Macy 's will furlough the majority of its 125,000 employees  Jordan Valinsky , CNN Business  Published at 10:55 am , March 30 , 2020  Share This  ( CNN ) -- Macy 's is furloughing a majority of its 125,000 employees because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , which has sunk sales and forced it close to its stores .
The company said Monday that the pandemic has taken a " heavy toll " on its business .
Macy 's , which also owns Bloomingdale 's and Bluemercury , closed all of its 775 stores in the United States earlier this month to slow the virus from spreading in crowded areas , and because of laws in some states that forced the closure of nonessential businesses , including retailers .
Macy 's painted a bleak picture of its already perilous financial situation .
The company said that it has lost a " majority " of sales because of the brick-and-mortar closures and has implemented other changes to bolster its bottom line , including drawing down its credit line and freezing hiring and spending .
" While these actions have helped , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macy 's is " moving to the absolute minimum workforce needed to maintain basic operations .
" That is resulting in furloughs for a " majority " of its employees beginning this week .
Affected workers will still get the company-funded health care for at least through May .
Macy 's websites remain open for orders .
The company will furlough fewer workers at its digital operations and distribution and call centers , Macy 's said , but online sales make up just a fifth of Macy 's overall revenue .
" We expect to bring colleagues back on a staggered basis as business resumes , " the company said .
However , its unclear when retailers will be allowed to open .
President Donald Trump announced Sunday he 's extending the nationwide social distancing guidelines until at least April 30 .
The news is another blow for Macy 's , which has already been reducing its store count as dwindling sales took hold in the US even before the coronavirus pandemic .
Department stores have already been being squeezed by discount chains , like TJ Maxx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put products on sale .
Meanwhile , more shoppers are migrating online .
Macy 's shares fell 2% in early trading .
The stock is down nearly 70% for the year .
