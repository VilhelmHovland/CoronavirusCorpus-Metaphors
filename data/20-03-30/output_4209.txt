Coronavirus effect prompts five-year high of homes for rent in central Dublin  Early numbers dramatic , but expert warns not to expect them to solve rental crisis  A significant number of one- and two-bed properties have arrived on the rental market in Dublin , 1 , 2 , 7 and 8  The rapid spread of coronavirus has prompted a flight from the Airbnb model of short-term rentals to longer term rental in key Dublin areas .
According to the latest listings from property rental website Daft .
, the number of available one- and two-bed properties in Dublin 1 , 2 , 7 and 8 jumped to a five-year high of 535 on Tuesday evening .
The figure represents a massive 83 per cent increase on the 293 one- and two-bed properties that had been available to rent in the same three weeks ( March 1-24 ) in 2019 .
The figures for the equivalent period in 2016 , 2017 and 2018 meanwhile were 348 , 288 and 275 properties respectively .
The early numbers have certainly been dramatic , and are likely to become more dramatic still as those landlords who took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quicker buck return their apartments and houses to the less lucrative and longer-term rental market .
Outside of the four postal districts that are within tourist-friendly walking distance of Dublin city centre , the migration of short-term rentals to the traditional rental market has been less pronounced .
The latest figures show the rest of Dublin has now registered a 22 per cent increase year-on-year in the number of one- and two-bed properties available for rent , going from 1,059 in March 2019 to 1,295 by Tuesday evening .
Beyond the capital the numbers have recorded a much smaller rise in the equivalent period , going from 1,889 available properties last year to 1,961 now .
Challenge  So what to make of it all ? Could this lead to the demise of short-term rentals or is it simply an unwelcome break in service for those involved in their delivery ?  Estate agent and residential lettings specialist Owen Reilly believes the Covid-19 crisis will represent a fundamental challenge to Air BnB and the myriad of similar operators acting as intermediaries between landlords and tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge .
I think landlords wo n't quickly forget what has happened over the past couple of weeks .
From talking to the landlords who 've contacted me , I do n't think they will be going back to Airbnb or any of the other short-term letting platforms any time soon .
" I would say there are a lot of landlords out there now who are happy to have ordinary tenants in their properties paying the rent , and who hopefully have n't lost their jobs .
" I would n't be so sure that landlords will go back to short-term lettings once the crisis has passed .
Particularly those landlords who 've been let down by their short-term operators .
" I 've been telling some of our landlords this for a while , that at the first spot of trouble some operators wo n't pay the rent .
They 'll simply walk away , and that 's what 's happened .
I think some of the landlords will be pretty reluctant to revert back to short-term rentals .
A lot of them are talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties out for 12 months .
"  Availability  While that 's a decision that may well be taken by hundreds of landlords , it 's still unlikely to make an appreciable difference to the availability or affordability of rental accommodation in Dublin or other cities .
Commenting on the current increase in the number of properties being advertised and the longer-term prospects for overall supply , economist with Daft .
Ronan Lyons said : " I think this is evidence both of the truth in the anecdotes being shared about short-term lets making their way onto the long-term rental market now that the city-break market is completely on hold for the next few months if not longer -- but also of the potentially limited scale that this transition will have .
"  " It of course remains to be seen how deep the real economic effects are in terms of lost incomes and jobs , and potentially on outward migration .
But Dublin 's underlying shortage of rental homes is in the tens of thousands , not the hundreds , and thus those suggesting that the demise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing/rental crisis are likely to be disappointed .
Clearly if this were were to continue for weeks or months however , then it would represent a meaningful improvement in long-term rental supply .
