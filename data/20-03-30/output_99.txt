" There has been a lot of ongoing interest in personal protective equipment .
It 's very important of course that we keep our frontline health workers safe .
I am also conscious that our frontline healthcare workers not only need to be safe , they need to feel safe , " Bloomfield said .
" I know that many of them are particularly concerned about elements of official advice .
I think it 's very good advice , it 's from infectious disease specialists and it 's designed to ensure they know what PPE to wear in different situations .
But I am conscious that many of our frontline healthcare workers are concerned about not having access to masks when they feel they need them to feel safe .
"  " We 're undertaking a process at the moment of releasing a large number of masks from our national stocks out to our District Health Boards and they will be distributing in their regions masks to frontline health workers in a range of organisations , including our home and community support workers , disability support workers , some NGO workers where they have face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our members are relieved to learn masks will be released to the DHBs and made available to community , disability and home support workers .
This is the right decision because it will help keep staff , clients and their families safe , " says Kerry Davies , National Secretary of the PSA .
" We now expect the Ministry of Health guidelines around the use of masks , gloves and aprons will be updated to reflect the critically important role support workers play in community health , and the unique dangers they face in terms of exposure and spreading the virus .
We do n't want this PPE to be locked away for a rainy day .
The rainy day is already here .
"  Bloomfield announced the decision as part of his daily update on the Covid-19 situation in New Zealand .
As of Tuesday morning , there were 58 new cases of Covid-19 in the country - 48 confirmed and 10 probable .
That brings the total number of cases to 647 , 74 of whom have recovered .
Although there were nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was too early to say whether this was indicative of a downward trend in the spread of Covid-19 .
" Whilst this is a drop in the number over the last day or two , I have no sense that this is a drop overall and our expectation is that the number of cases will continue to increase .
" It could be due to fewer tests being carried out on Sunday , he said .
More than 21,000 tests have been carried out for Covid-19 and that number is likely to spike over the next few days as the Government prepares to widen its case definition for the virus .
As it stands , a person wanting a test needs to have a connection to overseas travel or a confirmed case or they may be refused .
Doctors can use their clinical judgment to override this requirement but it is unclear how often this is happening .
Now , Bloomfield said , as it has become apparent that community transmission is ongoing in New Zealand and there are cases that have no connection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at again .
Bloomfield also highlighted the persistence of seven clusters of cases in New Zealand .
Because they are connected to a known or likely patient zero , these are n't classified as community transmission but they do represent the spread of Covid-19 within communities .
As of Monday morning , the largest cluster involved students and staff at Auckland 's Marist College , which is linked to 47 cases .
Bloomfield said he could n't totally guarantee there was no transmission within hospitals , but that hospitals were taking more precautions .
" It 's impossible for me to say I 'm a 100 percent confident there is no transmission within hospitals but what I will say is the learning from the case on the West Coast where a Covid-19 case was treated for several days as just influenza was that anyone coming to a hospital , for example , through an emergency department , with a respiratory infection should be treated and managed with appropriate PPE as if they have Covid-19 until that 's ruled out , " he said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of what the impact of Covid-19 would be in Aotearoa New Zealand if we were not taking a very decisive and strict approach to our response - that is , the implementation of the level four measures , " Bloomfield said .
" Without the actions currently being taken , the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 would clearly exact a high price on New Zealand in terms of its impact on our healthcare system , on our healthcare workers and , of course , in a large number of deaths .
Each of the models does present a stark choice between acting decisively , going early and going hard , and the counterfactual , which , in I think anyone 's terms was unacceptable .
"  The pandemic is pushing us into an unknown and uncertain future .
As the crisis unfolds the need for accurate , balanced and thorough reporting will be vital .
