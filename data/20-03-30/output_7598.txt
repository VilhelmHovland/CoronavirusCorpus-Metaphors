Actions  Edwards : More ventilators on the way  UPDATE : Gov .
Edwards issued the following statement about President Trump 's commitment of 150 ventilators to Louisiana as it fights COVID-19 and works to surge its medical capacity so it can care for residents who are sick .
Louisiana estimates the New Orleans area will run out of ventilator capacity on April 5 , though this number changes as the state receives ventilators .
Prior to this announcement , Louisiana had received 292 ventilators from vendors , including 100 ventilators on Monday .
" This morning , President Trump committed to me that he would make sure that Louisiana received ventilators .
He has just announced that we will get 150 ventilators , which will be the first we have received from the federal government 's Strategic National Stockpile , though I surely hope they will not be the last .
We do n't yet know when they will arrive in state or exactly what type of ventilators they are .
But I very much appreciate this support , " Edwards said .
" While this does not meet our overall need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the timeframe that we can provide care to Louisianans who are ill , which is critical as we deal with the growing threat of COVID-19 in our state .
" In total , Louisiana has ordered 14,000 ventilators , including 5,000 from the federal government 's strategic national stockpile .
Louisiana has the third highest number of cases per capita , and I will continue to fight to make sure our state 's needs are not lost in the national conversation .
"  At his daily media briefing , Gov .
Edwards said today he will be issuing an updated stay-at-home this week to bring Louisiana 's protocol in line with President Trump 's orders that extend through April 30 .
Edwards ' order originally was set to expire on April 12 .
Yesterday the president extended his orders to April 30 .
Edwards thanked the president for that .
" It lets people know that we are nowhere near over the hump , and it creates a realistic expectation with the public , " Edwards said .
Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be moved to their allowed maximum .
That will affect about 60 percent of SNAP recipients .
" Those SNAP recipients who are not at the maximum they are allowed will be put to the maximum .
This will automatically be loaded on their cards , they do n't have to do anything to receive this , " she said .
The state is suspending deadlines , waiting periods and work requirements .
" We want people in Louisiana to have food during this time , " she said .
The phone lines are overloaded right now , so she urged people to use the department 's website .
She urged people who are n't getting SNAP to apply because they may be eligible now .
Edwards stressed that residents need to continue to stay at home , to save lives .
" Under any conceivable scenario , we are going to exceed our medical capacity , " he said .
When he revisits his stay-at-home order , Edwards said he will work with the CDC and Homeland Security to revise parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Louisiana Department of Health reported 485 additional cases since Sunday , bringing the total to 4,025 positive cases .
So far , 185 people have died .
" Ventilators continue to be the most pressing need in the short term , " the governor said .
" And we do n't have much progress to report .
"  Edwards said that , during a conference call with the federal task force , the President and Vice President this morning , he was assured by the president that ventilators will be sent to Louisiana .
" We do n't have numbers or a timeline .
But we believe that will be from the national strategic stockpile , " he said .
So far , Louisiana has ordered 14,000 ventilators and has received fewer than 200 .
Edwards said he is asking all " like-minded " Louisiana residents to join him every Tuesday during the lunch hour to fast and pray .
In response to a media question , officials said that they 're trying to decrease the wait time for test results .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could bring much faster turnaround time .
The goal is to have a response within 24 hours .
As he always does , the governor asked people to comply with the stay-at-home order .
When asked specifically about a Baton Rouge-area preacher who continues to hold large church services , he said he 's asking that preacher to do what the vast majority of other faith leaders have done : comply and offer services in other methods .
" We need more compliance .
We 're asking people to do what is really their obligation as a citizen .
Leaders have an even greater obligation , " Edwards said .
One reporter asked Edwards who he is holding up .
He says it 's much tougher on medical workers , and he does n't need anybody to feel sorry for him .
" This is tough for everybody .
What makes this so unlike other things we 've faced in Louisiana , like natural disasters .
Typically when those happen , Louisiana and maybe one or two other states impacted , and so your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to help , " he said .
" In this case that does n't exist , because every state is in the same fight .
Some are ahead of us , and some of them are behind us , but everybody 's looking for PPE , ventilators , staffing , beds .
That 's what makes this hard , and the frustrating part is that knowing what you need , it 's really hard to make the kind of progress you know you need to make in the time in which you think you have .
We need people to help us as much as they can by flattening that curve .
