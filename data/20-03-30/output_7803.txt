On Rachel Maddow 's MSNBC show , New York Times science and health reporter Donald McNeil praised China 's mass quarantine camps as the best way to fight the COVID-19 pandemic .
A CBC documentary reveals what that policy entails : Citizens are literally being dragged out of their homes as they cry and scream .
Others have their doors welded shut .
So , perhaps it should n't come as a surprise when one of its reporters goes on cable TV to endorse China 's COVID-19 response , which included , among many other horrifying things , literally dragging people out of their homes and forcing them into mass quarantine camps .
Donald McNeil , a science and health reporter for the New York Times who covers infectious disease , went on Rachel Maddow 's MSNBC show to explain , in his opinion , the only proper way for a country to contain a pandemic .
The interview is absolutely chilling .
" You do n't want infected people -- or suspected infected people -- with their families .
They 'll just pass it on to them .
" If sick people should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put them ? McNeil explains that China sends people to special " fever clinics " and " quarantine hotels " -- which are really nice ways of saying " mass camps .
"  McNeil goes on .
" That is the key element : There is no home isolation .
There is no home quarantine .
" He assures us that these facilities are not " concentration camps " because they had nurses , beds , and dance lessons .
Uh huh .
If it 's such a good time , then why does this CBC documentary ( see video below ) depict people crying and screaming as they 're being dragged out of their homes ? Fever camp should be fun !  Did Rachel Maddow object to such an obviously tyrannical policy ? Nope .
She endorsed it .
" People are going to clip this and send it to their local health department .
"  A boy with cerebral palsy died because no one took care of him after his father was taken to be quarantined .
A woman with leukemia died after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-infection .
A mother desperately pleaded to the police to let her leukemia-stricken daughter through a checkpoint at a bridge to get chemotherapy .
A man with kidney disease jumped to his death from his apartment balcony after he could n't get access to health facilities for dialysis .
And at least 10 people died after a hotel being used as a quarantine facility collapsed .
This is the response that the World Health Organization has praised .
And it 's the response that the NYT 's Donald McNeil praises , too .
At one point in the Maddow interview , Mr .
McNeil says , " China has had enormous success in beating down its epidemic .
"  That 's true .
Of course , it 's because they beat their people in the process .
