With the government of India taking extreme measures to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic , the chances of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) taking place this year looks absolutely slim .
The thirteenth edition of the league was set to get underway on March 29 in Mumbai .

At that time , the board had said that further action will depend on how the situation unfolds .
But unfortunately , things have not been promising at all .
India already have more than 500 positive cases of coronavirus while nearly a dozen people have already succumbed to the deadly disease .
On Tuesday , PM Narendra Modi announced that the entire country will be in a 21-day lockdown period to combat the spread of the deadly virus and now a franchise official has reportedly admitted that hosting the T20 league this year is going to be very difficult .
