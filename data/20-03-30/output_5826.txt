Tax incentives for businesses not a priority -- DOF  Finance Secretary Carlos G .
Dominguez has admonished " insensitive " businesses for asking tax incentives and urged them to instead help government in addressing the current needs of the Filipino people and frontliners fighting the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) .
Dominguez said that it is too early for the national government to give out tax credits and other funding aid to businesses while threat of COVID-19 pandemic remains in the country .
" What is required right now is the ability of the government to move funds around to meet the new imperatives , " Dominguez told reporters in a video conference , noting the call of business groups is " totally distracting the government from the primary goal .
"  According to Dominguez , there is no point to discuss incentives and other privileges for business owners while work limitations are prescribed under the enhanced community quarantine measures .
" You know this stimulus package , we do n't even know the required amount .
What 's the point of giving tax credits and giving stimulus package now when you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quarantine , " the finance chief pointed out .
Dominguez , however , assured that the DOF is willing to discuss alleviation measures for the private sector once the COVID-19 crisis has subsided .
" I have told the people who had come out with that proposal to do a stimulus package .
That is not our priority at the moment .
Let 's talk about that later , " Dominguez said .
" Our priority now is support the people who have lost their daily livelihood .
Number two , protect the people who are the frontliners and expand our capacity to deal with this on a physical basis , " he added .
Last week , 32 of the country 's largest business organizations urged the national government to adopt a " fiscal stimulus " program which would raise the budget deficit-to-gross domestic product ratio close to fiver percent .
They said the government should commit to a " more forceful action on the fiscal front in order to mitigate the suffering of Filipinos and reduce damage to the society and economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US President Donald Trump on Friday invoked emergency powers to require General Motors Co ( GM .
) to build much-needed ventilators for coronavirus patients after he accused the largest US automaker of " wasting time " during negotiations .
A ventilator is seen at the New York City Emergency Management Warehouse , where 400 ventilators arrived and before being shipped out for distribution , due to concerns over the rapid spread of coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in the Brooklyn borough of New York City , US , March 24 , 2020 .
( REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs/File Photo / MANILA BULLETIN )  Trump , who has been on the defensive for not moving faster to compel the production of medical equipment , for the first time invoked the Defense Production Act , saying GM was not moving quickly enough even though earlier on Friday the largest US automaker announced it would begin building ventilators in the coming weeks .
Asked about negotiations with GM over ventilators , Trump expressed anger with the company 's decision to close an assembly plant in politically important Ohio .
He also criticized GM 's prior decisions to build plants outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it with a favorable view , " Trump told a news conference of the GM talks .
White House adviser Peter Navarro said the administration ran into " roadblocks " with GM this week .
GM said in a statement in response to Trump that it has been working with ventilator firm Ventec Life Systems and GM suppliers " around the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need " and said its commitment to Ventec 's ventilators " has never wavered .
"  The act grants the president power to expand industrial production of any key materials or products for national security and other reasons .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and other Democrats have urged him to invoke the act , but the president had been reluctant to do so until now .
Democratic US Senator Ed Markey said , " About time .
Now , tell us every day : which companies will be making more of this equipment , how much is being made , and where the equipment is going .
"  On Friday , the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest in the world according to a Reuters tally .
The US death toll topped 1,550 .
L1N2BK21G  Trump also said countries such as the United Kingdom , Germany , Spain , and Italy need ventilators and that if the excess volume is not needed , the United States can export them .
Earlier , Trump lashed out at GM and Ford Motor Co F .
for moving too slowly just hours before GM said it would build medical equipment at an Indiana plant .
Trump criticized the US automakers and said he expected the United States would make or obtain 100,000 additional ventilators within the next 100 days .
The attack on the automakers coincided with rising tension between Trump and the Democratic governors of New York and Michigan , who have criticized the administration 's response to the COVID-19 epidemic .
On Thursday evening , Trump questioned in an interview on the Fox News network whether New York state needed 30,000 ventilators to cope with rising numbers of coronavirus patients , as Cuomo had said .
GM and Ford separately announced earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost ventilator production .
GM and its partner Ventec confirmed after Trump 's tweets that the No .
1 US automaker would deploy 1,000 workers to build ventilators at its Kokomo , Indiana , parts plant and ship as soon as next month .
It was aiming to build more than 10,000 per month with the ability to go higher .
Suppliers in the effort were told the target was 200,000 ventilators .
But early Friday , before GM issued its release , Trump attacked the automaker and Chief Executive Mary Barra on Twitter , reviving his grievance with Barra for closing and selling a car factory in Ohio , a state critical to the president 's re-election campaign .
" General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio , or some other plant , and START MAKING VENTILATORS , NOW ! ! ! ! ! ! FORD , GET GOING ON VENTILATORS , FAST ! ! ! ! ! ! " Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday .
" They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GM and Ventec 's effort .
" Now they are saying it will only be 6000 , in late April , and they want top dollar .
"  Trump 's comments about GM and Ford came after a New York Times story Thursday suggested the White House had backed away from announcing a major ventilator deal with GM and Ventec because the price tag was too high .
That drew criticism from Democrats .
Following Trump 's tweets , Ford said it was moving as fast as it could to gear up its ventilator manufacturing efforts and was in " active conversations " with the Trump administration seeking approvals .
Ford said it has " teams working flat-out with GE Healthcare ( GE .
) to boost production of simplified ventilators .
"  Other automakers have said they are working to produce ventilators , masks , and other medical equipment .
On Friday , Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203 .
T ) said it was " finalizing agreements to begin working with at least two companies that produce ventilators and respirators to help increase their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday said on Twitter that Tesla Inc ( TSLA .
) had agreed to donate hundreds of ventilators to hospital intensive care units in New York City and the state of New York .
