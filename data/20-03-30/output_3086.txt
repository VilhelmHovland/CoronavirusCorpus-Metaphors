COVID-19 and vile criticism of Buhari , By Ehichioya Ezomon  Those who take the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) as a plaything -- and they seem to be in the majority in Nigeria -- certainly had comic reliefs the past week , to strengthen their unbelief in the pandemic .
The leading " thriller " was President Muhammadu Buhari , who many Nigerians had urged to address the nation on the virus that has infected more than 615,000 and over 28,000 deaths , globally as at the weekend .
The other " characters " were , at least , two members of the National Assembly ( NASS ) .
First , the NASS lawmakers .
I ca n't vouch that the first legislator I watched on WhatsApp was a senator or representative , but he 's contributing to the debate on COVID-19 , and had difficulty in pronouncing coronavirus .
Instead , he repeatedly called it " coronavarsity " -- a " Corona University " of some sorts .
I did n't see in the members a sign that their colleague 's gaffe meant anything serious .
But it 's an instant hit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into a sensation .
As for the second lawmaker , his action was the antithesis of the times .
Surely , he wore a face mask .
But when pressed by nature , he drew down the mask to the jaw level -- exposing the nose and mouth -- and released a bombshell of sneeze .
What 's the mask meant for ? Is n't it to prevent uncontrolled sneezing and thus the spread of COVID-19 ? Well , the lawmaker 's action caused laughter rather than a rebuke from his colleagues !  But on Thursday at the Imo State House of Assembly , when a member started " coughing and sneezing , " and some members abandoned seats , and went for their face masks or handkerchiefs , the Speaker , Collins Chiji , ordered him out of the chamber .
Two days prior , the Speaker had advised another member to self-isolate after his recent return from the United Kingdom , where the virus infections have affected Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock .
Let 's come to President Buhari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always craved for him to address them not just headlong and timeously , but in person through broadcasts .
The president had not been forthcoming in such critical times .
Rather , he would address the matters via his media aides -- core professionals and great guys -- but who people think do not suffice for Buhari 's voice or image , as the Commander-in-Chief .
In the wake of COVID-19 , Nigerians reminded Buhari about the popular address to the nation .
But the president , or his handlers elected to go to Twitter -- a platform for the " elite " in the society .
And what did we get ? Oh dear ! As I write , only a negligible percentage of Nigerians maybe able to recall the message Buhari passed on to an anxious and a frightened citizenry .
But many , through the social media , and by word of mouth , have retweeted , shared and spread -- " have you heard what President Buhari said , " as if he committed an awful sin or upbraided Nigerians for calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
His offence ? That he pronounced COVID-19 as " COVID-1-9 , " thereby setting Twitter on fire -- the medium he chose to speak to a limited , instead of a wider audience on radio and television .
Many , who assume " infallibility , " jubilated , and judged the scenario as Buhari 's alleged educational deficiency , even as they blamed his media handlers as incompetent in moulding and presenting the president 's image to the public .
Now , the questions : Was Buhari wrong in pronouncing COVID-19 the way he did ? Certainly ! If he 'd been watching the news -- just only on the Nigerian Television Authority ( NTA ) -- he would have grasped the pronunciation correctly .
Does the president 's " faux pas " warrant the attendant glee ? Of course ! Does it also necessitate the insults on and denigration of his person and character ? Absolutely NO ! The indulgers went too far .
But who to blame for the fiasco ? First , Mr Buhari .
He did n't make , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrations ' bedrock -- as a military Head of State and a civilian President .
In a military dictatorship , that could be excused , as the Decrees the hegemons roll out to hold on to power are louder than voices , and any breaches command severe consequences .
But not so in a civil regime , whose laws can be flouted under the guise of protecting citizens ' fundamental human rights .
So , the leader needs to reach out to , and convince the people .
In his nearly five years in the saddle since May 2015 , President Buhari has failed in this regard .
As the saying goes , " Practice makes perfect , " which he probably does n't fancy .
If he 's been engaging regularly with Nigerians , in flesh and blood , and through broadcasts , mistakes , such as mispronunciation , would be made , and corrections learned along the way .
But not doing so would make any slip the news of the season , and beyond .
And exactly what 's transpired aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the responsibility of the president 's media handlers in the episode ? It 's to ensure that there 're no mistakes in the speech , and its delivery flawless .
Were they more attentive , they could have detected the miasma and corrected it before hitting Twitter .
Perhaps they did , but were afraid to point it out , or more interested in getting the message out nonetheless , which , of course , was mired in the hoopla that accompanied the president 's address .
Whichever , the media aides -- individually and collectively -- should bear the odium of getting Buhari into the public scorn that could be mitigated in an open , and not " secret " address to the nation .
Going forward , they should encourage -- they must have done that countless times -- and impress it on Buhari the imperative of talking to the people directly .
It 's a better and more effective way of communicating his message to the grassroots .
World leaders are burnishing their sagging ratings with COVID-19 .
Watch how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his daily press conference , taking his message to Americans that have awarded him high marks since 2016 .
President Buhari may not mimic Mr Trump 's made-for-the-cable braggadocio , but he should n't censor himself from talking to Nigerians , especially at critical junctures , the likes of COVID-19 that 's escalating in confirmed cases in the country .
Buhari 's voice , no matter how some loathe it , serves as the needed direction , and a soothing balm in times of crisis .
He should seize that pedestal and address " Fellow Nigerians " regularly !  Last Line : The novel coronavirus has shown that humans are equal .
It does n't distinguish between man and woman , old and young , black and white , married and single , straight and gay , rich and poor , the able and disabled , and Christian and Muslim .
More importantly , the virus has indicated it 's a " big man " disease , and that our big men and women are afraid to die .
But if they must die , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've wilful neglected .
Perhaps , COVID-19 may .
