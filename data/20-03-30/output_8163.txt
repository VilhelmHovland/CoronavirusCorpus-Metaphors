Meet Eric Yuan , the man who made your Zoom meetings possible  If you had n't already heard have of Zoom Video Communications , there is a decent chance you 've made its acquaintance over the past few weeks .
Millions of people are now working from home as part of the intensifying fight against the coronavirus outbreak .
In addition to using the video conference for work , many are also tapping it to hold virtual playdates for their kids and virtual happy hours with friends and family banned from gathering in public places .
The crisis has cast a spotlight on Zoom , a company founded nine years ago by its CEO Eric Yuan after he defected from Cisco Systems and took about 40 engineers with him .
He wanted to refine a concept he first dreamed up during the 1990s as a college student in China , when he dreaded the 10-hour train trips to see his then-girlfriend , now his wife .
Now Zoom is booming , just 11 months after it made its debut on the stock market .
While the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 index has fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoom 's stock has soared 46% as investors bet on its service becoming a mainstream staple in life after the coronavirus .
Yuan , 50 , recently spoke to The Associated Press during an interview conducted on Zoom .
The conversation has been edited for clarity and length .
Q : Are these strange times providing a glimpse at how we are going to be working and living in the future ?  A : I hope this crisis can be over very , very soon , but one one thing I know for sure is that companies will learn this is the way to work .
I am pretty sure almost every company will be thinking about it and say , " Hey , maybe working from home makes sense , " and maybe let every employee work from home , maybe once a week .
Previously , a lot of businesses did n't even want to try .
Q : Do you think we will find out that people can be more productive at home ?  A : It 's too early to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least for me .
I am finding I have even more meetings , and every day I miss the lunch time , so I am also learning how to adapt to all this working from home .
Q : Zoom primarily has been used by businesses .
Are you discovering new social applications now that people are using it to virtually hang out too ?  A : That is not our intention .
But kids are pretty smart , they always figure out new use cases .
There are some very cool consumer use cases .
For now , I am just telling my team and reminding myself this is a very critical time because we are in a crisis .
So we are focusing on two things : To serve our existing customers and make sure our service is always great quality and is always up .
The second thing is how can we help the local community , like the K-12 schools , handle this crisis .
Anything else , I told our team , that 's just a distraction .
Q : Zoom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been plunging .
How are you managing that ?  A : It 's good that I am 50 now .
If you had asked me this question when I was 25 , I would tell you , " Yes , we are very excited about the stock price ! " But , now , seriously , I can tell you the truth , it do n't matter .
So the stock is up , it 's good for our investors .
If it 's down , we keep working hard .
I really do not focus on the stock price .
Q : Do you still see personal , physical interaction as an important element in society ?  A : I think for the foreseeable future , that 's absolutely right .
We still have n't been able to have cool features like a virtual hug that you can actually feel .
We talk about that , but we do n't have that .
Or when you drink tea or coffee , with one click you can digitize a smell .
Those features will be available with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's too early .
That 's why you have to have the personal interactions .
