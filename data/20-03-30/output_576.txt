More  Comments : Week of March 30 , 2020  1 For New York 's latest issue , the magazine turned its eye to how the coronavirus suddenly occupied the minds of millions around the world .
The cover was divisive .
Ad Age 's Simon Dumenco wrote that it nails " life during a pandemic , " and the cover quickly became a visual touchpoint for media coverage around the crisis .
But on Instagram and elsewhere , many commenters took issue with the reference to " the scariest time in America since 9/11 .
" @livschreiber , for instance , wrote , " This is ridiculous .
To compare to 9/11 ? ? This is what feeds hysteria .
I 'm in NY and surrounded by happy people running on West Side Highway ! " Others criticized the design for being histrionic and unhelpful .
@emelierod wrote , " As a trusted source of journalism for many , this feels really -irresponsible .
" The designer -Steven Heller called it " the wrong cover at the wrong time .
The best way to trigger panic is to enable panic .
I realize that this cover is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and world are ' feeling ' at this moment .
But I ' feel ' it does more harm as the meme of the moment than good .
We need solutions , not more fear and chaos .
" The coverage of the pandemic included an essay by Molly Fischer ( " A City of Bodies , " March 16 -- 29 ) that documented the personal transition from normal life in New York City to an altered reality of social distancing .
Vanity Fair 's Claire Landsbaum called it a " lovely , scary essay .
that reads like the beginning of Handmaid 's Tale .
" @gdun tweeted , " This was incredibly well -written .
You articulated things about the city that I 've felt but never been able to put into words before .
"  2 As the political response to the coronavirus ramped up , David Freedlander offered readers a front-row seat to New York governor Andrew Cuomo 's muscular , and much-lauded , response ( " The Bully Governor Meets His Moment , " March 16 -- 29 ) .
@hollsterbirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is leading and Trump is not .
" @besslevin was reminded of his leadership during previous times of crisis : " Remember him threatening to bury con-ed etc in a shallow grave if they did n't get their shit together after hurricane sandy ? " Even critics of the governor were -impressed by his response .
@sethpoho tweeted , " Not the world 's biggest Cuomo fan , but I 'll say this -- at least he 's trying to get solutions .
"  3 In " This Will Get Worse " ( March 16 -- 29 ) , New York 's business columnist Josh Barro wrote about the grim uncertainty around the coronavirus .
@rainjuarez wrote , " Thank you for being candid about the unknowns .
It 's a refreshing take .
" @kyarilee01 agreed : " Wow , that was kind of depressing but thanks for not sugarcoating it .
" Modena .
commented , " Fair and accurate article .
Mortality numbers are likely inaccurate at this point , but no one can deny what 's happened in Italy .
It 's a pretty clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of denial , excuses , and thoughts that help us sleep better at night and might align with our political party .
" Whatthereynardsays wrote , " This is so sobering I poured myself a drink half way through .
"  4 Online , New York 's writers and editors have reported extensively on the mounting crisis .
For Intelligencer , Jeff Wise painstakingly detailed what the virus ' journey through the human body looks like ( " How the Coronavirus Could Take Over Your Body -- Before You Ever Feel It , " March 18 ) .
More than 3 million people read the report , and many responded by encouraging others to stay inside .
BBC 's Emmanuel Igunza tweeted , " Read this to understand the importance of social distance .
Not meant to scare but illustrates things nicely .
" Julie Banderas of Fox News added , " Read this beginning to end .
Then stay the f*** home please .
" Others found the story unnecessarily alarmist .
Ronny Langley wrote , " The public is looking for answers not to be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why would this article be posted except to create more fear .
We have many articles to read explaining the extent of this virus and what to expect and the best ways to get through it without creating more fear .
" Commenter renotory responded to those critiques : " For those of you complaining that the article is ' negative , ' maybe you should consider the huge percentage of the population ( mostly younger people ) who are not taking this virus -seriously .
Observe the percentage of them heading to the beaches for spring break partying .
There are a lot of people who are still trying to go to Hawaii to vacation , in spite of that state 's officials asking them not to .
So you are wrong that this is a sensationalist article with no practical use .
If the people who are reading it are motivated to change their behavior to help stop this virus , it will have had exactly the effect the author intended .
