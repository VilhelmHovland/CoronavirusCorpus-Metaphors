A healthcare professional from Bristol has described what it was like to suffer with coronavirus and has urged people to take the virus seriously .
The woman , who wishes to remain anonymous , is in her 30s and said she was fit and healthy before noticing symptoms on March 17 .
A mother of three , she says she is so thankful for how her family got her through her illness , but has begged anyone who thinks the government guidance is a ' big joke ' to think again and that staying indoors is not a ' hardship ' .
Thursday ( March 26 ) was the first day I was able to go all day without having to sleep in the day although I was still getting very tried and out of breath easily .
" I spent the first three days in bed not even being able to go to the bathroom without being left fighting for breath .
As for the temperature I 've never been that hot in my life .
I know today that I 'm still not well but I know I am over the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for sure and has taken its toll .
I look forward to being able to talk for more then 10 minutes without getting out of breath .

' Husband 's look of sheer terror and helplessness '  But despite suffering with the disease , she says it was seeing her husband and kids cope with her illness that was the most difficult thing to deal with .
She has three children , one teenager and two aged five and seven .
She said : " The look of sheer terror and helplessness in my husband 's eyes as he sees me fighting to breathe , knowing he ca n't do anything to help , he ca n't put his hand on my shoulder as reassurance , he ca n't come close as the risk to himself was too high .
" All he could do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and busy and happy while keeping the house going .
He brings me a drink or something to eat , not knowing what he would find .

" I remain ever grateful for how well my family has adjusted and coped with what can only be described as unbelievable changes .
The support we have received from family and friends has been heartwarming .
' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum watching my family go through everything and coping , knowing there 's nothing I can do apart from fight this virus , while terrified I would pass it on and make them ill and the guilt that would leave me with .
" So far so good , keeping everything crossed still that they do n't get symptoms while I am slowly but surely continue to fight and recover .
" Covid-19 is something I fear will continue to affect many more families but we can all do our part .
" Anyone who thinks it 's all a big joke and the advice/rules do n't apply to them think again .

We have to all work together to beat this .
Staying in is n't a hardship in the grand scheme of things .
