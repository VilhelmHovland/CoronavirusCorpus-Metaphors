" But what we are now moving to is an arrangement for gatherings of less than 100 , is that there would be 4 square metres provided per person in an enclosed space , in a room .
So that 's 2 metres by 2 metres .
" So for example , if you 've got a room , if you 've got a premises , if you 've got a meeting room or something like that , that is 100 square metres , then you can have 25 people in that room .
" Now , in addition to that , you should continue to practise wherever possible the 1 metre or 1 .
metres of healthy distance between each of us , to ensure that we are limiting the contact and limiting the potential for the spread of the virus .
"  As Mr Morrison said , if your indoor space is 100 metres square , for example 10 metres by 10 metres , you can only have 25 people in it .
If your space is 400 metres square , you can have 100 people in it .

Does this mean I need to stay further away from people ?  No , these new guidelines do not seem to alter the day-to-day social distancing guidelines that have been in place for a while now .
What the experts are saying about coronavirus :  As Dr Brendan Murphy said , there 's " no point having a gathering of 20 people if it 's in tiny room and you 're all together " .
These measures are related to the number of people in an indoor space , rather than the more general person-to-person distancing advice previously offered .
You should still be trying to keep 1 .

But there are places where the restrictions do not apply .

Immediately , it seems .
Mr Morrison was a little vague on this , but given he did not state a starting time for the rules -- which he has clearly done for all other measures that have been announced in advance -- it is fair to assume the rules are in place from now .
We hope to be able to provide more clarity soon .
How will businesses deal with this change ?  To some extent that remains to be seen , but some restauranteurs are n't particularly happy about the updated guidelines .
