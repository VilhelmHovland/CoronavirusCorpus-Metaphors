One in four cases have required hospitalisation , while 84 of the 2,475 cases under analysis were admitted to ICU .
Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said : " We are beginning to see encouraging signs in our efforts to flatten the curve .
However , we can not become complacent as we are still seeing new cases and more ICU admissions every day " .
Dr Holohan said the measures introduced enjoy widespread public acceptance , with 89 per cent of people surveyed say they were happy with the measures and 94 per cent expressing confidence they would be able to adhere with them .
Prof Philip Nolan , chair of a group carrying out epidemiological modelling for NPHET said Ireland was " not on the track " of an unmitigated epidemic .
" The model reveals that before restrictions were in place , daily growth rate of confirmed cases was at 33 per cent .
This has fallen in recent days to around 15 per cent .
But it is still growing and needs to fall further .
"  Previous estimates of 15,000 people being infected by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " would look like , according to Prof Nolan , absent the measures introduced by Government .
While there were 2,910 cases today , he said , in an unmitigated scenario there would be 3,000 cases today and a total of 15,000 .
" It takes time to see the impact of our efforts in the numbers .
It will be another 7-10 days before we have a reliable picture of how effective our collective efforts have been .
"  Officials again acknowledged there are delays in the time it take to test people , and for samples to be processed , but they were unable to say how long the backlog was , and whether large test centres which closed over equipment shortages would re-open .
HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said shortage of testing kit stock had led to delays but this was being replenished on Monday .
There was a lot of global competition for the reagent used in tests but the HSE was pursuing a number of supply options .
Asked whether any samples had expired due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any expired tests at this stage .
