At just 35 years old , respiratory therapist Casey Parr is considering writing a will .

Oregon health care workers raised the alarm about the dearth of equipment in a virtual press conference Monday .
And the state 's top emergency manager told reporters that the state still needs hundreds of thousands of masks , gowns and gloves to slow the spread of the virus .
Parr , the respiratory therapist , fears transmitting the virus to patients , and said masks are supposed to be used once per patient encounter , rather than once per shift or stretched out for a whole week , as they are now .
" The repeated handling of these masks increases my exposure , increases my risk of infection and transmission to others including my patients that do n't have COVID-19 , " Parr said .
And some workers do n't even have basic protective gear .
That includes Irene Hunt , a home health care worker in Springfield .
" If our work is essential , our health and safety should be too , " said Hunt .

" Today , I ask that all politicians at both the federal and local level take more decisive action to protect both health care and retail employees during this global pandemic , " said Gramley , " And to release both reserved and seized masks as well as other protective equipment to workers like us so that we can be part of the effort to help slow the spread of this virus to ourselves and to our communities .
"  Gov .
Kate Brown says her " biggest concern " is the state 's lack of protective gear , and says that she has asked the federal government for more supplies aimed at protecting workers from getting the virus .
On March 18 , Brown directed health care professionals to stop non-emergency procedures to preserve protective gear like surgical masks , gowns and gloves .
The state is also asking for donations .
The state 's dental association donated thousands of materials to the state , the governor 's office said over the weekend .
" I am not exaggerating when I say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brown said .
But I will continue to work with Oregon 's congressional delegation to fight for frontline workers and fight for more ( protective equipment ) in Oregon .

" Certainly what we 've distributed now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become sick , continue to be sick , " Phelps said .
" I want to make sure that our health care providers have everything they need to treat patients and reduce the risk to themselves in that environment .
So it 's a big number .
"  Oregon had about 157,000 N95 masks and 219,000 surgical masks as of March 28 , according to inventory figures from the Oregon Health Authority .
The state has ordered more than 2 million additional masks , according to the health agency .
About 400,000 of both types of mask were en route to the state on Monday , Phelps said .
" How long is that going to last us ? " Phelps said .
" It 's hard to say , but we 're not going to look at a number and say , ' Yep , that 's good , we 're going to stop purchasing .
' We need to make sure that we have a supply chain that can backfill all those counties and the hospital systems and care facilities within those counties until , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we can shut the hose off .
"  The state is preparing for the pandemic to last several months , Phelps said , and is analyzing how quickly the state is burning through supplies .
" We 're in the first mile , I think , of what 's going to be a marathon for us , " Phelps said .
