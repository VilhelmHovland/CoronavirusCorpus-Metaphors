Fader Fort 2020 will be an opportunity to raise money for charities helping out with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic , a press release said .
On the morning of March 16 , Loren Medina sent an email very different from the kind she 's used to sending .
The Los Angeles-based publicist behind Jessie Reyez andKali Uchis was n't running business as usual .
She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , she found herself sending out a plea to the music industry .
" Dear colleagues and media partners , it is our duty to find creative solutions to keep our industry afloat , " she began .
" With lockdowns enforced and more travel restrictions soon to come , we must not let the current situation paralyze us and/or allow the virus to take up all the space in the media .
"  By now , there is no doubt the music industry will come out of the coronavirus pandemic as one of the hardest-hit fields worldwide .
Live music is gone : Tours and concerts , which serve as both a space for music discovery and the primary source of income for artists , have been universally canceled or postponed .
Already , the loss of live music events alone could potentially be in the billions in the U .
Loren Medina  Other areas have not gone unscathed .
Although Medina says her clients are not pausing their record releases , other artists , including Lady Gaga , Haimand Kehlani , have postponed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Elsewhere , Amazon is prioritizing deliveries of essential goods and has stopped CD and vinyl orders for the time being , a move that could ultimately hurt smaller labels the most .
Across the pond , musicians in the U .
have so far lost 13 .
million pounds ( +$17 million ) in estimated earnings , according to the Guardian .
Medina 's home has become a type of ground zero .
She now works remotely , just like the possibly millionsof other people across the U .
under the government 's direction to stay home in an attempt to flatten the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic curve in the county , which now faces upwards of 86,000 cases .
At her newfound home base , she assesses how to move forward day-by-day as the music industry faces such an unprecedented time .
A part of the greater fabric that helps the music industry run , Medina , who owns Guerrera PR , Marketing &amp; Management and also represents acts like Omar Apollo and Cuco , among other artists , has been forced to re-strategize .
Other publicists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music industry ecosystem are on the same boat .
The new reality consists of social distancing and quarantining , a scenario that creates a challenge for parts of the modern music industry to function .
Beyond it all , the virus is stripping music of its magic ; no longer can people from all over the world come together in one place to enjoy it .
Independent publicists and smaller PR agencies now face their own unique challenges .
Many run on project-based work focused on touring and album campaigns .
With artists now canceling tours and rethinking album releases , the music publicity sector now faces a potential , and significant , loss in income -- if not now , then in the future .
On top of that , there is no option of severance for many publicists if they lose their jobs or clients .
While Medina is n't experiencing a loss of work now , because she works on project-based campaigns , future clients might be at stake as some artists are holding off on releasing new music until the current situation is alleviated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprises 50 percent of his work .
Nearly every tour date he was working through his boutique PR company Riot Act Media , whose roster includes Clap Your Hands Say Yeah , Young Jesus and STRFKR , was canceled last week or was on " the wait " to see what happens .
Part of his new normal , which also means working from home with his wife and a four-year-old , has been trying to uncrack the new pitching protocol .
There is an ongoing conversation among publicists about how to pitch music media during a never-before-lived pandemic that only seems to worsen by the day and continues to dominate headlines .
How should they be pitching about music now ?  " I 'm just trying to be really calculated with my pitches so that I 'm not just blanketing people with lots and lots of music , " Walker says .
And he is n't only practicing caution with media , but empathy as well .
" When I pitch an album during this time , I 'm including a note sincerely hoping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I 'm sincerely hoping they 're in a good place right now , " he says .
" I 'm just trying to keep the train on the tracks and send them a record that I think they 'd love , and if they want me to stop pitching them , that 's OK .
I will understand .
"  " I 'm really focused on carefully and thoughtfully reaching out to journalists to make sure that they 're in the headspace to be accepting pitches and discussing new art at the moment , " she says .
A Desire For Escapism  Artists continue to put out work , whether or not pitches about it are accepted , and publicists will continue to push for their clients .
" It may be a little less busy right now , " Avrin says .
" But I think it 's going to pick up as artists have time on their hands to create and want to get engage , whether it 's livestream performances or just putting out new singles and sharing .
"  Although initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of her first steps toward regrouping her approach to engaging with the media .
" I was just like , OK , technology can definitely make us rethink the way we do things and can provide us the opportunities to keep going and not completely stay stagnant , " she says .
" We still want to consume content , we want to be distracted , and there 's a need for artists to continue to push out content .
"  The @ChicagoReader has lost 90% of its advertising revenue and we 're now relying on individuals and foundations more than ever to keep us afloat .

Smolin spent two days just replying to cancelations and has seen a loss in work in Europe , the U .
and Latin America .
She has also brainstormed with artists and media on how to move forward .
But Walker says sending pitches to some publications can be tough right now as they face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by digital giants like Facebook and Google , the virus has caused even more economic strain on traditional print magazines and newspapers as well as digital publications relyingon ads .
Playboy announced its magazine will fold , stating : " the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic to content production and the supply chain became clearer and clearer , we were forced to accelerate a conversation we 've been having internally : the question of how to transform our U .
print product to better suit what consumers want today .
"  " The other biggest challenge is promoting something like music to the press , who are currently worried about losing their jobs and also worried about a global pandemic , " Walker says .
" It 's hard to be a publicist in these times because .
It just seems frivolous to try and cheerlead music to people that have been crying , worried and stressed all day .
"  Change Needs To Happen  Just as the coronavirus has shed light on the weaknesses of governmentsaround the world , this pandemic is highlighting how unfeasible the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital streaming .
Music artists still heavily depend on touring and live events as a major income stream .
While streaming comprises a majority of the industry 's revenue , low royalty rates are not enough to make a living for some -- the average musician makes between $20,000 and $25,000 , according to a 2018 survey .
Ultimately , the coronavirus will change the world and it will change the music industry along with it .
How and if it will benefit artists remain the million-dollar questions .
For now , some artists have pivoted to livestream concerts .
Erykah Badu , who had concert postponements due to COVID-19 precautions , is doing a series of streaming performances for which she is asking fans to pay $1 , essentially sidestepping the middleman .
Other artists have used " digital tip jars " to which fans can donate , while some have asked for nothing at all .
The rise of livestreams has become one of the industry 's reactions to the pandemic , giving publicists material to help spread the word on what their artists are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , according to Medina , who 's also an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California 's Thorton School of Music .
Walker agrees : " Cybersex is n't sex .
It 's a temporary adjustment .
Whether it 's something that we can make financially viable during this time , depending on how long this time extends to , I 'm not certain , " he adds .
" It has to come from the fan 's heartfelt desire to support the artist .
"  Everyone in the industry is bracing , day by day , for what the repercussions for the loss of revenue and income will be .
The situation has brought Walker to think about what it could mean for publicists specifically .
" If I 'm being honest , it 's made me afraid that my work will no longer be viable , " he says .
The uncertainty in the industry is at an all-time high and people are scared , but the situation has brought publicists to find solace in each other .
" We 're in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other people , even though we 're indie publicists at other companies ; we 're a friendly company and there are other friendly indies out there , so we 're all putting our heads together , " Avrin says .
Smolin says she 's become a " pseudo- psychologist " for her artists who fear what the pandemic 's outcome could mean for them .
Ultimately , the situation has caused relationships with her clients to strengthen .
Medina feels her extensive experience as an indie publicist has made it easier to survive such times of uncertainty .
" Last week , I was very worried .
I actually felt a little bit depressed , " she says .
" This week , I 'm like , it 's fine .
I 'm going to figure out what else I can do .
If I have to put a pause on PR , I 'll figure out what else I can do .
It 's nothing that I 've never had to do before .
"  Avrin is taking things one day at a time .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from artists to media , to get creative while also potentially opening unique opportunities for independent artists .
All in all , " It 's hard to say there is a silver lining , " she says .
" People are in pain and people are dying .
"  Music artists understand the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) new normal is tough on both them and their fans .
To make things easier several , many musicians are streaming live performances from their homes .
Here 's the latest list of livestreaming concerts to catch or binge-watch .
" But because we 're all going through this nightmare together we are quite literally NOT alone .
Our lives and stories are all linked , maybe more now than they have ever been .

As the coronavirus itself continues to spread , so too does its ramifications on the music industry .
While industry experts and analysts are projecting that thelive concert business could stand to lose billions , the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have people delaying on-sales for tours , and you have people who are going to postpone tours .
It 's chaotic and stressful , from agents and managers to artists , their families and their support teams , " Allen Kovac , an artist manager who represents M ? tley Cr ? e and other acts , told The New York Times .
The downfall of the live music space comes in the streaming era when the majority of professional recording artists and performing musicians rely heavily on touring and live performances as their main source of income .
A 2018 survey by the Music Industry Research Association and the Princeton University Survey Research Center , in partnership withthe Recording Academy 's MusiCares , found that live performances were the " most common income source for musicians , " according to Rolling Stone .
( Pitchfork'sin-depth feature on the booming music streaming market visualizes these financial percentages in a helpful graph .
)  Still , even as the streaming industry continues to grow , withstreaming accounting for 80 percent of the music industry 's overall revenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent artists to evenearn a minimum wage through streaming .
And artists continue to make nothing from traditional AM/FM radio platforms ( a major reason why Congress needs to pass the AM-FM Act ) .
This all makes the live music industry all that more important for artists and musicians , especially for those considered to be non-superstar acts who rely on paychecks from touring and live gigs just to make a living .
A coronavirus-sized pandemic that causes festival cancelations and cuts touring schedules short will undoubtedly impact the bottom line of artists and creators of every size on a global scale .
Simply put : No shows = no paycheck .
The coronavirus cancellations will also trickle down to songwriters , who depend on performance royalties from the live performances of their songs .
A decrease in shows unquestionably equates to a decrease in potential gains via live performance royalties .
Then , of course , there 's the legion of audio engineers , sound and light crews , backstage teams , tour managers and other behind-the-scenes hands who have doubtlessly lost work due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a DJ- and gear-centric outlet , points out , audiovisual technicians are reporting a massive wave of job cancellations as more and more music conferences are cancelled in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic .
With the global concert industry now in flux , the disruption has created a volatile environment for artists , independent musicians , songwriters , producers and the like on every level .
As tours and festivals continue to cancel , these same industries are , too , impacted , leaving session players , live musicians and all sorts of creative workers to face potentially empty touring and recording schedules for months on end .
Worst of all , there is no end in sight just yet .
Still , as the coronavirus story develops and the world continues to adapt , so will our beloved music industry .
The artist and musician community can tap into the national and local resources available to alleviate any financial , mental and social distress caused by the coronavirus pandemic .

This week , the coronavirus sparked several major blows to the international live music industry .
On the same day , Friday , March 6 , both Ultra Music Festival ( UMF ) , the Miami-based EDM mega-festival , and SXSW , the annual multi-day music , film , interactive media and tech festival and conference in Austin , Texas , canceled their 2020 editions due to concerns over the coronavirus .
( Miami 's Calle Ocho Festival , a one-day street festival and cultural event part of Carnaval Miami , was also canceled as part of the UMF announcement .
)  In the same week that UMF and SXSW were canceled , Tomorrowland Winter in France , an offshoot event of Belgium 's globally attended annual Tomorrowland EDM festival , and Ultra Abu Dhabi , UMF 's event in the Middle East , were both called off .
The news marks the first-ever cancellations for both SXSW and UMF , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unprecedented development triggered by an equally unheard-of event with potentially unknown ramifications on an industry-wide level .
Currently , there is lots of talk in the music industry surrounding event cancellation insurance as the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact large-scale events around the world .
Generally speaking , infectious diseases are not covered in cancellation insurance policies , but rather come at an extra added premium .
Still , many such insurance polices may exempt the novel coronavirus , according to Billboard .
For example , while SXSW had insurance policies covering several types of events and scenarios , the festival did not have " cancellation insurance relating to a disease outbreak or triggered by the city declaring a ' local state of disaster , ' " according to a report from The Austin Chronicle .
Consequently , many are putting the onus of event safety during the coronavirus era in the hands of event promoters and festival producers .
" Concert promoters might need to come up with some kind of new model for this period , " Carnegie Mellon University professor George Loewenstein told Billboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning .
" University of Massachusetts-Lowell bioethicist Nicholas Evans adds , " If there 's a Los Angeles Times story that says ' Coachella becomes a hotbed for coronavirus , ' I do n't think it 's going to be the company that serves drinks at the bar that 's going to be taking the hit for that one .
It 's going to be the festival organizer .
"  In the fallout of the SXSW and UMF cancellations , novel practices are starting to emerge across the live music and event industries .
Many tech conferences and industry trade shows are taking their events and exhibitions virtual and online-only .
In the music space , large-scale events are implementing advanced medical technologies and additional health measures such as " fever screening , " a process by which festival and event attendees are screened for " exposure risks " via thermal-imaging cameras , as reported by Rolling Stone .
Still , with the 2020 festival season on the horizon , questions , fears and concerns surrounding the global coronavirus outbreak continue to loom in the music industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival cancellations remain a hot topic .
" I would n't doubt over the next 20 days if we see a festival a day canceled , " Vans Warped Tour founder Kevin Lymantold Billboard in an interview prior to the SXSW and UMF cancellations .
At the time of this writing , both Coachella and Stagecoach , the flagship festivals from music events and festival producer Goldenvoice , have not been canceled .
Meanwhile , Riverside County , where both f ? tes take place , today ( March 8 ) declared a public health emergency after it confirmed its first coronavirus case .
As the coronavirus continues to spread , many are left wondering if those festivals , along with several major events around the world , will see their fates cut short during this festival season .
