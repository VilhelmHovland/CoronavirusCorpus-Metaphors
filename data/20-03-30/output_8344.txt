TenHaken : Expect more coronavirus cases announced almost daily in metro area  Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken says the city is now at a point where it could see new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus continue to rise , but exactly when those cases could peak is unclear .
" We saw more cases in South Dakota , and Lincoln and Minnehaha counties , over the weekend , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will see more cases daily , and that will continue to happen .
"  That 's why it 's essential for residents to follow social distancing guidelines and stay at home to slow the spread of the virus and try to prevent hospital systems from being overwhelmed when cases surge , he said .
Right now , the city seems to be in a good spot when it comes to hospitals having enough ventilators and personal protective equipment , but TenHaken is concerned about the uncertainty of when cases could peak , he said .
He 's heard everything from June to September .
On a conference call Monday morning , the state department of health said the surge would be in late May or early June .
City officials are constantly relying on ever-changing data models to determine what to do if and when that surge comes , whether it 's a surge that 's more sharp or rounded , he said .
City officials have been working with both Avera Health and Sanford Health officials on a game plan , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a difference , said Jill Franken , the city public health director .
" If we start seeing we 're exceeding our capacity , that 's when it 's too late , " Franken said .
We 're continuing to every day sit down .
We 're talking through where are they at , what are they seeing .
Right now , they 're really in a good place .
We 're waiting for that surge to start .
"  Meanwhile , the city has been enforcing its new ordinance this weekend to limit the number of patrons in certain businesses to no more than nine at a time .
" We did have some calls over the weekend on that , but we 've found most businesses are in compliance on that , which we really have appreciated , " TenHaken said .
The ordinance was adopted by the Sioux Falls Board of Health and City Council last week , while the Minnehaha County Commission unanimously voted in an emergency meeting to pass a similar resolution to limit businesses to 10 patrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders to discuss the affect of the CARES Act , which passed Friday , specifically the payroll protection part of the bill that allows small businesses of 500 employees or less to keep employees on their payroll .
City parks continue to stay open , but as cases continue to climb , city officials may look at re-evaluating whether the city should take a more heavy-handed approach to enforcing social distancing guidelines at those locations , TenHaken said .
The city has also implemented a hiring freeze for its employees until further notice .
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 , the respiratory illness affecting thousands worldwide , surpassed 100 on Monday in South Dakota , with 28 reported in Minnehaha County alone .
The area now leads the state in the number of confirmed cases , with Beadle County trailing by eight .
Both counties substantial community spread , state officials have said .
