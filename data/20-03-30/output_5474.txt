Wage subsidy payments to Australian businesses will begin flowing from early-May as the Morrison government prepares to " dig deep " to ensure an estimated six million workers keep their jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic .
Announced Monday , employers will have access to $1,500 fortnightly payments for each full-time or part-time staff member on their books .
Sole traders and casual workers with a tenure of more than 12 months will also have access to the payments , expected to last for a period of six months .
The Australian Tax Office ( ATO ) will administer the so-called " JobKeeper " scheme and has begun taking expression of interests from employers through its website .
" Now is the time to dig deep , " Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday .

As overseer of the program , the ATO will be required to enforce a legal obligation for employers to use the funds to pay their staff , with single touch payroll functions slated to be used to track the money .
The scheme will cost $130 billion over the next six months , according to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg , who said the payments are equivalent to about 70% of the median wage nationally .
" We 've been focused on keeping Australians in jobs and Australian businesses in business , " he told reporters in Canberra on Monday .
" Today we go further , we go much further .

Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ATO spokesperson said it was unable to provide detailed comment on the measures until they pass parliament .

Quick-look Q&amp;A  Which businesses are eligible for the JobKeeper wage subsidy payments ?  The wage subsidy is available to businesses with annual turnover of less than $1 billion , that have seen a 30% drop in turnover due to the coronavirus .

What about startups ?  There is some confusion about how far the measure goes to support startups .

Of course , this may not be relevant at all for startups that do n't yet have turnover .
