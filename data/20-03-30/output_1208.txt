So you 're in quarantine , and you 've got kids playing too much Roblox while the school system scrambles to put digital learning in place .
Even for families with experience educating at home , it can be a daunting task coming up with learning experiences to fill a student 's day , especially with most public libraries closed during the COVID-19 crisis .
While television is not the cure-all for the problem , a nice educational program , perhaps one that includes instructional materials , could be just the thing to fill in the instructional gaps and give flustered parents a little break from playing teacher .
We 've listed here our favorite educational television program in each of the main subject areas : math , science , language arts , and social studies .
Most of these are available via PBS and are often presented along with materials for follow-up lessons .
There 's obviously a lot more out there for the elementary set than any other age group , but we tried to include programming that could appeal to a wide variety of grade levels broken down by subject .
Math : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genius by Stephen Hawking , the titular physicist says , " I believe that anyone can answer big questions for themselves .
" This show takes the questions we all ask such as " Can We Time Travel ? " and " Where Did the Universe Come From ? " and turns them into the episode titles designed specifically to explore those ideas through practical demonstrations , commentary from experts , and the interaction of three so-called " regular people " that act as the audience 's proxy .
The large-scale experiments and incredible stunts will appeal to students of many ages as they come to grips with molecular biology , astrophysics , and even Hawking 's speciality , quantum mechanics .
Genius by Stephen Hawking was produced in 2016 but is currently available to stream through your PBS station and is free to Amazon Prime subscribers .

Science &amp; Social Studies : NOVA  PBS knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 pandemic , so they recently began a free marathon of episodes of their famed science program , NOVA , starting with their collection entitled " Space &amp; the Universe " as of March 26 , 2020 .
Further marathons are planned for each successive week .
There are other NOVA resources on the PBS LearningMedia website , generally in the form of video excerpts that include teaching tips , discussion questions , and background essays , but the episodes certainly stand on their own for a lively family discussion afterwards .
But NOVA covers more curriculum than just science .
If you head to the NOVA website and click on " Topic , " you 'll also find resources and videos in the areas of world history and military analysis for use in social studies .
NOVA has been around for over 40 seasons so it 's definitely a tried and true program , and many seasons are available for free via Amazon Prime , Apple TV+ , and the PBS streaming app .
Cosmos : Possible Worlds , airing now on the National Geographic channel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , mostly in the area of anthropology .
Although not as continuously airing as NOVA , it certainly covers the same hopeful and contextual topics .
As a side note , the History Channel has a lot of great educational content in their online classroom , but on their channel , you have to sort through all the episodes of Swamp People and Pawn Stars to get to gems like Project Blue Book and Vikings , neither of which are necessarily classroom related .

It 's like a giant book club with celebrity interviews presented alongside commentary from authors and everyday fans of reading .
For everyone who 's thinking about starting a book club via Zoom or Google Hangouts , this show is the perfect companion to get the conversation started with personal stories from other readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Den of Geek delivered right to your inbox !  The eight episode season currently available on PBS and Amazon Prime includes topics like " Villains and Monsters , " " What We Do for Love , " and -- a great one for Den of Geek readers -- " Other Worlds .
" The Great American Read reportedly culminates with the reveal of America 's most-loved novel .
An honorable mention in this category goes to PBS 's Shakespeare Uncovered for those with a penchant for The Bard .
This is obviously just a cross section of free programs out there that can contribute to a home curriculum of educational content during the long housebound hours , but even if it just acts as a supplement to the arts and crafts activities elsewhere in the day , the time spent watching these shows can act as content , a break for parents , and even quality family time .
Whether the local school system has something in place for students to fulfill their compulsory education requirement or not , a new routine established in these strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe your love of these shows will even continue beyond the bounds of quarantine ! .
