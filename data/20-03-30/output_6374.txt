UK epidemic is slowing ; antibody test could soon be ready - advisers  FILE PHOTO : Contractors , members of 1 Royal Anglian Regiment and members of the Queen 's Gurkha Engineer Regiment help to build the new NHS N  By Guy Faulconbridge and Paul Sandle  LONDON ( Reuters ) - The coronavirus epidemic in the United Kingdom is showing signs of slowing and antibody tests could be ready in days , Neil Ferguson , a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London , said on Monday .
" We think the epidemic is just about slowing in the UK right now , " Ferguson told BBC radio .
Patrick Vallance , the government 's chief scientific adviser , also said there were signs that locking down the country a week ago had slowed the rate of transmission of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast acceleration " phase .
Official data on Monday showed 1,408 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) had died so far and there were 22,141 positive cases .
Britain initially took a modest approach to containing the spread of the disease compared with European countries such as Italy .
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed stringent controls after projections showed a quarter of a million people could die .
Johnson has since become the first leader of a major power to announce a positive test result for coronavirus .
Vallance said on Monday the restrictions - which have seen public transport use fall to less than a quarter of normal levels - were already having a " big effect " on the transmission of the virus .
This in turn would to lead to fewer people being admitted to hospital , he said , and ultimately reduce the total fatality figure .
Hospital admissions had already stabilized at about 1,000 per day , he said .
" It 's quite important - it tells you that actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , adding that the country was tracking France rather than the worse-hit Italy and Spain .
He said it would take another 2 to 3 weeks to determine the extent of the slowdown in the spread of the virus because of the lag between the rate of transmission and that of hospital admissions .
Ferguson said a third or even 40% of people do not get any symptoms and thought perhaps 2% to 3% of Britain 's population had been infected .
But Ferguson cautioned that the data was not good enough to make firm extrapolations .
He said antibody tests were in the final stage of validation and could hopefully be ready in " days rather than weeks " .
