Covid-19 is causing a global economic slowdown , says GlobalData  China has established itself as the most dominant country among the emerging economies .
However , when Wuhan City in Hubei became ground zero for COVID-19 outbreak , it resulted into a pronounced slowdown in the global economy , including the oil and gas industry , says data and analytics company GlobalData .
Ravindra Puranik , Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData , commented , " China consumes 13 .
million barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude oil annually ( 2018 estimate ) , of which around 62% is obtained through imports .
The lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed in some of the major cities across China have resulted in a drop in consumption of petroleum products in the country .
"  The steep decline in the workforce , a consequence of lockdown , has also disrupted port activity in China .

It prompted companies , such as PetroChina and China National Offshore Oil Corporation ( CNOOC ) to decline some crude oil cargoes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China 's state-owned refiners announced a cut in the refining throughput of 940,000 bpd for the month .
According to GlobalData , there could be some delays in execution of downstream projects that are under construction , such as Jieyang , Lianyungang II , Dayushan Island Phase II , and Zhejiang Petrochemical Daishan Xylene Plant 2 due to the disruption in supply chains amid travel restrictions .
Chinese firms have also invested in the oil and gas sector of several other emerging markets , especially Russia , Brazil , Nigeria , and Mexico .
These countries too may witness some dip in their oil and gas income due to the faltering energy consumption in China .
Brazil and Nigeria also export significant volumes of their crude oil production to China , which are likely to drop over the short term .
Puranik concluded , " In contrast to other emerging markets , India has been one of the beneficiaries of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and the resultant low oil prices .
Following China 's cancellation of some crude oil imports , India refiners , such as Bharat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consignments of from Mediterranean and Latin American regions at discounted rates .
