ClassNK Releases New Non-destructive Inspection Guidelines  Leading Classification Society ClassNK has released its " Guidelines for Non-destructive Inspection by Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing .
"  Phased array ultrasonic testing is an advanced non-destructive inspection technology that enables the visualizing of flaw detection results and the digitizing of the record-keeping process .
It has higher detection performance for defects in materials and welded joints compared to conventional ultrasonic testing .
In recent years , the application of phased array ultrasonic testing in various industrial fields has been increasing , and it has also been gradually spreading in the shipbuilding field , taking advantage of the above features .
In light of these circumstances , ClassNK has been carrying out R&amp;D on the practical implementation of phased array ultrasonic testing as part of its R&amp;D roadmap announced in September 2017 .
Based on the knowledge acquired from this R&amp;D , the society has comprehensively summarized the requirements for non-destructive inspection by phased array ultrasonic testing and specific flaw detection procedures for butt welded joints of carbon steels in the shipbuilding field into its guidelines .
Phased array ultrasonic testing has the potential to greatly benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand so that it can be more widely implemented and taken advantage of .
ClassNK will continue to actively support the smooth dissemination of such advanced inspection technologies and make efforts to contribute to the further development of the industry by investing in new areas and implementing important findings into its rules and guidelines .

Maersk and MSC , the world 's largest ocean carriers and the two primary partners of the 2M alliance , have implemented deep cuts in service on the core Asia-Europe trade lanes due to the COVID-19 outbreak .
This new round of cuts is driven by falling demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China that forced carriers to slash dozens of sailings in February and March .
The new cuts include a temporary suspension of the 2M AE20/Dragon and AE2/Swan .
Long after their passengers have returned home , most of the world 's full-size cruise ships retain a sizeable crew complement , and some of these vessels are beginning to report COVID-19 cases or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 on board .
In addition to the passenger-involved outbreaks aboard Diamond Princess , Grand Princess , Ruby Princess , Costa Luminosa , Costa Victoria , Braemar , Silver Shadow , Silver Explorer , Artania and Zaandam , multiple cruise ships have reported either positive test results or flu-like illness among the crew during the ongoing layup .
The Australian Antarctic Division will use the ice-class multipurpos vessel Everest to resupply its Antarctic stations and sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island next summer as Aurora Australis has been retired .
The Everest is operated by Dutch company Maritime Construction Services and is capable of navigating in ice up to one meter thick .
She will operate instead of Australia 's new icebreaker RSV Nuyina after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 140 meter long ship was built in 2017 and will be used for .
The first Eastbound train on Maersk 's AE19 service was dispatched from St .
Petersburg port in the eastward direction on March 28 , carrying goods from Europe to Asia .
The overall transit time of the new intercontinental service from ports in North Europe to ports in Korea and Japan will be between 23 and 32 days , which is a reduction by half compared to 52-57 days via the traditional ocean route .
The train loaded with plywood and chemical products from North Europe .
