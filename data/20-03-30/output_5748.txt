Locked up : No masks , sanitizer as virus spreads behind bars  NEW YORK .
In this March 16 , 2011 , file photo , a security fence surrounds inmate housing on the Rikers Island correctional facility in New York .
Health experts say prisons and jails are considered a potential epicenter for America 's coronavirus pandemic .
( AP )  +  AA  -  March 29 , 2020  SOMETHING was wrong .
The chow hall line at New York 's Rikers Island jail had halted .
For three hours , the men stood and waited , without food , until a correctional officer quietly delivered the news : A civilian chef was among those who tested positive for the coronavirus .
" We was like , ' What ? The cook ? ' " said Corey Young , who spoke to The Associated Press last week by phone from Rikers .
He and others wondered if the chef had sneezed on trays or into the food .
Some men later floated the idea of a hunger strike to protest .
" I do n't want to eat nothing that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not going to take care of us properly here .
"  Health experts say prisons and jails are considered a potential epicenter for America 's coronavirus pandemic .
They are little cities hidden behind tall fences where many people share cells , sit elbow-to-elbow at dining areas and are herded through halls to the yard or prison industry jobs .
They say it 's nearly impossible to keep 6 feet away from anyone , adding to tensions .
Medical services behind bars have long been substandard and even hand sanitizer is considered contraband in some facilities because of its alcohol content .
More than 2 .
million people are incarcerated in the United States -- more than anywhere else in the world .
But the threat posed by COVID-19 behind bars extends well beyond prison walls .
Even though most personal visits have been stopped , hundreds of thousands of guards , wardens and other correctional facility administrators go in and out 24 hours a day , potentially carrying the virus home to their families and communities .
And -- as the incarcerated understand better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely to bring the virus into overflowing facilities already grappling with older men and women , those suffering from chronic health conditions and the mentally ill .
Nascimento Blair , locked up at Fishkill Correctional Facility in upstate New York , said one officer had returned from a cruise vacation and was coughing and showing other flu-like symptoms in common areas .
That person was eventually sent home , but only after a few days .
" Now we do n't even know if we 've been exposed , " he said , adding there had been one confirmed coronavirus case at his prison , but the men were aware of three others .
" And how do you run from this ? "  The first positive tests from inside America 's correctional facilities started trickling out two weeks ago , with more than 350 cases now confirmed in New York , California , Michigan , Alabama and a dozen other states .
But information and transparency about the number of infections are lacking , and some in custody are afraid to report symptoms because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so , several men said in interviews with the AP .
Many correctional departments across the country do not even identify affected facilities , let alone name those who test positive , citing privacy concerns .
" It 's like we are expendable , " said Blair , from Fishkill .
" The last thing you want is to be around someone and not know that that person has it , because that 's a potential catastrophe .
"  Most of the coronavirus cases in jails and prisons so far have been reported from New York City , with the Department of Corrections said Saturday that one of its longest-serving officers passed away at a local hospital and that 104 staff and 132 men in custody have now tested positive at Rikers and city jails alone -- five times what was reported just a week ago .
Homer Venters , former chief medical officer of the New York City jail system , said the rise in infection rates at Rikers Island foreshadows what 's to come elsewhere .
He called for authorities to " rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness and death , and create pathways to hospital-level care .
" If nothing is done , he said , people will die and the virus will spread faster .
The Bureau of Prisons said Saturday that the first federal inmate had died of coronavirus .
The man , Patrick Jones , 49 , had been housed at FCI Oakdale I , a low-security prison in Louisiana and had " long-term , pre-existing medical conditions , " the agency said .
Officials said Jones had complained of a persistent cough on March 19 and was taken to a hospital .
His condition declined the next day and he was placed on a ventilator .
He died at the hospital on Saturday .
Jones was serving a 27-year sentence for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute near a junior college .
Already , New York , Ohio , Florida and a handful of other states have started letting some people out -- the elderly , pretrial detainees , those being held on technical violations and low-level offenders who are at high-risk of severe illness .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Meanwhile , youth justice groups in nearly two dozen states are also calling for the release of detained and incarcerated juveniles and a halt to new admissions .
However , new men and women continue to cycle in and out of the prison system and others are still being transferred in crowded vans between facilities , sometimes across state lines .
All increasing the chances the virus will spread .
Juan Giron was transferred to Rikers Island from an upstate facility last week for resentencing .
After going through intake and undergoing a health screening , he went to a dormitory , where dozens of beds were lined up next to one another , just a few feet apart .
Four or five other men arrived soon after , he said , and within a few hours it became clear one of them might be infected .
" Two police officers come in with masks and gloves on and try to give the guy a mask .
and they took him out , " Giron said .
" We asked one of the officers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing now for guys who have the virus .
' "  No one else from the dorm was isolated , he said , or even told to look out for symptoms .
With little information coming from within correctional facilities or from the outside world , those inside often try to figure out who 's been infected on their own .
Sometimes they learn about it from jail staff members , who have weighed orders to remain silent with their own concerns about the health of inmates and staff , the men say .
Others make assumptions after vague memos about COVID-19 infections are posted in their units and a guard , cook or someone in their unit suddenly disappears after showing flu-like symptoms .
However , protocols on paper for dealing with infectious diseases behind bars do not always translate into reality .
Even the simplest guidelines like hand washing and social distancing are often impossible to follow inside .
Some men also said they had neither soap or toilet paper .
So far , most of the confirmed cases in prisons and jails across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Sometimes , incarcerated men known to have come into contact with infected people are sent to segregation or to their cells -- whether they have a bunk mate or not .
But more often , it 's just business as usual .
Several men told the AP they are trying their best to take care of themselves , washing their hands as much as possible and wiping down surfaces .
Without masks , some people improvise by covering the receiver of communal phones with a sock or wearing gloves used for sports to try to keep from picking up germs .
At Waupun Correctional Institution in Wisconsin the warden sent a vaguely worded email to staff saying someone had tested positive for the virus .
Days later , it surfaced in the media that the infected person was a prison doctor who had been working for two weeks after returning from a vacation in Italy .
Elijah Prioleau , who is locked up there on a three-year revocation after serving 16 years in the state 's prisons , said sick people are not being tested quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another part of the jail , even though there are still healthy prisoners housed there .
If someone who is sick refuses to be moved out of fear that they may infect others there , he said the only alternative is segregation , or solitary confinement -- a place no one wants to go .
" As far as the quarantine goes , it 's a joke , " Prioleau said on a call with the nonprofit Forum For Understanding Prisons posted on Facebook Live .
" They putting you in seg .
They 're throwing you in the hole and quarantining you if you refuse to go over there .
"  He added that the men are also not being given enough cleaning supplies , and that guards and prisoners do not have any protective gear so some are forced to improvise .
" I got on handball gloves right now holding the phone , " Prioleau said , adding many men were coughing and sneezing in his tier .
Anna Neil , a spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Corrections , said Waupun is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in separate areas .
She said Covid-19 tests are being given , but only after people with symptoms test negative for influenza .
" For this case , individuals in our care were moved to a cell hall with the best means of isolation , " she said .
Visits from friends , relatives and , in most cases , lawyers have all but stopped in jails and prisons nationwide , making it harder to get information in and out .
Though some prisoners have access to phones , and at times now a few free calls , many say they are more isolated than ever .
" Guys are just idle , waiting for the next shoe to drop , " said Rickey Fu-Quan McGee , 42 , who 's serving a life sentence at MCI-Norfolk , a prison in Massachusetts .
With so many men suffering from mental health issues , he said he 's concerned about their well-being .
" No one 's coming around asking guys how they 're dealing with it .
This can be a very volatile environment , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , making sure everyone 's good .
"  In states , such as Minnesota , with no confirmed cases inside prisons , everyone is nervous and doing their best to protect themselves .
" The same rules that apply out there should apply here , " said Antonio Williams , who is serving time at the state 's Rush City Correctional Facility , about an hour north of the Minneapolis-St .
Paul metro area .
He said he and others are paying careful attention to the guidelines issued in the outside world , even though they are all but impossible to follow inside .
" Meeting between 10 or more people should be restricted , right ? " Williams said .
" They force us to the chow hall .
Literally elbow to elbow .
If it comes here , it 's gon na spread like wildfire .
