The plan is to make the show an annual preseason Big3 tournament , sources said .

A basketball gymnasium is currently being constructed at the designated home .
If a player were to break quarantine at any point during the tournament , he or she would be eliminated and removed from the premises .

1 concern is safety , " Kwatinetz told Yahoo Sports .
" Aside from being able to work with the best creative producers possible for this type of show , they 're also the right people to ensure safety and health because they 've done this for over 20 years in a hundred countries .
They 've specialized in keeping people in quarantined conditions .
