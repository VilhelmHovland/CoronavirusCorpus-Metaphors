" From Monday , pharmacies around the country can offer free delivery on prescriptions to their customers and take advantage of the recently announced increased Australian Government rebate and Australia Post 's unrivalled national network , " Australia Post said in a statement .
" The initiative incorporates Australia Post 's contactless delivery in line with current Covid-19 guidelines .
" The new delivery option will support vulnerable Australians , including those isolating themselves at home on the advice of a medical practitioner , people over 70 and people with chronic health conditions .
" The initiative has been developed in association with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and allows vulnerable members of the community to receive medication and other essential supplies ( under 500grams ) through Australia Post 's Express Post network , once a month , and pharmacies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Deliveries can be made to the home , or to a local Post Office or 24/7 Parcel Locker for pick-up .
Pharmacy Guild national president George Tambassis appeared in mainstream media including radio 2SM on Monday morning to explain the new service to listeners .
" We 're already seeing increased demand from patients : elderly , not-so-elderly , people with comorbidities -- people who just ca n't get out of the home or maybe their carers are too busy -- are already ringing pharmacies up and emailing us and texting us , and saying , ' Can we please have our medicines delivered from now on ? ' " Mr Tambassis told 2SM .
" And we need to change the way we run our pharmacies , it 's as simple as that , because it 's a new world now .
"  He explained that the general public can utilise the service monthly .
" It 's once a month , so you 've got to organise yourself , so whatever your PBS medicine is , you 'll always get once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can organise yourself and ask to get all your monthly medicines delivered to you on a monthly basis , you 'll be able to take advantage of .
the Australian Government 's announcement .
"  If patients need more deliveries per month , this can be arranged with prices and availability depending on factors such as the way a pharmacy runs its business , distance to the pharmacy and customer loyalty , Mr Tambassis advised listeners , adding that " a lot of pharmacies wo n't charge for the extra deliveries anyway " .
He advised listeners that when ordering a delivery that weighs more than 500g , they should speak to their pharmacy to discuss options .
Mr Tambassis also asked patients to " look after your local pharmacy and we 'll look after you , " saying " we 're all in this together " .
