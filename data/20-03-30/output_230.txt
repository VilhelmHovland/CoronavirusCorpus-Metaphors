Wake up , New Zealand : that 's the message from a New Zealander trying to manage a large dairy farm in the UK amid the COVID-19 outbreak .
A friend of the man who wishes to remain anonymous called Dairy News in a bid to make farmers in NZ aware of the situation in the UK which he describes as horrific .
