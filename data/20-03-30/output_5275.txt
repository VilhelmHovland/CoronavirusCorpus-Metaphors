To be fair , doing anything more is a legal nightmare .
And Monday 's $1,500 wage subsidy is good policy and will be more helpful in the big picture .
So , let 's negotiate with that landlord .
As I may have mentioned in several irate articles , they have generally been absolute dicks about the whole COVID-19 situation .
But the key to negotiation is not confrontation , it is understanding .
Even if it 's just understanding that you 're dealing with someone really greedy .
Why they 're not getting it  To help understand the commercial landlord mindset , here 's a handy graph .
You , the one responsible for the business , have been running around this hellscape with your hair on fire for weeks now .
You 're slashing costs like a maniac to save something , anything , from the wreckage .
This lag is why you might have been frustrated by staff fixated on details of their entitlements when you 're thinking : ' I 'm just trying to save your job .
' They simply have n't been immersed in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like : ' This is just the government blowing all this out of proportion .
' Not joking , that is a verbatim quote from one last week .
Because theirs is a slow-reaction business .
They make decisions at continental-drift speed .
They are n't scouring every bit of coronavirus economic news like we are .
And their business decision processes are very different too .
I 've seen landlords leave buildings empty for three or four years rather than accept 5% less than their asking price .
Despite the Prime Minister 's matey imagery , you are not going to sit down with your landlord .
Nobody does that .
You 'll need to put it in writing .
Call the managing agent and let them know a formal request is on its way .
Put it in writing  Handily , a friend of mine runs a national chain of stores in the tasty frozen treat category .
Last week , he sent a copy of his letter that 's worked well with a range of landlords , both institutional and private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private landlords have been better than the big guys .
Their letter has a good basic structure that you can use yourself .
The core points are as follows .
Hi commercial landlord 's name ,  Our business has been ordered to cease trading by federal and state governments for COVID-19 containment .
Until this point , our business was solvent , well-managed and a stable tenant .
As you would be aware , the PM has requested that commercial tenants and landlords negotiate in good faith .
We seek a six-month rent-free period from next payment date , to be reviewed should government shutdown policy change , then rent as a proportion of revenue for the six months after that .
This will allow us to resume our position as a stable tenant once we are allowed to trade .
I 've written a more formal version of this as a Word Document .
You can download and edit it here .
While you wait for a response , pay half your April rent if you 've got the cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full amount , they 'll stall you forever .
What sort of deal do you ask for ?  There are lots of variables here , depending on how hard COVID-19 has hit you .
But if you 're shut down by order like those of us unlucky enough to be in events , ask for the six months that is current government guidance .
That 's realistic .
Watch out for the D-word : deferral .
Say no to deferral .
That means double overheads in the coming recession and it just pushes the death of your business back to 2021 .
Turnover-based rent is an interesting one .
It 's something that 's traditionally existed in retail malls , mainly in the sense of ' if you have a bumper sales period , your landlord wants a bumper rent windfall ' .
But turning that around to rent as a fixed percentage of revenue as you come out of the shutdown is a good way of sharing the risk if you can swing it .
Do n't forget outgoings  Outgoings is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they 're likely to be about 20% of your rent expenses .
It 's all the costs for things such as carpark maintenance , gardeners , window cleaners and that sort of thing .
Managing agents can be pretty blas ? about those costs in the good times and they creep up .
We 're meeting with one of our landlords next week , along with other tenants in the block , to go through all these costs to work out what 's absolutely necessary .
Let that garden run riot , nobody cares .
What if they wo n't negotiate ?  Sticky situation .
State governments have promised various ' no evictions for six months ' laws .
A worst-case scenario is your landlord refuses to budge on rent , you refuse to pay for six months , then they can start evicting you .
That 's not an instant process .
You lose your security deposit , roughly two months rent .
Bingo you 're at least four months ahead less moving costs .
It will require a certain amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they could have prevented all this unpleasantness by negotiating in good faith .
Do they have any further legal hold over you , like say suing for rent for the duration of the lease ? I thought about asking the Motivation For Sceptics legal advisory panel , but it 's a waste of their time given the new laws only exist in press release form .
My non-lawyer view is , when all this is washed up , the courts are going to be pretty far from interested in hearing cases brought by landlords who failed to negotiate when asked to do so by the government .
Did n't negotiate with your tenant ? Get out of my court .
Should I stay or should I go ?  If they wo n't negotiate , it 's a complex choice .
As a general observation , if you really like your premises or it has an expensive fit-out , pay half rent for a few months but remain civil and open to further negotiation .
If you 're not wedded to the premises , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just moving desks , may as well go renegade on them .
Ask yourself , while that space suited you before the virus , will it be the right space for your slimmed-down business in the recession of 2021 and beyond ?  And remember , it 'll be a very different market in the aftermath .
It 's quite likely you 'll find yourself something better and cheaper .
Advice from a pro lease negotiator  This update came in late , just as I was recording this story .
Blog friend with all the stores has been talking with a professional lease negotiator , who had some very useful extra points .
A successful trading lessee in 12 months is going to be a sought-after prize , worth far more than a few months ' rent now .
A point worth bringing up when you ' sit down ' .
The words to use are ' pause ' or ' hibernate ' .
NOT ' defer ' .
There is no ' defer ' as of now .
Consolation for the landlord : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration of the lease .
Now is a really good time to introduce the percentage-of-turnover rent concept .
Show them your revenue figures for Feb/March 2019 vs Feb/Mar 2020 .
That will help bring home the reality .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses .
So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ? .
