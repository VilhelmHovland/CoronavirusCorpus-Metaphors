( File Photo : Jair Messias Bolsonaro/Facebook )  RIO DE JANEIRO -- Even as coronavirus cases mount in Latin America 's largest nation , Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has staked out the most deliberately dismissive position of any major world leader , calling the pandemic a momentary , minor problem and saying strong measures to contain it are unnecessary .
Bolsonaro says his response to the disease matches that of President Donald Trump in the U .
, but the Brazilian leader has gone further , labeling the virus as " a little flu " and saying state governors ' aggressive measures to halt the disease were crimes .
On Thursday , Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital , Brasilia , that he feels Brazilians ' natural immunity will protect the nation .
" The Brazilian needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see a guy jumping into sewage , diving in , right ? Nothing happens to him .
I think a lot of people were already infected in Brazil , weeks or months ago , and they already have the antibodies that help it not proliferate , " Bolsonaro said .
" I 'm hopeful that 's really a reality .
"  A video titled " Brazil Can not Stop " that circulated on social media drew a rebuke from Monica de Bolle , a Brazilian senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics .
" Do you know what will happen , Bolsonaro ? Brazil WILL stop .
Your irresponsibility will bring thousands to avoidable deaths , " she tweeted Friday .
" The destroyed lungs of these people , as well as the organs of those who wo n't be able to have medical care , will fall on your lap .
And Brazil will not spare you .
"  Bolsonaro , 65 , shows no sign of wavering even as the nation 's tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases approach 4,000 , deaths top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Datafolha this month found 73% of people supported total isolation , and 54% approved of governors ' management of the crisis .
Bolsonaro 's backing was just 33% .
Does Bolsonaro actually believe , as he says , that the virus will be vanquished by a cocktail of drugs and Brazil 's tropical climate ? It 's possible , but analysts say a more calculated political gamble may underlie his increasingly defiant position .
Bolsonaro may have concluded that when he faces reelection in two and a half years , the economy will matter more to most Brazilians than the death toll from coronavirus .
By labeling the virus threat as overblown and decrying state governors ' quarantines and shutdowns as unnecessary , he could be preparing to blame others for any recession that might happen .
" If things go really poorly from an economic point of view , he can point his finger at the governors , " Christopher Garman , managing director for the Americas at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group , said by phone .
" What he is n't calculating is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have not handled well the public health crisis .
"  The governors of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , the states hardest hit by the virus , have banned public gatherings , closed schools and businesses and called for strict social distancing .
Both are Bolsonaro critics and possible contenders in the 2022 presidential race .
They also have backup : 25 of Brazil 's 27 governors signed a joint letter this week begging Bolsonaro to back strict anti-virus measures .
Bolsonaro , a Trump devotee , said he has watched his U .
counterpart speak about the virus in recent days and found their perspectives rather aligned .
Like Trump , he has sought to ease anxiety by often touting the yet-unproven benefits of chloroquine in combating the virus .
On Thursday , he eliminated tariffs for the anti-malaria drug .
Local media have counted some two dozen people who tested positive for COVID-19 after travelling with Bolsonaro this month to the U .
That includes his national security adviser , who this week returned to work at the presidential palace .
Bolsonaro says his two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has refused to publish his results .
From the U .
, Bolsonaro called coronavirus fears a " fantasy .
"  As COVID-19 started to spread in mid-March , he issued a lukewarm call for postponement of pro-government demonstrations , then celebrated the rallies and shook supporters ' hands .
For a few days , he and his ministers wore masks , but they removed them when speaking .
Asked March 23 why they had dispensed with their masks , officials exchanged sidelong glances for a full 15 seconds before a moderator broke the silence to call for the next question .
Bolsonaro returned to a hard line of denial Tuesday in an address to the nation .
He demanded that life return to normal and people get back to work .
His athletic past , he said , rendered him impervious to the virus .
The next morning , he told reporters he and his health minister would decide to isolate only high-risk Brazilians -- the elderly and those with preexisting health problems .
The minister , a doctor who had earned praise for his no-nonsense crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been hasty .
" It 's a very high-risk , tremendous gamble for Bolsonaro and probably it wo n't work , " said Michael Shifter , president of the Inter-American Dialogue , a Washington-based think-tank .
" But I would n't rule out that it could .
He could get lucky .
It seems like it is going to hurt him significantly , but he has defied the odds before .
"  For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .
The vast majority of people recover .
Bolsonaro , a former Army captain , was a fringe lawmaker during his seven congressional terms and gained prominence with a stream of offensive statements .
Popular support coalesced around his call for aggressive policing , plans to impose conservative cultural values and promises to rejuvenate the economy .
During his 15 months in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation of so-called " cultural Marxism " and dismissed data showing a surge in Amazon deforestation .
He has flouted the international consensus on coronavirus even as Trump has moved toward some World Health Organization recommendations for isolation .
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador spent weeks dismissing the coronavirus threat but on Thursday closed government for all but essential work and urged Mexicans to remain indoors .
Brazil 's economy still has not healed from a devastating 2015-2016 recession , and the country can not survive a sustained stoppage without food riots and the like , according to Tony Volpon , chief economist at UBS in Brazil .
He supports a shutdown but says the government should develop a plan to gradually ease the restrictions by region and business type , accompanied by ramping up testing and clamping down wherever coronavirus cases spike .
In Sao Paulo and Rio , self-isolating Brazilians have leaned from their windows every night for the past week to bang pots and pans in protest .
While that 's not indicative of nationwide discontent , Eurasia 's Garman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Bolsonaro 's fate will depend largely on the damage wrought by the disease , according to Thiago de Arag ? o , director of strategy at political risk consultancy Arko Advice .
If deaths are relatively low and the economy crippled , " public opinion could side with him , " de Arag ? o said .
" If the final outcome is 50,000 deaths and trucks carrying coffins , like in Italy , it will be tremendously negative for the president .
