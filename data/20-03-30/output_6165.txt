The coronavirus recession and oil price crash could push inflation below zero for the first time since the Great Depression , causing a dangerous deflation spiral that will require a huge government spending stimulus after the virus passes , a former top Treasury economist has warned .
The government would ultimately need to step in and inject another huge fiscal stimulus on top of the $84 billion announced so far , he said .
Rising unemployment , weak wage growth and the oil price collapse to below $US30 a barrel after negotiations broke down between Russia and the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will push inflation to or below zero by the middle of next year , according to his preliminary economic modelling .
Having been out today to grab a couple of things , I 'm of the opinion we 're fucking doomed .
Ducked into Bunnings to grab a replacement door lock for a house I 'm fixing up for a relative ( looters ) and stupid fucking idiots all walking right next to me despite all the signage Bunnings had in place .

We need to get it to the point where 80% of the population are staying put at home .
We 're not there yet .
And we need to get there .
Otherwise , as demonstrated in the graphs on the last page shows we 're still headed to maxing out our healthcare capacity if we manage to maintain our current levels of growth .
Wait a month for even more businesses to shutdown and people out of work to get the stimulus money in their pocket , then we 'll see inflation rocket up and shit really hit the fan .
I do n't think so .
firstly , I do n't think people are going to squander the stimulus money this time , I think they will in the main , keep it for when they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spend it ? all the majors are shutting down , and most smaller retailers are keen to do so .

Ah , but will they get the money in their pockets ? Wage/salary subsidies look like going to the employer , not individual employees .
What are the chances of some employers doing a Seven Eleven and not passing on the full amount ? And what of the million or so unemployed before the subsidy takes effect ? Talk is that the employers will also get their subsidised wages .

from the " functioning " infected / mildly unwell + the unaffected ?  The concept surrounds secondment of other private and public assets likely with the support and assistance of the armed forces to deal with the higher logistical load of treatment .
And yes , I am aware that we just do n't have the volume of professionals /carers - and also , those on the front lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune systems get compromised under the load  But rhetoric is also being used about being at war , silent enemy etc etc .
By way of example , and for me - one of the great heroic and inspirational examples of humankind 's can do - during the Battle of Britain the average training time for new pilots was curtailed significantly to get bodies in the air to fight .
Matter was compromised in " the normal way " things otherwise would have worked - but the preparedness to re-write your book eventually saw the RAF get to stabilise the Air Battle despite being outnumbered - and then ultimately to emerge victorious .
We are already hearing suggestions / examples of Qantas trying to redirect staff to logistic support with Coles and Woolies , people from the Health and Fitness industry to work as orderlies or anything else in low level support to help lighten any load we can  What about endeavouring to re-direct medical and nursing students who are within 1-2 years from completing their degrees to be called on , displaced specialists who are copping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been qualified nurses but have stayed at home to prioritise raising their families and are not " modern qualified "  What about " field facilities/ logistics " that deal with increased load in a combination and pulling together of all above factors and no doubt around a myriad of others that also drives hospitality / catering supply , immediate production initiatives - and there are a range of opportunities here - some of which I 've seen in my own neighbourhood with the boys at the Milton Rum Distillery re-configuring their operations / stills over the last week to go into bulk sanitiser production .
Brilliant .
I think I saw something where Dyson ( vacuum cleaner manufacturers ) were re-directing part of their operations to Ventilator production .
Also brilliant .
There are opportunities everywhere here .
And yes a large number of people need help in how they re-wire or re-direct but we have to stop thinking about what we know based on what is now the old paradigm  The new paradigm requires a lot of new creativity , co-operation and leadership - and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have considered before  So .
with all that said - why ca n't we manage both health and economy ? If we continue to think , or make of it , a binary choice - it seems we 're more rooted than what we need to be in either of those choices  Nup .
Stimulus and the consequent inflationary pressure will be needed .
The amount already put in is unlikely to be enough .
Deflation is the word you do n't want to be hearing .
This is a supply shock , with reduced production we will see 1970s style stagflation .
Deflationary spirals are caused by falling demand and a supply gut--something we do n't have .
When prices rise without increases in real production all it does is lower purchasing power of consumers negating the effect of the stimulus  firstly , I do n't think people are going to squander the stimulus money this time , I think they will in the main , keep it for when they might really need it .
in any event , where could they spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most smaller retailers are keen to do so .
if there was a spike in demand , most retailers would be more focused on clearing inventory rather than maximising prices .
If households engage in balance sheet repair rather than spending the stimulus , then that might prove some long-term good but it basically blunts the whole aim of the policy which is to generate spending to keep us out of the hole until businesses can start opening again .
And , in some respects , that there are n't many retailers to spend the money on adds to inflationary pressures as you have more money chasing fewer goods .
Will they , though ? The GFC hit and after stimulus , interest rates did n't do shit - I know because I fixed a few months earlier .
Now my bank is giving 3-year fixed terms of 2 .
and I 'm thinking " yeah that looks tasty , but remember last time you fixed and the RBA cut rates to try and stimulate an economy ? "  The effective lower bound is 0 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for holding cash with the central bank .
If they cut to 0 then banks will have to pay to keep money in their ESAs .
At this stage , when the banks are already losing revenue by freezing mortgages etc .
, I doubt the RBA will be looking to reduce their cashflows even more .
Back in November , Lowe basically took negative interest rates off the table .
Short end of the yield curve basically ca n't go lower , look to see the long end fall as the crisis extends ( i .

" The woman had initially been diagnosed with influenza that was complicated by an underlying health condition , and a positive Covid-19 test came through on Friday .
The 21 staff who treated her were self-isolating .
"  Two real concerns here are that it happened on the West Coast of the South Island , which is sparsely populated &amp; relatively isolated compared to most other parts of the country .
Also taking 21 staff out of what would be a fairly small hospital is gunna leave a hole that wo n't easily be plugged &amp; the next-nearest hospital is going to be a fair distance away by NZ standards .
On a brighter note there are now 56 people who 've recovered &amp; the 63 new cases is fewer than reported yesterday or on Friday .

Not to mention the lifelong impact on the health care professionals trapped in the tsunami People who advocate that can stay at home and intubate themselves .
If China is unable to return to some level of production without prolonged delay then , yes , all bets are off .
They 're the middle of the chain .
But production is restarting ( an internal imperative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced demand for their exports to the rest of the world now hit by the pandemic .
I do n't think Chinese production really has much to do with inflationary prospects in a service based economy like Australia .
As long as services are closed then real output will be falling in Australia .
As output contracts but demand for still available goods remains propped up by stimulus then inflationary pressures will mount ( a good example of this is home gym equipment .
With gyms closing consumers have substituted to personal equipment and retailers are now basically all sold out ) .
Of course , globalised supply chains mean that there is unlikely to be absolute shortages and we wo n't see as extreme price hikes as in the past but they will still mount .
Largely agree that falling commodity demand and supply lags will reduce inflationary pressures .
This may wane if commodity production also starts to be locked up .
I do n't think Chinese production really has much to do with inflationary prospects in a service based economy like Australia .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-to-medium-cost goods ( the cost is key ) which many service providers use or sell ( even just IT/telco gear , or those cheap home gyms you mentioned ) and costs go up .
I 'll leave it there , having said China should get a level of recovery - ( except to add there 's no easy analysis of the interdependent services sector in isolation from the wider Australian economy ) .

Despite what many people think , that medical workers will be " better off " in this crisis , many will not .
As a surgeon , most income comes from surgery , some from consulting .
Most of our surgery is going to be on hold , and fair enough .
Consulting will be significantly reduced ( why see lots of patients for surgery when you can not give them a realistic time frame to perform it ) AND the new Telehealth and Telephone consulting item numbers MUST be bulk billed .
Given we are being strongly urged to see as few face to face , consulting income is also way down .
No cash flow , nothing to pay people .
It 's going to be pretty tight even with me paying myself nothing .
If it goes the wrong way , I 'll have to loan money to the business , or borrow it .
My staff depend on their wages so they wo n't be laid off .
So I can not see why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate other businesses might be different and have laid off staff .
Better that staff stay " employed " and have continuity of other benefits like Super than being laid off .
I 've talked at length to my accountant .
Any which way , I wo n't be " better off " .
To declare before I begin : I truly have concern and empathy for all effected by this scourge and I also have nothing but respect and gratitude for all front line medical personnel dealing with this at the coal face  According to WHO Data about 3,500,000 people die every year from infectious disease borne from dirty water supply  Further , over 1,000,000 die every year from dysentery  So when we talk about shit ways to die - not being able to rely upon a glass of clear water ( something 99% of us have probably never had to contemplate ) is pretty awful  And ultimately , because these diseases are overwhelmingly 3rd world diseases in under developed / under resourced nations it just does n't get the attention it requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we tolerate it .
I dare say we do n't even know to have the opportunity of caring or demand we do something about it in pure humanitarian terms .
Our governments in developed society have accepted those numbers because they have n't been deemed important enough or a direct threat to our health and prosperity .
We 've just come to accept those numbers , that outcome of " that 's how it is " as we continue on doing what we do  Perhaps as we recover on the other side of this we might think about social equity in our own country - and - around the world in a different way  Why is this a problem ? My staff are being paid normal wages .
I 'm not drawing a wage myself for the next several months , most likely , at this stage .
Despite what many people think , that medical workers will be " better off " in this crisis , many will not .
As a surgeon , most income comes from surgery , some from consulting .
Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fair enough .

If it goes the wrong way , I 'll have to loan money to the business , or borrow it .
My staff depend on their wages so they wo n't be laid off .
So I can not see why the subsidy should go anywhere else , for my case .
I appreciate other businesses might be different and have laid off staff .
Better that staff stay " employed " and have continuity of other benefits like Super than being laid off .
I 've talked at length to my accountant .
Any which way , I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material difference ? The only difference i can see is if you want to keep your employees on 100% of their salaries and swallow the remaining 20% ( which would be nice ) .
Otherwise the money should ultimately end up with the employees regardless ? or am i missing something .
I suppose giving it direct to employees might avoid some scams from business owners .
