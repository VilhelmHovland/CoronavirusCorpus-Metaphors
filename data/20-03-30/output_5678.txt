Virus ends sugar export story for now  Cogencis , Wednesday , Mar 25  By Preeti Bhagat  NEW DELHI - The novel coronavirus has knocked down markets the world over , and sugar is no exception .
The benchmark raw sugar prices , which surged to a near-three-year high of 15 .
cents per pound on Feb 12 on Intercontinental Exchange Futures US , crashed to an 18-month low of 10 .
cents last week , as demand has eroded due to the spread of the virus and the fall in crude oil  TREND  prices that has made sugar more attractive for Brazil , the largest producer .
The 34% fall in sugar prices in a matter of weeks has made exports from India unviable , and brought fresh overseas deals to a standstill , dashing the industry 's hopes of exporting the highest quantity of sugar in a decade .
When global prices had rallied early February , there was a spike in the number of mills offering sugar for exports , an official with a multinational firm said .
At that time , the industry was hoping that exports would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range between 4 .
and 4 .
mln tn , an industry official said .
" Exporters are losing money .
Exports may not pick up like we saw in the last two months .
Last deals were signed at 24-25 rupees per kg , now mills will have to cut down on pricing , " a  Mumbai-based exporter said .
Prices have now fallen sharply .
Currently , ex-mill export price of raw sugar is 18 rupees per kg , and white sugar at 20 .
0-20 .
rupees .
To bridge the gap between the global and domestic prices , the Centre is offering a total subsidy of 10 .
rupees for every kg of sugar exported .
The government has set the export target of 2019-20 at 6 mln tn , and will provide assistance even if mills export half of their allotted quota .
But even with the subsidy , mills are reluctant to enter fresh deals , as the returns on exports are falling .
Over the last 15-20 days , old deals were being honoured .
No new deal for sugar exports has been signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower price , a senior official with a Mumbai-based sugar company said .
" Foreign parties are backing out now because they will have to pay more .
Incoming ships are being kept in quarantine at ports as a force majeure measure to check the virus spread .
Some ships are also stuck at Kandla port in Mumbai , " the official said .
There is also no relief in sight , as global prices are unlikely to recover anytime soon .
Global prices of sugar have fallen due to weak crude oil prices , growing risk aversion and on expectation of a decline in demand amid outbreak of coronavirus , JM Financial said in a report .
Consumption has taken a hit due to a sharp decline in people going out to eat and drink , and difficulties faced in operating normal supply chain in countries that have been badly affected by coronavirus such as China , Germany , France , Italy , South Korea , Poland , Spain , Austria , Netherlands and Lebanon , London-based trader Czarnikow said .
Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high on Tuesday , exports are unlikely to get a boost in near term due to the nationwide lockdown imposed for three weeks .
Prices are also unlikely to sustain at higher levels , as the sharp drop in global crude oil prices has made sugar more attractive for mills in Brazil compared to ethanol .
" Availability of sugar in the world will be much more once Brazil comes into the market , so global deficit will be wiped out .
Prices will remain around 12 cents ( per pound ) .
, " Managing Director of National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Prakash Naiknaware said .
Brazil is likely to increase sugar production to 34 mln tn in 2020-21 ( Apr-Mar ) , against 26 .
mln tn this season , a market source said .
The country is likely to export 29 mln tn sugar compared with 18 mln tn this year .
However , a group of industry officials are still hopeful of exports touching 5 mln tn as India still has time till Sep 30 to sell their sugar to the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian currency had slipped to a record-low of 76 .
a dollar on Tuesday .
It 's only a matter of a few months , and we will get to know how things unfold for exports .
The positive pick is that shipping out even 4 .
mln tn would bring some relief to the domestic industry as India is sitting on a record-high carryover stock of 14 .
mln tn .
The country 's annual consumption is 26 mln tn and the expected sugar production this season is 26 .
mln tn .
This would thus take the stocks-to-use to over 41 mln tn , which would much higher than what is required .
