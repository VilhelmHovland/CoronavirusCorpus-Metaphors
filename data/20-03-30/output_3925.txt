NO CAUSE FOR ALARM  Contacted , Lamu County Commissioner Irungu Macharia said the government took all the required measures before bringing in the workers to Kiunga .

The stand of the government is to temporarily quarantine the labourers at Kiunga Primary School as the contractor makes arrangements to ferry them to their construction site at Usalama camp .
In the meantime , the labourers will be going to work at the security border wall during the day and reporting back to Kiunga Primary in the evening .
There 's no cause for alarm , " said Mr Macharia .
