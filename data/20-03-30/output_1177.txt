Five schools in Perth and Kinross to re-open as hubs for children of key workers  Five school campuses in Perth and Kinross will reopen on Thursday morning for children of Category One key workers .
The activity centres will run throughout the week and over the weekend if needed .
They could even continue during the Easter holidays , which officially begin early next month .
Parents who have been allocated places were due to be contacted by 5pm on Wednesday .
The hubs will run at North Inch Campus , Kinross Primary School , the Community School of Auchterarder , Newhill Campus in Blairgowrie and Invergowrie Primary School .
Each centre will teach children in small groups , in order to reduce the risk of infection , and siblings will be kept together .
Several nurseries and registered childminders will also be providing spaces for youngsters over the coming weeks , but only those who have been offered spaces can attend .
Category One workers are described as frontline health and care workers directly tackling the coronavirus outbreak .
Executive director of education Sheena Devlin said : " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childcare we have been providing this week and will help ensure essential workers can continue their valuable work over the coming weeks .
" We appreciate this is a difficult time for our young people and their parents and carers and we would like to thank them all for their patience and understanding .
"  The Scottish Government ordered all schools to close at the end of last week , but teachers were told to return to class on Monday morning .
They were stood down on Sunday evening , while the council finalised its plan for activity centres .
Meanwhile , the local authority has decided against providing meals from school buildings .
Families entitled to free school meals will instead get the equivalent amount paid into their accounts .
The first payments will go out this week , and are expected to continue throughout the Easter break .
