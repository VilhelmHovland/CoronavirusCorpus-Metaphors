Leon Draisaitl is going to have to wait a while to find out if he 's going to win the Hart Trophy as NHL MVP , but when he does , he 'll join Sean Panganiban as the Dynamic Duo .
Not Connor McDavid .
Sean Panganiban .
The 33-year-old Edmonton Oilers fan has just been named the inaugural winner of the Upper Deck award as the NHL 's Ultimate MVP .
And as inspirational as Draisaitl 's season has been , I 'm not sure it can compare to that of the Ultimate MVP .
Panganiban overcame a serious virus infection that left him with major mobility issues but used the Oilers as major motivation to overcome .
He made his goal to see the Oilers play in last season 's Global Series game in Draisaitl 's hometown of Cologne , Germany and overcame all odds to be able to make the trip .
He has not only been named the NHL Ultimate MVP , he will receive the ' My MVP Hart Trophy ' and will have his own card in next year 's Upper Deck MVP Series hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .
He 'll also take an all expenses paid trip to the Stanley Cup finals whenever and wherever they 're eventually held .
And Panganiban will also receive all sorts of swag and other Upper Deck collectables as well .
It all started with the virus but it was his girlfriend Erin Mitchell that drew the assist .
" First of all you had to be nominated and somehow prove that you 're a super fan .
My girlfriend nominated me .
" As part of the nomination , she submitted the story of how my friends and I , when they released the news 10 months before they were to go , began making plans to go when I contacted a rare virus .
" It 's kind of ironic with what 's going on with the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic that 's going on these days , but I contacted Vestieular Neuritis , which is essentially an inflammation of the inner ear .
" It 's a 1-in-125,000 thing .
" I lost all my ability to walk , balance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those functions again .
I got virago , confusion and all that stuff .
I essentially had to retrain my brain to do all these things again .
" Once I started getting better , I created my own recovery video and I 've been able to help a lot of other people .
That 's the best part , I hope , with the winning of this contest .
It gives me the vehicle to show other people it 's possible to get your life back .
There 's a lot of people with this that are confined to their bed .
" The story my girl friend submitted detailed how , despite the difficulties , I worked my way up to being able to see the Oilers play in Germany .
" My girlfriend received a letter that I 'd been accepted to be one of the final five to be the Oilers representative in the contest involving the winners from 23 NHL teams participating in the contest .
Through a Twitter vote , I got to be the Oilers fan representative .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was way behind a Columbus fan in the first few days of voting but random Oilers fans just started a flood of voting inspired by Olympic goalie Shannon Szabados and country and western record artist Brett Kissel who took up my nomination cause or whatever you call it .
I was amazed they did that .
" It 's just a really cool feeling to be their first Ultimate MVP fan and get my own hockey card in next year 's collection .
"  If Upper Deck gives him his own supply of his card that will go in the packs , he 's definitely going to give one to Szabados and Kissel .
There 's more involved in winning this thing than overcoming the virus .
There 's being an over-the-top Oilers fan .
" My dad and I watched all those Edmonton-Dallas playoff series and read all the articles , so this is kind of neat , being interviewed and everything .
And my dad actually bought me boxes and boxes of Upper Deck hockey cards and we would sort these things together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sort of became a big hockey stats guy .
" Growing up , my favourite player was Ryan Smyth .
My dad and I used to go to all those Oilers autograph signings at West Edmonton Mall and I got an Oilers jersey signed by him and Mike Greer .
That 's when I started collecting Oilers memorabilia as well .
" I 've even won trips based on Oilers trivia as well at ' Oilers Game Day Live ' events .
"  Who better to ask about what the fans are going through right now with hockey withdrawal than the MVP Ultimate Oilers fan ?  " Not having hockey right now is definitely disappointing and I definitely wish there was hockey but at the same time , everything considered , there 's bigger things going on than hockey and sports in general .
But I sure ca n't wait to find out what this team is going to become when they can get back on the ice again .
It 's going to be a great time to be an Oilers fan .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-ever Upper Deck NHL Ultimate MVP .
