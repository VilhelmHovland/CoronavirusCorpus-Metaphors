WASHINGTON , March 30 , 2020 /Christian Newswire/ -- Christian organization deeply troubled that churches and faith organizations are being considered " non-essential " rather than " essential " in statewide orders during the coronavirus crisis .
Patrick Mahoney , Director of the Christian Defense Coalition , calls for all 50 states and the federal government to recognize the work of churches as " essential " to their local communities and be given the same status , protections and exemptions as other essential services .
It is difficult to imagine under any circumstances liquor and hardware stores being labeled " essential " while churches are considered " non-essential .
"  Churches , their staff and ministry should be considered in the same light as other " essential " state business and held to the same standards and guidelines as they are .
During this national health crisis , it is critical that religious freedom and civil liberties are protected and not crushed .
Faith communities believe it is possible during the coronavirus crisis to protect both the health of our citizens and also their religious freedoms and rights .
Protecting these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day across our nation , over 300,000 churches provide the most ' essential ' of community services .
They offer things such as ; spiritual , psychological and emotional support , shelter and food for the needy , financial support for single parent families , counseling services , child care , free legal services , vocational training and so much more .
" It is hard to believe any government official would consider liquor stores more ' essential ' than the critical work of America 's churches .
" Churches are not asking they be treated differently than any other ' essential ' community business or organization .
In fact , just the opposite is true .
They are simply asking to be held to the same social distancing guidelines , CDC recommendations and the best standards of medical care to protect our citizens from the coronavirus as these groups are .
" It would be tragic to see the second victims of this national health emergency be religious freedom and civil liberties .
