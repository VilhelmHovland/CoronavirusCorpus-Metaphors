Mercedes F1 partners with UCLH to develop much-needed breathing aids  The devices , which are being created with engineers at University College London , work by delivering oxygen to the lungs without the need for a ventilator  Spotted : With a worldwide shortage of ventilators hitting healthcare supplies everywhere , the need for new breathing devices has become paramount in the fight against the coronavirus .
The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) devices are already in use in some of the worst-affected areas , such as Italy and China , but now clinicians from University College London Hospital ( UCLH ) and Mercedes F1 have worked with engineers at UCL to develop the aids for the NHS .
The devices work by delivering oxygen to the lungs without the need for a ventilator , which should help to get coronavirus patients out of intensive care .
This is in response to the formation of the " VentilatorChallengeUK , " which includes companies such as Airbus , BAE Systems , Ford , Rolls-Royce and Siemens , who are promising to work together to invent more ventilators rapidly .
Forty CPAPs have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trial .
Mercedes-AMG-HPP is claiming that they could produce up to 1000 of the devices every day if the trials work .
The trials will take place quickly and the machines could be in production within a week .
The MHRA ( Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ) has given the use of the devices the go-ahead already .
Takeaway :  All over the world , we are hearing horror stories of coronavirus-related deaths that are accelerated due to ventilator shortages , which are forcing medical professionals to choose between patients as to who they will save .
As coronavorius attacks the lungs , ventilators are required to deliver oxygenated air to patients who are unable to breathe sufficiently on their own , while also removing carbon dioxide from their lungs .
At the moment , the UK has just 4,000 ventilators , and the CPAP is just one response from amongst many large manufacturers , who are promising to come up with solutions quickly .
