Shreveport Police Chief Ben Raymond held a press conference Monday afternoon to discuss Gov .
John Bel Edwards ' emergency proclamation and law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 .
" Unfortunately , some citizens and businesses have not properly followed the directives implemented by Governor Edwards and the Shreveport Police Department is being forced to take criminal enforcement actions , " Raymond said .

That summons is punishable by jail time and a fine .
" The business owner and management of the business or the organizer of an event , can expect to receive that summons , " Raymond said .
" Any person found to be in violation of that order is subject to be summonsed .
Those businesses or gatherings which are considered egregious and are knowingly in violation of the governor 's prohibition against ten or more gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning and can expect to be issued a misdemeanor summons upon the initial contact .
"  Raymond added that if a business continues to operate after having been notified that they are not in compliance with the order , the police department has the right to effectively close the business for any further operations during the period of the governor 's emergency declaration .
" The declaration is currently scheduled to end April 13 but could be extended , " Raymond said .
" Despite implementation of the new measures , I assure you , the police department is not looking for work .
Understand that the manpower that 's having to be used to enforce the stay-at-home order reduces the number of officers that can effectively respond to other emergencies and more severe criminal acts .
We are asking for everyone to heed the governor 's warning and not force our hand in having to take more drastic enforcement measures .

" If your business model does not meet that need of criticality , then you 're a non-essential business and we 're asking you to heed the advice of the governor , close operations temporarily so that we can flatten the curve within our state and decrease the number of people being effected by COVID-19 .
"  On the question of Shreveport police officers testing positive for COVID-19 , Raymond confirmed that several officers tested positive .
He added that not all of those officers are on the front line of operations .
