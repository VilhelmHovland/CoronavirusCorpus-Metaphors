' Do we take the fish out , or clean the water in the tank ? ' Diarmuid Lyng on COVID-19  Former Wexford hurler Diarmuid Lyng joined us on OTB AM this morning , as we discussed life in Ireland in these unprecedented times .
Lyng has been living a more self-sufficient life than many of us , living off land down in Kerry in recent times , and as such is in a unique position to discuss the current lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak .
" People have been forced to stay at home , forced to stop working , forced to observe types of life .
Ronan O'Gara was talking about using this time to have a look at what he 's doing and see if it 's something .
how acceptable or desirable it is to him .
" I think a lot of people are in the same situation .
I think it 's just about responding to life , life forced me down this road in a way , and I see it 's the most perfect road for me .
" This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronavirus will make us see how interconnected we are , and how much compassion exists in Irish society .
Lyng also added that the current global pandemic may force us to look closer at health in society overall more urgently .
" Obviously there are experts out there who know about disease , and health , and proteins , which is what COVID-19 is .
" When it comes to something like ash dieback and in the case of the ash tree , what we tend to do to beat the ash dieback disease is how do we treat it , how do we kill it , how do we poison it ? How do we win the war against it ?  " If our focus was less on the war on disease , and more on what is the health of our society , the health of our most vulnerable ? Are we prolonging life on drugs , or can we change the water in the tank ? "  18 February 2020 ; The definitive GAA sports series Laochra Gael returns to TG4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six Laochra with genuine star quality and reveals deeper , fresh and sometimes unexpected insights into the lives of these icons .

" I am in the middle of moving .
we 're making a few trips back west and setting up shop back there .
This all came from me by following deeper instincts .
" I spent a few years not really knowing where money was going to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or if I would have enough to provide for my family .
" The more that tension came up in me , I felt the more a block I was creating in going to find work and enjoy the work I did manage to find .
" I had to really sit with that for a while and allow that feeling and tension , to examine and bring it up to the surface and then let it fade away .
" Is it that I feel I 'm not good enough ? Or I 'm not capable ? Or my talents are useless ? Or whatever it is .
I had to really examine those feelings and let them fall away .
" I found that once I could do that .
once I cleared those things out , I felt like I was opening the way for more work to come in .
