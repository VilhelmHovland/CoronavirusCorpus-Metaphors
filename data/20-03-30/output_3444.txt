Self-employed creatives ' can not wait three months to be paid ' , government warned  The Creative Industries Federation has said interim relief for self-employed workers from the government must be made " immediately accessible " as " a matter of urgency " , ahead of .
The Creative Industries Federation has said interim relief for self-employed workers from the government must be made " immediately accessible " as " a matter of urgency " , ahead of the timeline of the beginning of June , as freelancers in creative industries struggle to pay their bills now .
The Society of Authors has also called for greater clarity over what the Chancellor 's scheme means for authors with portfolio careers .
Freelancers who participated in The Bookseller 's survey on the impact of the coronavirus outbreak said that work was clearly " drying up " .
One freelance publicist described cash-flow being " a major concern " , as several of their upcoming campaigns have been postponed indefinitely or shifted to autumn publication dates .
Another said : " I have almost nothing to do , as my customers have mostly closed .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed Rishi Sunak 's Thursday night statement ( 27th March ) that promised grants from the government will pay self-employed workers 80% of their average profits -- up to ? 2,500 a month -- for three months .
Starting in June , it covers " 95% of people who make most of their income from self-employment " , according to Sunak .
Caroline Norbury , c .
of the Creative Industries Federation , described the measures as " a victory for the creative industries " following its open letter to the Chancellor in the same week .
" The income of freelancers up and down the country is at immediate risk , threatening their ability to keep their businesses alive and cover basic living costs like rent , bills and food , " the letter had stressed .
However , Norbury said June was too long to wait and the relief must be " immediately accessible " .
" We now must ensure that this package is comprehensive and interim relief is immediately accessible , " she said .
" A third of the UK 's creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 15% .
Many of these workers had 100% of their work cancelled overnight due to the impact of Covid-19 .
" Although the measures announced today are welcome , it is vital that they are implemented as a matter of urgency , and certainly much quicker than the proposed timeline of June -- two months later than those on payroll .
Self-employed workers have outgoings and business expenses due immediately , which ? 94 .
a week in Universal Credit payments simply will not cover .
They can not wait three months to be paid .
It is vital that government implements an interim basic income for the self-employed , until the scheme is fully operational .
"  Norbury added " urgent clarity " is needed for creative workers " who may be most in need and fall between these schemes " , such as those who started self-employment after April 2019 , recent graduates , those paid in dividends , temporary workers and short-term contractors normally paid by PAYE .
" We must ensure that these packages are truly comprehensive and accessible to all , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society of Authors , likewise called for greater clarity , having already said authors are enduring " unmanageable losses -- some seeing thousands of pounds worth of lost contracts in a single day " .
She said , although the Chancellor 's income support for self-employed workers should " help many authors and other freelancers , if administered correctly " , the scheme needs to provide " much more detail " so people know where they stand and quickly .
" Much more detail is now needed so that we can better understand how the scheme will be administered and how our members stand to be affected , " said Solomon .
" As we all continue to adapt fast to a health crisis so full of uncertainty , we need to ensure there is as much certainty as possible in such a practical and tangible area as financial support .
" In particular , self-employed workers are being asked to wait to be contacted by HMRC , who will identify from past records whether they are eligible .
While some will be able to see immediately that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , many will not have that certainty .
And since no payments will be made until June , many will need to know what interim support will be available until then .
It is simply not clear what the scheme proposed means for authors with portfolio careers who earn a portion of their income from self-employment and the rest through PAYE and how the schemes for self-employed and employed people interrelate .
"  The Society of Authors is taking part in a conference call this afternoon ( Monday 30th March ) with government minister Paul Scully to discuss the measures to help self-employed workers during the coronavirus outbreak , as part of which it will be asking for clarity on these and other points .
In the meantime , SoA is continuing to receive and process the " many " applications to the Authors ' Emergency Fund that it has been receiving since it launched on 20th March .
Creative Scotland has also launched three funding programmes to provide further support to the country 's creative community during the outbreak , ackowledging many have been deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronavirus emergency .
There is : a " Bridging Bursaries Fund " of ? 2 million offering one-off bursary payments of between ? 500 and ? 2,500 to help support the immediate needs -- applications to the fund open today ( 30th March ) ; a " Screen Scotland Bridging Bursary " programme of ? 1 .
million providing one-off bursaries of ? 500 to ? 2,500 to freelance PAYE and self-employed screen sector workers -- applications open today ( 30th March ) ; and an " Open Funding : Sustaining Creative Development " fund of ? 7 .
to allow creative practitioners to continue to develop work for up to 12 months with a maximum award of ? 50,000 -- applications open on 3rd April .
" These are extremely challenging times that have brought serious personal and professional impacts to artists , creative practitioners and organisations and the work they do with communities across Scotland , " Iain Munro , chief executive of Creative Scotland said .
" At Creative Scotland our focus is to keep funding flowing .
These funds direct our resources to those in need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector and its work at this time .
When we all emerge from this crisis , it will undoubtedly be to a changed world , but one I hope where culture and creativity remain at the heart of the life of the nation .
"  Freelancers make up 33% of workers in the creative industries , according to the Creative Industries Federation and the SoA -- more than double the 15% of self-employed people in the economy .
