You do n't need to practice social distancing from Mother Nature : Enjoy Iowa 's parks -- and pass a tax to fund them  The Register 's editorial Published 6:00 a .
CT March 27 , 2020  Editorial : Iowa lawmakers should mark the 100th anniversary of our state parks by finally funding the conservation trust as voters intended  CONNECT  TWEET  LINKEDIN  COMMENT  EMAIL  MORE  " Our parks and preserves serve as living museums and windows into the past , informing us of what Iowa once was and how it worked .
They invite us to ask where we Iowans are going , and then they show us how we might get there .
" -- From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stewardship , 1920-2020 "  The outdoors have never been more appealing .
Iowans are advised to avoid crowds .
We are worried about the health of ourselves and loved ones .
We may feel isolated , lonely and trapped inside .
But no one needs to practice social distancing with Mother Nature .
So it is a welcome time for Iowa to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its state park system and the foresight of those who established these spaces .
It is also a good time to visit our parks .
That 's exactly what you 'll want to do if you get your hands on a copy of the new book " Iowa State Parks : A Century of Stewardship , 1920-2020 .
"  Available online and in local bookstores , the book is more than a guide to Iowa 's dozens of parks , recreation areas , preserves and forests .
It contains essays , history and photographs that capture the beauty of our green spaces and wildlife .
That history includes the 1917 State Park Act , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor the ability to appoint a State Board of Conservation .
The following year the board was granted authority to establish state parks .
The first two -- Backbone State Park and Lacey-Keosauqua State Park -- were dedicated in 1920 .
The board went on to acquire more land and secure funding as public demand for parks grew , fueled in part by the growth of automobile tourism .
Then came the Great Depression and a federal investment in public lands .
Work programs aided the construction of at least a thousand structures in Iowa parks , including lodges , campgrounds and artificial lakes .
In 1946 , 1 .
million people visited our state parks , a figure that rose to nearly 7 million in 1960 .
Iowa families that could not afford big vacation made free use of the parks .
Mom would pack a picnic lunch , and the family would spend the day at Pine Lake or Rock Creek .
Kids would swim , play tag and roam .
The parks were one of the best things Iowa ever did for families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recreation lands in this state now draw more than 15 million day-use visitors annually .
An additional 1 million stay overnight in campgrounds , cabins and other facilities .
But the intrepid enthusiasm about growing and preserving them has waned in the past several decades .
Some of the lakes kids once enjoyed are now too polluted for swimming .
Of the 71 dedicated state parks in Iowa , only two have been created in the past 20 years .
Elinor Bedell State Park on West Lake Okaboji was made possible by a generous donation of land in 2001 .
Banner Lakes at Summerset near Des Moines was a designated wildlife area until 2004 .
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is working with several partners to celebrate the centennial , and events , including a classic car tour of parks , are being planned .
The Iowa Legislature should mark the anniversary by finally raising the sales tax a penny and devoting three-eighths of each cent to fund a conservation and recreation trust fund overwhelmingly approved by voters in 2010 .
Year after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revenue to the outdoors .
Of the numerous states that have similarly used constitutional amendments , Iowa is the only one that has never deposited a penny .
When raising the tax , lawmakers also should ensure that the fraction of each cent " shall supplement and not replace " other conservation funding , exactly as current Iowa Code states and voters intended .
Iowa could generate an estimated $180 million new dollars to fund conservation , improve water quality , build trails and invest in our state parks .
We need these precious outdoor spaces more than ever .
Share your state park memories  Editorial board member Richard Doak mentioned to the board recently that the state parks figure into a surprising number of his childhood memories .
" This would be in the late 1940s and 1950s .
Our family could n't afford big vacations , but made frequent use of the state parks .
Mom would pack a picnic lunch ( I remember fried chicken ) and we would take off to spend the day at Pine Lake or Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock Creek ) was created near Newton so we did n't have to drive far .
We would swim in lakes , and it was all free , one of the best things Iowa ever did for its ordinary people like us .
"  We invite other Iowans to share their memories of Iowa 's parks .

March 22 , 2020  We 're all in this together amid coronavirus threat  Gov .
Kim Reynolds did the right thing Tuesday issuing an emergency proclamation closing numerous gathering places from dine-in restaurants to recreation facilities because of the coronavirus .
The directive in effect through March 31 undoubtedly will be extended .
The Centers for Disease Control recommended " social distancing " for at least eight weeks .
Iowa had 38 cases by midweek , including an 81-year-old Black Hawk County resident .
" These are unprecedented times , and the state of Iowa will do whatever is necessary to address this public health disaster , " Reynolds stated .
This plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu shows the need for social distancing .
The federal government was promoting Liberty Loan bonds at parades to cover World War I expenses .
Two were scheduled that September in Philadelphia and St .
Louis .
Philadelphia had no cases of civilians contracting the flu , but soldiers and sailors at nearby military installations were dying from it .
Instead of cancelling the Sept .
28 event , 200,000 watched the floats and John Philip Souza conducted marching bands .
More than 2,600 died within a week when city officials finally announced a lockdown .
The eventual toll was 12,000 .
In St .
Louis , which previously cancelled the parade , 700 died .
The U .
was late to this game , but is now ramping up .
President Donald Trump falsely compared COVID-19 to the flu and claimed it was " totally under control .
" His acolytes at Fox News called it a " Democratic hoax .
"  The CDC , though , stated COVID-19 was unlike the flu because it was so contagious .
Its worst-case scenario was 160 million and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 200,000 to 1 .
million .
The 21 million possibly needing hospitalization would overwhelm the nation 's 925,000 hospital beds .
Trump and Fox News changed their tunes last week after commentator Tucker Carlson personally implored the president to do something .
He complained on air , " None of our leaders helped us to take it seriously .
People you trust , people you probably voted for , have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem .
That 's their position .
But they 're wrong .
"  Valuable time was lost , compounded by the CDC botching initial tests .
South Korea took immediate action on testing and lowered the incidence of COVID-19 .
It tested 5,200 people per million , compared to 74 per million in the U .
by this week .
Italy did n't take it seriously and had 3,405 by Thursday , now surpassing China 's death toll of 3,245 .
Lombardy regional newspapers had printed two-to-three pages of obituaries daily , but were now running 13 .
Because protective gear was lacking , 12% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Testing finally ramped up with universities and public health agencies involved .
But Trump 's promise that everyone needing a test would get one was hampered by a shortage of testing compounds mainly available from France and Italy .
As the Courier reported , area residents with symptoms resembling COVID-19 were denied tests due to narrow criteria .
Iowa also had limited tests available .
By Thursday , the U .
exceeded 7,000 cases with 121 deaths , including three in a New Jersey family .
With one in five Americans losing their jobs , the economic toll was devastating .
Proving that it can be bipartisan during a crisis , Congress approved legislation to expand Medicaid , unemployment benefits and free COVID-19 testing .
Its compromise mandating paid sick leave and child care benefits covered those quarantined with COVID-19 and their caregivers , but exempted businesses with more than 500 or fewer than 50 employees , hospitals , nursing homes and the self-employed .
Steven King , R-Iowa , opposed it .
Congress also was debating a White House package surpassing $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with a $50 billion package for the four major airlines , each with profits exceeding $1 billion and money generated by the Trump tax cut used to buy shares from stockholders rather than improve employee pay or build reserves .
Democrats wanted relief aid to primarily benefit workers , as it should .
Mitt Romney proposed a $1,000 check to Americans .
Bernie Sanders , I-Vt .
, raised it to $2,000 , which the White House adopted .
Trump proactively enlisted U .
Navy hospital ships and released military hospital supplies .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposed using the Defence Production Act to have private companies produce more ventilators and masks , while hospitals needed costs defrayed to actually buy them for a specific event .
Residents can do their part by donating to agencies such as the Northeast Iowa Food Bank and Salvation Army , suddenly facing a more pronounced mission .
As the Courier reported , restaurants closed for dining were imploring residents to take out .
Help them out .
Their survival may depend on it .
We also like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gift certificate now to assist beleaguered merchants immediately .
We 're all in this together .

March 24 , 2020  Help celebrate National Ag Day  It recognizes the many contributions of American agriculture .
After an at times trying winter , spring is about to arrive .
As another growing season approaches , today has been set as National Ag Day by the Agriculture Council of America .
The council designates the week within which it falls as National Ag Week .
This important time to celebrate agriculture runs through Saturday .
One goal of Ag Day is to recognize the contribution agriculture makes in the lives of all of us .
The council sponsors and encourages programs during Ag Week that help Americans understand :  * How food and fiber products are produced ,  * The essential role of agriculture in the economy , and  * The role agriculture plays in providing safe , abundant and affordable products .
While it seems unlikely that many Iowans need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a good time to recall just how impressive American agriculture truly has become .
According to the ACA , each of this country 's farmers feeds more than 144 people -- up from 25 people just four decades ago .
That 's very good news for Americans , but also for hungry people everywhere .
This country produces far more agricultural products than Americans can consume .
The resulting exports help offset trade deficits in other areas of the economy .
In fact , agricultural products are this country 's No .
1 export .
One in three U .
farm acres is planted for export .
The agricultural sector in the United States has become incredibly efficient at producing a wide array of products .
Americans spend less on food than people in any other developed nation .
The ACA says we Americans spend only 2 per cent of our disposable income on meat and poultry .
As recently as 1970 , it was 4 .
per cent .
With the planet 's population projected to grow to 7 .
billion , people everywhere have good reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture .
