LAS VEGAS , NV - AUGUST 25 : Actor/comedian Chris D'Elia performs his stand-up comedy routine as part of the Aces of Comedy series at The Mirage Hotel ( via Getty Images )  One of the benefits of living in a vibrant metropolitan city like London is seeing live entertainment .
For many , the highlight of their week -- before the coronavirus crisis -- was enjoying standup comedians at pubs , open mic nights and comedy clubs across the capital .
As well as being a source of entertainment , live comedy also makes a big contribution to the UK economy , generating around ? 500m every year .
But of course , due to the social distancing measures implemented to combat the current crisis , live events and social gatherings have been totally cancelled .
For comedians who relied on standup to make a living , this is proving devastating .
Rich Wilson , host of the mental health podcast Insane in the Men Brain , has been performing standup comedy for 15 years .
He says that the circuit has been " completely wiped out " by Covid-19 .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other areas , like TV and writing , but for everyone who was solely reliant on live work , it has completely devastated the whole thing , " he says .
" That was my sole income , and it 's all gone .
For people who were solely reliant on standup comedy , it 's going to be a tough few months .
"  Because of the impact on his livelihood , Wilson says he is applying for other jobs , including stacking shelves and van driving .
He has also taken a pragmatic view on the crisis .
" In some respects , it has done us a favour .
It 'll take a while for things to rebuild and get to a version of what they used to be , but I think it 'll make us realise how lucky we all were , " he says philosophically .
There have been some attempts for the comedy sector to adapt .
For instance , The Stand , which runs a chain comedy clubs across the country , has put on two virtual gigs featuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been free to watch , asking viewers to donate rather than charging them , but most of the proceeds go towards keeping the company 's three venues going during the lockdown .
And while chancellor Rishi Sunak 's proposals last week should hopefully help self-employed comedians , offering them 80 per cent of their average profits , these payments wo n't start until June , leaving our entertainers in the lurch .
More immediate help for potentially-impoverished comedians is coming from NextUp Comedy , a Netflix-style streaming website focused on standup comedy .
The company recently launched a crowdfunding campaign , to raise money for comedians impacted by the shutdown .
" We set up the #hecklethevirus fundraiser because , as a platform that supports comedians in as many ways as possible , we know that the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent promotion of social distancing and cancellation of live events will have a huge impact across the whole industry , " says Chloe Richardson , spokesperson for NextUp Comedy .
" It 's killed the main revenue source of so many comedians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative effects of this as much as possible , with the help of those that love comedy as much as we do .
"  At the time of writing , the campaign has raised ? 81,870 from 528 supporters .
Around ? 10,000 has been distributed to over 40 comedians in urgent need of financial support .
" Our aim is to allocate ? 10,000 a week to as many people as possible , distributed to those comedians who have applied via our online form and answered a range of questions to assess the severity and urgency of every request , " explains Richardson .
" Our initial target is ? 100,000 but we have no idea , realistically , how long this is going to last .
Once we hit that first target , we will definitely aim to keep raising and issuing funds for as long as comedians are unable to perform at live events and therefore unable to make a living .
"  While we have all been affected by Covid-19 to some degree , it 's heart-warming to see initiatives like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific sectors .
More innovation and charitable ideas like this may be needed in the months ahead .
For now , let 's support those aiming to keep us laughing during these turbulent times .
