When the Olympic Games were postponed for the first time in their 124-year history , Great Britain rower Polly Swann took another step towards becoming a doctor .
It was a day of mixed emotions for Swann .
She took 13 years to complete her medical degree as she juggled that with rowing for Team GB .
Now , following Tuesday 's confirmation of the postponement , she faces an unprecedented dilemma : use her medical skills to help fight the coronavirus pandemic or continue her journey to her final Olympic Games .
Her plan , before the days of COVID-19 , was to enjoy the ultimate swan song to her rowing career at Tokyo before rechannelling her pursuits into medicine .
Opportunities to compete at an Olympics are fleeting for the 11,000 or so hopefuls around the world .
Swann , 31 , already knows how it feels to miss out -- she was forced to sit out her home games at London 2012 through injury .
A flurry of success followed , including becoming a 2013 world champion in the women 's pair alongside double-Olympic champion Helen Glover .
She went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Now she wants gold .
" For me , the Olympics is such a massive personal goal , " Swann says .
" It will definitely be my last Games as you only have the ability to go to the Olympics at a certain point in life .
I know medicine will always be there for me , but I feel that a global pandemic is much more than sport .
Medicine is my passion as well .
I feel torn .
"  Swann was planning to begin her medical career in August , just weeks after she would have been due home from Tokyo .
She is just one of the hundreds of British athletes who have ripped up their plans for this summer .
What does the postponement mean for Team GB 's athletes ?  The immediate impact for athletes is the drop in pressure to train , qualify and compete , all in the middle of a pandemic .
Callum Skinner , Rio 2016 cycling gold medallist and senior figure at athlete-led movement Global Athlete , was one of the most vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started calling for postponement , I did n't take that decision lightly , " Skinner told ESPN .
" I know athletes have been preparing to be at their absolute peak and that 's not something they can just push off and on .
But that 's why we pushed so hard to get clarity from the IOC .
" As much as home workouts are becoming fashionable , it 's not really a way in which to prepare for the Olympic Games .
It 's really difficult to try and prepare as best you can with all these compromises .
"  While postponing the Games does relieve athletes of some pressure , it also throws up a multitude of questions .
Skinner points out that many athletes train on a four to 10-year cycle , which has now been completely thrown out of sync .
New training plans have to be put in place , mindsets have to be recalibrated and the Olympics butterflies have to be dulled for a year .
Team GB canoeist Rebii Simon was training in Seville , Spain , two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK .
At that stage , her Olympic trials were still set to go ahead and while the disruption was unfortunate , she believed she could train adequately in the UK .
" It was quite stressful to train because we did n't know what was going to happen , " she told ESPN .
" People were guessing if they were going to cancel trials , but we were trying to train like they were n't going to cancel them .
"  However , the trials were quickly cancelled upon her return to the UK and Simon was left wondering what to do next .
She returned to Hungary , where she has been based for the last eight months .
She feels lucky as she can do much of her training from home , but she 's hoping to get into a training camp in Hungary where you 're permitted to enter if you 've tested negative for the coronavirus .
Team GB gymnast Dominick Cunningham says the postponement will be hard for a lot of athletes to take : " I 'm pretty strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told ESPN .
" They 'll be freaking out .
"  What dilemmas are GB athletes facing ?  Rio 2016 silver medalist Polly Swann must make a decision between pursuing her career in medicine or continuing her journey to her final Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2021 .
Naomi Baker/Getty Images  While Swann 's dilemma may not be replicated across the board , athletes are facing tough decisions on how to approach the next few months .
" There are athletes that have been planning retirement after 2020 ; there are athletes who are planning other careers .
It affects us all in very different ways .
We urge athletes to take stock and take a bit of time to process what is going on , have conversations with friends and family and with governing bodies so that they 're not rushing into a decision , " British Athletes Commission CEO Mahdi Choudhury told ESPN .
For a lot of athletes , the main dilemma is how to get their heads in shape with the hype of competing at an Olympics disappearing overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really have an actual plan right now , " Simon said .
" I think I just need a few days or a week to just get my head around things .
Keep training but just do the parts I love about this sport , rather than being like ' ok get loads of sessions done and train really , really hard ' .
" I guess it 's just like a long winter now .
I 'm trying to think of it like that and from September start again as if it was just another season .
"  For other athletes , the dilemma is how to train when their sport requires a specialist environment or equipment .
" There 's no way I can replicate a gymnastics setup at home , " Cunningham said .
" So , I 'm going to keep myself busy .
I 'm doing up my vehicles because I like my cars .
It gives me a bit of time to give my head space .
" It 's been crazy because my mind has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't stay mentally focused because by the time the Olympics comes around , I will be burnt out .
I 'm allowing myself to have a bit of down time now and ride the wave .
"  What does it mean for athletes ' funding ?  Many Olympic athletes sign commercial sponsorship deals , usually ranging between one to three years in length depending on how much promise they show in the future .
Some of these deals could be affected by the adverse financial climate caused by the coronavirus outbreak .
" It is not a great financial climate now and that will have a massive impact on commercial deals , " Choudhury said .
" A lot depends on what individual contracts say .
There are clauses in there that address the incompletion of the Games .
"  There is a lot to be ironed out , but athletes sponsored by smaller businesses could be at risk of losing those deals .
Skinner said : " I 've heard second hand from a couple of athletes who have had sponsorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're not selling anything , we 're looking at redundancies , thus we have to start cutting off sponsorships before we start cutting off our staff .
' It is totally reasonable but it does put athletes in a more precarious position .
"  How will they qualify ?  Dominick Cunningham said some athletes will be " freaking out " over the postponement of the Games .
David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile via Getty Images  Some sports kept their qualification processes going right up to the last minute .
Swann was at Olympic trials for the last two weeks but said it was nothing like she had experienced before .
" Usually it 's a really intense atmosphere , " Swann said .
" You would have a few more new faces around , more media around and some more people coming in and racing for the final trials .
We did n't have any of that .
It definitely felt very odd .
And then the atmosphere inside the training centre .
you had people 's Olympic hopes and dreams on the line which are very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening with the Olympics .
You could n't escape it .
"  However , scores of tournaments have been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak .
" If I was in a sport that had n't qualified that would be my most immediate concern .
How can I get my qualification sorted in the run up to Tokyo ? " Skinner said .
While the time frame has been lengthened , the Olympic organising bodies need to fit qualifiers into an already packed domestic and international schedule .
" It 's not just a question of shifting everything back by a year , " Choudhury said .
" It ca n't be done overnight .
The sporting calendar is already set , world championships and events have already been set .
It will impact qualification events as well .
"  The short answer is no one is exactly sure how the qualification process will play out .
With the IOC initially saying there was going to be a four-week consultation period on whether to postpone or not , Tuesday 's announcement came unexpectedly quickly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows when it will be safe to organise large gatherings again in the UK , it could be a couple of months before a path to qualifying is established .
What are the financial implications for Team GB ?  Tuesday 's announcement over the postponement of the games triggered confusion over Team GB 's funding model for the Tokyo Games in 2021 .
UK Sport is responsible for managing and distributing funds from the UK lottery to each British sporting governing body .
Funds are awarded in four-year cycles to coincide with the Games -- a problem now the Olympics are postponed for a year .
Their current level of funding will remain in place at least until their next financial cycle is due to begin on March 31 , 2021 -- just a few months prior to when the Tokyo Games will be likely held .
Decisions over funding and bridging the gap will take place over the next three weeks , a UK Sport spokesperson told ESPN .
The organisation initially had a meeting planned with the government 's Digital , Culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss funding for Paris 2024 .
However , that meeting has been postponed due to the coronavirus and any rescheduled meeting would now have to look first at Tokyo 2020 .
Athletes will now scrub the original start date of the Olympics from their calendars and pencil in next summer .
For Swann , she is undecided on her immediate path .
" I have n't made any firm plans yet but I need to find out if they calling for junior doctors to start earlier and also what the process would be .
I 'm sure there is only so much time out I can take .
"  Swann is determined to keep fit while at her parents ' house in Edinburgh .
She is using an exercise bike and rowing machine loaned to her by the local university .
Both have been placed in her makeshift gym in the shed at the bottom of the garden , with a couple of the dumbbells that were divided up among the rowing team after their training base in Caversham was shut down on Saturday .
For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of uncertainties .
But when all the athletes eventually descend on Tokyo in 2021 , it will be a momentous occasion worth the wait .
