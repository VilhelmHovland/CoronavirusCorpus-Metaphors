The world is still navigating the impact of the coronavirus crisis and with no firm date yet when soccer might return , we asked Nick Miller to round up the little things we miss about every team in the English Premier League .
Even Liverpool .
We can easily get drowned in the complexities of football , whether that 's the intricacies of tactics , finance , increasingly tricky moral questions and so on .
Sometimes it 's good to just boil everything down to the basics , like kicking a ball really , really hard .
Lacazette is sensational at that , putting his foot through that leather to send it flying forward at a fierce pace .
There are better footballers in the Premier League , but there are n't too many more enjoyable to watch than Grealish , a lithe joy of a playmaker who is technically brilliant but sometimes plays as if he 's doing it for free , just for the pleasure of being a footballer .
Hair flapping , socks down .
man , we 'd like to see him again soon .
One of the consequences of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League bookings record was curtailed .
The feisty Colombia international was on nine yellow cards when the season stopped , with the top mark of 14 ( held by eight different players ) tantalisingly in his sights .
As well as being a good player , Lerma provides entertainment by allowing us to wonder exactly how and why he 's going to get booked next .
Brighton : " Sussex by the Sea "  At some point over the past few years , there was a meeting that concluded teams ' entrances onto the pitch needed to be jazzed up .
Podia spouting fire , elaborate light shows , portentous poetry , doomy and dramatic music : it often feels a bit much and a sign that football takes itself too seriously .
Before matches at Brighton however , they play an old brass band song called " Sussex by the Sea , " apparently written in 1907 and adopted as the county 's unofficial anthem .
It 's such an anachronism in these overwrought times and lifts the soul every time you hear it .
ESPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be truly underrated in the Premier League these days , but the player that seems to be closest to that description is McNeil , one of the most aesthetically pleasing regulars in the division .
The balls he can whip over with his left foot , from wide , deep , close or far , are beautiful to watch , and by the looks of things , a genuine pain to defend against .
He 's a different kind of winger to many these days , but that somehow makes him even more special .
If all had gone to plan , Giroud would have left Chelsea in January .
He wanted to go , and the club did n't want him to stay ; all that held up a move was Inter 's procrastination .
In the end , it all fell through , and he was staring down the barrel of another six months of inactivity .
But Tammy Abraham 's injury and Michy Batshuayi 's incompetence opened the door , and Giroud was able to show the world what a terrific player he remains .
He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual " Giroudness , " a pleasant bonus from a player we might not appreciate until he 's gone .
Underappreciated Olivier Giroud was just starting to hit top form when the Premier League was suspended due to the coronavirus .
Photo by James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images  Crystal Palace : Roy Hodgson 's ludicrous consistency  There is n't much you can rely on in this world , but Hodgson 's win percentage is one thing : with Blackburn it was 35% , Fulham 34% , Liverpool 35% , West Brom 36% and overall with Crystal Palace it has been 36% .
This season ? A tidy 34% .
We need stability more than ever at the moment and with " Uncle Roy , " that 's exactly what you 'll get .
It was mentioned a lot after the Portuguese midfielder returned from his grotesque injury a few weeks ago , but it remains absurd that someone could recover from having his ankle at a right-angle in just 112 days .
Gomes seems like a thoroughly likeable guy too , so to watch him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys in Everton 's midfield -- was a joy .
It 's not often you see right-backs dictate the pace of games : some are entertaining , some are skilful , some are brilliant in attack and some are sensational at crossing , but very few can operate as playmaker from the right side of defence .
Pereira does , though , and he has been one of the key reasons for Leicester 's success this season .
You could pick any number of things we 're missing about Liverpool , given how they were charging toward a sensational title win and are in the conversation for the best Premier League team of all time .
But Wijnaldum 's great big lovely smile is just the sort of thing that would cheer us up when it 's needed most .
Manchester City : The Champions League  We 're obviously missing the Champions League in general , but if you believe in anything like fate or destiny , it was inevitable that Manchester City were going to win the thing this season .
Having been banned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , there would have been some sort of poetic irony in them lifting the trophy in May .
And then , quite possibly , all turning around and raising their collective middle fingers to the watching UEFA suits .
play  1:49  Should the Premier League season be voided ?  Julien Laurens discusses Rio Ferdinand 's opinion that the current Premier League should be voided .
He was a panic buy , and if he goes on to score a hat trick in every game he 'll still be a panic buy , but the idea of Ighalo , plucked from footballing obscurity in China to play for the club he supported as a boy , was genuinely heartwarming .
He was delighted just to put on the shirt , and after a couple of Europa League goals , we were looking forward to seeing how wide his smile would 've been if he 'd notched in the Premier League .
Do we really need to explain why ? The ultimate in chaotically entertaining footballers , Saint-Maximin most certainly falls into the category of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do next , so we certainly do n't know .
" And while that might be frustrating if you 're his teammate , it 's brilliant for neutral observers looking for some entertainment .
Admittedly , this is a little vague , but we just miss the idea of Norwich City .
They 're bottom of the Premier League , but do n't appear massively sad about it .
In fact , they seem pretty happy to be in the top flight in the nicest way possible , and they continue to play lovely football with youngsters like Todd Cantwell and Max Aarons flourishing .
There 's an innocence to Norwich that is quite appealing , almost lacking the cynicism that runs through the rest of the division .
Teemu Pukki and co are going down , but they realise it 's not the end of the world .
Sheffield United : David McGoldrick 's hunt for a goal  He was just returning to the first team after a spell out with injury , which meant McGoldrick 's solemn hunt for a goal this season for Sheffield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of their squad and one of their best players this season , McGoldrick had yet to score in the Premier League when the season was stopped , but he was still trying .
Boy , was he trying .
play  1:39  Aubameyang and Arsenal have ' so much at stake ' in summer window  Julien Laurens details why this summer is so important for Arsenal and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang .
Southampton : James Ward-Prowse 's free-kicks  It 's a bit tricky to work out exactly how good Ward-Prowse is : underappreciated creator or at a bottom-half team for a reason ? One thing that is unambiguously impressive about the Southampton midfielder are his free kicks : Only Matt Le Tissier has more goals from dead balls for the Saints in the Premier League , and it 's always a moment that raises the spirit when he lines one up .
You just think " something might happen here , " and really , that 's all we need .
Tottenham Hotspur : Jose Mourinho  Oh how we miss the Special One .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season was over ( which has come chillingly close to coming true ) , his constant complaining , his insistence that he ca n't play normal football with a team full of internationals .
Mercy me .
This really is serious .
Please come back , football , so we can cast out these demon thoughts .
Watford : Nigel Pearson 's stare  There have been a few reasons credited for Watford 's revival under Pearson , from him simplifying their game to , according to Troy Deeney , treating the players " like men , " but surely one of the reasons is his stare .
A terrifying , but also motivating stare .
If he looked at you the way he does , eyes burrowing into your soul and searching out any weakness you might have , would n't you start winning some games too ?  David Moyes was ( perhaps rightly ) cautious of throwing Bowen into the West Ham first team after his move from Hull on deadline day , but when he did start a game , he made an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat Southampton 3-1 .
He 's a terrific talent , and it 's a shame we have n't been able to see him develop more .
We miss Traore on any days he 's not playing football .
So when he 's potentially not playing football for months .
oh lord , we pine heavily .
The pace , the increasing technical awareness , the thighs , the absolute insistence that he does n't lift weights -- come back , Adama .
