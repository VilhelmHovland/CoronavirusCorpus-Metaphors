Corona : Queen or king ?  Gabriel Amalu  The social media has replaced the Lagos traffic .
Uncertain , winding and unending .
It has become the escape route from the drudgery associated with the ravenous attack of the coronavirus pandemic .
In one WhatsApp message we are told that Nostradamus predicted corona as a queen , which shall wreak havoc on the world , in the year of the double , 2020 .
Somehow , it is fashionable to attribute mysterious happenings to the 16th century French astrologer and seer , who made several predictions that came to pass .
Corona has also been likened to a king .
But whether a queen or a king , this unwanted visitor is a wreaker , and should go away .
It has turned the world upside down , and the centre can no longer hold .
Some have attributed the virus to God 's way of showing his supremacy over man .
The argument being that because of the great achievements in science and technology , man had begun to count himself equal to God .
So , God decided to show superiority , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this argument is spaciously speculative , there is no history of a similar traducer that has at the same time maligned the entire world as COVID 19 .
Even the earlier plagues did n't have this much impact .
So , in the past week , from New York to Paris , from Berlin to London , from New Delhi to Beijing , from Pretoria to Lagos , from Oslo to Tokyo , it has been eerie silence all over .
On COVID 19 , there is no dichotomy , between the east and west , between third world and first world , between the rich and the poor .
Indeed , the great stock that advanced countries had made of conquering the outer space has not been of any help , so far .
Before now , it was believed that should the earth become uninhabitable , the advanced countries of the world could abandon the earth for the laggard ones , and move their people to another planet .
Maybe such a drastic move lies in the future , even as the fearless virus has hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favour .
Of note , the twitter loving Donald Trump of the United States of America , now prattles endlessly as the unwanted visitor has confounded and unsettled his dear country .
This unwanted visitor , which he can not intimidate with his tweets , or technology guided missiles is rampaging his beloved cities .
In another video , the protagonist claimed that it was a war waged by mammon , against humans .
The mammon is the god of money or wealth .
He likened the economic meltdown across the world as a greater pandemic than the corona virus .
Of course , the world economic order is in turmoil , with a relation saying the impact is so huge that the entire pension savings of many Americans have been wiped out .
Officially the world has gone into economic recession according to some sources .
Nigeria which suffered recession few years ago , is set to return to those challenging time , more so as the price of crude oil continues to plummet from the attacks of COVID 19 , and the price war between Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife was videoed singing and praising COVID 19 , for forcing her husband to stay at home .
She said that all the lies and tales by moonlight which men peddle to get out of the house are no more tenable , and she thanked the virus for all that .
Those husbands who spend the family fortune on gambling on the English Premier League and other hot spots have also been restricted by the closure of non-essential service stores .
Some children too are not left out in the grand opportunity to enjoy their parents , thanks to COVID 19 pandemic .
Before most parents were forced to stay at home ; in many homes , both fathers and mothers leave the house very early in the morning and return home very late , while the children are left at the mercy of the nannies and house girls .
But all that have changed , with most parents forced to stay at home , whether out of fear of the virus or the order of government to stay at home .
Mothers who have not neared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , have all returned to their old beats .
Fathers too are helping with their children 's school assignments , while some have returned to helping with preparing the family meals .
So , with the sit at home order , the social media is awash with stories of how COVID 19 pandemic has engineered great family reunions , amidst the fear and trepidation , resulting from the virulent attacks of the virus .
In their innocence , some children would wish the cause of the enduring love from mummy and daddy lasts much longer .
While the children hope , scientists are frantically working hard to find the cure for this invincible evil that has befallen the world .
Unfortunately , like the conventional armies confronted by terrorist organisations , the scientists are stupefied by this asymmetrical enemy whose ways and means are different from what they are used to .
Okey Bakassi , in one video asked what those who are owing their landlords would do with the sit at home order .
As for social distancing , he wondered how those who are 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Same for those who must use the same bathroom and toilet .
One concerned Nigerian interviewed on one of the television programmes asked how hungry Nigerians can stay at home when hunger is knocking on the doors of their tummy .
Another challenged group are those trapped at state borders , who can not return to where they live after visiting a neighbouring state .
The joke is also on the wealthy , especially those in the corridors of power .
Some erroneously think the disease is attacking mainly the rich and powerful .
While at a newspaper stand , one angry Nigeria asked rhetorically whether any poor man has been infected by the disease , and answering himself , he mentioned the famous Nigerians that have been infected .
While such permutation is clearly fallacious , there is also the story in the social media that the National Centre for Disease Control , only caters for the rich and politically connected .
The author of the message claimed that after several efforts to get tested , he came to the conclusion that those infected are grossly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment for the privileged elite who neglected the medical infrastructure in the country .
Last Sunday , President Muhammadu Buhari finally spoke , ending weeks of speculation about his wellbeing , and that of his kitchen cabinet .
He reinforced the need for hand washing , social distancing and staying in our homes .
