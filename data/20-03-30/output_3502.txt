" Currently , what 's most required of us is to just stay put .
The traveling that we 're able to do is explore the often neglected magazines and travel books that adorn our bookshelves .
To get online and seek out the wisdom and suggestions of travel writers and other online platforms that will help us stoke the travel wanderlust , " he says .
With so many people staying at home , Jared says this is the perfect time to use social media to share travel experiences .
" It 's also good to remember that it 's not only us travel writers who have stories to tell .
We can all use our social media platforms for talking about the exciting places we have been .
While in isolation they may be out of reach for us , now more than ever we need to be reminded of the phenomenal beauty that exists around us , " he says .
Although he says the tourism industry has been ' disastrously ' hit , he believes that it will recover .
" The tourism industry is , in my opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wholehearted believe that it will recover .
It 's been touted that in the same way it has been one of the first to be affected , it may also be one of the first to recover , " he says .
" On the domestic scene , South Africans are no strangers to challenge , and time and time again the resourcefulness and resilience of our people have shown that we will prevail .
"  Jared says moving forward , even after the pandemic has been dealt with , people should continue taking the necessary precautions to ensure they stay safe and healthy .
" When the tourism industry recovers and we start travelling again , I suggest start cautiously by searching out destinations that do offer seclusion and forms of isolation , and since we now know what good personal hygiene looks like , let 's continue to practice it , " he concludes .
