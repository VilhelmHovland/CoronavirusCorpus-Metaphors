The New Zealand Taxpayers ' Union is joining calls for the Government to extend submission deadlines for Select Committees during the immediate fallout of the COVID-19 crisis .
New Zealand Taxpayers ' Union spokesman Louis Houlbrooke says , " Old political priorities need to be re-evaluated as New Zealanders scramble to deal with the implications of COVID-19 and the national lockdown .
"  " Four pieces of legislation - including vaping regulations and the Screen Industry Workers Bill - have submission deadlines this week .
"  " If an organisation or individual asks for an extension , the Speaker demands practical reasons they ca n't meet the deadline .
This makes a farce of democracy at a time when literally everyone is dealing with the effects of a global crisis .
"  " Individuals who would have otherwise made valuable submissions now find themselves with higher priorities .
And organisations with valuable research and community ties will struggle to put together their submissions while in lockdown - not everyone has an MP 's home office set-up .
"  " We 're backing calls to defer select committee submission and reporting deadlines by at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant to the COVID-19 response or otherwise clearly time-sensitive .
"  New Zealand 's grassroots campaign for lower taxes and less government waste  The New Zealand Taxpayers ' Union is an independent activist group , dedicated to being the voice for Kiwi taxpayers in the corridors of power .
It 's here to fight government waste and make sure New Zealanders get value for money from their tax dollar .

With a few honourable exceptions there has been a striking lack of focus on the ( insufficient ) number of ventilators in our intensive care units -- and an almost complete absence of overt urgency about acquiring and/or building more of them .
Ventilators are literally the difference between life and death for seriously ill Covid-19 patients .
Arguably , this shortfall is more vital than having enough PPE gowns , masks and gloves , important as those are .

" New Zealand is well-placed to respond to COVID-19 .
More&gt;&gt;  ALSO :  No doubt , last night 's defeat of abortion law reform provisions that would have created safe zones around abortion clinics will be portrayed , by some , as a victory for free speech .
It is n't .
It was a victory for bigotry and intimidation directed .
More&gt;&gt;  Lets step back in time now , to simpler days and to simple-minded solutions .
if National gets elected , landlords will once again be able to evict tenants at will , raise rents anytime they like , and ignore the need to install a healthy standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This promised ' bonfire of regulations ' is being done in the name of cutting red tape .
