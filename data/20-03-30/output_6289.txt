With all the money they made .
they built statues .
they built religious structures .
they built monuments .
they demolished and rebuilt buildings that were in perfect condition .
Some of it meandered its way to personal coffers naturally .
And as the money finished .
the pandemic arose and travelled across the globe annihilating many and overpowering one and all .
And once again they reached out to their ' reserves ' and into the coffers they looked , and the bare bottom gleamed back at them as the reserves had been dug into and splurged a long time back .
Healthcare , good governance , emergency support systems withered away without a blink .
When an emergency strikes , it certainly comes without a warning and stays around to cause enough hardships and destruction .
This is when a country needs a good fall-back plan of action .
a support system in place and funds .
Where are India 's resources ? We have never paid heed to a good healthcare plan - to medical aid/treatments and we have never bothered about our daily-wage workers .
our farmers .
our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bad times .
will survive .
But what about the millions in India who are below poverty level ?  There is no way to quite describe how debilitating it feels carrying a crushing load of stress and uncertainty in today 's times .
When we are all panicking it is nearly impossible to find workable or well considered solutions to our problems .
Feelings of stress are amongst the most frightening and powerful we experience along our path in these trying days .
We have all been thrown into a cauldron of confliction : unfair situations , poor communication , deals gone bad , lies told , people panicking , entitlement , loss of finances and other let downs .
The coronavirus pandemic has already started to hit our pocketbooks , with nearly 1 in 5 households experiencing a layoff or a reduction in work hours .
As people stay home , avoid crowds and cancel plans to avoid spreading the disease , it is rapidly causing a contraction in economic activity that is hurting a wide range of businesses .
Restaurants , bars , hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple effects of the drop in demand are expected to spread across virtually the entire economy .
As of today , layoffs and reduced hours have already hit us .
Lower-income workers are the most affected and even those who have n't lost work because of the coronavirus are often working differently because of the pandemic .
Many businesses have allowed or instructed people to work from home to reduce their exposure to the virus .
But many jobs , particularly blue-collar and service or retail jobs can not be done remotely .
Misplaced priorities are numbing us .
As panic over coronavirus amplifies , it is essential to keep our focus on human beings , not just on the economy .
Growing fear in the financial markets can distract us from remembering that the most important participants in this story are the victims of the virus itself .
With intensifying public health warnings over the past two weeks , it has become more and more tempting to view covid-19 through the lens of its financial effects .
Other aspects also do come to the surface ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to protect our children or grandparents .
Still , a disproportionate amount of our focus has been on the financial consequences of the virus -- because we as a society have given pride of place to economic reasoning .
To some extent , this makes sense .
A strong economy allows us to make a living .
We plan for the future in good times and use our financial resources to help each other when things are bad .
At its most moral , finance -- like money itself -- is conceived of as a means , not an end .
If money is meant to serve , it is meant precisely for moments such as this .
But today , we are not at our most moral .
Our priorities are spelled out differently .
Our misplaced priorities have translated into a troubling numbness to the reality of the current situation .
This is not a trivial matter .
We live in a time of vast resources , but those resources are responsive to what we notice and what we value .
This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Many of the greatest headlines of the age -- from gaping inequality to the breakdown of local communities , from racism to the climate crisis -- are all , in their own ways , stories of fixation on what the market demands over and above the people it is meant to serve .
In all of these cases , we tend to obscure significant moral decisions under the logic of economic necessity .
So , where exactly have we gone wrong ? It all points to greed .
This crisis will change things for all of us forever .
it is an awakening on how we have all gone wrong following the path that cared not for the planet but for personal gains .
not for healthcare but for religion .
not for our environment but for a concrete jungle .
not for our people but for political greed .
We chased the wrong heroes and idolised them , little realising that the real heroes wear invisible capes and work silently in the background .
Let us thank those individuals working tirelessly to save lives determinedly .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented existential threat to humanity .
We have been warned ! .
