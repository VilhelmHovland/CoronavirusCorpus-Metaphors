Cities are coming up with their own ingenious ways to disinfect those within their areas , along with those coming in .
Pasig , for instance has their drones , while Manila has deployed their fire trucks .
Quezon City on the other hand has , well , something else .
Granted , Quezon City has also been spraying disinfectant all over the place but their latest scheme has netizens either in stitches or even more frustrated at their local government .
Their solution ? Wash down and disinfect passing cars with a tabo .
Somebody had taken a video of a disinfecting station along the Quezon City Circle which sees one car stopped as city employees pour what looks like water on the vehicle .
When it was uploaded on social media , the varied reactions started pouring in .
Many criticized city mayor Joy Belmonte for implementing such schemes , while others felt sorry for those who had to wash down the cars because they were n't even given hoses to make the job a little bit easier .
Of course , there were those who ( sarcastically ) thanked the mayor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car can actually be a carrier of the virus as well .
Judging by the many reactions from netizens , the use of a tabo for disinfection probably is n't the best solution at the moment .
That aside , the government has been ramping up measures to try and flatten the curve .
However , there is currently a spike in reported cases as the test results come in .
The country now has well over 1,000 cases with that number expected to rise as the days go by .
Here 's to hoping more people will find more ways to fight the pandemic although one thing is for sure ; a tabo is out of the question now .
