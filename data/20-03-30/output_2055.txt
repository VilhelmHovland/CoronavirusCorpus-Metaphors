Social Sharing  7 potential lingering effects of COVID-19 on the economy : Don Pittis  As cases and deaths continue to rise and stocks retreat again , the economy is beset by record levels of uncertainty .
Don Pittis offers some considerations for how to choose among radically different outlooks .
Social Sharing  How to choose among economic forecasts in a time of record uncertainty  A pedestrian crosses a quiet downtown street as efforts continue to help slow the spread of coronavirus disease in Ottawa on March 23 .
( Blair Gable/Reuters )  For those of us who have kept a close eye on forecasts for the impact of COVID-19 on the global and Canadian economy , it is instructive to watch how much the outlook keeps changing .
Just over a month ago , many economists were anticipating the brunt of the disease would fall on Chinese commerce and that the global effect would be passed on due to a slowdown in that economy to5 .
per cent for all of 2020 , as one bank forecaster told me at the time .
Now that China 's problems have swept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasts seem laughably optimistic .
But even now , with rare exceptions , predictions for the economy range frommoderately gloomy to what may be wishful thinking .
The often-bleak David Rosenberg , who now runs his own independent research company , concedes U .
Federal Reserve 's massive cash injection may avert an economic depression .
For Rosenberg , that 's positively cheery .
The current index of economic policy uncertainty is like nothing we have ever seen before and we have to say that in a strong sense : not like 2008 , not like 9/11 , not like 1997/8 or 87 .

But uncertainty remains extraordinarily high and with such a range of views each of us must either pick among the forecasts or make up our own .
With that in mind , here are a few considerations to help you think about what the future may hold .

Highly leveraged businesses also face strain .
Business survival and recovery  Overall , recessions hurt people , but some economic theory says that capitalism actually needs periodic downturns to refresh itself throughcreative destruction .
Weak " zombie " businesses and sunset industries are finally killed off , clearing the way for healthier , younger or more efficient firms , making the whole economy stronger in the aftermath .
But the adjustment process is far from instant and can be painful for displaced workers .

Immigration  Travel restrictions have already stopped immigration and despite objections from refugee advocates , theborder has also closed to asylum seekers .
Restrictions of weeks or months will lead to a backlog of immigration cases and as the economy works through its recovery , governments may face pressure to limit the total flow of immigrants .

Housing  The steady growth of Canada 's population through immigration has been one of the things contributing to rising housing demand , a key sector of the economy .
Job losses and heavy debt loads mentioned above may lead to a slowdown , especially outside Canada 's hottest housing markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credible forecasts are impossible .
While some predictions , especially in Aberta , are gloomy , low interest rates and the thought that real estate is " the new gold " as The Globe and Mail recently suggested , could have a mitigating effect .
Energy  One reason for real estate fears in Alberta is that few parts of the Canadian economy have been as battered by the COVID-19 crisis as the oil and gas sector , where the cost of a barrel of oil sands crude has fallen below price for the Barrel of Monkeys childrens ' game .
Despite low gasoline prices partly caused by a global price war led by Saudi Arabia , sales have plummeted as people stay home .
Storage capacity has reached its limits meaning that even with federal and provincial help producers are shutting down .
For incurable optimists , one positive effect could be the redirection of investment toward diversification .

( Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that as low prices slow exploration and drive some producers out of business , oil prices will bounce back .
Of course , the question is when .
Spending on COVID-19 testing may yield surprising results as they did in places like Singapore .
It is also almost certain that as soon as they are released , commerce-starved shut-ins who do have money to shop will rush out to spend it on goods and services .
That one-time burst of spending could act in a similar way toKeynesian stimulation , kick-starting the economy and sending businesses that have survived to new heights .
In post-war kind of mood , perhaps we will experience post-war solidarity and goodwill based on shared experience to help solve our economic problems .
And while some doubt it , another lingering effect may be a baby boom from couples who were just looking for a way to keep busy .
