Covid-induced economic crisis and the world of work  Is the government response adequate ?  The RMG industry in Bangladesh employs about 4 million workers , whose wages will be supported by the government during the recession , but what about the millions of workers in other industries ? Photo : AFP  The coronavirus disease ( Covid-19 ) that started in China has now become a global health crisis which , in turn , has caused an economic crisis .
The global economy is now bracing for a deep recession .
In recent days , several financial institutions , including Morgan Stanley , Bank of America and Deutsche Bank , have forecast a global recession for 2020 .
And now the IMF Managing Director has also announced that the global economy is in recession .
Countries putting restrictions on travel and gatherings , airlines stopping flights , and people cancelling holidays are adversely affecting a number of service industries , such as hotels , travel , trade etc .
Restrictions on public life are also having a negative impact on internal trade , transport , restaurants and hence , on the demand for goods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is going to jeopardise jobs and create an adverse effect on the lives and livelihoods of people .
The economic downturn is affecting the world of work in various ways .
Layoffs resulting in unemployment is an immediate outcome of recession .
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) has projected that open unemployment may rise by 25 million ( in the " high " scenario ) .
Compared to the total global unemployment figure of 188 million in 2019 , this represents about 13 percent increase .
Even in the " mid " scenario of the ILO , unemployment is likely to increase by about 13 million .
Reports of massive layoffs and a sharp rise in jobless claims are already coming from countries like the USA .
One projection from the New York Times mentions that the rate of unemployment is set to rise from the current level of 3 .
percent to 6 percent by 2021 .
Apart from outright layoffs , labour markets could adjust in other ways , such as through short term work ( meaning , in effect , sharing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ) , wage reduction , etc .
When the virus hit China , it was thought that Bangladesh would face disruptions in its supply chain which , in turn , may affect production in different sectors .
However , the situation changed rapidly , and now the major markets of Bangladesh 's export goods , mainly the USA and European countries , are facing recession due to shrinking demand .
Take the case of ready-made garments ( RMG ) .
As country after country go into lockdown mode , demand deficiency has already hit the industry .
Likewise , the demand for other export items like jute and jute goods , and frozen foods , may also falter .
During this recession , demand deficiency will not remain confined to export oriented goods alone .
Measures taken to fight the health crisis are having a dampening effect on a wide range of economic activities including manufacturing , trade , transport , education , etc .
The shut-down that started in Bangladesh on March 26 has led to the closure of large swaths of economic activities throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be affected ? In the RMG industry , layoffs may not result immediately because the government has announced a package of assistance aimed at covering wage payments .
But the same can not be said about other sectors that are facing business closure and uncertainties .
In situations where layoffs are caused only ( or primarily ) by deficiency in external demand , the tendency usually is for the retrenched workers to crowd into informal sector trade and service type activities .
But in the present situation , with all economic activities coming to a standstill , where are they going to go ? There are not many alternatives .
In fact , those who are engaged in multitudes of micro and small enterprises in the informal sector are already facing difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods .
Both monetary and fiscal policies may be used to fight recession .
Central banks can provide guidance by lowering the indicative rate of interest and if necessary , by adopting quantitative easing .
This is done to make credit cheaper and more easily available so that businesses can tide over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be taken to provide stimulus to economic activities , to bail out targeted sectors/activities , and to strengthen social protection .
Both types of policies have already been announced by various countries including the UK , US , Germany , Switzerland etc .
What has the Government of Bangladesh done ? First , Bangladesh Bank announced a few " policy support " measures to protect exporters and importers .
What these would imply in reality remains to be seen .
Then , on March 25 , the Prime Minister announced a set of policies that include the following : ( i ) a package of Tk 5,000 crore for export-oriented industries , with a stipulation that the money would be used for providing salaries and wages of workers and employees ; ( ii ) provision of assistance through the " Return-to-Home " programme for homeless and landless people under which there would be homes free of cost , six month 's food and cash assistance ; ( iii ) continuation of the Vulnerable Group Development ( VGD ) , Vulnerable Group Feeding ( VGF ) and rice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation in Bhashan Char island to provide shelter for 100,000 people .
What do all of the above imply -- especially if one looks at the overall magnitude of the problem ? Let 's look at the Tk 5,000 crore package first .
It may be recalled that during the global economic crisis of 2008 , fiscal stimulus was provided to export-oriented manufacturing industries with the objective of preventing a major decline in the growth of exports .
The assumption perhaps was that if the flow of exports could be maintained , jobs in the industry would also be protected .
Whether the expectation was met is a question that was never fully evaluated .
This time also , the declared purpose of the package is to provide wages and salaries to the workers and employees of the factories that are in danger of having to close down .
Given the timing of the crisis ( especially , the advent of Ramadan and Eid ) , it may appear to be a good idea to provide support to the industries so that they can in turn , pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask why the four-decade old RMG industry needs assistance from the government every time there is a crisis .
Could n't the industry itself devise some built-in mechanism , for example , by creating a reserve fund with contributions from members during periods of growth which could be used at times of crisis to tide over the difficult period ?  It 's true that the RMG industry employs about four million workers and is also the major source of foreign exchange for the country .
But consider the following numbers .
Outside agriculture and the RMG industry , there are some 5 million more in various manufacturing industries and another 13 million workers in other sectors , of whom 85 percent are in the informal sector .
Many of the five million non-RMG industrial workers are also in micro and small size enterprises .
With all economic activities shut down for nearly two weeks ( as of now ) , workers engaged in them , and the self-employed who run many of them , must be struggling to make ends meet .
And who knows when economic activities will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extend support to them ?  Then look at the other measures mentioned , e .
, the return home programme and VGD , VGF , etc .
The former is basically an ongoing programme targeted at the homeless and destitute -- not an economic activity-based measure .
Can that be expected to accommodate the millions who had to leave the urban areas during this period of shutdown ? Also , there are many who could n't leave and are facing joblessness and precarious situations in the cities .
Likewise , VGF and VGD represent targeted programmes -- identified with cards given to the target households .
Can those programmes be expanded rapidly , with new beneficiaries included for support ? And finally , Bhashan Char , where 100,000 people can be accommodated .
Are we expecting that those who are facing a jobless and income-less situation in urban or semi-urban areas will apply for relocating to Bhashan Char ?  In the absence of real automatic stabilisers like unemployment benefits , measures are needed to provide income support to workers , the self-employed in small businesses and owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop a package of support to such workers and businesses .
The possibility of support in the form of food grains also needs to be considered .
It is important to formulate a comprehensive package of measures that could simultaneously provide stimulus to economic activities and protection to those who require it .
This task is urgent .
The fiscal cost of a stimulus package of the kind mentioned above can be met by a reallocation of the present budget and by tolerating a temporary increase in budget deficit .
The rest of the world is doing it that way .
