The move to working from home for many people has upended a lot of routines .
Lunch is one of them .
You 're probably not making a daily run to your favorite fast-casual , and your typical brown bag might not even make as much sense as it used to .
For freelancers and others used to putting in days at the home office , it 's more of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jennifer Tyler Lee , for advice .
Actually make time to eat .
" I think the schedule is your friend in your situation , " Lee says .
" If I do n't keep myself on the schedule , I will just eat pretzels all day .
" Whether it 's easier or more difficult to step away from your computer at home than at the office , do carve out time for lunch .
Lee focuses on writing in the morning and calls in the afternoon , which leaves a natural break in the middle to eat .
If you have kids at home , trying to keep some semblance of a schedule , at least when it comes to meals , is important , too .
Make-ahead is your friend .
As your schedule allows , devote time on the weekend or even a slower weekday to prep for lunch .
That way you can spend most of your break time eating and not cooking , especially if work time bleeds into lunch time .
" Stuff happens , " Lee says .
" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get an email that you have to respond to right away .
" That 's less of a crisis if you can move directly into eating .
Lee 's staple for make-ahead lunch is Mason jar salads , which she usually assembles on the weekend .
She also makes onigiri , or stuffed Japanese rice balls , as another grab-and-go option .
Lean on leftovers .
This goes hand-in-hand with make-ahead .
" My kids and my family in general need the leftovers to be reworked into something else , " Lee says .
So roast chicken will go into those salad jars or onigiri , or even on top of a very minimal pasta dish that can be quickly thrown together on a lunch break .
I 'm less picky about eating the same thing over and over again , and if you 're the same , consider a healthful soup as a good option .
Ditto egg or chicken salad to last you a few days .
Take care of yourself , but take it easy on yourself .
" I do n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , who prefers to leave her more involved meals for dinner .
" For me , it 's just about making sure I eat a lunch .
" She notes that is especially important right now when we 're counting on our immune systems to be strong .
Still , not every day will be a home run , whether you cobble together a bunch of snacks or just work through lunch .
" There are going to be exceptions , and that 's 100% fine , " she says .
" You want to do your best , but do n't beat yourself up if it 's not perfect .
