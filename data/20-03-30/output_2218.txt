humanitarian chief warned Monday that the 10 cases of COVID-19 and one death confirmed in Syria are just " the tip of the iceberg , " and judging from other countries " a devastating impact " can be expected on vulnerable communities .
Mark Lowcock told the U .
Security Council that " all efforts to prevent , detect and respond to COVID-19 are impeded by Syria 's fragile health system , " noting that only around half the country 's hospitals and primary health care facilities were fully functional at the end of 2019 .
He said efforts to prevent and combat the virus are also impeded by high levels of population movement , challenges to obtaining critical supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crowded camps for the displaced with " low levels of sanitation services .
"  With the Syrian conflict entering its 10th year this month , Lowcock said , over half the population has been forced to flee their homes , more than 11 million people in the country including nearly 5 million children need humanitarian assistance , almost eight million people do n't have reliable access to food , over 20 per cent more than last year , and 500,000 children are chronically malnourished .
He said humanitarian needs in Syria " remain enormous , " with data showing clear evidence of deteriorating conditions since December , including increased rates of stunting -- " a consequence of child malnutrition , from which it is rarely possible fully to recover .
" In the last rebel-held stronghold in northwest Syria , he said , almost 3 out of 10 displaced children under the age of five are stunted .
special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen told the council that " after terrible violence , an uneasy calm prevails on the ground -- and now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  He echoed U .
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ' call for an immediate global cease-fire in all conflicts to tackle the coronavirus , warning that " Syria is at high risk of being unable to contain the pandemic .
"  In northwest Syria , he said , " there has been a significant decrease in violence , especially in aerial attacks and ground operations .
Sporadic incidents continue , involving all sides .
" And in the northeast , he expressed appreciation that arrangements between key parties including Russia , Turkey , the United States and Syrians , " also continue to broadly hold .

" But in both the northeast and northwest , there is a real risk of hostilities resuming , " Pedersen said in a video briefing to the council .
" If that happened , the pre-existing dangers to civilians would be multiplied by the pandemic and the virus would spread like wildfire , with devastating effects for the Syrian people -- humanitarian , societal and economic .
It could rebound across international borders .

Pedersen said the U .
is engaging concerned countries to put aside all hurdles and ensure humanitarian exemptions so critical items can be moved into Syria urgently to combat COVID-19 .
" I welcome the initial engagement by the United States with us in this regard , and stress the need for utmost urgency .
" he said ,  He gave no details but the U .
State Department said $16 .
million of nearly $274 million that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday in emergency health and humanitarian aid to 64 of the world 's most at-risk countries in response to the pandemic would go to Syria .
Ambassador Kelly Craft strongly supported a sustained cease-fire , " not another tactical pause that allows Syrian forces and their Russian and Iranian allies to rest before resuming their campaign of terror in the northwest .
