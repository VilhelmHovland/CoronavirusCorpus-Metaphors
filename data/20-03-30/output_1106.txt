Resilient bus timetable to support key worker travel  Bus operators in West Yorkshire will introduce new timetables from Monday to bring additional stability to the network and certainty for key workers who need to travel during the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
Through the West Yorkshire Bus Alliance , the West Yorkshire Combined Authority has worked with operators to agree changes to ensure reliable services are there for those that need them while reflecting changing patterns of demand as people follow the instruction to stay at home .
People are urged to check the details for the routes they use but across the network the changes will typically mean weekday services start and finish at their usual time but operate to Sunday frequencies .
Additional services will operate on routes and at times where demand has been higher to help passengers follow social distancing guidelines .
It has also been agreed that from Monday , Temple Green Park and Ride will be closed .
People wishing to use park-and-ride into Leeds can continue to use the Elland Road site .
