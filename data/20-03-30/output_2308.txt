RECYCLED LOVE : Even veterinarians feeling the impact of COVID-19  A veterinarian 's profession can be challenging during the best of times , but under current world conditions , their vocation has become both physically and emotionally punishing .
Safeguarding the health and welfare of your pets has always been their number one objective , but because of the pandemic , they must also protect the long-term health and well-being of their clinic staff .
The COVID-19 outbreak is uncharted territory for veterinarian clinics , forcing them to change their day-to-day operations .
Veterinarians and their teams are weary and exhausted .
Most clinics have introduced new procedures , such as a closed-door policy .
The office 's front doors are locked , barring entry to the public .
If you need to purchase pet food , have a prescription filled or any other miscellaneous item purchased , you must call the clinic in advance .
A member of the staff will meet you outside with your parcel and a debit machine for payment .
If you have an appointment for your cherished pet , clinics will follow the same procedure .
A veterinarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make notes about the health of your pet .
Once the records are composed , they will take your pet inside the clinic to meet with the veterinarian , and they may even use a clinic leash .
Throughout the appointment , the veterinarian will call or Skype with you to share updates of their diagnosis , concerns , and recommendations for your pet .
The new closed-door policy is tough on both veterinarians and staff , but as always , your pet is receiving first-class care .
The majority of pet owners feel their veterinarian and staff are equivalent to our health care workers , seeing them as an essential service .
Overall , most pet owners are sympathetic and thankful for the services of their clinic , especially in today 's challenging environment .
However , it has been upsetting to hear about some incidents of clients being disrespectful or downright insulting with these hardworking individuals .
The clinic staff and veterinarians should be respected , valued and praised during this difficult time .
Veterinarian clinics are very social by nature , with cheerful people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you settle in before your scheduled appointment .
The vet tech may take your pet 's temperature and prep the pet for their meeting with the vet .
Lastly , your dedicated veterinarian tends to your beloved pet .
It must be gut-wrenching for veterinarians to have to practice medicine under the current dire circumstances .
Hopefully , knowing it will not have to continue forever brings them some comfort and relief .
If you have a veterinarian clinic that you adore , please let them know they have your support and appreciation .
Restore the clinic 's faith in humanity , especially with the tremendous stress they are currently experiencing .
These professionals are doing everything possible to keep your pet healthy , even under these extraordinary conditions .
Please be kind to animals .
