Uncertainty will exacerbate economic impact of virus : Fed paper  2 Min Read  March 30 ( Reuters ) - The spike in uncertainty that has accompanied the spread of the coronavirus and efforts to contain it will likely contribute to a surge in U .
unemployment and a decline in inflation , researchers at the San Francisco Federal Reserve said on Monday .
In addition to causing sickness and death , the virus has weighed heavily on the economy as business activity is curtailed and people practice social distancing .
The economic effects have been exacerbated by uncertainty over the path of the virus , and how long the economy will be shut .
Historically , " periods of heightened uncertainty are followed by persistent increases in the unemployment rate and protracted declines in inflation , despite declines in interest rates , " San Francisco Fed research chief Sylvain Leduc and economist Zheng Liu said in the regional Fed bank 's latest Economic Letter .
" By raising uncertainty , the coronavirus affects the economy in a way similar to a decline in aggregate demand .
"  The Cboe Volatility Index , a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record closing high earlier this month and is still well above its normal levels .
That elevated uncertainty alone - due in part to the lack of clarity on how soon and how well the virus will be contained - could add 1 percentage point to the unemployment rate over the next 12 months , and subtract as much as 2 percentage points from inflation in the next six months , the researchers estimated .
The Fed had struggled to meet its 2% inflation target even when unemployment was near 50-year lows , persistently falling short of its goal .
The Fed 's move earlier this month to reduce interest rates to near zero is expected to help cushion the impact of uncertainty on economic activity .
But the virus is nonetheless expected to have a profound and protracted impact on economic activity , the researchers said .
