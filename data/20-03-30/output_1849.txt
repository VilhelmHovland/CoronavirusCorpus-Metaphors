The UK may have left it ' too late ' to impose a coronavirus lockdown and stop millions of people getting COVID-19  The UK needs to ' radically change direction ' and start doing far more tests for possible cases of the coronavirus , according to the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt .
Boris Johnson announced strict new lockdown measures on Monday , meaning people are only allowed to leave their homes to pick up essential supplies and exercise once a day .
But Hunt , speaking before the lockdown was announced , said the UK needed to introduce testing as well as new social distancing rules , warning that up to a million people could be infected by the end of next week and said the UK lockdown may be " too late .
"  He said : ' How can we possibly suppress the virus if we do not know where it is ? '  The UK government may have left it " too late " to impose its national coronavirus lockdown , with around one million people likely already infected by next week , the UK 's former health secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening announced a strict national lockdown , which means people are only allowed to leave their homes to buy essential supplies and to exercise once a day .
But Jeremy Hunt , who served as health secretary for six years until 2018 , told the House of Commons on Monday , shortly before the new measures were announced , that so-called " social distancing " measures alone would not be enough to contain the disease .
And in a stark warning , Hunt warned that it may be " too late " to prevent the UK following the same trajectory as Italy , which has recorded a death toll over over 6,000 to date , but he said the lockdown measures introduced by Boris Johnson shortly afterwards were the only ones which gave Britain " any chance at all of doing so .

" How can we possibly suppress the virus if we do not know where it is ? So far , we have had 281 deaths , tragically .
" According to the modellers , there is about one death per 1,000 cases , which means that we have just under 300,000 cases in this country .
" According to the same modellers , the number of cases is doubling every five days , which means that at the end of next week we will have about 1 million cases or more in this country .
Unless we radically change direction , we will not know where those 1 million cases are .

Announcing the new lockdown measures on Monday evening , Boris Johnson said people would for at least three weeks be allowed to leave their homes only for " very limited purposes , " which include shopping for essentials , collecting medicine , exercising once a day , and travelling to and from work where it was not possible to work at home .
