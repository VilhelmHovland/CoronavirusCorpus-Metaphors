Lockdown confusion as Labour MP visits Lord Kinnock for his birthday  LABOUR MP Stephen Kinnock has insisted he did not break lockdown rules after putting seats outside his parents ' home to sit on during a birthday visit .
He was sending greetings to his father , Lord Neil Kinnock , the former leader of the Labour Party , at his home in Tufnell Park .
His social media photos , however , stirred a debate over whether he should be visiting , given people were last week told to stay away from their elderly mothers on Mothering Sunday because of the spread of coronavirus .
Lord Kinnock turned 78 on Saturday and is at home with his wife , Baroness Glenys Kinnock , the former MEP who is 75 .
Over-70s have been told to take extra precautions .
His son visited with his wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt , a former prime minister of Denmark .
They described it as a " socially distanced " celebration because of the gap between the outdoor chairs and the doorstep .
South Wales Police , however , felt the fun breached the rules and tweeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's birthday is a lovely thing to do , however this is not essential travel .
We all have our part to play in this , we urge you to comply with government restrictions , they are in place to keep us all safe .
"  A host of social media users suggested that MPs did not think the same rules announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week applied to them .
" Mate , frankly you 're taking the piss out of the majority who comply with the rules , " said one , who said he was a retired police officer .
" And then to publicise it on social media just compounds matter .
You should be setting an example for others to follow .
Really surprised at your incredible arrogance .
"  But Mr Kinnock said he had not done anything to risk spreading the Covid-19 coronavirus .
" I felt that this was essential travel as I had to deliver some necessary supplies to my parents .
I stayed long enough to sing ' happy birthday ' to Dad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
