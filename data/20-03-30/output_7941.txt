15 San Bernardino County firefighters in quarantine after two test positive for coronavirus  The two positive tests were the first among emergency personnel in the county .
The firefighters work for the San Bernardino County Fire Protection District and the Montclair Fire Department .
" They 're still being medically monitored at home and are doing well , " said Battalion Chief Steve Tracy , spokesperson for the All Hazard Regional Incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among 18 firefighting agencies in the county after they announced a centralized effort last week to continue services throughout the length of the pandemic .
Tracy said the Incident Management Team worked with the county 's public health department to identify personnel who might have come in contact with the two firefighters who tested positive .
He could not provide specific numbers but said several of the 13 newly quarantined personnel had already been tested , while the remainder were waiting to see whether they became symptomatic .
" There 's nobody who is symptomatic , so that 's good .
When or how they contracted it we just do n't know .
Because of the incubation period , it 's very hard to track down where they would have contracted it from , " Tracy said .
About three weeks ago , the Incident Management Team developed standard operating procedures for dealing with the virus ' impending onslaught .
Those included having dispatchers ask callers if they were displaying any symptoms of the virus , requesting callers meet emergency personnel outside , instead of inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  San Bernardino County Fire Department logo ( Photo : San Bernardino County Fire )  The agencies are tracking how many calls they go on that could include interaction with coronavirus-positive residents to keep tabs on the amount of personal protective equipment , such as gowns and masks , that emergency responders have used .
" Currently , we have plenty of personal protective equipment in relationship to the number of calls we 're going on per day , but that could change daily , " he said .
Tracy also said there would be a certain point when " the 9-1-1 system starts getting inundated with COVID-type calls " and the county would begin strategically allocating resources to ensure they can all be handled .
He would not provide details about when the county would need to implement that plan .
But the number of confirmed cases would need to continue increasing to get close to that point .
