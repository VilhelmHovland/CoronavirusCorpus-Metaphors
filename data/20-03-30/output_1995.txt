FTSE 100 dividend stocks : is it game over for investors ?  FTSE 100 dividend stocks seemas shaky as I 've ever seen them .
Yes , the great financial crisis was bad .
But dividend cuts were largely confined to a narrow range of sectors .
I fear it 's different today .
We 've already seen payouts suspended across many businesses .
And I 'm sure there are more to come .
We 've seen a decade in which blue-chip companies distributed hundreds of billions in cash to shareholders .
The question now has to be : is it game over for investors in Footsie dividend stocks ?  Global stock markets may be reeling from the coronavirus , but you do n't have to face this down market alone .

It felt more indicative of above-average risk to dividend sustainability .
For one thing , the coverage of dividends by earnings was at historically weak levels .
For another , many companies had balance sheets loaded with debt .
As I wrote in early February : " In some cases , they 've upped their borrowings simply to buy back their own shares and/or support otherwise unaffordable levels of shareholder dividends .
"  The International Monetary Fund said something interesting last year about a possible economic slowdown half as severe as 2008-09 .
It said nearly 40% of total corporate debt in major economies would be owed by companies unable to cover their interest expenses with their earnings .
It 's scary to think such a large proportion of businesses were ill-prepared for even a modest economic slowdown .
Let alone for a rarer , but higher-impact risk , such as a pandemic .
In downturns , over-leverage threatens not only dividends , but also the very survival of companies .
FTSE 100 dividend stocks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has emerged over the last few weeks .
Financial guidance has been scrapped , available credit drawn-down , extreme cost-cutting implemented , and dividends suspended or reviewed .
The rash of such announcements has already included a fair number of popular FTSE 100 dividend stocks .
These include commercial property firm British Land , hotel group InterContinental , and broadcaster ITV .
Plus there 's retailer Kingfisher , housebuilder Persimmon , and pest control company Rentokil .
I expect many more Footsie firms to follow suit , because the world economy is being hammered by widespread lockdowns .
Furthermore , no one knows the timescale for recovery .
It could begin later this year .
Or we could be heading into a protracted recession , particularly in the event of a second wave of the epidemic .
Whatever happens , though , I think we should assume a rebasing of the FTSE 100 's aggregate dividend .
Coverage by aggregate earnings needs to be at a more robust level than it 's been in recent years .
I 'd also assume relatively low aggregate dividend growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies will be prioritising reducing debt and strengthening their balance sheets .
FTSE 100 dividend stocks : game over ?  The outlook is relatively poor in the near term .
However , I do n't think it 's by any means game over for investors in FTSE 100 dividend stocks .
I mentioned the index 's aggregate dividend .
Some companies are better placed than others to maintain a payout .
If suspended , some are better place to resume it at the same level when the time comes .
And among those that rebase , the level of reset will vary .
Right now , as they always should , buy-and-hold dividend investors may want to focus on companies with superior liquidity and balance sheets .
In other words , the financially stronger businesses in their industries .
And with the Covid-19 virus now beginning to spread beyond of China and Italy , it seems very likely that the bull market we 've enjoyed over the past decade could finally be coming to an end .
Against such a backdrop of market worry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic .
( After all , nobody likes to see the value of their portfolio fall significantly in such a short space of time .
