MyVoice : Views of our readers 31st March 2020  Hans News Service 30 March 2020 7:58 PM GMT  Highlights  MyVoice : Views of our readers 31st March 2020  No one knows when all this will end  It is alarming to read reports on the growing number coronavirus cases in the country .
One simple measure of the spread of the virus is the doubling rate , that is , the number of days it takes for cases to double in a particular area .
According to the latest figures available , up to March 25 , India 's doubling rate is less than four days , compared to seven days for the world as a whole .
In fact , between March 21 and 25 , the number of confirmed cases in India went up 2 .
times ( from 231 to 562 ) ; according to government statistics , this number is now over 1,000 .
Bear in mind that these are confirmed cases , and it is almost certain that the number of actual cases is significantly higher than the number confirmed .
This is why it seems fair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment .
Of the 193 countries that are member-States of the United Nations , 170 have confirmed Covid-19 cases ; among the 23 that have n't reported cases , about 10 probably have cases but either do n't have the testing facilities to confirm or are not telling .
In short , this is a pandemic which has different rates of growth in different parts of the globe , with patterns still difficult to discern , at least in terms of affected areas .
To put it bluntly , no one knows how the pandemic will spread and when it may come to an end : the most optimistic estimates put it at six to eight months for the world as whole , others stretch it out into the foreseeable future .
Whichever way one looks at it , this will be a protracted , bitter , exhausting , and potentially devastating struggle , and the sooner we start to take measures that are both sensible and practical , the better it will be for all of us .
Parvathy Reddy K , Hyderabad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked us to stay put at home , patiently , for three weeks .
We must all listen and comply .
It will not come as a surprise if our patience is further tested and the date advanced .
The US , the most powerful country on earth , is experiencing the truth of the virus only now after precautions were put in place .
Rough calculations picked from TV commentators ' dire warnings indicate June-end/July as the time of relief .
And what about the economic and social costs that every afflicted country has to bear inevitably ? The present indications are that economic activity may have to restart from low if not near-bottom levels when normalcy is restored .
Germany and Japan overcame obstacles to recovery and shone after their defeat in World War II .
Even the victorious Allies had to work hard to readjust to peacetime industries .
We , too , will overcome ! Modi came to power in 2014 on a promise of development .
He veered out in 2019 to his party 's majoritarian agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be wise of him to use his leadership and communication skills to lead us to work hard for " Sabka Vikas " , a concept to which he has paid only lip service till now .
In the time of the corona , every Indian , be he or she a Hindu or a Muslim or Christian or Sikh , is equally targeted by the virus .
No one was exempted on grounds of religious belief , or caste or economic status .
Modi should take note of this and take us all along .
His leadership in the time of the corona has been tested and applauded .
He can capitalise on the virus to sow unity in the country on the platform of a universal humanity that needs to be protected from some future viruses which can decimate each and every one of us , whether Hindu or Muslim .
