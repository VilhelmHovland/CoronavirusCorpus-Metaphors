The Treasure Coast could become as overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases as New York City , he said .
" If we do not do a good job , " Rob Lord told the Martin County Commission , " we will overwhelm the healthcare system , not only here but everywhere .
"  The warning came amid an emergency County Commission meeting , where some residents called for enacting a stay-at-home order , like some South Florida communities already have done , to slow the spread of the coronavirus .
Lord pointed to New York , the epicenter of the country 's coronavirus outbreak , as an example of what conditions could be seen here if people do not practice social distancing and good-hand washing techniques .
" I would beg our community to take this very , very seriously , " Lord said .

( Photo : PATRICK DOVE/TCPALM )  The hospital 's top executive laid out the current statistics of testing , offering his frustrations with a backlog of test results .
Since beginning drive-thru testing at Cleveland Clinic Martin Health North March 14 , the hospital has screened about 6,000 people ; tested 634 people from Martin County ; and received 236 results , resulting in 22 positive cases .
Of the 398 people awaiting results , Lord said , 22 are hospitalized at Cleveland Clinic Martin Health North and South hospitals , and can not leave until lab results are received .
Originally , Lord said , he was told results would take three to five days to get back from a private lab .
Result times have ballooned to over a week at times .
The hospital now is sending some tests to its headquarters in Cleveland to expedite results .
" We 're pulling every string we have at our disposal , " Lord said .
Cleveland Clinic -- with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- was slated to receive new testing kits , with the capability to test in-house .
At the last minute , though , they were rerouted to New York , Lord said .
He lamented how testing has rolled out across the country .
South Korea , he said , is a prime example of testing as many people as possible .
The test the United States ultimately decided to go with , different than the World Health Organization test , required equipment that the hospital did not have , delaying its ability to test and get results .
For now , Cleveland Clinic has enough personal protective equipment and ventilators , Lord said , but he warned what could happen .
