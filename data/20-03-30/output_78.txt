Youth Observer  What we know about coronavirus and children  There is much we do not know about COVID-19 , but the research we have suggests most children are relatively unharmed  The moment you become a parent , your children consume your every thought and worry - they are , of course , the most precious gift in your life .
Your natural instinct is to want to protect them in any way possible and if you could wrap them up in cotton wool to keep them safe , you would .
Children are always prone to catching infections and minor illnesses .
This is because their immune systems are fairly immature at birth and only develop fully over time .
Their resilience against infection develops and matures through engaging in set vaccination programmes - depending on which country you live in - but also through being exposed to a spectrum of common viruses and bacteria .
Most often , these illnesses cause fairly mild - albeit at times stressful - symptoms .
The good news is that most make a full recovery and are left with the bonus of enhanced immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot about , are enough to cause panic and anxiety when our children come down with them because we hate seeing our kids suffer .
Even though I 'm a doctor , who knows the facts and science well , as a mother , I still feel very stressed and anxious when my own child is poorly .
It is no wonder , then , that amid a global pandemic , where we are facing a fight against a virus that we know little about , parents may be feeling overwhelming fear and anxiety .
I am being inundated with questions and worries from patients about how COVID-19 will affect their children .
It is difficult to reassure them because we know so little about this virus and the situation is constantly evolving .
However , so far the research has consistently shown that children seem to be largely unharmed by COVID-19 .
A recent study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics looked at more than 2,000 children with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 which had been reported to the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 8 .
Of the 2,143 cases , 90 percent were either reported to have no symptoms or only mild ( fever , fatigue , muscle aches , cough , sore throat , runny nose , and sneezing ) to moderate ( with pneumonia , frequent fevers , variable cough and shortness of breath ) symptoms .
These children were reported to make a full recovery with no complications .
Children of all ages were shown to be susceptible to contracting the coronavirus , which is to be expected as with any infectious disease .
We learned that four percent of children showed no symptoms at all however there was a small number - 125 children , or six percent - who developed more serious symptoms .
In these cases , the infection progressed to compromise other organs of the body including the gastrointestinal system , the kidneys , the heart and lungs .
A small number ( 0 .
percent ) of these children required critical care support due to potential multi-organ and respiratory failure .
Sadly , there was one death among the sample - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , there is no information about any potential underlying health conditions in this case .
This is the largest study to date , so it gives us a good impression of the spread of the coronavirus in children .
However , with the rapid spread of this illness on such a global scale , we need more data as soon as possible to learn more .
We are continually updating our knowledge about this virus and how it will affect our children and about whether exposure to coronavirus will cause them any long-term complications .
So much is still unknown .
For now , however , the data shows that serious complications in those aged under 19 are rare .
Even if they show no symptoms , children are highly effective " super spreaders " of this virus mainly because of how they mobilise around society .
They are curious by nature , are highly sociable , touch everything and love physical contact .
This places the more vulnerable members of their families and communities at risk .
People over the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications because this group generally tends to be more frail or have other long-term health problems which make them more vulnerable .
This is the same for those who have compromised immune systems secondary to conditions such as cancer or those with other underlying medical problems such as lung disease , heart disease and diabetes .
A large proportion of this age group will be grandparents or relatives who are in contact with young children .
In the UK , pregnant women have now been placed in the high-risk category and , of course , many of these women , too , will have other children who could be bringing home the virus .
The issue is that many of those in the high-risk , vulnerable categories are also relatives or carers for the young so we must appreciate the need to implement measures such as social distancing , as challenging and as daunting as that may seem .
This combination could be deadly .
So what can you do to protect your kids as well as your elders ?  Ensure that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-protection .
Teach them how to meticulously wash their hands and avoid touching their faces .
As a mum , I fully appreciate this is not an easy ask but keep the reminders going .
Repetition is key .
Everybody should practise social distancing and avoid close contact with others , even those you think are well , because at this stage we simply do not know who has it and who does not .
It is especially important to keep children away from those who are unwell , have underlying medical problems , are on medications that are suppressing their immune systems and those who are over the age of 70 .
Children are transmitters through no fault of their own .
It is up to us , their carers and parents , to help limit the spread of the coronavirus as much as possible .
I appreciate how uncertain these times feel but we are being guided by world experts on a daily basis .
We must remain hopeful and relay this to our youngsters so we can continue to enjoy family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now .
