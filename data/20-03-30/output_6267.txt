Covid-19 : Is this the end of neo-liberalism ?  ?  The inability of private capital to serve the public interest stands exposed .
The state has recaptured lost ground as the key economic actor  Pandemics do n't need passports .
They travel at will and no one can stop their journey .
With globalisation , the reach of pandemics has become wider and wider .
History has many examples .
The Black Death , arguably the most calamitous pandemic in history with a fatality count of over 200 million , took years to spread across the globe .
The plague , which reached western Europe in 1347 , took nearly a year to reach nearby England .
Such was the case with most pandemics in the pre-globalisation days .
But when air travel became popular and with the advent of rapid globalisation of trade and culture , more people started criss-crossing the globe .
The International Civil Aviation Organization tells us that the aviation industry has seen dramatic growth over the past 20 years , with the number of passengers rising from 1 .
billion in 1998 to nearly four billion in 2017 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates the International Air Transport Association , some 8 .
billion people will travel by air .
End of globalisation ?  A joint estimate by the Brookings Institution and the United Nations says that as people continue to migrate to cities for economic opportunity , the middle class will expand and most of them will travel , particularly within the developing bloc of Brazil , Russia , India , and China ( BRIC ) .
This means the trend of people travelling across the globe is here to stay .
However , globalisation , as we know it today , has exposed people to dangers its proponents never warned , or even worried , about .
In his 1989 essay , The End of History ? , political thinker Francis Fukuyama famously predicted the triumph of liberalism , which became a catalyst for globalisation and the associated liberalisation of economy .
The fall of the Soviet Union , which many happily attributed to as the fall of the socialist order , and the downfall of states that leaned towards the left spectrum of ideologies , gave way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unstoppable .
This prompted policymakers across the globe to blindly embrace market-driven , private-capital oriented economic policies .
Income inequalities skyrocketed in most geographies , especially in the emerging markets and the least developed bloc .
In 2018 , a working paper by the OECD -- Inequalities in emerging economies : Informing the policy dialogue on inclusive growth -- observed that income inequality was generally higher in emerging economies than in the most unequal OECD countries , even though there was a general reduction in poverty rates .
But even this reduction is minuscule if compared with the pace with which wealth has been accumulated by private individuals .
In 2018 , the number of millionaires stood at more than 22 million , according to Boston Consulting Group , and the number is expected to reach 27 .
million by 2023 .
Advent of protectionism  The 2009 global financial meltdown , like the 1997 East Asian crisis before it , sowed seeds of doubt in the minds of those believed that capitalism and its globalisation were flawless .
The rise of inequality also translated into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-globalisation discourse in the US , targeted against China .
The context here , of course , is of China wiping out jobs and industry in the US with unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation .
This political wave is , however , Right-wing and authoritarian .
The arrival of Donald Trump and his ilk at power centres in critical geographies and their protectionist policies confirmed that globalisation was on life-support .
Just a few months ago , economist Joseph Stiglitz declared that the credibility of neo-liberalism 's faith in unfettered markets as the surest road to shared prosperity is on life-support these days .
His essay The End of Neo-liberalism and the Rebirth of History reads like a tongue-in-cheek reply to Fukuyama 's End of History .
Interestingly , Stiglitz 's views appeared in the same month China reported its first case of what would later be called the coronavirus .
It is even more interesting that the virus broke out in a country that is billed by many as the poster boy of reverse globalisation .
In 2017 , a paper called China 's Role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with some advanced economies turning inward , a successful reset of globalisation may depend on whether China throws its considerable weight behind a new approach " .
However , Covid-19 , which spread across the world from China , claiming over 20,000 lives ( so far ) and infecting nearly five lakh people , has initiated a rethink not only on globalisation but the very foundation of the neo-liberal order .
It has exposed the inability of capitalism in safeguarding public interests , especially general healthcare requirements in countries such as Italy , Spain and the US , where the coronavirus has killed thousands .
Reboot for businesses  The fear and panic triggered by the virus has wreaked havoc in global financial markets .
Financial Times says there is a potential warning signal of global recession .
The newspaper 's editorial is , interestingly , titled Coronavirus has put globalisation into reverse .
The spread of the epidemic amounts to an experiment in deglobalisation .
global public response towards the coronavirus pandemic reaffirms such concerns .
There is now general consensus among the liberal intelligentsia that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is the failure of private capital and privatised medical care in ensuring proper healthcare for the public at large .
Second , companies can not take comfort in the fact that poverty , unhygienic conditions or precarious health infrastructure in one remote country is none of their business .
A virus in China , thanks to an intricately globalised world , can hit plants and supply chains in next to no time ; so , it is in the best interest of corporates everywhere that the host country has basic healthcare facilities to test and tackle such diseases .
This , in fact , is the globalisation of responsibility , and not globalisation for the sake of profits alone .
The third factor is that socialist regimes are better positioned to respond to emergencies .
Their ability to channelise massive resources for fighting a pandemic is something capitalist regimes can not easily match .
The fourth and most crucial insight is that public problems require public solutions .
By default , neo-liberalism ( a crony capitalist state allowing unregulated private enterprise ) simply can not offer answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lies in ensuring a world order where resources are distributed in a much more egalitarian way and are controlled by the public .
Any demand for more state-control of resources and their equitable distribution by controlling the unbridled growth of private capital may still invite a cluster of frowns from the fans of neo-liberalism and capitalism .
But as we have been learning the hard way , we are not left with too many options .
Spain 's nationalised private hospitals are just one of the many starting points in this change .
