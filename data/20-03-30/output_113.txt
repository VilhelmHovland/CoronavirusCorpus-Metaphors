' Generations of Kiwis ' will pay for recovery  Generations of New Zealanders will be paying for the economic recovery caused by the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic , Finance Minister Grant Robertson says .
Robertson told Newstalk ZB 's Mike Hosking this morning the Government needed to take a long-term view - balancing what was needed now to help individuals and businesses , with how a diversified New Zealand economy would look in the future .
" Generations will be paying for it , that 's the truth .
The massive investment we are making and that other countries are making .
will take many years to deal with .
" That 's why we have to have a plan for what the economy looks like .
one that allows us to pay debt back , have taxes at a reasonable level and allows us to maintain living standards .
" We are all aware that in the short term we want to make sure people have money to put food on the table we want to make sure that businesses have a sense of continuity .
"  Robertson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its spies and pass on any proof of supermarkets price-gouging , or to report their neighbours for breaking the lockdown rules .
The number of coronavirus cases has reached almost 740,000 globally , with more than 35,000 deaths .
The United States and Europe are now the epicentre of the outbreak , which began in mainland China in late December .
In the US , President Donald Trump - siding with public health experts ' dire projections - defended his decision to extend restrictive social distancing guidelines through to the end of April , while bracing the nation for a coronavirus death toll that could reach 200,000 people .
The Government will today release the sets of modelling on the spread of Covid-19 that it has based many of its decisions on , including the decision to go into lockdown .
The first meeting of the new Pandemic Response committee , chaired by National Party leader Simon Bridges , will be held today .
That committee of 11 MPs will hear from Covid-19 response team head John Ombler and Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield first .

Tourism , international education wo n't be coming back for a while .
"  The Government was working on a package of initiatives , including infrastructure and other regional schemes , to roll out as soon as possible to help the economy recover .
Credit ratings agencies would be looking at all countries , not just New Zealand , and in that sense , we were in a relatively good position , Robertson said .
Net core Crown debt was at just under 20% of GDP , but this would significantly lift as a result of the initiatives caused by the virus economic impact .
" Other countries have higher debt in most cases than we do .
"  Robertson had seen predictions of unemployment growing to anywhere from the current 4% to anywhere between 8% and 30% .

He said the Government was working with Air New Zealand " every day " as the airline felt the full impacts of Covid-19 .
Airline chief executive Greg Foran revealed in an email to customers last night that annual revenue was set to fall from $6 billion to $500 million .
Up to a third of staff and 95% of its schedule are set to be cut , and Robertson urged the airline to use the Government 's wage subsidy scheme .
About 580,000 Kiwis are already on the scheme .
" Air New Zealand is in an incredibly difficult position .
we are working with them every day .
We want an airline that comes through this .
