Airbnb pledges $250 million for hosts to weather coronavirus-related cancellations  Airbnb on Monday pledged $250 million to help support hosts whose guests have canceled reservations due to the coronavirus outbreak .
In a blog post , Airbnb said its " extenuating circumstances policy " would apply for trips booked before March 14 and check-ins between March 14 and May 31 .
Guests will be able to cancel for full refunds , while Airbnb will pay hosts 25% of what they would have made on the canceled trip .
The company said stays booked after March 14 -- the date the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic -- will not fall under under the extenuating circumstances policy , and regular cancellation terms will apply .
For stays reserved after May 31 , the company asked hosts and guests to either cancel or re-affirm their reservations .
The COVID-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to Airbnb , with the Wall Street Journal reporting hundreds of millions of dollars lost this year , forcing the company to consider a capital raise or whether to alter its plan to go public via a direct offering .
