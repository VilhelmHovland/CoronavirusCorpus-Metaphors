Tony Holohan , chief medical officer , Department of Health , said : ' We are beginning to see encouraging signs in our efforts to flatten the curve .
However , we can not become complacent as we are still seeing new cases and more ICU admissions every day .
Our strategy remains the implementation of public health restrictions to interrupt the spread of the virus and prevent people from arriving to ICU in first place .
Professor Philip Nolan , chair of the NPHET Irish Epidemiological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know what an unmitigated epidemic looks like , we are not on that track .
The model reveals that before restrictions were in place , daily growth rate of confirmed cases was at 33% .
This has fallen in recent days to around 15% .
But it is still growing and needs to fall further .
It takes time to see the impact of our efforts in the numbers .
It will be another 7-10 days before we have a reliable picture of how effective our collective efforts have been .
