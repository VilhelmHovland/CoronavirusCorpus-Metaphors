Jos court declares sacking of elected councilors illegal ?  A Jos High Court has ruled that Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has no powers to dissolve elected Local Government Councilors in the State .
The Court also set aside the Local Government Law , which the Governor relied upon to remove the democratically elected Council officials .
Delivering the judgment , Justice David Mann , said that section 41 , sub section 4 of 2007 Local Government Laws of the State , which empowered the Governor to dissolve the Council officials , was at variance with section 7 of the 1999 constitution as amended and therefore null and void .
It would be recalled that Governor Lalong had in 2015 after taking the mantle of leadership in the State dissolved the democratically elected Local Government Chairmen and Councilors in the State .
However , the aggrieved Council officials who had approached the court to seek redress insisted that the action of the Governor was illegal as their tenure had not been completed .
The sacked Councilors who had mobilized to the court in large numbers were , however , disappointed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Judge , the 2007 Local Government Laws which was amended in 2008 only stipulates , a two year tenure for the Councilors , adding that since the Councilors were elected in 2014 , their two year tenure ought to have expired in 2016 .
Speaking to journalists after the judgment , Counsel to the plaintiff , Gyang ZI , said " although there was no consequential order by the courtto reinstate the ousted councilors , my clients have been vindicated by the court 's pronouncement declaring the action of the Governor as illegal " , he stressed .
On his part , Counsel to Governor Lalong and three others joined in the suite , Nanle Kumak , said they will abide by the court 's judgment .
