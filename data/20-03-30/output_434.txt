Rabbi Kanievsky ruled that anyone not obeying social-distancing orders is like someone trying to murder another , is responsible for causing their death ; permits reporting them to secular authorities .
After weeks of stalling , the most senior rabbinic leader of the ultra-Orthodox world , Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky , has ordered members of the community to obey social-distancing orders , pray alone instead of in a prayer quorum and report anyone who violates the orders to the police .
Kanievsky 's instructions were notable for the level of trust they imparted to officials and experts regarding the coronavirus epidemic in contrast to previous comments the rabbi has made , as well as to a prevailing attitude in the community itself which often puts greater trust in rabbis than officials of any other kind , including state and medical ones .
Two weeks ago , despite the widening coronavirus epidemic , Kanievsky and Rabbi Gershon Edelstein , the other senior leader of the ultra-Orthodox world , both decided not to close ultra-Orthodox boys schools and yeshivas , on the basis that children studying Torah provides physical protection to the Jewish people .
On Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the ultra-Orthodox public to be particularly high , Kanievsky finally issued several rulings instructing the community to take the epidemic seriously .
In response to a list of six questions apparently posed to him by members of the public in recent days , Kanievsky took a strong stance on the importance of adhering to social distancing instructions and obeying the instructions of doctors .
The rabbi was asked whether people , who claim they trust that God will prevent them from become infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus and therefore violate social-distancing orders issued by the Health Ministry , should be considered " like a rodef " -- someone " pursuing " people in order to kill them .
Kanievsky responded yes .
In Jewish law , extreme measures can be taken against a rodef to halt their actions .
Kanievsky added that if a person violated the social-distancing orders and thereby infected someone else and caused their death , that person would bear liability for that person 's death .
The rabbi also ruled that people should leave a cell phone on over Shabbat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact them in an emergency situation .
Using a phone on Shabbat usually violates Jewish law unless there is a matter of life and death , so Kanievsky 's ruling demonstrates the seriousness with which he is now taking the coronavirus epidemic .
In addition , the leading legal authority ruled that it was permitted to inform law enforcement agencies about an individual , a synagogue and educational institutions which violate the Health Ministry orders , even if it means that fines or even imprisonment will be imposed on such violators .
Kanievsky said in summation that the general public should pray to stop the epidemic .
Since Kanievsky and Edelstein ruled to keep boys ' schools and yeshivas open , many such institutions continued to operate for several days on a near-normal basis .
The two rabbis never rescinded that decision , but last week the winter term ended and ultra-Orthodox schools and yeshivas are now on their Passover vacation , which lasts a month .
