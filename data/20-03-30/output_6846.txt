" The numbers have been incredible on testing , " Trump said .
" In the days ahead we 're going to go even faster on testing .
"  Trump has previously discussed a new test from Chicago-based Abbott that can produce results in minutes .
The president said over the weekend that the Food and Drug Administration was able to approve the test in four weeks instead of the normal months-long approval process .
A box containing the test was placed next to Trump in the Rose Garden on Monday , complete with its own presidential seal .
" This is the first one on the line , " Trump said of the new test , calling it " highly accurate .

Lindell said he has dedicated 75% of his company 's manufacturing capacity to producing cotton face masks and plans to produce 50,000 per day .
" Thank you , Mr .
President , for your call to action , which has empowered companies like MyPillow to help our nation win this invisible war , " Lindell said at the White House coronavirus press briefing .

"  When Trump retook the mic , he said he was unaware Lindell would make those remarks , but " he 's a friend of mine and I do appreciate it .
"  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday said she does n't expect lawmakers to reach an agreement on the next round of legislation needed to address the coronavirus pandemic until after Congress returns April 20 .
" I would not suspect that we would have any bipartisan legislation before we return after Easter and Passover , " the California Democrat told reporters .
" But we 're getting ready , and in some cases we are ready .
in light of the increasing challenge we face .
"  Even before the House passed an historically-large rescue package last week , Pelosi had said more legislation would be needed .

Pelosi added Monday that she would like the next round to include infrastructure funding .
Congress has been trying for years to tackle the nation 's underfunded infrastructure but lawmakers have not agreed on a way to pay for it .

Frank Pallone , the New Jersey Democrat who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
He cited as an example the need for more community health centers in rural areas .

-- Christal Hayes  State Department : 25,000 stranded Americans have been brought home  The State Department has helped bring approximately 25,000 stranded Americans back to the USA from abroad , a top agency official said Monday , amid a global freeze on international travel , border closures and quarantines sparked by the coronavirus pandemic .
Ian Brownlee , the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Consular Affairs , said the State Department has an additional 100 flights in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peru and other countries .
" We do not know how long commercial flights will remain available , nor do we know how long the U .
government will be able to facilitate additional flights where commercial options no longer exist , " Brownlee said in a briefing Monday .
" It is imperative that U .
citizens make plans now to avail themselves of these options .
"  Brownlee said the State Department received a slew of new requests for help from Americans stranded in Asia , including U .
citizens seeking to leave India , where that country 's president imposed a severe lockdown .
Brownlee said a significant number of Americans are deciding " to stay abroad and ride out this crisis where they are .
" Those who choose to do that , he said , " will need to hunker down where they are .
"  Brownlee confirmed reports that some American travelers have been placed under quarantine in a hostel in Peru , and he said the State Department is in talks " at the highest level " with Peruvian government officials to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure they get the food and medical care they need .

-- Christal Hayes  Federal officers caution against prison releases  Federal law enforcement officers cautioned Monday that an expanded release of prisoners to home confinement to guard against larger outbreaks of the coronavirus would shift an additional burden to short-staffed probation officers who would be required to track them .
" Allowing for the release of inmates at this time and before providing the additional resources and compensation needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community , " said Larry Cosme , president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association .
The group represents 26,000 officers across 65 agencies .
Last week , Attorney General William Barr directed federal prison authorities to identify more elderly and medically compromised inmates for home confinement to avoid the virus ' spread inside the Bureau of Prisons ' 122 institutions .
Lawmakers and civil rights advocates urge the Justice Department to reduce the number of vulnerable prisoners who would be most at risk of infection inside the nation 's largest detention system .
Saturday , the federal prison system reported its first inmate death caused by the virus at a low-security facility in Louisiana , where at least four other inmates and three staffers have tested positive .
In all , 19 inmates and 19 staffers have tested positive for the virus , the BOP reported Monday .
" Once an inmate exits prison , whether they are released during their pretrial stage or post-conviction stage , it is the job of the brave men and women of the U .
Probation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure they no longer pose a threat to the American people , " Cosme said .
" Unfortunately , across the nation , probation and pretrial services offices have long been understaffed , causing an already apparent strain on the existing workforce .
"  -- Kevin Johnson  Trump suggests that more voting would lead to defeats for Republicans  Protesting Democratic additions to the $2 trillion stimulus bill , President Donald Trump suggested Monday that laws making it easier to vote would hurt Republican candidates .
" The things they had in there were crazy , " Trump said , describing negotiations for the stimulus bill he signed into law last week .

The $2 trillion stimulus bill includes $400 million in assistance to states that seek to protect elections from possible disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats sought more money , saying elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
-- David Jackson  Kremlin : Trump and Vladimir Putin agree to talks about the oil market  As the spread of coronavirus roils global energy markets , President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin agreed to schedule ministerial talks about the oil market , the Kremlin said Monday .
Putin and Trump " exchanged views on the current state of the world oil market , " said a translated statement from the Kremlin .
" We have agreed to hold Russian-American consultations on this issue through the energy ministers .
"  The statement said the two presidents " expressed serious concern about the scale of the spread of coronavirus in the world and informed each other about the measures taken in Russia and the United States to counter this threat .
"  The statement said , " The possibilities of closer cooperation between the two countries in this area were discussed , " but it did not provide specifics .
Earlier in the day , Trump complained about the energy war between Russia and Saudi Arabia , oil-producing giants that have driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " I never thought I 'd be saying that maybe we have to have an oil ( price ) increase , because we do , " Trump said in a morning interview with Fox News .
" The price is so low now , they 're fighting like crazy over distribution and over how many barrels to let go .
"  The White House said Trump and Putin " agreed on the importance of stability in global energy markets .
" It said the two leaders agreed " to drive the international campaign to defeat the virus and reinvigorate the global economy .
"  Trump and Putin also discussed unrest in Venezuela , the White House statement said .
-- David Jackson  Mnuchin : $2 trillion stimulus should get USA through next 8-12 weeks  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday that the massive economic rescue package signed into law last week is expected to help America endure the hardships caused by the coronavirus outbreak for the next two to three months .
" We have a lot of money as you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we can lever another $4 trillion with the Federal Reserve , " Mnuchin told Fox Business host Stuart Varney .
" We think this existing package gets us through the next 8-12 weeks .
"  Mnuchin said he expected the $350 billion in small-business loans included in the package to be ready for distribution starting Friday .
He said he hoped the instructions and forms needed to apply for the loans would be available Monday .
The loans " should cover about 50% of the private workforce " and should help employers cover eight weeks of payroll , as well as 25% of their overhead , Mnuchin said .
" As long as they use that money to bring back their employees , or pay their employees , it will be forgiven , " he said .
" So this is a great way to get Americans back to work .
"  If the program is successful and uses up the available funds , Mnuchin said , it would be likely to get more approved .
" This is a very popular program with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot , " he said , noting that every worker who gets a paycheck through the loans is a worker who wo n't have to file for unemployment benefits .
When asked about Trump 's suggestion during a " Fox &amp; Friends " interview that first responders should get hazard pay during the outbreak , Mnuchin said it was a good idea .
" That 's definitely something we will put in the next bill , " he said .
Mnuchin said he had not started working on another stimulus bill to deal with the crisis , which would be the fourth such piece of legislation since it began , and he was focused on distributing the funds that were just approved .
" We 're ready to work with Congress if we need more enhancements or additional funds , " he said .
