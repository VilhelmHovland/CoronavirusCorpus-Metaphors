The 15th Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People 's Congress met Thursday to discuss the draft regulations of the ban .
The proposal looks to extend the ban to all terrestrial wild animals and certain aquatic wild animals .
The Beijing Daily , the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China 's Beijing Municipal Committee , also reported that a penalty of 2 to 15 times the price of the animal was proposed .
Beijing 's municipal body is the most important local administrative body in China .
The regulation is the first step towards China 's pledge to revise its laws on wildlife trade and consumption .
The law is also likely to have echos in other parts of the country .
Late in January , China imposed a ban on hunting and consumption of wild animals on suspicion that the Covid-19 outbreak was linked to the wildlife trade in the country .
The initial cases in Hubei province were of people who had been exposed to the wildlife market in Wuhan , where bats , civets , snakes and other animals are sold .

The SARS epidemic , which claimed 774 lives , is likely to have originated from horseshoe bats of the Yunan province .
A group of Chinese researchers spent five years examining SARS-related viruses in these bats and found 11 strains with the genetic blocks of the virus that caused the 2002 SARS outbreak .

Ingredients like bear bile and tiger bones are used in traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) .
The impact of procuring them has an immensely detrimental impact on wildlife .
For instance , about 10,000 bears are kept in farms to supply bear bile .
In 2011 , it was reported that a bear had killed her cub before killing herself to avoid the torture at a farm .
According to the Environmental Investigation Agency ( EIA ) , at least one tiger is killed daily for its bone , which are used for treating bone diseases .
In an interview to the National Geographic , conservationist Belinda Wright attributed India 's tiger poaching to the demand from China .
Leopard and rhinos are also on the list of endangered animals that are poached in India and smuggled to China .
