The coronavirus may have bumped the climate crisis out of the headlines temporarily .
But this week Attenborough tells The Big Issue that once we have conquered the short-term crisis facing us all , eyes must again look to the long-term as the battle for survival moves from virus to the environment once again .
" If there was a risk of you getting coronavirus tomorrow -- which there is -- and someone next door had got it , you would find you were in quarantine quite quickly , " Attenborough says , speaking to The Big Issue before the current quarantine guidelines were put in place .
" But somebody next door to you who was doing something that could cause a terrible thing in five years ' time ? People will say , ' Well , that 's five years ' time , meanwhile I 've got to deal with coronavirus , or something ' .
"  David Attenborough : A Life On Our Planet has been produced by Silverback Films and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinemas and globally via Netflix later this year .
