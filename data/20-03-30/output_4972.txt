Privacy vs pandemic : Govt tracking of mobile phones could be a potent weapon against COVID-19  Last Updated : Monday 30 March 2020  Borders , beaches , pubs and churches are closed , large events are cancelled , and travellers are subject to 14 days ' isolation -- all at significant cost to taxpayers and the economy .
But could telecommunications technology offer a more targeted approach to controlling the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus ?  One possibility is to use location history data from the mobile phones of confirmed cases , to help track and trace the spread of infection .
Some people can be contagious without knowing , either because they have not yet developed symptoms , or because their symptoms are mild .
These individuals can not be identified until they become sufficiently unwell to seek medical assistance .
Finding them more quickly could help curb the spread of the disease .
All mobile service providers in Australia are required to hold two years of data relating to the use of each mobile phone on their network , including location information .
For anyone who tests positive with COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they ( or , more accurately , their phone ) had been over the preceding few weeks .
Using that list , it would then be possible to identify every phone that had been in close proximity to the person 's phone during that time .
The owners of those phones could then be tested , even though they may not necessarily have developed symptoms or suspected that they had come into contact with the coronavirus .
The government could do this in a systematic way .
It could assemble everyone 's location history into a single , searchable database that could then be cross-referenced against the locations of known clusters of infection .
This would allow contact tracing throughout the entire population , creating a more proactive way to track down suspected cases .
The privacy problem  You may well ask : Do we want the government to assemble a searchable database showing the locations of almost every person over 16 in Australia over the past month ?  Some people will undoubtedly find it a confronting prospect to be contacted by the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolated or tested .
Others will be concerned that such a database , or the broad surveillance capability that underpins it , could be used to intrude on our privacy in other ways .
Several countries are already using mobile phone data in the fight against the coronavirus .
The UK government is reportedly in talks with major mobile phone operators to use location data to analyse the outbreak 's spread .
India , Hong Kong , Israel , Austria , Belgium , Germany are also among the list of countries taking advantage of mobile data to tackle the pandemic .
The Singapore government has launched an app called Trace Together , which allows mobile users to voluntarily share their location data .
Iran 's leaders have been accused of being rather less transparent , amid reports that its coronavirus " diagnosis " app also logs people 's whereabouts .
Is it legal anyway ?  We may well take the view that the privacy risks are justified in the circumstances .
But does the Australian government actually have the power to use our data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep telecommunications data secure , but also allows federal , state and territory governments to request access to it for purposes including law enforcement , national security , and protecting public revenue .
Being infected with COVID-19 is not a crime , and while a pandemic is arguably a threat to national security , it is not specifically listed under the Act .
Limiting the outbreak would undoubtedly benefit public revenue , but clearly the primary intent of contact tracing is as a public health measure .
There is another law that could also compel mobile carriers to hand over users ' data .
During a " human biosecurity emergency period " , the Biosecurity Act 2015 allows the federal health minister to take any action necessary to prevent or control the " emergence , establishment or spread " of the declared emergency disease .
A human biosecurity emergency period was declared on Sunday 23 March .
In recent years there has been a great deal of debate over the use of telecommunications data for surveillance purposes .
The introduction of the mandatory data retention regime was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies to access the data for law enforcement .
One reason for the controversy was the relatively low threshold for use of these laws : Authorities could access data relating to any suspected offence punishable by three years or more in prison .
Australia is now facing a crisis that is orders of magnitude more serious .
Many Australians would be willing to see their information used in this way if it saves lives , limits the economic impact , and impedes the spread of COVID-19 .
The Commonwealth has the legal power to do it , the security and privacy issues can be managed , and the benefits may be significant .
