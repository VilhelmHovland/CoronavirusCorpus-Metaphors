Describing the novel coronavirus pandemic as a " biological tsunami , " Beaumont Health President and CEO John Fox told the Free Press Wednesday that the hospital system is adding about 100 new patients per day who have COVID-19 .
That pace has continued for the last three days .
" What we all need to remember is that we got our first patient two weeks ago , " he said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is definitely a biological tsunami .
"  He said so far , the hospital has been able to keep up with the demand for ventilators , but the outbreak of this new virus also is taxing the hospital 's capacity not only for equipment and beds but for trained medical staff who can care for the sick .
John Fox , President &amp; CEO of Beaumont Health ( Photo : Beaumont Health )  " In my lifetime , we 've never had a pandemic like this , " Fox said .
" The transmission mechanism is in many ways humanity 's most vulnerable for contagion , because we 're social animals and this affects the respiratory system and is transmitted through the air in micro-droplets , unfortunately very effectively between and amongst humans .
" You know , this is our worst nightmare .
"  With more than 2,200 confirmed cases and at least 43 deaths statewide as of Wednesday afternoon , Michigan 's eight regional emergency health care coalitions have been activated , Fox said , working together to get a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting resources to hospitals in need while sending patients to hospitals with more availability .
" They have turned on the switch to form their medical coordinating centers , " Fox said .
" They have the structure and they have the power to coordinate load balancing across the hospital providers as we try to adjust to the oncoming growth of the pandemic and the size of the curve that we may be facing .

Ryan Garza , Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also want to view these photo galleries :  " The first patient transfer occurred today , with Huron Valley Hospital accepting three COVID-19 patients from Beaumont Health .
We 're going to need a lot more of that .
" It needs to start now .
"  Beaumont Health surpassed 500 patients with confirmed COVID-19 cases Tuesday night , Fox said .
" And there 's 200 or more suspected cases .
By the time I go home today , or certainly before it hits midnight , I know we 'll break through 600 .
" We 're growing by 100 a day .
" And that number does n't include all the patients who were tested through Beaumont and got a positive result , but whose symptoms are mild enough to stay home to recover .
Susan Grant , executive vice president and chief of nursing , numbered those at about 500 .
The health system , which claims to be Michigan 's largest , with eight hospitals in Wayne and Oakland counties , is " not yet " at ventilator capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ER for Beaumont Hospital stands by as Amena Beslic , RN Director at the Emergency Center shows BD universal viral transport solution used to keep virus alive after a swab is used in the nose to test for COVID-19 at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak on Monday , March 16 , 2020 .
( Photo : Ryan Garza , Detroit Free Press )  " We are moving ventilators from hospital A to B to C , " Fox said .
" But that 's why the load balancing is so important because you .
do n't want patients driving past a hospital with maybe 10%-20% capacity that 's underutilized and then go to a hospital that 's super saturated , and where there are very limited resources or they may already be at the max .
"  At Henry Ford Health System , 304 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 and another 107 people were admitted and waiting for test results as of Wednesday afternoon at its five hospitals in Detroit , West Bloomfield , Clinton Township , Wyandotte and Jackson .
Henry Ford had tested 1,698 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Riney , president of healthcare operations and chief operating officer , said the health system has moved patients who do n't have the novel coronavirus from its hospital downtown to make additional room for COVID-19 patients .
It also turned two floors of the Henry Ford Medical Center at Fairlane in Dearborn into a 15-bed inpatient unit for patients who do not have the virus .
Henry Ford Macomb has converted eight operating rooms into a 16-bed unit for COVID-19 patients and Henry Ford Wyandotte has converted surgical units to a dedicated COVID-19 unit , increasing the number of ICU beds from 18 to 32 .
" All non-time-sensitive surgeries and procedures have been postponed , " Riney said .
" We 've moved complex neurosurgery , advanced ophthalmology and cancer procedures that are historically performed at Henry Ford Hospital to Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital .
" We have a team that is doing incredible work .
They are very dedicated , they are showing great agility .
Having said that , we are monitoring the stress and pressure and making sure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positioned to stay strong even if this goes on beyond some of the timelines that are projected .
"  Dr .
Betty Chu , associate chief clinical officer and chief quality officer at Henry Ford , said capacity varies by hospital campus , but she cited a significant surge in COVID-19 patients in Wayne County and Oakland County .
Beds are quite full at West Bloomfield and Detroit hospitals especially -- 152 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized at Henry Ford Hospital which has 877 beds , and 56 at Henry Ford West Bloomfield , which has 191 beds .
Bed availability reflects the total inpatient population , not just COVID-19 patients .
" While we 've relocated some surgical procedures to another hospital campus , we continue to perform services like baby deliveries , cardiac procedures and other time-sensitive procedures , " a Henry Ford spokesperson said .
Gretchen Whitmer said Monday in announcing her Stay Home , Stay Safe executive order that the disease growth curve in Michigan indicates the state would follow a path similar to Italy 's , with as much as 70% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as 1 million people could have the most severe symptoms of the disease and require hospitalization .
That is in a state with a hospital bed capacity of 25,000 .
The key to managing the outbreak , she said , is to " flatten the curve " or prevent a large percentage of the population from getting severely ill all at the same time , overwhelming the state 's hospitals .
Fox said it 's still too soon to tell whether enough has been done in the state to effectively flatten the curve .
" I believe the governor has made a lot of tough decisions to try and flatten that curve , " he said .
" In the modeling around this , there 's two theories of thought .
There 's the mitigation , which is flattening the curve , which is isolating anybody who 's showing symptoms , having them quarantine , things like that .
" And then you get into what they call suppression , which the extreme example is what happened in Wuhan ( China ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down .
" You 're basically trying to stop the disease in its tracks .
The question is really going to be when you take your foot off the brake of suppression , how fast will the disease come back and start to infect the rest of the population ? "  There are just two ways to stop the disease from spreading rapidly , Fox said : Develop a vaccine or infect enough of the population to create herd immunity .
With a vaccine still a year to 18 months away , herd immunity would occur only when enough of the population has already had the virus -- and developed antibodies to it -- to protect those who have n't .
" That 's assuming the antibodies work with this virus the way they do with essentially all others , " he said .
" Then the population should be safe .
"  But the question is whether COVID-19 will mutate , and whether people are likely to get it again .
" It 's always a risk , " Fox said .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutate at some level , but again , it is possible for it to mutate into something that our immune system can recognize , like a host of other coronaviruses that really do n't have much impact on us .
"  Beaumont , he said , has had discussions with Oakland University to convert dormitories into hospital wards if there are n't enough beds in the area 's hospitals to accommodate all the people sick with COVID-19 , but the process is more complex than it seems on the surface .
" The hotel industry and others have volunteered , but it 's not really about mattresses , " he said .
" The real rate limiter is patient care staff .
If Beaumont and other hospitals move patients to the dorm , " the challenge you have there is you need them to be low acuity enough for a limited staff to handle , but you still have to have the logistics for laboratory tests and pharmacy support and everything else .
" And so , the first thing is to convert as much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for COVID-19 patients .
But the challenge there is we still have to stay functional for patients with heart attacks , trauma , auto accidents , newborn babies , cancer treatments , and on and on .
So COVID-19 is on top of everything else we historically do .
"  So far , Fox said , the staff at Beaumont has remained relatively healthy .
" We have n't had a large incidence of the disease at all in our 38,000 employees , " he said .
The health system has eliminated most elective surgeries and procedures and is reassigning the staff who would have been involved in that work toward handling the surge of COVID-19 patients .
He said it 's very important for people to understand that testing is still extremely limited -- not only at Beaumont , but around the state .
Henry Ford 's Riney also said supplies for testing are a problem right now .
" Henry Ford still has a backlog of symptomatic individuals that have not been tested , " Riney said .
" I think that backlog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more testing capabilities come online .
Fox urged people who do not have severe symptoms not to try to get tested .
" If you 've got a fever , a little breathing congestion , the dry cough and it 's becoming apparent now that you might have the loss of smell and/or taste , in a pandemic , the odds are pretty overwhelming you 've got the virus .
Just manage it accordingly .
"  Stay home , he said .
Self-isolate .
Monitor symptoms .
Only if you develop severe symptoms , such as shortness of breath or fever that is n't controlled by acetaminophen should you seek additional health care , experts advise .
" We are conditioned , especially in America , that if you 've got something , you get a test for it , " Fox said .
" And in virology , with viruses , 90% of the time the test does n't do you any good .
"  For now , he urged Michiganders to continue practicing social distancing and staying at home .
" If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve and leveling it out , then we could have a steady flow of COVID-19 for the next four months , " Fox said .
" If it 's not working and a lot of contagion is occurring , then we can have a much bigger bolus .
And the models , I think , are good frameworks but their predictive value is highly suspect .
" What I look at ? Beaumont is growing by 100 a day and is probably going to get bigger .
And , you know , when that stops or slows down , I think then you 've got a data point that might be useful .
