Phase two of MCO from April 1 : no lockdown , but more roadblocks -- 8am-8pm for supermarkets , restaurants  The government has announced that phase two of the movement control order ( MCO ) -- which will introduce stricter enforcement measures -- will begin on April 1 .
This was announced by defence minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob at a preearlier today .
He said that 828 individuals were arrested at roadblocks and during patrol rounds yesterday ( Sunday ) , meaning that the police was taking sterner action than before against those who flout the MCO .
Still , the aim is to get people being compliant with the order , which is in effect until April 14 , and stay put where they are .
" Our target is not to increase arrests , our target is to reduce arrests .
The more arrests there are everyday , it means that there are still a lot of people out there not complying with the order , " he explained .
He said that a total of 257,287 vehicles were checked at 1,520 roadblocks carried out yesterday , and added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two .
These will include entry points into tolled roads across the country , which have already been increased from 23 at the early stages to 65 at present .
The number of roadblocks at toll plaza entry points will continue to increase to 114 in phase two .
Ismail Sabri added that more than 67,000 police , army and Rela personnel were currently deployed for MCO operations , but more resources are available and capable of being introduced at any point if the situation demands it .
He said while phase two will be different than phase one of the MCO in terms of tighter measures , it will still allow for movement , and supermarkets -- and restaurants for takeaways -- will still be open as per normal , except with changes to operating hours .
He reiterated once again that phase two is not a full lockdown .
Changes in phase two will include limiting the operating hours for all supermarkets , restaurants doing takeaways and petrol stations , with daily operating hours from 8 am to 8 pm being uniformly set for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also includes home deliveries .
Limited operation hours for public transport ( LRT/MRT and stage buses ) will continue as last scheduled , from 6 am to 10 am and 5pm to 10 pm daily , while taxis and ride-hailing vehicles will be permitted to operate from 6 am to 10 pm .
For private individual vehicles , the one person per car ruling remains .
Again , we remind everyone that if it is absolutely necessary for you to get provisions , medical supplies and food , please make it fast and limit the distance travelled for those purposes .
You can try switching to delivery services for food as much as possible , or at least on alternate occasions , in a bid to heed the government 's call to just stay at home .

Having spent more than a decade and a half with an English tabloid daily never being able to grasp the meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furiously at the idea of waffling - in greater detail - about cars and all their intrinsic peculiarities here .
Why not fine the stubborn people who ca n't understand what is MCO means , and then later on use the money build up our economy once the crisis is over , or that money will help us to get more medical assistant  Typical selfish attitude .
