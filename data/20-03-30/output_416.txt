Ron DeSantis on Saturday announced the creation of an Interstate 95 checkpoint on Florida 's northern border to screen motorists traveling from the New York City area , in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus .
Saturday 's announcement came a day after DeSantis said he was setting up a similar checkpoint in Northwest Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expansion of screenings already underway at certain Florida airports aimed at people coming from the tri-state area around New York City , one of the nation 's " hot spots " for COVID-19 , the respiratory disease caused by the virus .
DeSantis also used Saturday 's news conference at the Capitol to announce that Florida is working to make a hydroxychloroquine , a low-cost generic malaria drug , available to hospital systems in Miami-Dade , Broward , Orange and Hillsborough counties .
" I 'm not a doctor .
I 'm not telling anyone to take it or not take it , " DeSantis said .
" But I do believe in the idea of a right to try .
If somebody is really in bad shape and there is no other treatment available and the doctor believes this is something that could be helpful , then we want that patient to have access to that .
"  The governor 's staff said the hospital systems have requested the drug , which President Donald Trump recently touted as a possible COVID-19 cure .
Federal health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drug as a treatment for COVID-19 .
DeSantis ' call to make the drug available to highly populated counties in the state comes as the Florida Department of Health reported Saturday there are 4,038 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state .
More than a quarter of the cases are in Miami-Dade County .
As of Saturday evening , 56 people in Florida have died from COVID-19 , according to health officials .
The checkpoint announcement came a day after DeSantis expanded a 14-day self-isolation order for people arriving from New York , New Jersey and Connecticut to include travelers from Louisiana .
Florida officials on Saturday were operating a checkpoint on Interstate 10 west of Pensacola , with all non-commercial motorists detoured to a vehicle weigh station where license plates and driver 's licenses were checked and motorists were asked about their travels .
" Initially I was concerned about doing this because I do n't want there to be a backup , " DeSantis told reporters at Saturday 's press conference .
" But they 're doing it in a great way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about that .
We 're just worried about the people fleeing some of those areas .
"  DeSantis said he spoke with Trump , who on Saturday said he is considering imposing a quarantine on New York , New Jersey and parts of Connecticut to prevent the spread of the virus .
" Whatever works , I think we need to do , " the governor said .
" There is a lot of logistics involved and I think the president can figure that out .
"  Trump , a close ally of DeSantis , told reporters Saturday that he is considering a two-week quarantine for the northern states .
" We 'd like to see New York quarantined because it 's a hotspot .
New York , New Jersey , maybe one or two other places , certain parts of Connecticut , quarantined , " Trump told reporters , adding " we might not have to do it , but there 's a possibility that sometime today we 'll do a quarantine .
"  As of Saturday , there were 119,748 cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases -- 52,318 -- in New York state , according to the Johns Hopkins University &amp; Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center .
New York City had 29,766 cases , according to the New York State Department of Health .
In an effort to deter travel from New York City , the Florida National Guard and public health officials have been screening travelers on flights from the metropolitan area coming into airports in Fort Lauderdale , Jacksonville , Miami , Orlando , Tampa and Palm Beach , as well as Southwest Florida .
Saying the screening is working , DeSantis told reporters that a person whose symptoms of COVID-19 had abated was showing signs of the respiratory disease again , following a flight Friday from New York to Jacksonville .
" He was intercepted when he came to the checkpoint and he was diverted to go a hospital , " DeSantis said .
" That 's something I think helps protect Floridians .
"  The individual and people that were seated near him on the plane are now being treated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airline and the hospital where the individual was taken were not released .
DeSantis , who has faced criticism from Democrats and local officials for not issuing a statewide stay-in-place order , said his goal in targeting certain travelers is to reduce the spread of the coronavirus , an effort health officials call " flattening the curve " of the disease .
" I think it 's in everybody 's interest that we deal with the spread that we have here now , try to blunt it , flatten the curve , but we do n't allow importing new infections , " the governor said .
Asked about other access points for motorists -- such as U .
1 and the Amtrak Auto Train , which stops in Sanford -- DeSantis said I-95 is the " natural one " for motorists from the Northeast .
" I think having the ( Interstate ) 10 and ( Interstate ) 95 is good , that provides the protection , " DeSantis said .
