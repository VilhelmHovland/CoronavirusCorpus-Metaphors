His Judgement is unavoidable , unless .
Text : " .
whatsoever a man sows , that shall he also reap " -- Galatians 6:7  There lived a highly educated and widely celebrated school teacher who God used to raise the lives and destinies of thousands of young men and women in the old Western region .
He was so cerebral that whenever there was any issue of moral and/or educational decadence , he was the ' utility player ' that the government of that time deployed to sort things out and he attended to that duty , effortlessly and beyond expectation -- the man was very good and outstanding ! On his home front however , things were n't very pleasant .
His wife had psychiatric issues which led to her sudden death , two of his children were known armed robbers till they were killed , the rest of the children died strangely and things were generally on the southward slope domestically .
As a young Christian I became very curious in the place of prayers about why such bad things happen to good people .
There , it was revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayed the trust and confidence of her best friend .
She ' snatched ' the man from her best friend when she travelled out of the country for further studies and married him before the friend got back -- what a life !  That is an example of the terrible attitude of a number of people in our world today .
They traverse the land with the fallacious opinion that they are not answerable to anyone -- they fire arrows to the sky and hide their heads under a mortar thinking that their deeds are not visible to human eyes .
I have news for such people , nothing is hid from the eyes of the Almighty God ! ( 2 Chronicles 16:9 ; Genesis 17:1 ) .
He knows and sees all the deeds of man and He is a rewarder and will surely reward every deed .
In Jeremiah 17:10 ( NLT version ) God confirmed this : " I the Lord search all hearts and examine secret motives .
I give all people their due rewards , according to what their actions deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:23b ; Hebrews 11:6b ) .
It is regrettable that this type of irresponsible behavior pervades the land from ' ghost workers ' at government controlled organizations to non-existent contracts , ten-percents on contracts awards , ' ghost parliamentarians ' who avoid public sittings and yet receive humongous pay packets , to fraudulent judicial officers who right the societal wrongs by apportioning judgments based on ' cash and carry ' , to shameless political power holders that were voted for public interests but running after personal benefits and spending our common patrimony for useless expenditure , even when COVID 19 is destroying homes and families .
It also goes to our spiritual power wielders that have mortgaged their consciences on the altar of pecuniary benefits .
It is becoming a norm in our clime for people to get paid for work undone , for the ' side pays ' of some highly placed officers in public and private places to be more important to them than their gazetted salaries hence their lives of temporal opulence .
Wickedness is now the order of the day in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and selfishly but ignorantly about the day of death when all shall end ( Ecclesiastes 11:8 ) .
It is worrisome how people subject family members and house-helps at their commands to terrible maltreatment and staff working under them are not spared of their " caustic " tongues and wickedness .
Paul , in our text expressed the mind of God concerning those set of people .
It is possible to deceive man but God can neither be mocked nor deceived .
He said that no one should opine that his works are not known because every overt and covert work shall be rewarded in due course .
Jesus Christ gave due credence to Paul 's letter when He told the church in Laodecia as recorded in Revelation 3:15-17 that " I know your works , that you are neither cold nor hot : I would that you were cold or hot .
So then because you are lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue you out of my mouth .
Because you say , I am rich , and increased with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that you are wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked " -- what a frightening verdict of rejection by God for such people at the twilight of their ages !  During this time of Lent brethren , God is calling on you to carry out a personal , detailed and honest analysis of your life , how wicked and dishonest you have been to yourself , to hapless and helpless people within the precincts of your home , place of work , ministry and the state .
It is for this purpose that Jesus Christ came .
He came to save the lost sheep of the house of Israel ( Matthew 15:24 ) .
He is calling you today to consider your ways very fast and repent before it is too late and He comes down with His judgment ( Acts 3:19 ; Revelations 2:5 ) .
His fiery judgment in Jeremiah 17:11 is that " like a partridge that hatches eggs she has not laid , so are those who get their wealth by unjust means .
At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will become poor old fools .
" May this never be your end in the name of Jesus .
From this moment , please confess your sins to God , surrender your life to Jesus Christ and be committed to a life of righteousness , integrity , kindness , empathy , love and holiness .
Ask for pardon from the people you have wronged and restitute your ways .
Support families that their loved ones have tested positive to COVID 19 .
By so doing , God will forgive your past deeds , give you a new life , prosper your way , bless the fruits of your loins , elongate your years and when your end shall come , you will be blessed with eternal life as opposed to eternal damnation in the name of Jesus .
Prayer : Lord , I am sorry for my evil deeds .
Give me a clean heart and give me grace to reign with you eternally in Jesus ' name .
