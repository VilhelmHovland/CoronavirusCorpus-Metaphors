Ghosts of a century ago are back to haunt Mombasa which is yet again hit hard by the novel coronavirus , just as it was in the days of the Spanish flu .
Like in 1918 , Mombasa was jerked out of its false sense of invincibility when it suffered its first scare when a Kenyan student arrived from China with symptoms associated with the virus .
Kenya recorded its first case on March 13 and the fears were revived because of the nature and travel patterns of patient zero who like Mombasa 's false case had traveled from overseas by air .

Coast special circumstances place it at a higher risk because of its direct link to countries with high cases of the virus .
Coincidentally , many of these nations also trade with the world through the Mombasa Port which receives goods from China , Europe and other parts of Asia now stricken by the Covid-19 .
During the Spanish Flu which was introduced at the coast by a ship in September 1918 , approximately 31,908 cases and 4593 deaths associated were reported from the five districts .
Coast 's proximity to Tanzania and Somalia is said to be another reason .
