Ventura County doctors call for better social distancing to prevent overwhelming COVID-19 surge  Doctors in Ventura County say COVID-19 could overwhelm area hospitals with floods of people and cause masses of unnecessary deaths unless social distancing improves .
In a blunt , open letter to the community , three Ventura County Health Care Area Agency physicians described a worst-case scenario involving no social distancing where there could be so much sickness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .
That , they said , is as much as 100 times the county 's current inventory though an emergency medical official said the supply is growing .
" These patients are not going to remain abstract statistics , " wrote Drs .
Nessa Meshkaty , Melissa Barger and Daniel Cox .
" This may well be someone you love , someone you know .
"  But if Ventura County residents can isolate themselves enough to reduce social contact by 60% to 70% , the doctors said , the surge would be much smaller and slower .
The peak may not happen until nearly six months after the local outbreak began and could be reduced to the need for 475 ventilators .
" That extra time is critical for our hospitals to build ventilator capacity and allow for the developments of novel treatments , " wrote the doctors -- two infectious disease specialists and a palliative care physician .
" Thousands of lives would be saved .
"  ' We 'll have more volume than any of the hospitals can handle '  COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than doubling since Wednesday when the count stood at 50 .
A week before that , on March 18 , the tally was 11 reported cases , according to public health records .
Cox , a palliative care specialist , called the rate at which cases have doubled concerning and relatively unaffected by the shelter-in-place order issued on March 20 .
Some communities , he noted , have imposed curfews or used law enforcement to shut down businesses deemed as non-essential .
" I think maybe we should be more strict about shutting everything down , " said Dr .
Raj Bhatia , a pulmonary and critical care physician in Oxnard .
I think some people are being too casual .
They 're not worried about it .
Which is a bad mentality to have .
"  Social distancing is " absolutely necessary , " said Bhatia , medical director for the critical care unit at St .
John 's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard .
Without it , more people will get sick quicker .
" We 'll have more volume than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These patients are not going to remain abstract statistics .
This may well be someone you love , someone you know .
"  Drs .
Nessa Meshkaty , Melissa Barger and Daniel Cox  Dr .
Todd Flosi , chief medical officer for Ventura County Medical Center and Santa Paula Hospital , said the county 's COVID-19 rate appears to be doubling in less than every four days .
" If it continues like that , at some point we would be overwhelmed , " he said .
" There 's a chance if you stretch out that doubling time to seven or eight days , we get through this without an overwhelming number of patients in our ( intensive care units ) requiring ventilators .
"  Flosi cited young people gathering in clusters on beaches and trails , noting they may not be as vulnerable but can still be at the tipping point of a dangerous line of dominoes .
" They have parents .
They have grandparents .
They may have an uncle on dialysis , " he said .
" I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  When we 'll know how well social distancing paid off  CLOSE  Social distancing matters .
Here is how to do it and how it can help curb the COVID-19 pandemic .
USA TODAY  While doctors called for better social distancing , at least one evaluator gave the region an " A " grade for its efforts .
A human mobility data company named Unacast is using smartphone GPS information to try to track how movement has changed in the wake of COVID-19 and shelter-in-place orders .
The company 's social distancing scoreboard measures the change in average distance traveled since the outbreak emerged .
In Ventura County , the average distance traveled fell 46% from pre-COVID days to March 26 , the company reported .
That 's better than the state tally of 40% and the national mark of 30% .
Others said the true measurement of the region 's social distancing efforts wo n't emerge until it 's clear if the expected surge of patients is manageable or massive .
" Ironically after weeks of sheltering in place , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we see that nothing much has happened -- that 's when we 'll know that our sacrifice made all the difference .
"  How bad a surge in coronavirus cases could get  The doctors said in their letter that in a worst-case scenario , one of five COVID-19 cases could require hospitalization .
Of those hospitalized , 25% could need a ventilator .
Using a calculation model recommended by the California Department of Public Health , they said the worst-case scenario , without social distancing , could peak with the need of 18,000 ventilators some two months after the virus began to spread through the Ventura County community .
" Hospitals in Italy , Iran and now New York City have been overwhelmed when the infection rate spiked , and many have died that would otherwise have had a chance at surviving , " they wrote .
But effective social distancing , the doctors said , could push the peak back to day 170 of the outbreak and reduce it so less than 500 ventilators are needed .
" Each week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to adapt and build our defense to better prepare for the coronavirus surge , " they wrote .
" Your efforts and sacrifice now will save lives of people you know and love in the future .
