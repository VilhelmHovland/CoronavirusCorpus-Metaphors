The national lockdown during the coronavirus outbreak may increase incidents of domestic abuse , but help is at hand .
Picture : Pexels  Archant  Our government is telling people to stay at home during the coronavirus pandemic but , for those who experience domestic abuse or violence , home is not a place of safety and Bedfordshire Police is raising awareness of the problem and encouraging people to come forward if they have concerns .
A spokesman for Bedfordshire Police explained how raised levels of anxiety and stress , or even illness , in a home where relationships are under strain , can be a trigger point .
This is usually true during periods of extended time spent with the family , such as school holidays , so the national lockdown will bring the same issues to the surface .
She said social distancing and isolation may encourage coercive and controlling behaviours , as stricter routines and fewer opportunities to get out become apparent - especially for those who view work or school as a refuge from a situation at home .
Detective inspector Lorraine Coombes , of the force 's Emerald unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , or working from home , will bring many challenges .
We all need to be aware how this will impact existing victims and perpetrators of domestic abuse , and those who may now find themselves in such a situation due to the exceptional circumstances upon us .
You may also want to watch :  " In our daily lives , many of us will regularly be in contact with both perpetrators and victims , perhaps without realising .
This could be a family member , friend or neighbour , or a work colleague .
You are our eyes and ears - please do n't keep your concerns to yourself .
" Chances are if something does n't feel right it is n't , and we will continue to investigate and support throughout this pandemic situation .
"  She pointed out that people are still able to leave the house for a walk - if not ill or self-isolating - and fresh air and a physical space can often defuse an escalating situation .
If you are struggling , feeling overwhelmed with what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your partner or family , help is available .
If you have concerns about your own , or another person 's behaviour , or you fear for someone 's safety - or your own safety - call Bedfordshire Police on 101 , or call 999 in an emergency .
Alternatively , call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 .
