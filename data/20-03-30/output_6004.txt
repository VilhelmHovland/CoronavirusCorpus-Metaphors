When life hits pause  March 24 , 2020Uncategorized  With the March 22 Janta Curfew now extended for another three days , in an effort to keep COVID-19 at bay , Goans , confined to the indoors , are discovering the joys of slowing down and bonding with family .
NT BUZZ reports  Danuska Da Gama NT BUZZ  Who does n't love lazy Sundays ? However , March 22 will be remembered as a lazy Sunday with a difference , given the government order to observe Janta Curfew in a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19 .
This meant that Indians all over the country , barring those working in the essential services sector were confined to their homes from 7 a .
to 9 p .
And with the curfew now being extended to March 25 with a few tweaks , many people while happy to their part to avoid the spread of virus , have also been able to find time to do some of the things that they had n't had time for before .
" This curfew , a blessing in disguise , served as my most wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self reflection , of de-stressing and self love during this time .
More so , I 've been working on my mental health -- something we all fail to do on a daily basis .
And while the curfew was on Sunday and was then extended , I partially went into self isolation a few days before the curfew .
"  Ruth Costa , teacher , Taleigao  " The extended Janta curfew will help reduce the risk of pandemic that has engulfed the world .
I am doing my part as a responsible citizen of India .
Every loss due to the virus in various countries makes me realise that life is unpredictable .
This realisation has made me spend more time with my loved ones in these two days .
Meanwhile I have carried important work at home which will enable me to be with my family and join in the curfew as well .
It was a very patriotic feeling to join in the mass acknowledgement of the other professionals and personnel who are out there on the field irrespective of caste , religion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our homes with our families .
Let 's fight this together as one community .
"  Irfan Agha , advocate , Panaji  " I 've stayed at home before , but this time it actually felt like being in a cage .
I have never experienced anything thing like this before .
However , despite the irritation of being confined at home it did not force me to step out of the house .
I gave my best to support the Janta Curfew as I believe it is really important for each and everyone to self quarantine and take precautionary measures .
However , I do not like to waste my time and since I am otherwise busy at the bar I run at Calangute beach , and hardly get time to spend with my family , this was an overdose of quality time where we played housie , sequence , FIFA 20 on the PlayStation , and several indoor games .
It also got me to start cleaning the house which was a long pending task assigned to me .
And since my wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decoupage , washed my cars and bike and enjoyed this time at home , which is otherwise not possible due to the hectic life and routine we follow .
"  -- Nevis Coutinho , entrepreneur , Saligao  " Staying at home is not something I do every day ; but it was kind of fun to be kept at home .
For me , it was more of an adventure than a curfew .
Before the curfew the thought of staying home for one whole day got me frustrated and worked up and I actually thought I would lose my mind .
But as the day progressed , and the curfew extended , it seems okay .
I spent some valuable time with my parents and siblings , helped in household chores which surprised my mother and surprisingly made me happy .
I think more than a restriction , it has been a wonderful experience .
"  Rohan Pinto , businessman , Aldona  " After the hectic work schedule , staying at home was a dream come true .
Also , it has given me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help India and people be safe from this deadly virus .
It is also nice to have the family around where you just get time to bond knowing there 's no work , or pressure or burden , and to catch up on all the time missed and make up for it .
So at home we first had a deep clean session , which was followed by the mass liturgy disseminated by priests to be said at home .
Besides , food and games , it 's also been a time to relax .
"  -- Shweta Sequeira , designer , Porvorim  " Being at home for Janta curfew on March 22 , and now till 25th March , is to do more with spending time with family , praying the rosary to call out to God to spare us this pandemic .
On Sunday there was a feast at home , as I cooked a lot of food and now , I 'm relaxing .
"  Claudia D'Souza , assistant professor , Utorda  " I was happy to experience the Goa that my grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusting of leaves and silence on the roads , it looks like everything has slowed down and people are bonding with their family .
At the same time , it struck me that health is important and that situations can change and no amount of planning works .
"  Rekha Sawant , student , Margao  " On Sunday , I woke up late , made some fancy breakfast that the family ate at lunch time , and had a long siesta time .
It was fun to go out at 5 p .
and clap for all those hardworking health workers .
Since , a family member was exempted of curfew due to work reasons , I accompanied her to get a few errands done , buy milk , and some supplies for home .
It was fun to see the empty roads , but people queued up outside shops that opened for a while to buy milk and essential commodities .
This time , allowed me to slow down a bit , but it has been irritating to see people around me complain about how they miss work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Sushant Coelho , engineer , Mapusa  " We were prepared for this and I knew this was coming soon .
Spending time with my little ones and family , playing and relaxing has been the routine for the last few days now .
The ambience around us is now serene , with birds chirping and barely any traffic- something which has become a luxury now .
It has reminded me of our good old childhood days .
These days have been excellent time for family bonding .
I also believe that Mother Earth is recovering from the damage we humans have caused .
"  Emera Remedious , home entrepreneur , Pilerne  " Since Janta curfew was on a Sunday , it did n't make much of a difference -- Sundays are meant for relaxation -- not that one works too hard on other days but on Sundays , one can officially be lazy .
This was also the day when one had to responsibly stay indoors -- the self-isolation and lockdown is the best thing to do -- many advanced and first world countries are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Times like these also help to put things in perspective and make you reflect -- like why I overtook the guy in a hurry while driving or why was I so restless at the traffic signal when I was late for a movie .
This is a good time to catch up on movies at home -- a good part of the Sunday was spent watching the Sherlock Holmes teleserial starring Jeremy Brett , who is the quintessential Holmes .
Watching it again for the Nth time actually made me feel far more intelligent than my lowly IQ suggests .
" I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather " as Holmes says in ' A Study in Scarlet ' , reflecting my sentiment during these times .
