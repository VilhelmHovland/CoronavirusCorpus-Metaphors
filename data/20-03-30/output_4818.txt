Stadium rebuilds will make even less sense if sports get demolished  The players could , I suppose , take legal action against their various clubs and insist that their contracts , signed in good faith , be observed to the letter , and the last red cent .
Some might still do that .
But the problem is best explained by the old Mafia dictum , " If a man owes you a thousand dollars and ca n't pay , he has a problem .
If he owes you ten thousand dollars and ca n't pay , you have a problem .
"  The NRL clubs collectively owe the players many millions , and ca n't pay .
The players have a problem .
The core issue is that the NRL is like a banana shop selling bananas to the TV networks .
until overnight a blight wiped out the entire banana crop .
There are screams , tears , table-thumpings , but in the end if you have no bananas to sell , and you have bugger-all in the bank set aside for a rainy day , you ca n't pay those who work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Advertisement  Where does the fault lie for the catastrophe ? Ultimately it must lie with the NRL which has been awash with hundreds of millions of dollars for many years , even while the taxpayer forked out for their showpieces of infrastructure in absurdly profligate new stadiums , and yet still only had a buffer to stay afloat for a few months at best .
Illustration : John ShakespeareCredit :  The way forward ? I maintain my original position : it is not to go back to get more from the taxpayers per se .
In terms of prioritising need , million-dollar footballers can get right at the back of the queue , behind the casual workers , the labourers , the flight attendants , the shop assistants and all the rest .
The leaguies ' best hope , as they seem to have realised , is to do what I said last week and say : " We will live with the Olympic Stadium being an oval , not a rectangle , if we can have some of the proceeds of the $800 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Say , fer Chrissakes , can we at least all live without the $100 million electric curtain to hide the stadium 's frequent emptiness ? " )  They approached the Berejiklian Government with that proposal mid-week -- ovals , not rectangles , and give us some money -- only to be reportedly roundly rejected .
Maybe ovally rejected , I am not sure .
But I would persist .
It was already absurd to build those grand stadiums when there was no need , but it will look criminally absurd if there is not much of a rugby league on the other side of this to even begin to fill them .
NRL should have pressed stop on play  According to Peter V'landys , it was all very neat .
It was only " on the advice of our biosecurity and pandemic experts , " that the NRL competition had -- against public outcry and common sense -- proceeded to start the season .
And they got through two rounds before a phone call came on Monday afternoon from their key expert .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all these new measures , we consulted our pandemic and biosecurity expert and it was fine to continue to play , " V'landys recounted .
" That changed mid-afternoon today after we got a call to say we can no longer assure the safety of our players .
The advice from our pandemic expert is alarming .
"  Sorry , what ?  The seven-person family in New Jersey that lost four to coronavirus on the Saturday , with three fighting for their lives ? That was n't alarming enough already ? So play on , and have these NRL players return to their own families ?  The 869 who died of the same virus in Italy on the Sunday ? Play on , again ?  I respectfully submit that the call to quit should have been made a lot earlier than that , and by the NRL itself .
The best of sport  What can sport do to help the world get through this crisis ? The answer is , mobilise our communities .
In Australia the way is being led , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant job on the #SaveHakeem campaign .
Right now a lot of non-government organisations and charities relying on volunteers are so severely understaffed as they try to keep , most particularly , the elderly and now isolated looked after , they need 50,000 good souls to sign up to do everything from packing meals in community centres to driving for Meals on Wheels etc .
" With sport off now , " Foster says , " we are creating a volunteer army to fill the void in a sporting coalition for humanity .
" The idea is to #PlayForLives not points this season , and we need those who sign up to put aside the four to five hours they would have committed to training and competition to volunteer instead .
Waverley Old Boys soccer club got it underway by packing food at Addison Rd Community Centre , Marrickville and they have a roster for 30 volunteers for coming weeks .
Four other clubs in NSW and Victoria are involved and other sports organisations are joining , including the FFA and Rugby Australia .
All other sports are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong community .
