Covid-19 : People 's attitude determine duration of MCO  KUALA LUMPUR : The rate of public compliance to the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) is now at 97% , not the full percentage that the government wants to achieve to break the chain of Covid-19 infections .
There are still people who insist on hanging out in coffee shops and other public places , even violating the traffic rules imposed during the MCO .
The most common reason given is that they are going out to buy food .
But is it really necessary to go out four times a day to forage for food ?  Tomorrow is the 14th day the MCO has been imposed , and there are two more weeks for Malaysians to improve their compliance rate .
And the way for them to do this is by disciplining themselves to " stay at home " , and venturing out only when it is absolutely necessary .
Tomorrow too , the MCO is expected to go into the second stage , with sterner action taken against those who violate it , and hopefully it will not be extended beyond April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob recently .
Today too , the government will begin the Covid-19 Public Sanitation Operations throughout the country , involving hotspot locations which are Red Zones and Orange Zones , in a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Housing and Local Government , the local authorities , and solid waste management concession companies .
Besides the MCO , this is a serious effort by the government to eradicate Covid-19 , where as of noon yesterday , 150 new cases were recorded , bringing the total number of positive cases in the country to 2,470 , with 34 deaths .
The disinfecting process has already been carried out by various state governments , with focus on high-risk areas .
Among the first ones to conduct the operations was Kuala Lumpur City Hall which launched a massive exercise in the city last Saturday , starting with Seri Petaling which was a red zone area .
Since early this week too , almost all the local governments in Perak have conducted similar operations in their respective areas , with focus on public markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , the Klang Municipal Council has carried out operations in 35 areas .
Yesterday , after he visited a supermarket in the federal capital , Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said he was happy to see that more people were complying with the requirement for social distancing during the MCO period .
" Yesterday , I visited a supermarket in Kuala Lumpur .
I was looking for a few things and I also wanted to see how the public was at the supermarket .
Alhamdulillah , many are now observing social distancing , " he said in a posting on social media .
The response of netizens to the posting was positive , with people praising Muhyiddin as a leader who kept to his word that only the head of a household is allowed to go out of the house to purchase essential items especially food .
