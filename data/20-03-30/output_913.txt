Teach NJ advocates for state funding for nonpublic schools  Last week , state Assembly passed bills for school cleaning , technology in response to coronavirus crisis  Last Friday , the New Jersey State Assembly passed two bills for which Teach NJ strongly advocated .
One bill will establish the " Bridging the Digital Divide Grant Program " ; the other would provide $20 million to help schools afford the deep cleaning they might need to ensure that all traces of the virus are gone .
Teach NJ is part of the Orthodox Union 's Teach Coalition ; it advocates on behalf of all private schools in general , and for faith-based schools in particular .
These two bills were aimed at all schools , public and private , secular and faith-based , and they are in response to the pandemic .
That 's because " the pandemic does not discriminate , " Katie Schlussel Katz of Teaneck , Teach NJ 's executive director , said .
" Covid-19 does not discriminate against anybody .
" It goes after everyone .
So whenever any action that the state government takes to help schools respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of parents and schools will be struggling .
So these bills are to make sure that all students , regardless of where they go to school , are receiving these opportunities and getting all the help that they need .
"  Ms .
Katz described the two bills .
The grant program " reimburses schools for the purchase of technology , " she said .
" Laptops and tablets and access to hot spots .
It 's specifically for parents whose families do not have the means to buy them .
" Those devices are particularly necessary now , with all schools closed and all learning gone digital .
On Monday , the state Senate passed the bill ; as of Monday it was awaiting Governor Phil Murphy 's signature .
He is expected to sign the bill into law .
The other bill , which has not yet gone to the Senate for approval -- it 's not clear when it will be sent there -- " provides up to $20 million to sanitize a school 's facility , and any school in New Jersey can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Before any students can go back to school , the school has to be sanitized , so the schools put together a list of their estimated costs .
" The Frisch School in Paramus was the first Jewish school in Bergen County to have anyone from its community test positive ; as a result , it 's been deep cleaned .
" The school brought in a special sanitization company , " Ms .
Katz said .
She does n't know how much it cost , but she knows that it was not a cheap procedure .
Each school 's need for cleaning will depend at least in part on how long it has been closed , and what epidemiologists learn about how long the virus can live on the various surfaces that can be found in schools .
" Both of those bills received overwhelming support from the state Assembly , and we feel positive about them , " Ms .
Katz said .
" We are really happy that non-public school students are included in those bills .
We have continued to advocate for those students as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to include as many of our students and families as they can .
"  " We are pleased that Trenton has acted swiftly to ensure schools have the resources they need in order to manage an extreme and unplanned-for public health crisis and that nonpublic schools will have access to these critical resources , " she added in a press release .
" Families throughout New Jersey are taking unprecedented steps to ensure their own health as well as that of their loved ones and fellow community members .
It is important for communities to have peace of mind that their children can continue learning during this period and that facilities will be safe for all students , faculty and staff once schools re-open .
