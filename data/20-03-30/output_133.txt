Coronavirus : ' Big picture ' of COVID-19 crisis and when the Government responded  The head of the Government 's response to COVID-19 , John Ombler , has provided a timeline of how the crisis unfolded and at which points officials responded with action .
Speaking to the Epidemic Response Committee - a group of mainly Opposition MPs holding the Government to account while Parliament is suspended during lockdown - Ombler provided a " big picture " of the response so far .
Timeline  December 31 : China informed WHO of the first cases of COVID-19  January 24 : First COVID-19 monitoring team established in New Zealand  January 27 : National Security System activated in New Zealand to respond to virus  January 27 : Health staff begin meeting people on flights from China to New Zealand  Related News  He said the Government first responded to the outbreak on January 27 , when the National Security System was activated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet .
Since that time , he said there have been eight meetings of the Officials Committee for Domestic and External Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support that .
ODESC is a group of the heads of relevant Government departments that give the Prime Minister strategic policy advice on security and intelligence matters .
It was activated in March 2019 after the Christchurch terror attack .
Ombler said in terms of the Government response itself , the Ministry of Health first set up a COVID-19 monitoring team on January 24 , and health staff began meeting people on flights from China on January 27 .
By February , the Ministry of Health started receiving support in its lead agency role with all-of-Government strategy and policy input - which Ombler was appointed to lead .
" On Tuesday , March 10 , the National Crisis Management Centre was activated and the chair of ODESC appointed me to lead the national response - three weeks ago today , " he told the committee .
Ombler is supported in his role by the Ministry of Health 's Dr Ashley Bloomfield , the director of Civil Defence and Emergency Sarah Stuart-Black , Police Commissioner Mike Bush and Dr Peter Crabtree from the Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " COVID-19 does truly present an unprecedented challenge to New Zealand - certainly in my lifetime , " Ombler said .
" The scale and fast-moving nature of this threat has required us to adapt our way of working and our operating models .
" This is not only an all-of-Government response - it 's truly a national response .
"  He said the strategy under alert level 4 - which came into effect last week - is to eliminate the spread of the coronavirus by " going hard and going early to avoid our health system being overwhelmed the way it has been in other countries " .
" I expect within the coming month we will have a strong indication of our efforts there , " Ombler said .
" It depends on New Zealand 's collective cooperation and commitment .
"  It comes as Otago University research modelling shows that up to 14,000 Kiwis could die if intensive efforts to eradicate the coronavirus fail .
The modelling was considered alongside a range of other information to inform the Ministry of Health 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .
" The modelling shows that without the actions currently being taken , the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 would exact a high price in New Zealand , " Dr Bloomfield said .
" What is consistent across all the models is that we had a stark choice - let the virus spread unchecked and see large numbers of New Zealanders get sick , our health system overrun and many people dying , or taking firm measures to save lives .
