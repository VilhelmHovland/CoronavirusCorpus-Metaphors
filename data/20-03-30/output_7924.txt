Greg Wilpert : It 's the Real News Network .
I 'm Greg Wilpert in Arlington , Virginia .
As the world enters an unprecedented lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic , it makes sense to step back and look at what led us here and what a world that is less susceptible to pandemics might look like .
One prominent thinker considering this is sociologist Walden Bello .
In an article on the website Foreign Policy In Focus , he outlines why globalization is one of the main causes of this pandemic and how the pandemic could eventually lead to what he calls deglobalization .
Joining me now to discuss his article titled Coronavirus and the Death of Connectivity is Walden Bello .
He 's professor of sociology at the State University of New York at Binghamton , and the author of many books most recently of Counterrevolution , The Global Rise of the Far-Right , and of Paper Dragons : China and the Next Crash .
He joins us today from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walden .
Greg Wilpert : Right .
So in your article , you say that the pandemic was to a large extent caused by globalization and that its aftermath could lead to a process of deglobalization .
But before we get into that , we need to set the stage .
Talk about how the great recession of 2009 affected globalization and where we are today .
Walden Bello : I think that the first great crisis of globalization took place in 2008 with The Great Recession .
Basically , what we saw during that period was that so many of the aspects of globalization , such as supply chains , ground to a halt .
Even The Economist at that point was saying that the integration of the world economy is falling apart , owing to the speed of both the financial crisis and the impact under real economy .
Let 's not forget that at that time , not only did the financial system globally come to a halt , but there was tremendous impact on the real economy .
In China alone , 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of people throughout the world in the global North as well as in the global South lost their jobs .
There was stagnation for the coming several years .
Europe was in recession for a long , long time .
The United States had unemployment of about the .
that was greater in 2015 than at the start of the financial crisis .
So we really had a situation whereby globalization and the integration of the global economy that that brought about really was in a major , major crisis .
Greg Wilpert : So it seems that the elites were oriented towards continuing the neoliberal globalization process , were basically intent on reestablishing the old order after 2009 , that is more free trade deals , limited market regulation , and more government austerity .
Now in your book on the global rise of the right , and also in your article , you argue that this approach among the elite provided an opening for the right , for the far-right .
How and why did this happen exactly ?  Walden Bello : You definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and center left elites were tied to the old border of neoliberalism and globalization .
But , they had lost their faith in it .
It was like they were just going through the motions during this time .
But nevertheless , they did n't see any other alternative but to stick to it .
It 's because in fact , they did not change at all except adhere to the old methods despite the social costs of this , that this provided people in the far-right , for an extreme right to take up the costs of protecting the economies , protecting the political system and basically challenging globalization but giving it a twist that the basic cost of this whole thing was migrants or minorities , and that the elites were out of touch and that they were promoting this invasion of their societies by migrants , and that those people who had been there basically had the rights to the benefits of that society .
Basically , it was twisting around what many of us at the left had been saying , that globalization was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progressive world order , both at the national and the global order , but they were twisting it to say that , " Oh , let 's do protection , but only for those who have been here for a long , long time , the native population .
Everybody else , keep out .
" I mean , that 's simplistic of course , but that 's the kind of nativist and racist kind of reactions that the far-right played , that the far-right pushed , and which evoked a lot of support from workers and other sectors that were threatened and wanted to see an explanation for their crisis .
So that was the opening that the crisis of globalization provided to the far-right .
Greg Wilpert : Let 's turn to the coronavirus pandemic right now .
Here at the Real News Network , we have interviewed guests who have laid some of the blame for the pandemic to climate change .
But in your article , you tie it to globalization .
What do you see as being the connection between globalization and the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-right 's anti-globalization discourse ?  Walden Bello : My sense is this , that during the crisis , as the far-right began to take advantage of nationalistic sentiments to promote a kind of protectionist , but negatively protectionist vision for their societies , and established elites were basically lacked legitimacy because of the crisis to which globalization had led and neoliberalism has led , China stepped into the leadership of the globalization process .
This was when Xi Jinping came to power , and we had the economic nationalism of Trump .
Xi Jinping stepped into this and he says that globalization was essentially good .
It 's just that we needed to be able to smooth its rough edges , and that it was very beneficial to all of humanity .
That was sort of the thing that happened .
Now the new slogan at this point in time that came out from different sectors of the global elite and from China itself was connectivity , that it was important to have not only digital connectivity , which everybody was saying was great , but also physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical transportation and other kinds of chronic connectivities , as they would call it , was really very essential in order to move to a new phase of globalization .
Air transportation , air connectivity was one of the most important things that was being pushed , not only in order to be able to speed up the movements in the global supply chain , but also to push , take advantage of explosion on tourism at this point in time .
Everybody wanted a piece of the pie that was offered by the tremendous number of tourists coming out of China into the rest of the world .
And so many of the local sectors of the different economies , like that of Thailand for instance , became very much dependent on this air connectivity-triggered tourism .
The last thing I would just like to push here was that it was China came out , or the leadership in China came out with the Belt and Road Initiative , this really big trillion dollar program that evoked the images of linking Europe and Asia in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put at the global level .
The Chinese leadership called it global connectivity .
There were essentially initially two routes , the land route , okay , and the maritime route by around 2015 .
There were so many routes now , including a polar silk route that was supposed to bring together the world within a new system of connectivity .
The context , in which that provided the context for the recent events , as we have the seen .
Now I 'm not saying , of course , that there 's that direct connection in terms of globalization , say directly creating the conditions for the virus , I mean , the emergence of the virus .
I 'm not saying that .
I 'm just saying that when what happened happened in terms of the leap from viruses in animals to humans to which they took place , then this whole system of connectivity became the transmission , especially air connectivity became the transmission belt for a virus that was traveling at internet speed .
So connectivity , you might say , created the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus .
Greg Wilpert : So if globalization carries some of the blame for the spread of the pandemic , now would deglobalization be the appropriate response to it ? And if so , what does deglobalization even mean ? How would it be different from what people on the far-right , such as Donald Trump , are calling for when they turn towards nationalism and against globalism ?  Walden Bello : Well , deglobalization , just a bit of a history , we had proposed this as an alternative to globalization as early as the 2000 and 2001 .
In fact , I wrote a book that was titled Deglobalization and it came out in 2002 .
Basically , this was , we were saying that one , we needed to protect local economies from the way that industry and agriculture were being subverted by transnational corporations in terms of their cheap goods , and that we needed to use tariffs and other mechanisms to be able to protect , our farmers , and local manufacturers .
But beyond that , there was a sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact sustain our national economies and not have them be disrupted by the impact of very cheap commodities that were being produced by this supply chains run by transnational corporations .
And a lot of these supply chains were in fact located in China .
But beyond that , I think that beyond the policy prescriptions that we had around how do we maintain the integrity of national economies , we were basically saying that deglobalization rests on ideas or an approach that basically says we need to control markets so that markets do n't run society , but societies run markets .
We said that values of justice , community , solidarity were very important as an canopy to be able to contain and direct markets rather than markets directing society .
You know , of course that the essence of globalization was to say that the best restraints on the market , the better .
So everything was being chucked out of the window and it was a question of markets and profits being the centerpiece that would drive the global economy .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say that we just need to have more local control , but in a progressive way that did not discriminate against people but in fact promoted social justice , welcomed migrants , and basically sought greater social equality .
That is something that the right has pushed out of the window and is just relying on this nationalistic anti-migrant and racist sentiments of basically saying , " Hey , it 's only for us to enjoy what are the benefits of this society , us meaning those of us who were originally here and of the right religion and of the right color and of the right culture .
The rest , it 's off limits to them .
" That was the way that the right distorted the message of deglobalization .
Greg Wilpert : Okay .
Well , we 're going to have to leave it there for now .
