The British and Irish Lions ' tour of South Africa in July 2021 will not be shifted despite a direct overlap with the new dates for the Tokyo Olympic Games .
The Olympics have been pushed back a year due to the global coronavirus pandemic and will now start on July 23 , 2021 , the day before the first of three tests on consecutive weekends between the Lions and world champions Springboks .
" The priority right now has to be the safety and wellbeing of all those affected by the global Covid-19 pandemic , " Ben Calveley , British &amp; Irish Lions Managing Director , told Reuters on Monday .
" We are determined to play our part in what will be an extraordinary summer of sport .
There should not be any direct clashes with Lions matches and Olympic events given the time difference between South Africa and Tokyo , so fans should not miss out on any action .
" We are expecting a fantastic series against the world champions .
"  The clash in dates will narrow the options for t he Springbok Sevens side that will compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who won bronze in Rio de Janeiro four years ago , otherwise occupied with the 15-man game .
Other players such as loose forward Kwagga Smith and centre Ruhan Nel , who might have hoped to make both teams , will now have to make a choice .
The decision to stick to the dates of the Lions tour , which starts on July 3 with the first of five matches against provincial and invitational sides before the opening test on July 24 , at least brings some welcome certainty to arguably the biggest rugby attraction outside of the World Cup .
The World Rugby calendar has many question marks remaining though , with the 2020 Six Nations yet to be completed and the July internationals for this year under threat and likely to be scrapped .
