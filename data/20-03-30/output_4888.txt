THE disappointing cancellation of the keenly-awaited new NBL1 North competition has done little to dampen Chris Riches resolve to battle on .
While the latest decision was expected , the Ipswich Basketball Association official and Ipswich Force men 's head coach said everything was being geared towards a grassroots revival as soon as possible .
" Our focus basically is shifting on to those local competitions , ' ' Riches said , waiting for further direction from the Australian and Queensland governments on when sport can resume .
" That will determine everything else .
" We really need a holding pattern until the local domestic competitions can go on .
" There will be pretty significant restrictions placed on the operation of those competitions with everyone 's wellbeing paramount .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no representative or any kind of basketball above that .
' '  The banned competition includes the newly-formed NBL1 North competition , planned to bolster the pathway between the former Queensland Basketball League and national league .
All three NBL1 conferences - in Queensland , Victoria and South Australia - have been cancelled after initially been postponed until May due to the coronavirus saga .
The decision came after the indefinite closure of indoor sports centres because of COVID-19 .
Ipswich Force men 's and women 's teams were preparing to play in the NBL1 North competitions .
" We 're like every other sport .
We 're just waiting to see what happens in regard to the virus spread and trying to minimise that as much as possible , ' ' Riches said .
The latest decision also came after Force had signed Australian Boomers and Brisbane Bullets guard Nathan Sobey for the inaugural NBL1 North series .
Riches said the star recruit 's future plans would be reviewed along with all programs when basketball is allowed to continue .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll talk to everyone about 2021 , ' ' Riches said .
" That 's where your focus shifts .
It never stops .
It 's always going .
' '  A positive was that loyal American import Kyle Harvey was not due to fly out until April 6 .
He 's avoided the risk of being left in limbo or being indefinitely stranded in Queensland .
" Because we have such a heavily based local association , a lot of guys are around town , ' ' Riches said .
" We have n't had a lot of guys coming in and out so that 's been one of the benefits of actually having local guys in the program .
' '  Riches said Ipswich Basketball Association competitions would be restored once given the all-clear .
" The regular competitions , which is where all our Ipswich players are involved in , they are the ones that are really important as well because we have n't had any basketball for about three , three and a half weeks , ' ' Riches said .
