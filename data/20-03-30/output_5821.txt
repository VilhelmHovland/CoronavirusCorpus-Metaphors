Mercedes F1 team helps develop breathing aid for coronavirus patients  LONDON -- Formula One team Mercedes has helped to develop a breathing aid that could keep coronavirus patients out of intensive care and ease some pressure on Britain 's strained health service .
Mercedes worked with engineers at the University College London and clinicians at University College London Hospital to adapt and improve a device that bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and the need for full ventilation .
The device , known as continuous positive airway pressure , has been used extensively in hospitals in Italy and China to deliver oxygen to the lungs of coronavirus patients during the pandemic .
UCL said the adapted devices have been recommended for use in Britain and that 100 of them are being sent to its hospital for clinical trials .
There is the potential for quick roll-out by Mercedes to hospitals across the country .

Tim Baker , a professor from UCL 's department of mechanical engineering , said clinicians called on the " capability of Formula One " to reduce a process " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " with the adapted device taking less than 100 hours to develop from an initial meeting .
" We have been proud to put our resources at the service of UCL , " said Andy Cowell , managing director of Mercedes , " to deliver the CPAP project to the highest standards and in the fastest possible time frame .
"  CPAP machines work by pushing a mix of oxygen and air into the mouth and nose at a continuous rate , helping to increase the amount of oxygen entering the lungs .
They are used routinely by Britain 's National Health Service but are in short supply currently .
