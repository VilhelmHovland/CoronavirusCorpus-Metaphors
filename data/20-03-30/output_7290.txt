Actions  AUSTIN , TX -- Governor Greg Abbott has waived certain statutory provisions to ensure public safety employees who contract COVID-19 during the course of their employment will be reimbursed for reasonable medical expenses related to their treatment of COVID-19 .
Because the nature of their duties has caused them to increase their risk of contracting COVID-19 , the Governor has waived these statutory provisions so that public safety employees who contract COVID-19 are not also financially penalized .
" Texas ' public safety employees are vital to our COVID-19 response , " said Governor Abbott .
" These brave men and women are on the front lines and risking potential exposure to keep our communities safe .
By waiving these statutory provisions , Texas will ensure that those who may contract COVID-19 will have the support they need to pay for medical expenses .
