Urgent demand for medical equipment to fight the coronavirus has sent the cost of chartering aircraft skyrocketing and turned a typically humdrum process into an ultra-competitive auction .
" Chartered prices have been pushed up from less than $300,000 four to six weeks back to $600,000 to $800,000 in the last few days , " Anthony Lau , chairman and founder of logistics company Pacific Air ( HK ) Ltd .
, said in an interview Friday .
" It is absolutely crazy .
"  An unprecedented collapse in passenger demand is prompting airlines to use their fleets to transport more cargo , including medicines , as the coronavirus pandemic causes major disruptions to supply chains and exacts a heavy toll on the world .
Infections globally have climbed above 720,000 and about 34,000 people have died from the virus .
The likes of Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd .
, Korean Air Lines Co .
and American Airlines Group Inc .
are hauling a greater amount of goods in the bellies of their passenger planes to keep up with demand .
Cargo rates have risen over 10% in recent weeks .
