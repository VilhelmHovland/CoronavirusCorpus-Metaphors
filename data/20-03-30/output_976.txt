Normally a lieutenant governor , at least in Alabama , takes a backseat when it comes to policy and leading the charge in a crisis unless asked to do so or if something happens to the governor .
But this week , Alabama Lt .
Will Ainsworth lunged into the role of de facto coronavirus response leader .
He wrote a biting open letter to Gov .
Kay Ivey 's COVID-19 task force , arguing they were not taking a " realistic approach " about the looming " tsunami of hospital patients .
"  The governor , on Friday , shot back by saying that Ainsworth was n't helping the state by not offering up solutions .
" As a public official , our greatest responsibility is to be honest with one another and to the people of Alabama , " Ivey said during a news conference .
" I invited ( Ainsworth ) to be on my task force , and he said he was willing to help .
" What is not helpful is raising challenges and criticism and issues we are aware of and ( then ) offering no solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the team willing to fix it .
"  Ainsworth , in a statement to AL .
, responded by saying that his letter " was intended to be a call to arms .
"  " The COVID-19 crisis will be resolved only if the governor 's task force recognizes the reality that faces us and works as a team to resolve it , " he said .
The comments on Friday further revealed two constitutional officers at odds with one another as the coronavirus pandemic rips through the state .
" It 's unusual for the Governor and Lieutenant Governor to put out such different messages , " said Robert Blanton , professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham .
" Politically , it indicates a lack of effective communication between their offices , which is somewhat surprising given the gravity of the situation .
"  ' Action now '  While Gov .
Kay Ivey has been scarcely visible , Lt .
Will Ainsworth is trying to ring the alarm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Ivey , during a news conference , said the state needed to balance public health with the economy , echoing a statement of President Donald Trump , who was pushing to open portions of the U .
economy by April 12 .
The letter from Ainsworth was received well by lawmakers , and it was praised by Democratic U .
Doug Jones .
Jones said he spoke with Ainsworth by phone and , during an interview with AL .
, said the lieutenant governor " hit the nail on the head " with his letter .
Jones also criticized Ivey for sending " mixed messages " about certain businesses being open -- such as gun stores -- while others considered " non-essential " should close .
Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh , R-Anniston , said Ainsworth 's concerns were similar to his own views .
But Marsh also said the concerns are " being addressed by ( Ivey ) and her team .
"  Ainsworth , the 39-year-old former state representative from Guntersville , has been the beneficiary of positive headlines in recent days after calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided some alarming projections not previously discussed by public officials , but reported in state media , regarding what he says is a lack of hospital beds .
Ainsworth 's letter called on a doubling of hospital beds in Alabama , and he projected the state could have over 245,499 cases by May 1 , with 13,914 hospital beds in use ( assuming a conservative hospitalization rate of 13% for people diagnosed with COVID-19 ) .
He also forecasts something more ominous : By May 1 , the state could have 6,382 patients in intensive care units around the state who will be in need of ventilators .
According to Ainsworth , the statewide stockpile is only 1,344 ventilators .
" I believe that the public 's safety and simple common sense demand that we create a formal plan to double or triple hospital capacity and also provide for adequate staffing levels , " Ainsworth said .
" Even with the help of federal government and FEMA assistance , building capacity takes time , which is why we need action now .
"  More facts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is second in the country for largest percentage increase .
This is a major problem .
Alabama was higher than New York , California , and Louisiana for percentage of increase today .
Gina Maiola , the governor 's spokeswoman , said that Ivey 's No .
1 priority is " protecting the health , safety , and well-being of all Alabamians , and that very much includes keeping the economy going as much as possible .
"  In reacting to Ainsworth 's letter on Thursday , Maiola said , that it " only reinforces the actions of her task force , and the governor intends to continue taking a measured and practical approach regarding both the gravity of the virus and also keeping the economy alive .
"  Ivey , asked to react to Ainsworth 's letter on Friday , provided the more forceful criticism .
' Trains of thought '  Singleton , the Senate 's Democratic minority leader , said it 's healthy to have multiple viewpoints publicly expressed during the pandemic .
" I applaud him in forcing his opinion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the second person in command in the state , it may ( inspire ) other folks to look at his position , " said Singleton , who butted heads with Ainsworth last May during a Senate debate over the state 's near-ban on abortion .
Ainsworth , a strong supporter of the ban , gaveled down two amendments that would 've added rape and incest exceptions into legislation , prompting Singleton to respond with anger .
" It is good for the members of the leadership who have different trains of thoughts on this , " he said .
Several Alabama Democratic Party leaders , including Singleton , have called on Ivey to issue a " shelter in place " order , which she has thus far refused .
On Friday she said every part of the state does not have the same needs or issues , that Grove Hill is not Gadsden , Dothan is not Decatur .
Singleton added , " It would be good if we all sat down and made those decisions together .
"  Indeed , it 's unclear if Ainsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the governor 's response hints at a lack of communication .
The governor 's office did n't respond to an email question on whether the two have spoken .
" This view of economic growth and public health as being at odds with one another is disturbing , " said Blanton , who said Ainsworth 's approach is " much more in line with what medical experts are recommending " and that it offered a " reset " in the state 's approach toward dealing with COVID-19 .
The toll plan was pushed by the Alabama Department of Transportation , but was widely opposed by coastal Alabama residents who flocked to social media to express their disapproval of having to pay tolls to drive on an existing interstate .
Ainsworth 's opposition further fueled the opposition movement , and the project was ultimately declared " dead " later in the month .
In Alabama , the lieutenant governor is elected separately from the governor .
The two do not share their political party 's ticket together during either the primary or general elections .
Seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Ainsworth is a 2003 graduate of Auburn University and an avid outdoorsman who , along with his brother Austin , founded the popular Dream Camp hunting lodge in Guntersville .
According to one published report , the camp attracts over 20,000 people each year .
The brothers also partnered and founded the Tennessee River Valley Hunting and Fishing Expo that is held each year at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville .
Ainsworth 's rise to the lieutenant governor 's seat began when was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives in 2014 .
Four years later , he ran for the statewide seat and won a hotly contested GOP runoff against Twinkle Cavanaugh before cruising in to a general election victory over Democrat Will Boyd .
During an expensive runoff campaign , Cavanaugh -- a much more well-known politician who was the head of the Alabama Public Service Commission at the time -- accused Ainsworth of openly opposing Trump during the 2016 presidential election .
Ainsworth was a supporter of Florida Sen .
Marco Rubio , but he claimed to have always been an admirer of Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested twice -- in 2001 and 2002 .
The 2001 incident was for driving an unregistered boat in Jackson County , while the 2002 incident was for what he called a " college prank " with fraternity brothers for stealing fiberglass tigers placed in downtown Auburn for a Chamber of Commerce event .
Ainsworth , who was 20 at the time , performed community service and the case was dismissed .
Jess Brown , a retired political science professor of Athens State University , said the Ivey-Ainsworth rift is the first time he can recall one occurring that involves the state 's top two constitutional officers since Republicans took over the Statehouse in 2010 .
He said of Ivey and Ainsworth that , " we 've seen repeated examples of a lieutenant governor differing with the governor on two major policy positions .
"  Said Brown , " It may also suggest the difference in their political careers and where they are in terms of their life cycle .
He 's a young fellow wanting a higher level of office .
I imagine she 's not running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times .
