COVID-19 can cause cardiac injury in healthy people  New research has found that COVID-19 can cause cardiac injury , even in patients without underlying heart conditions .
It 's known that COVID-19 can have fatal consequences for people with underlying cardiovascular disease , but even in people without underlying heart conditions , the virus can cause cardiac injury .
This is according to a review by health experts at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston ( UTHealth ) .
" It is likely that , even in the absence of previous heart disease , the heart muscle can be affected by coronavirus disease , " says Mohammad Madjid , MD , MS , the study 's lead author and an assistant professor of cardiology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth .
" Overall , injury to the heart muscle can happen in any patient with or without heart disease , but the risk is higher in those who already have heart disease .

In a clinical bulletin issued by the American College of Cardiology , it was revealed that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 for patients with cardiovascular disease was 10,5% .
Data also points to a greater likelihood that individuals over the age of 65 with coronary heart disease or hypertension can contract the illness , as well as experience more severe symptoms that will require critical care .
According to the study authors , critical cases are those that reported respiratory failure , septic shock , and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure that resulted in death .
" It is reasonable to expect that significant cardiovascular complications linked to COVID-19 will occur in severe symptomatic patients because of the high inflammatory response associated with this illness , " says Madjid , who also sees patients at the UT Physicians Multispecialty -- Bayshore clinic .
