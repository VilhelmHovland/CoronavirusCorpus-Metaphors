Time limit on SNAP benefits suspended during state of emergency  Time limits imposed on receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) benefits have been suspended during the COVID-19 state of emergency by federal legislation .
" SNAP benefits play a critical role in helping Oregonians get by during difficult circumstances , " said Dan Haun , a program director at the Oregon Department of Human Services , in a statement Monday .
" This change ensures that food benefits remain available for the increasing number of Oregonians losing jobs during this pandemic .
"  The three-month time limit normally applies to a subset of recipients who are required to seek work as a condition of receiving the benefits .
Department of Human Services officials said the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the number of people eligible for SNAP .
Both retailers moved up their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unable or who have difficulty getting to the store another option to purchase food , human services officials said .
Those who 've had their work hours reduced or have lost their jobs may become eligible for SNAP .
The proposals include rental and mortgage assistance ; a ban on commercial and residential evictions ; expedited food security benefits ; grants and loans for impacted small businesses ; and improved health care access .
" This is a scary and uncertain time for Oregonians across the state , " House Speaker Tina Kotek , D-Portland , said in a statement .
" The Legislature is doing everything we can to act quickly to provide some certainty to people for essential needs like housing and food .
"  Meanwhile , Amazon employees at a New York City warehouse are planning to walk off the job Monday , as a growing number of delivery and warehouse workers demand better pay and protections in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic .

' '  Officials : Self-service gas pumps only if staffing is unavailable  One of the most distinctive parts of being an Oregon citizen , never pumping your own gasoline , will change temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
After lobbying by gas station owners in recent days , the Office of State Fire Marshal announced early Saturday the state 's ban on self-service of gasoline will be suspended from Saturday through April 11 .
Following the announcement , officials clarified that the suspension of the ban on self-service does not make self-service mandatory and would only need to happen at a retail gas outlet if the owner has limited staffing options .
" During this unprecedented time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply lines for fuels and other basic services remain uninterrupted , " said State Fire Marshal Jim Walker .
Only Oregon and New Jersey have bans on self-service gasoline .
In recent days the Oregon Fuels Association , which represents the state 's gas station owners , lobbied Gov .
Kate Brown in recent days , asking for the temporary change due to staffing issues they are facing .
" This is an emergency and we need immediate , temporary relief from Oregon 's self-service ban until the coronavirus public health crisis is over , " the group said in a letter to Brown , according to Willamette Week .
Oregon has banned self-serve gas since 1951 -- not diesel -- but in recent years has relaxed its rules in recent years .
