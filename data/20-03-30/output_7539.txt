Anthony C in Hoboken via text : Is there any chance the Mets bring back Matt Harvey to replace Noah Syndergaard in the rotation ? Say yes .
I would love to see Harvey come home , but in no way can he be guaranteed a role .
He 'll need to earn his way into the rotation ( or bullpen ) .

SNY 's Andy Martino reported earlier this week that a " reasonable expectation " for when Syndergaard returns is Memorial Day of the 2021 season , which is his final season of arbitration before free agency .

Murray-USA TODAY Sports ( Noah K .
Murray )  The Mets received some unfortunate injury news on Tuesday afternoon , as it was announced that right-hander Noah Syndergaard would be undergoing Tommy John surgery for a torn UCL .
Syndergaard began feeling discomfort in his pitching elbow before the coronavirus pandemic halted spring training , and with surgery set for this Thursday , there 's now a reasonable expectation that the Mets could be without Syndergaard until Memorial Day of 2021 .
Some of Syndergaard 's teammates and coaches voiced their support for the righty on social media after the news was announced .
Here 's a look at what other members of the Mets had to say :  From the time Noah Syndergaard rather famously added muscle during the winter of 2017 with the stated intention to throw even harder than 100-101 mph , I heard from pitching coaches past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Living Room : What 's next for the Mets now that Noah Syndergaard needs Tommy John surgery ?

So what direction will the Mets turn to in order to replace him in the rotation ? The Baseball Night in New York crew breaks down exactly what this means for the Mets and how it will impact them once the 2020 season eventually begins .

That surgery , which means the loss of Syndergaard for at least the entire 2020 season , will send ripple effects up and down the Mets ' roster in 2020 and beyond and could have a huge impact on Syndergaard 's personal future and his future with the Mets .
If you 're a Mets fan looking for context to help process the news that Noah Syndergaard needs Tommy John surgery , consider this : The season that Syndergaard will miss will be shorter -- and weirder -- than just about any other in history .
It 's the same silver lining that the Yankees stumbled into with Luis Severino , whose elbow also needed surgical reconstruction this spring .
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic , no one knows when baseball will return , or how long the season will be .

Mets ' Noah Syndergaard to undergo Tommy John surgery  Syndergaard will miss the entire 2020 season  In an enormous blow to the Mets ' 2020 season and potentially their 2021 season as well , right-handed pitcher Noah Syndergaard will undergo Tommy John surgery on Thursday due to a torn UCL in his right elbow , the team announced Tuesday .
" After experiencing discomfort in his elbow before Spring Training was suspended due to the pandemic , Noah and our health and performance department have been in constant contact , " Brodie Van Wagenen said in a statement .
" Based on the persistence of his symptoms , Noah underwent a physical examination and MRI that revealed the ligament tear .
A second opinion from Dr .
Neal ElAttrache confirmed the diagnosis and the recommendation for surgery .
Noah is an incredibly hard worker and a tremendous talent .

What caused the 2019 juiced baseballs in MLB and what will they be like in 2020 ? An astrophysicist explains  One small change could have a huge impact on pitchers  2019 was the year of the home run in Major League Baseball , with many balls that used to be ordinary fly outs sailing out of ballparks .
The combination of pitchers being unable to properly grip baseballs that were slicker and had lower seams and hitters taking aim at a ball that was flying differently once hit led to numbers that were staggering .
An MLB-record 6,776 home runs were hit during the 2019 season , up from 5,585 in 2018 .
There had been a spike from 2016 to 2017 as well ( 5,610 home runs to 6,105 home runs ) , but 2019 was simply a different animal .
And it transformed baseball into a different sport than it had ever been before , arguably for the worst .
