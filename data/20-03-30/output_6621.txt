Be grateful that you 're bored during the COVID-19 pandemic  The other night , as I began my prayers , I hesitated for a moment .
Then I prayed :  Thank you Lord , for my being bored today .
The reason I prayed that was because I realized I had the opportunity to be bored .
I woke up that morning , got dressed , walked my daughter 's dog , did the dishes , did the laundry , worked on my latest crochet project .
It does n't sound boring does it ? It is when that routine is on repeat daily .
We 're all in the Ground Hog Day movie .
Before the COVID 1-9 virus ( Coronavirus ) pandemic hit , my routine would n't be that much different except that when I got bored , I would head out on the bus and train to a museum and meet a friend for a little cultural enrichment .
If a friend or relative was n't available , I would go by myself .
I 'm an only child .
I can do " all by myself " really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually wake up every morning to be bored .
My family , extended family and friends are all healthy .
So if you 're bored , be grateful that you 're bored during the COVID-19 pandemic .
It means you have another day to live on repeat .
