Madison resident goes on CNN to warn : ' It can happen to you '  MADISON -- Jen Wadeyka of Douglas Avenue appeared on CNN with anchor Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night , March 25 , to emphasize a warning to the public about the Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic :  " It can happen to you .
"  Sadly , Wadeyka was uniquely qualified to deliver the message .
Her grandfather , Army veteran Ralph J .
Amato , 91 , of Parsippany , died of coronavirus Monday , March 23 .
Wadeyka , who has been " sheltering in place " but was running errands and shopping for her grandfather , looked at him through the window Friday , March 20 , and became alarmed at his condition .
She called 911 and watched him carried into an ambulance , bound for Morristown Memorial Hospital .
She never saw him again .
That same day Wadeyka , who similarly was " shopping and getting food " regularly for her mother , Karen Wadeyka of Basking Ridge , became concerned about her mother and again summoned an ambulance .
Her mother was transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The test was positive .
The family 's two emergencies happened on the same day , but the experiences were different .
Ralph Amato was admitted into the hospital March 20 .
Wadeyka 's mother was taken to the Emergency Room , where " they determined she could go home " but should be tested in one of the tents the hospital had set up in a parking lot , Wadeyka said .
" There was a 48-hour turnaround " for the result , she recalled , and it was positive for coronavirus .
" So she 's quarantined in her home , in her room , " Wadeyka said six days later , on March 26 .
" Today she did n't have a fever .
She 's taking medication and doing better .
She seems to be turning a corner .
"  Korean War Veteran  Wadeyka 's grandfather , Ralph J .
Amato , served as a Corporal in the Infantry Regiment of the Army during the Korean War and went on to graduate from St .
John 's University in New York City .
He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Fourth Degree member of the Knights of Columbus .
" He was very active in the VFW , " Wadeyka said , at Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) Post 5481 in Montville , serving on its Finance Committee and leading the VFW 's Eagle Scout programs .
While Wadeyka and her grandfather were both " sheltering in place , " she in Madison and he in Parsippany , and she was shopping for him , the 91-year-old Army veteran " was very active " and still left his home from time to time , Wadeyka noted .
" I told him , we have to take this ( self-isolation ) seriously .
"  Looking back , Wadeyka suspects her grandfather may have been stifling a cough during her regular visits in March , when they would talk through a window .
But when she visited him on March 20 he was visibly ill .
" He thought he had the flu , " Wadeyka said .
" I called an ambulance .
I was unable to visit him at the hospital , " due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died on March 23 , and Wadeyka said those same coronavirus restrictions prevent any gathering for a celebration of his life at this time .

" It 's really unfortunate .
We will do a Celebration of Life when this is all over , " Wadeyka said .
" Hopefully in the summer .

People are n't able to have a wedding .
Everybody 's struggling .
"  As for her own Madison household , with husband Josh Murray and children Molly and Cooper Murray , " We 're hanging in there , " Wadeyka said .
" We 're OK -- my kids , my husband -- so far , so good .
Obviously we 're not leaving the house , indefinitely .
