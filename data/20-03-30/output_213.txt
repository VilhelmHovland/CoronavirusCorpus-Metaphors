Hinduism prescribes funeral rites from a distance  And Hindu Council of New Zealand provides clarityNitika SharmaAuckland , March 31 , 2020  When we woke up two months ago , Covid-19 was something in the distance and life carried on as normal .
A month ago , it was nearer to us with the first case of Covid-19 confirmed in New Zealand .
As we wake up now , we are in a world that no one could have wished .
The feeling of being in our ' bubbles ' and our streets being empty is nothing but surreal .
But it is an important step that we need to take , united to stop the spread of this virus - together as one country and together as one people .
Lifestyle changes  Alert 4 Lockdown also means that our communities have had to make a number of changes to how they are practicing their dharma .
We thank the Hindu community for adopting this new normal so quickly and efficiently .
As we continue to understand how the lockdown applies to all other aspects of our lives , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we farewell our loved ones .
A difficult topic for some of us to talk about , it is an important conversation to be having to be prepared should the unfortunate situation , which no one wishes for , occur in our families .
Government regulations  The government has strict rules in place for when a loved one passes away , regardless of the cause .
These rules apply to everyone , every culture , every religion .
This means that we are no longer able to hold formal funerals , viewings or private funerals at homes .
We are aware of what we are asking our communities to sacrifice .
We are asking people to forgo the way that we have always said goodbye to our loved ones .
It is the one time in our lives that we do n't want to rush our emotions .
During these unprecedented times we are asking a lot of our communities , but this sacrifice is one we have to make .
Religious perspective  There have been several discussions around what this means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Antim Kriya , ' final rites .
We have been in discussion with a number of our learned pundits and guru 's in New Zealand and abroad .
Pundit Vasant Shukla of Acharya Ashram said that our Shastras mention about the ability to perform the final rites from a distance .
" There are prescribed ways to do this using Vidhi .
A lot in the Dharma is based on symbolism and there are ways that the rituals can be completed with the use of earthly materials that can represent the human body , " he said .
Acharya Ajay Tiwari said that the Hindu Dharma is very broad and age old .
" There are a number of ways of following the path to perform the rituals .
In our normal lives , we follow what is widely done and accepted .
But there are several things in our scriptures that are written for such situations .
This might be the time we have to use it and the wider community can also learn about it , " he said .
Pundit Tiwari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) who we do n't see , but we still perform Pooja on the Prateek ( representation ) .
" There are ways we can perform Antim Kriya on the Prateek of the departed .
We need to perform the rituals for the Sadgati ( Salvation or Liberation ) of the Atma , that is the important part here .
I will be willing to work with families to explain this if needed , " he said .
Two Options  The current guidance gives us two options : ( 1 ) Embalm the earthly remains of our departed one and wait for Alert 4 to be lifted and then hold the funeral ( 2 ) Funeral Directors take charge of the cremation .
In this situation , the ashes will remain with the Funeral Home and can be dispersed once the lockdown ends .
We ask why such stances need to be taken for a time when families and loved ones seek closure ?  This is because Covid-19 is now in our community in Aotearoa .
We need to do everything in our controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go .
This will protect the people in our communities with weakened immunities , those who have other underlying conditions and all those who are at increased risk .
The Dharma  We have a Dharma towards the rest of the community and now is the time to be looking after them selflessly as well .
This may be a big ask for some people and we understand it can be a very difficult situation .
We are in conversation with one funeral home so that there can be cameras available for people to participate in the final journey of their loved ones .
In case of the Funeral Directors taking charge of the cremation , a pundit can be available remotely with the family and funeral director to help facilitate the rituals .
Please do n't feel you are alone .
If required , get in touch with your Pundit to understand how they can support you and your family .
If in doubt , get in touch with us and we will connect you with someone who is set up and able to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pundits available who can help anyone through this time with full understanding of how what and why .
We are all in this together .
We have to unite and support each other during this time .
