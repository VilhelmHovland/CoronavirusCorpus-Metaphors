Even as Trump was excoriating GM , the automaker and its Seattle-area partner , Ventec Life Systems Inc .
, were closing in on a production date to build a machine called a VOCSN : ventilator , oxygen , cough , suction and nebulizer .
On March 18 , General Motors Co .
Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra told President Donald Trump 's economic adviser Larry Kudlow that the automaker might be able to help make much-needed ventilators , the scarce breathing machines used to keep coronavirus patients alive .
The deal would help the company , which has had tense relations with Trump .
It would help the administration , which faced charges that the pandemic caught it napping .
Most importantly , it would help the sickest patients , those facing death without machines to breathe for them .
But not 10 days later , Trump accused GM of foot-dragging and price-gouging in its effort to replenish the supply of medical equipment .
" Always a mess with Mary B , " Trump tweeted , just hours before invoking the Defense Production Act , which allowed him to order GM to move .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the effort -- order or no order -- and company officials say the sprint from first phone call to production will take about a month .
A parallel effort by Ford Motor Co .
is n't expected to bear fruit until June , though the company said it is speeding up its work .
Trump did an about face Sunday , saying GM is doing a " fantastic job .
"  Even as Trump was excoriating GM on Friday , the automaker and its Seattle-area partner , Ventec Life Systems Inc .
, were closing in on a production date to build a machine called a VOCSN : ventilator , oxygen , cough , suction and nebulizer .
When they start in mid-April , it will culminate a lightning effort to convert an auto-parts plant into a medical-equipment complex .
" The speed has been challenging , " Gerald Johnson , GM 's global vice president of manufacturing , said in a Sunday night interview .
" But we know it will save thousands of lives .
Making cars is cool , but it does n't compare to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploratory phone calls on March 17 from an ad hoc group of business leaders called StoptheSpread .
It was seeking ways to make up for what some members saw as a slow federal response to Covid-19 .
The group is led by retired American Express Co .
Chairman Ken Chenault and Rachel Carlson , founder of online education firm Guild Education Inc .
They asked Barra 's team what they needed to make ventilators .
GM needed a ventilator-making partner with an established product and a medical sales force .
For his part , Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said that he needed a partner with mass-manufacturing expertise , factories and a work force to produce on a huge scale to help cities like New York as patients overwhelm hospitals .

Exponential Growth  Managers from both companies got on the phone that evening and started exploring how GM could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month to 10,000 and eventually get on pace to make 200,000 this year .
The whole industry generally makes fewer than 100,000 a year .
It was growth meant to match the exponential spread of a disease that has sickened at least 125,000 Americans and killed more than 2,100 in the epidemic 's early weeks .
" They produce millions of cars a year in the U .
, " said Ventec Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brooks .
" We produce hundreds of ventilators a month .
They have a global supply base that understands making parts at large scale .
"  The next day , Barra told Kudlow that GM could pitch in .
Kudlow , one of the adminstration 's primary pitchmen , went on television with the idea .
He made GM an example of a company that was stepping up " on a voluntary basis for civic and patriotic reasons .
"  But GM was still studying how to make it happen .
On March 19 , Phil Kinley , vice president of manufacturing and labor and the plant-floor leader of the project , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson said .
Ventec sent technical specifications and drawings for the ventilator 's 700 parts to GM 's Tech Center in Warren , north of Detroit .
GM 's purchasing team went to work , Johnson said .
They contacted suppliers who make the small motors that run everything from automatic windows and wipers .
They called wiring producers and companies that make tubes and hoses .
By March 22 , GM had most parts lined up .
" The supply base really stepped up , " Johnson said .
Painstaking Assembly  ?  Work being done at the General Motors manufacturing facility in Kokomo , Indiana , where GM and Ventec Life Systems are partnering to produce Ventec VOCSN critical care ventilators in response to the COVID-19 pandemic .
?  The VOCSN , approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 , is primarily used for critical-care ventilation .
It also delivers concentrated oxygen to the patient , and has a nebulizer that sends medication to the lungs , secretion management that creates an artificial cough and a suction device to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its website that the 18-pound unit replaces 55 pounds of equipment .
To make something slightly larger than a toaster oven , a GM assembly plant was ill suited .
The assembly lines are made to swing a dashboard into the cabin of Buick .
Making a ventilator is more like building a watch : Assemblers work by hand at stations with tables and chairs .
That sort of operation is now being created in a GM parts plant in Kokomo , Indiana .
It has a clean room and 100,000 square feet that will contain two assembly lines .
GM and Ventec engineers are disassembling a VOCSN unit and reassembling it as they lay out the factory and the process , Johnson said .
" This is truly a major step at a critical moment , " said Harley Shaiken , a professor of labor economics at the University of California at Berkeley and longtime GM watcher .
" GM was written off and appears to be coming through .
"  Money Matters  GM and Ventec now need to decide how the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , which would likely buy and channel them through the Federal Emergency Management Agency , said people familiar with the matter .
That assumes a deal gets done .
To the surprise of GM and Ventec , Trump accused the automaker of trying to gouge the government during his Friday press briefing .
And he tweeted that GM officials " want top dollar .
"  GM said it 's building the units at cost and is only the contract manufacturer for Ventec , which is the major player in negotiations with the government .
The normally cost about $18,000 apiece , while some ventilators can run as high as $50,000 .
People familiar with negotiations said that there never was a firm proposal on volume or a timeline , and they were caught off guard when the president complained .
As negotiations go on , GM and Ventec are moving fast .
" The responsible thing for us to do is move forward and meet that need , " Brooks said .
There may a change in sentiment from Trump .
At his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think we have to worry about General Motors now .
