Andrew Cuomo seems to relish a New York-style give-and-take with President Trump .
: Anthony Behar / TNS  Gov .
Gavin Newsom 's decision to start holding daily briefings about the coronavirus crisis in California is a sign the state is about to go prime time in its fight against the pandemic -- and that Newsom will be the face of its response .
With Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti predicting his city will soon be inundated with COVID-19 cases like New York is now , the national spotlight is likely to be pointing at Newsom .
The leader of the world 's fifth-largest economy -- the " nation-state , " as Newsom likes to call it -- must become a reliable source of information , direction , foresight and comfort to 40 million Californians .
The fight " is entering a new phase , " Newsom declared Monday in the first of what his office said would be daily noontime briefings , taking the place of irregularly scheduled appearances that the governor was making in the early evening with only a few minutes ' notice .
Here 's some advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the military 's relief effort after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast in 2005 : " Stay away from the political narrative .
Stay on the logistics .
"  Related Stories  Honor ? was directing his comments largely at the media on MSNBC , but he could also have been speaking to any official charged with telling the public how government is coping with a disaster .
Newsom has largely adhered to that advice during his early handling of the state 's response .
He is treating President Trump as a business partner , not the enemy .
He is reaching out to and name-checking the California All-Stars in his phone -- Elon Musk , Nancy Pelosi , Mark Zuckerberg .
He is rattling off the tiniest of details -- " we have 4,252 ventilators locked down ' ' -- like they were his kids ' names .
Demonstrating a knowledge of the details builds trust during this time of chaos and misinformation .
It 's a contrast to Trump , who first publicly floated a return to normalcy by Easter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut before abandoning each possibility .
In some senses , Newsom is taking a cue from New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo , whose briefings are carried live daily on cable networks and have become must-viewing for many Americans locked in their homes , not just those in New York .
Cuomo 's mix of plain-spoken tough talk and sentimentality work because , like Trump , he 's from Queens -- it sounds authentic .
The other day , Cuomo ended his briefing by saying , " So I say , my friends , that we go out there today and we kick coronavirus ass .
"  That 's not the sort of thing Californians are likely to hear from Newsom -- it 's not his style , and not really the state 's style , either .
Newsom is likely to follow his own road map for how to " stay away from the political narrative " and " stay on the logistics " in the next few months :  Tangling with Trump : Cuomo has known Trump for decades and seems to relish their New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teleconference with the nation 's governors that " Cuomo of New York has to ' do more .
' "  Cuomo responded , " I have to do more ? No -- YOU have to do something ! You 're supposed to be the President .
" Trump later deleted his tweet .
Newsom , however , has engaged in a charm offensive with Trump since the pandemic ignited .
That 's quite a change considering that less than two months ago , Newsom called California " the most un-Trump state in America .
" He spent his two-plus years in office defining the state as the hub of the anti-Trump resistance .
Now , nearly every one of Newsom 's news conferences has included a note of thanks to the president , as when he praised Trump for promptly declaring a disaster in California and sending a military hospital ship to Los Angeles .
Placated , Trump has been on his best behavior as well .
Avoiding petty Twitter fights has helped keep the lines of communications open between Sacramento and Washington instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day .
Keeping it simple : Visual aids help .
Newsom does not use a teleprompter during his briefings , in part because he suffers from dyslexia , a learning disorder that makes reading difficult .
It takes an hour of preparation for every minute of a prepared speech he gives .
He occasionally uses notes at the rostrum during his more free-wheeling briefings .
To compensate , Newsom has developed an ability to recite a litany of statistics that is remarkable .
Asked on Monday how many Californians have been hospitalized , Newsom responded without glancing at notes , " 1,432 .
that number substantially higher than the first number we gave you a couple days ago , which was 746 .
"  Soon , however , the numbers start to blur .
Cuomo makes great use of PowerPoint charts to simply explain his updates .
Perhaps Newsom , the governor of Silicon Valley , will mix in a chart with the chat .
Talking about family : Cuomo has a decades-long history of being a ruthless political operator , starting when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov .
Mario Cuomo .
But now , the 62-year-old father of two adult daughters often invokes his family -- particularly the vulnerability of his 88-year-old mother , Matilda -- to bring the pandemic home in a softer way .
On Sunday , he encouraged New Yorkers to find " joy " in small ways .
He recalled the spaghetti and meatballs that his family would have every Sunday when he grew up .
He shared dinner with his mom and daughters via Skype and on the phone as a way to recapture that joy during the crisis .
Newsom , the 52-year-old father of four school-age children , is speaking to a different audience -- families trying to balance working from home while home-schooling their kids .
A few days ago , he said his daughter had told him she was upset she was out of school and missed her friends .
She threw pillows and her stuffed bunny on the floor .
The governor said he had told her during an hour-long conversation that , " Honey , I do n't think the schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of news -- that the governor assumed California 's schools would n't reopen until fall -- did n't carry any official weight .
And it may have surprised school administrators , many of whom have n't reached that decision yet .
But it showed his empathy for the anxiety that many California families were feeling .
It is a valuable quality for the leader of a nation-state to display .
" If I can tell my daughter that and not tell your daughter that , " Newsom said during his briefing , " then I 'm not being honest and true to the people of the state of California .
