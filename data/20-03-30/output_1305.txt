Coronavirus in Cumbria : Rate of case rise may start to fall in week  Coronavirus in Cumbria : Rate of case rise may start to fall in week  A CARLISLE-based academic says the lockdown is working and we could start to see a fall in the rate of increase in coronavirus cases in Cumbria within the week .
Dr John Campbell , who has been critical of the how late the decision to place the UK into lockdown was made , said : " It will start to fall from a 10 per cent increase to a nine per cent increase and so on , " he explained .
" Hopefully that would level off and new cases will start to fall and we will start to see the measures working through the incubation period .
" It will carry on getting worse for the next two weeks because of people already infected , then new cases start to decline as you start to get the benefit of the lockdown .
"  The worst period is just round the corner , according to the academic , who has more than half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come in two weeks ' time ( the peak ) and if we have had doubling of cases every five or six days we can expect the current number of cases to increase by another two or three times , " Dr Campbell said .
" Hopefully there will only be one more doubling .
Once in lockdown for a week we would hope to start seeing a reduction in the rate of increases .
" I would expect the lockdown measures to further reduce future transmission , with the rate this week much less than last week .
" The incubation period of the virus is six to seven days , so we can expect to see a continued increase from the social interactions last week -- before the lockdown .
" Given that people die of this two , three or four weeks after the onset of symptoms , we expect the number of deaths to increase in the next few weeks .
"  Dr Campbell is hopeful the peak of the virus in the UK will be less severe than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shutdown came later than I would have liked , I am hoping it will flatten the curve .
" I hope the lockdown has come early enough to prevent that , yes .
Without the lockdown we would have seen that , I believe .
I 'm hoping the lockdown is in time and people are fully compliant to prevent that nightmare scenario .
" The lockdown will be reviewed after three weeks and I expect it will be renewed for a further period of time , unless it is replaced by large-scale testing .
" It would not be a ludicrous suggestion that we will have another two to three weeks after the current three-week lockdown .
" Testing would mean the lockdown and isolation becomes specific to those who have the virus .
That means you can target the lockdown so it 's not for everyone .
" But social distancing will need to be maintained for the rest of the year .
We wo n't be shaking hands in 2020 .
"  The effects of the lockdown will come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A&amp;E nurse .
" The first thing we will notice is the rate of increases decline , then there will be no increases at all , then cases start to decrease , " he said .
