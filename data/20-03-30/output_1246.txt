An advertising recession is now highly probable in the first half of 2020 as COVID-19 hits key media owners  FMCG brands - which spend $97 .
on advertising - are likely to weather the storm better than other sectors , as sales of food , drink and hygiene products boom on Amazon and Tmall  Press Release  WARC Global Advertising Trends : FMCG &amp; COVID-19  30 March 2020 -- The global economy is set to fall into recession , with the advertising market likely to follow in the first half of this year , though FMCG brands are better-placed to weather the storm finds WARC , the international marketing intelligence service .
The Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) - a monthly survey of trading conditions among purchasing managers in private sector companies - for February and March show the worst results for the services sector in recent history across the US ( 39 .
, whereby a value below 50 indicates decline ) , UK ( 35 .
) , Japan ( 32 .
) , the Euro area ( 28 .
) and China ( 26 .
The COVID-19 crunch is filtering through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that COVID-19 is hitting ad bookings , while in the US NBCUniversal also expects a material impact , not least because its Olympic coverage has now been postponed .
UK broadcaster ITV reports the same , notably within the travel sector ( 5% of its 2019 ad revenue , or ? 91m ) and expects ad growth to be down 10% .
JCDecaux is anticipating a 10% dip too .
Baidu in China advises Q1 revenue will be down by as much as 18% while other online pure players , such as Alphabet , Twitter and Facebook are also exposed - digital channels are often the easiest to switch off in a time of crisis .
The last financial crisis removed $60 .
from the advertising market , with all media apart from online search recording declines in investment .
The market took eight years to recover from this shock after accounting for inflation and currency fluctuations .
James McDonald , Managing Editor , WARC Data , and author of the research , says : " The current downturn may not hit FMCG as hard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequential in terms of changing consumer purchasing behaviour .
A sharp increase in e-commerce activity may result in online players becoming more significant as the gatekeepers to FMCG shoppers .
"  FMCG better-placed to weather the storm  During the last advertising recession in 2009 , advertising investment among the food and drink sector fell at a far softer rate than the wider industry .
In the UK , the food sector reduced investment by 1 .
to ? 860m and the drinks sector by 2 .
to ? 321m .
This compares to a 5 .
fall for total FMCG ( to ? 1 .
) in the UK and an 11 .
dip for the total UK market ( to ? 13 .
TV was by far the hardest-hit advertising medium .
Sales revenue was down for each of the five largest FMCG companies in 2009 , though only P&amp;G ( -11 .
to $7 .
) and Coca-Cola ( -6 .
to $2 .
) cut ad investment .
As a share of sales revenue , advertising spend held during the last crash at Unilever ( 13 .
of sales , or ? 5 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( 33 .
, CHF36 .
) , Coca-Cola ( 9 .
, $2 .
) and L'Or ? al ( 30 .
, ? 5 .
The FMCG ad market was worth $97 .
in 2019 , a 15 .
share of global advertising spend .
Much of this money is spent online ; for example , 55 .
- $28 .
- of ad budgets in the household and domestic sector is invested in online advertising .
This compares to a 26 .
share ( $25 .
) for toiletries &amp; cosmetics .
The food and drinks sectors spend most on TV , at $17 .
and $16 .
respectively .
Brand-building is important within these sectors as products are sold via third-party retailers , not directly to consumers .
These sectors are better-placed to weather the impending recession as shoppers continue to buy the essentials ; the apparel , automotive , retail ( non-food ) , consumer durables and leisure &amp; tourism sectors will be disproportionately affected by a downturn .
FMCG sales boom on Amazon and Tmall as consumers adjust to ' the new normal '  One in four is now shopping more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to do so , followed by Gen Xers ( 25% ) .
Higher earners are also significantly more likely to than lower earners ( 48% versus 15% ) .
Most shoppers are going online at the expense of visits to the store ; this is particularly true in India ( 55% of consumers ) and China ( 50% ) , but also notable in Italy ( 31% ) , the US ( 23% ) , and the UK ( 18% ) .
A WARC analysis of Edge by Ascential data shows sharp rises in the sale of FMCG products on Amazon in the US and UK over the last few weeks , with growth far exceeding both Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday .
In the US , sales of hand sanitiser were up by over 650% compared to a year earlier , and 450% compared to Prime Day .
Sales of pantry staples , vitamin C and disinfecting wipes more than doubled .
Nielsen also recorded sharp rises in grocery sales across all US outlets , notably for powdered milk ( +85% ) , dried beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rice ( +25% ) .
The picture was similar in the UK ; sales of antiseptics &amp; disinfectants were up by almost 300% on Amazon , while sales of soaps &amp; hand wash trebled .
In China , sales of face masks , oral mouthwash , snacks &amp; confectionary and alcohol have more than doubled , according to data from Yimian .
The upshot of increased e-commerce activity is that online players may become more significant as the gatekeepers to FMCG shoppers .
For the big manufacturers , this may increase the importance of DTC or subscription offers .
