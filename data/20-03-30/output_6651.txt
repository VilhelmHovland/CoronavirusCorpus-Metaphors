OPINION  If Trump signs coronavirus relief checks , he should also sign sympathy cards  Opinion : This is what happens when a president wants all of the credit -- now .
And none of the blame -- ever .
President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus on March 25 , 2020 .
( Photo : Alex Brandon/AP )  We 're all in this together , right ?  When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is going to be a lot of finger pointing .
Some good .
Some bad .
We hopefully will honor and reward the many ordinary Americans who heroically kept the country running during the pandemic by daily performing what we think of as ordinary , even mundane , jobs and which we 've come to understand were anything but .
Instead , they were on the front lines , braving risk to serve .
Likewise , there will be politicians who performed with grace and wisdom , and those who shrank from the task or were overwhelmed by the responsibilities .
But all of that should come later , and it will for most .
But not President Donald Trump .
He wants his praise .
And he wants to be absolved of any blame .
Trump gives himself 10 out of 10  The massive coronavirus aid bill was passed unanimously by the Senate and nearly the same by the House .
Trump thanked " Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " the buck stops here " philosophy when it comes to the presidency .
' If they do n't treat you right , do n't call '  If anything , Trump 's need to repress criticism could put people at risk .
Trump said he encourages Vice President Mike Pence to avoid calling governors if they do n't express enough appreciation for the federal government 's assistance .
Trump said , " If they do n't treat you right , I do n't call .
"  We just surpassed 2,000 lost to the virus .
The experts say we should expect many thousands more .
At least the president extended the White House 's social distancing guidelines until April 30 .
Though there is no way of knowing if that is enough .
The virus sets the timeline , not Trump .
He 's busy anyway , tweeting about the ratings on his press briefings .
Because the " Ratings " of my News Conferences etc .
are so high , " Bachelor finale , Monday Night Football type numbers " according to the @nytimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reaching too many people , we must stop him .
" said one lunatic .
See you at 5:00 P .
