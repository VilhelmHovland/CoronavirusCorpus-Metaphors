House Deputy Minority Floor Leader Carlos Zarate has called on the national government to observe transparency in the use of the multi-billion allocations under the additional powers granted by Congress to President Rodrigo Duterte for COVID-19 crisis response .
" The Duterte administration should be very transparent on how they will spend the billions of funds that Congress authorize and already in its disposal , " he said .
Zarate stressed the national government should stop insulting health workers by allocating merely P500 daily compensation for volunteer medical frontliners .
He said most health workers are willing to give their services for free but in return , the government should be transparent on dispensing the P275-billion funds under the Bayanihan Act of 2020 .
Instead of compensating volunteer health professionals with such meager amount , it would be better to " hire them for the period of emergency , " according to Zarate .
" Even if you compensate them the maximum of P50,000 per month , it will only amount P60M for two months , which the government can certainly provide , " he said .
The lawmaker from Bayan Muna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time after the first COVID-19 case in the country was identified .
He claimed that " the DOH dilly dallied as admitted himself by Sec .
Francisco Duque " and that the current response is still not suited for this type of crisis .
" As it is there are still no mass testing in communities identified with COVID-19 cases .
There are still no pro-active community tracing , " said Zarate .
" There so many hospitals calling for masks and personal protective equipment ( PPEs ) .
People in communities are now getting hungry because we are now entering the third week of the lockdown but relief goods have not reached them , " he added .
