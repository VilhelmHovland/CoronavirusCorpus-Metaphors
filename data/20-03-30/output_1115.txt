The Prime Minister 's top adviser Dominic Cummings is now self-isolating after developing symptoms of coronavirus over the weekend .
Boris Johnson tested positive for coronavirus last week and is self-isolating in Downing Street .
The Prime Minister was advised by the Chief Medical Officer to take the test on Thursday after he experienced mild symptoms of the disease .
Shortly afterwards Matt Hancock , the Health Secretary , announced that he had contracted the virus , and was self-isolating too .
So who else at the top of government has caught coronavirus and will be out of action for the next week or so ? The Cabinet has recently begun using the video-conferencing software Zoom to conduct meetings , but several ministers have continued to travel to their offices , Downing Street and Parliament as the virus has spread , making them likely targets of the disease .
