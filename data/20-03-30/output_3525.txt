Royal Free calls for financial donations in ' direct appeal to community '  THE Royal Free has made an appeal for financial donations for the first time during the coronavirus crisis with the launch of an ' emergency fund ' .
Many staff at the Pond Street hospital in Hampstead are looking after patients with coronavirus while trying to maintain services to others who do not have COVID-19 but still desperately need hospital care .
The NHS trust 's charity said donations would be spent on care packages , " psychological support " and " physical respite spaces " for staff working " very long shifts " .
Much has been funded by government " but not everything " , a statement said .
" We are reaching out directly to the local community , " said Judy Dewinter , the Royal Free Charity 's chair of trustees .
" We are asking your local NHS staff what they need and your response is going to make a real difference to their lives .
Your donation will go directly to help them as they work under pressure and in the most challenging of circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pocket money and offers of help from individuals and local businesses .
We want the message to be loud and clear for staff at our hospitals : ' You are our heroes and we will support you with whatever you need .
' "  The New Journal has published stories detailing the pressure staff are working under and concerns about that resources are stretched to breaking point .
There are 10,000 NHS staff at Royal Free London hospitals -- which include Barnet and Chase Farm as well as the Royal Free in Pond Street .
The Royal Free has followed the Whittington , which launched a similar scheme last week .
The Royal Free NHS trust Chairman Dominic Dodd said : " Every person on our team -- from the doctors and nurses to the porters , cleaners and support staff , is playing a vital role in being there for others during this emergency .
Please join our team effort by showing your appreciation , gratitude and solidarity for them at this very difficult time .
