In recent days an elderly Norfolk resident was targeted by a cold caller claiming to be from an electricity company , while in Suffolk there were reports of people pretending to be from British Red Cross .
A spate of similar crimes across the country has prompted the NCA to urge vigilance amid unprecedented circumstances .
Steve Rodhouse , director general of the agency , said : " Like all organisations we are having to make some adjustments to how we operate in light of the outbreak .
" We recognise COVID-19 may provide opportunities for criminals , and we are monitoring crime trends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NCA is providing services that directly keep the public safe and also allow others across law enforcement to do the same , and these will be maintained throughout the pandemic .
" I would ask the public to remain vigilant during this difficult time and report anything they think might be suspicious .
"  Earlier this week a man from north Norfolk narrowly avoided being scammed by a cold caller , who claimed to be from a company called Southern Electric .
The caller said they would visit the resident 's home at midday and , in exchange for a cash payment of ? 520 , a credit of ? 5,000 would be put onto the resident 's electricity bill " as part of us helping people though the Coronavirus outbreak " .
Norfolk Trading Standards has since told the public to " hang up " in such situations and never to " hand over large cash payments or purchase gift cards to access larger amounts in return or refunds " .
Across the border , Suffolk Trading Standards issued a warning after elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they were from the British Red Cross .
