Wenceslao : Covid times , 1  +  AA  -  Candid Thoughts  March 27 , 2020  THURSDAY afternoon , one day before the announced implementation of a " possible lockdown " in Cebu that had some people missing the word " possible " in the announcement :  I drove my vehicle to the store intending to use it in my effort to replenish supplies , only to be told that traffic was a problem from the Bulacao area to Tabunok in Talisay down to Minglanilla , the usual " choke " points .
" Mora'g pista sa Tabunok , " somebody told me .
Another offered an explanation : People were in a rush to go home to prepare for the " lockdown .
"  I decided to instead do things without the vehicle and rode a " trisikad " to the highway .
Traffic flow at our portion of the highway was only slow going to Tabunok .
There seemed to be no problem going to the town proper .
I stood on the sidewalk to get a ride only to realize that the passing passenger multicabs and tricycles were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heck , " I told myself .
I used to jog-walk from our place to the jurisdiction of the next local government unit , so why not walk to the town proper ? On the way , I passed by my " suki " bodega of grains to buy a sack of rice and a sack of corn grits .
A black SUV and a truck and some people were immediately visible in the bodega , meaning that panic buying that began a day before had eased only by a bit .
After paying for my purchase , I resumed my walk to the town proper to buy food from a popular branch of a fastfood chain there .
It was then that I noticed the others walking with me along the sidewalk .
Workers , I thought , judging from their muscular build and the bag slung from their shoulders , probably containing a spare T-shirt and a " bawon " for lunch .
They were among those stranded in Bulacao and chose to walk all the way home .
Jollibee at the town proper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine in .
I washed my hands with the hand sanitizers placed in a bottle on a stand near the door after which the guard took my temperature using what I call a " temperature gun " aimed at my forehead .
I bought take-out food for my boys and french fries and soft drinks for myself that I told the staff to wrap for take-out but which I actually consumed seated on one of the deserted chairs and using one of the deserted tables inside .
Nobody reprimanded me for it .
I was already tired , so walking was no longer an option in going back to the bodega to get the sacks of rice and corn grits that I had purchased .
I proceeded to a corner not far from Jollibee and saw two habal-habal drivers , a man and a woman , there .
I picked the more accommodating , the woman , who brought me to the road that branched off from the highway near the bodega .
One side of that road was where tricycles going to the interior were parked .
There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God , the fee to bring to my store the sacks of grain that I had purchased .
It was n't a lockdown yet or enhanced community quarantine to prevent the spread of the virus that has caused a worldwide pandemic .
But the displacement it caused was like we were preparing for World War 3 .
