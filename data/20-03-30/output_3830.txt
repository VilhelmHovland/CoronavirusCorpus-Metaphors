" Steps taken so far .
will give India victory over coronavirus , " he vowed .
Authorities estimate around 300,000 jobless and hungry labourers have hit the roads .

Repeats the release about govt providing shelter people as per " standard protocol " ( which apparently only applies if you are piss poor )  A major concern in India is that the hundreds of thousands of workers going homes will spread the virus deep into the hinterland , said a top health official .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like having migratory populations moving from one place to another .
Like non-affected states , adjoining affected states , " said Dr S K Singh , director of the National Centre for Disease Control , which investigates and recommends control measures for outbreaks .
Many experts doubt the official number of Covid-19 cases and deaths and say that India is testing far too few people .
" This migration has taken it ( the virus ) to small towns and villages , " Virologist Shahid Jameel at the Wellcome Trust DBT India Alliance said .
The numbers are small compared with the US , Italy and China , but experts fear these precautions wo n't be enough for India 's beleaguered , under-funded and under-staffed health system to stave off an epidemic .
Migration compared with 1947 partition  Police said four migrants were killed on Saturday when a truck ran into them in the western state of Maharashtra .

For the economic migrants who may test coronavirus positive , " the fatality rates may be higher only because of the long walk back home , " Indian economist and migration expert Chinmay Tumbe told The Indian Express .

India has overstretched its health infrastructure .
There 's one state-run hospital for every 55,591 people on average and one hospital bed for every 1,844 people .
India needs about 10 times more doctors to meet the norms prescribed by the World Health Organization , a shortfall of at least 500,000 doctors .
Experts fear that an epidemic would cause other routine health care functions to suffer .
" Everything will become about Covid-19 .
And other routine services like immunisation or taking care of maternal mortality would be affected , " said Anant Bhan , a global health and policy expert .
Other experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared its concerns and when the first coronavirus death was reported in India in January .
" India lost a good lead time when we knew that this was a pandemic in the making .
The government had been warned in advance and asked to watch-out , soon after China announced that this was transferred between animals and humans via social contact , " said Dr T Jacob John , India 's leading virologist , who formerly headed Indian Council for Medical Research 's Centre for Advanced Research in Virology .
" The purpose of a lockdown is to buy 21 days before widespread community transmission occurs .
The 21-day time is only to buy more time or let 's say to delay the transmission so that the government can make frantic preparations , " he said .
" A pandemic needed three months to go around the world , and see where we are now .
We would have been better off if we the government had taken it seriously in early January .
"  India ranks 184th out of 191 in terms of GDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spends slightly over one percent of its total GDP on health care .
India spent an average of $62 .
per person on health care in 2016 , compared to China 's $398 .
" The last time a needs-based survey was done for India 's health care was in 1946 , " Dr John said , adding that the country 's " health management system is very inadequate for India 's existing problems , let alone new ones .
"  While coronavirus makes inroads , Modi 's right-wing government has been slammed for willingness to tolerate unscientific thinking for years .
" The prime minister and his colleagues have held intellectuals and experts in disdain , and promoted traditional medicine in the past , undermining the health ministry 's efforts to combat misinformation by endorsing homoeopathic prophylactic treatment , " senior journalist Vidya Krishnan wrote in The Atlantic .
Before lockdown order , Modi also announced a single-day " people 's curfew " for March 22 and asked Indians to beat utensils and ring bells at 5 pm to show support for health workers .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many Indian states with festive fervour , undermining the government 's social distancing call to avoid coronavirus .
However , there still appears to be broad support for strong measures such as a lockdown .
But opposition leaders , analysts and some citizens are increasingly criticising its implementation .
In particular , they say Modi 's government appears to have been caught off guard by the mass movement of migrants following the announcement , which threatens to spread the disease into the hinterlands .
The government " had no contingency plans in place for this exodus , " tweeted opposition politician Rahul Gandhi as images of migrant labourers walking long distances to return home dominated local media .
#ModiMadeDisaster was a top trending topic in India on Sunday on social media site Twitter .
