Leaving home , outside of essential functions like grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail , Gov .
Larry Hogan said as part of his latest attempt to slow the COVID-19 pandemic in Maryland .
The stay-at-home order announced on Monday comes as the state saw nearly 180 new cases of the disease in 24 hours and the number of deaths go from five on Friday to 17 by Monday evening .
" Marylanders need to know that , unfortunately , we are only at the beginning of this crisis , and it is going to get considerably worse before it gets better , " Hogan said during a press conference .
No Marylander should leave their home unless it is for an essential job or essential reason such as obtaining food and medicine , Hogan said .

Brian Witte  Any person who violates the order is subject to a misdemeanor charge and up to one year in jail , a fine up to $5,000 , or both , Hogan said .
Essential businesses must make every effort to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no out-of-state travel unless absolutely necessary , Hogan said , and those who do travel out of state should self-quarantine for 14 days upon return .
No one should use any mode of public transportation unless absolutely necessary , Hogan added .
Marylanders can go walking , running or biking , as long as they follow social distancing guidelines and do not gather in groups 10 or more , according to the governor 's order .
People may also take care of a friend , family member , pet or livestock animal , but there are reasons for taking such drastic measures .
" This is a deadly public health crisis .
We are no longer asking or suggesting Marylanders stay home .
We are directing them to do so , " Hogan said .
The governor has asked local and state law enforcement to enforce the stay-at-home order .

In announcing the stay-at-home order , Hogan said essential businesses , which were not closed under a previous executive order , should scale down the amount of staff working and institute telework as much as possible .
Grocery stores will likely cut back on employees , Mike Ricci , Hogan 's spokesman , said in a tweet .
They are already taking steps to protect both staff and customers .
" We want more businesses to do the same , " Ricci tweeted .
Liquor stores will stay open , although people are encouraged to use delivery where possible .
The governor also ordered remote notarizations , Ricci said .
While the executive order does not say who can go on walks together , Deputy Secretary of Public Health Services Fran Phillips said during the press conference to only go on walks with people in the same household and for a short period of time .
So far , local law enforcement agencies have not had much trouble enforcing compliance with the ban on gatherings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliant with closures .
The Frederick Police Department responded to 10 calls for large gatherings between 5 p .
March 16 through Sunday , none of which were located by the time officers arrived , according to Sgt .
Matt Carado , a department spokesman .
In that same time period , officers also conducted 165 business compliance checks and 1,208 patrol checks of businesses and other public places like parks , but no instances of noncompliance were found , the sergeant said .
While the county sheriff 's office was not conducting compliance checks on businesses , that agency had not received a single call from 5 p .
March 16 through Sunday for reports of gatherings of 10 people or more , according to Taylor Clarke , a sheriff 's office spokeswoman .
" The citizens and businesses in our areas of responsibility are generally cooperative and compliant of the governor 's orders , " Clarke said in an email .

Hogan 's executive orders are being observed such as restaurant carry-out only restrictions and not having more than 10 people in one location in other types of establishments .
State troopers based in the county were also finding overall compliance , according to Lt .
Wayne Wachsmuth .
Troopers received fewer than 10 calls for service regarding large gatherings , all of which were handled and dispersed when troopers arrived to explain the order and hand out information pamphlets rather than formal citations , according to the lieutenant .
Troopers did identify a small number of non-compliant businesses in the 496 compliance checks the agency conducted from 5 p .
March 16 through 1 p .
Monday , including a comic book store and a few hair and nail salons , but all of those businesses immediately closed once the order was explained , Wachsmuth wrote in an email .
" From our perspective , most residents of Frederick County are keeping with the governor 's orders , " Wachsmuth said .
" Moreover , we 've observed a steep decline in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maryland continue to riseCases of COVID-19 in Maryland reached 1,413 according to the daily numbers released by the Maryland Department of Health Monday .
However , these numbers do not include cases in Washington , Carroll and Frederick counties , bringing the total to 1,418 as of 10 a .
Frederick County announced an additional two cases Monday , bringing the total in the county to 29 .
Three of the Frederick cases have recovered , with five currently hospitalized .
There have not been any deaths in the county .
However , deaths in the states increased to 15 over the weekend .
Howard County Executive Calvin Ball announced a 16th death , which was not included in the state counts .
A second death at the nursing home in Mount Airy was also announced Monday , according to the Carroll County Times .
While numbers in the state rose by a smaller percentage from Sunday to Monday , there continues to be limitations to tests available , Phillips said .
There is also a backlog in testing facilities due to limitations with testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-month-old , Hogan announced during his press conference .
Of the five cases in people nine and under , two of them are infants .
" We have reached a critical turning point in the fight to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic here in Maryland and the National Capital region , which includes Washington , D .
and Virginia , " Hogan said during his press conference .
The state has had its first outbreak , in the Pleasant View Nursing Home in Carroll County .
Currently , 67 residents have tested positive for the disease and 27 members of the staff have now reported symptoms , Hogan said .
Hogan also announced that four Fort Meade employees have tested positive for the disease .
Soon after Hogan 's press conference , The Baltimore Sun reported an outbreak at Clifton T .
Perkins , a psychiatric hospital mostly involving forensic patients , which affected patients and staff .
Hogan referenced Dr .
Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases , who said the United States could see millions of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To put that in perspective , that would mean more American deaths than the Vietnam War and the Korean War added together , " Hogan said .
There have been at least 67 hospitalizations in 24 hours , Phillips said .
She stressed that people need to stay home to help address the crisis .
Together , Maryland will get through the crisis , she said .
" We stayed home , we missed schools , we missed our friends , all of our normal routines so we could fight this virus and save lives , " Phillips said .
" We will say we gave up so much for a while in order to save our loved ones , friends , neighbors and countless others that we will never know .

( 81 ) comments  In times like these with panic buying going on all over , all gun owners should be required to turn their guns over to local police for the duration .

Glad to see liquor stores are still allowed to be open Essential is essential does .
Stop paying Federal , State , and Local Government non-essential workers and you can be assured the lock down will be a lot shorter .
Is there anyone in the government financially suffering because of covid-19 ? No .
all are being paid essential , non-essential , etc .
If you read the executive order it clearly states what you can and ca n't do .
I did n't find it on the MD government page , but through the governor 's twitter page .
It 's 8 pages and I could n't find anything about guarantee of 14 days if you leave the state and comeback .
The media needs to do a better job of accurately reporting the information rather than hastily publishing something and causing panic and confusion .
Serious question .
What types of activities is Hogan trying to crack down on ? I ask because I 've only been leaving my house for grocery shopping and occassional takeout .
I have n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looked suspicious to me .
It 's like , really , who cares who is right and who is wrong .
I do n't care if I 'm wrong .
I have my family .
I have a nice piece of land and residence .
I have great friends .
Business is good .
If I 'm wrong on an Internet forum , big deal .
Life is good .
Do n't gather in groups and socialize , if you get enough exposure it means the virus could over-run any immune system .
More people infected together equals every one 's immune system getting hit harder .
Just like how groups of animals tend to produce disease , that is where this strain also arises from .
" you can still go walking and jogging " The idea is to keep your distance from others .
The virus has a limited distance in expression , 6 to 8 ft .
I run ? ? and keeping a distance from others by no closer than 12 ft .
Exercise , fresh air , and sunshine are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use COMMON SENSE , maintain social distancing ( 6 foot minimum ) , avoid gathering in groups etc .
He 's talking about going out to shop because you 're bored , etc .
It 's probably mostly spread through coughs and sneeze droplets .
Once it hits the ground , it is not going to infect anyone .
If an infected person sneezes and nobody is within 6 feet or so , there is almost no danger of transmission .
Depending on the surface , some small percentage of the viruses can survive up to a few days , but the main spread is through droplets from sneezes and coughs that land directly on someone else 's hands or face .
These droplets stay in the air only for seconds .
Those experiments showing the virus can survive in the air are probably under laboratory conditions where the virus is suspended in air .
Additionally , keep in mind that the ultraviolet light in sunlight can kill the virus fairly quickly .
The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too heavy to hang in the air .
They quickly fall on floors or surfaces .
You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19 , or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes , nose or mouth before washing your hands .
"  From what I read , the study in question did not involve droplets .
It used a nebulizer to blow virus into the air in a lab setting .
They kept the virus in the air and tested its viability after different time points .
The study was designed to show how long the virus could stay viable in air , but it was not simulating a sneeze or cough .
I think the study was over-hyped , and a lot of people misunderstood the test design - maybe even Dr .
Fauci .
I do n't know why some are saying that sunlight does not kill the coronavirus .
I have not seen studies on that , but I have seen a recent study on sunlight killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? term=Sch .
What this article does n't say is that Pleasant View is shipping all their residents to the hospital because they do n't have staffing to take care of them .
That nursing home needs to be on isolation and not have this patients sent to the hospital which is putting more people at risk !  Really , you only need to apply " habeas corpus " when you have a plurality violating the state order .
Today , most people will apply with ' a state emergency ' , an euphemism for ' martial law ' .
The overwhelming majority will not even consider ' personal rights ' understanding the seriousness of the matter .
In addition , the governor implemented a penalty of one year in jail and/or a $5,000 fine for each violation .
Yes , the far majority of maryland citizens recognize the seriousness of the virus and will comply but there will be some ' knuckleheads ' out there .
The national guard will assist , if needed the local police and state troopers to implement the shut-down policies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and for what reason ) , control over movement , social gathering throughout the state .
That 's the definition of martial law .
If you like to test it on a constitutional basis , try riding around the county after 8pm to night .
Let me know how that worked out for you .
See how easy it is to get Americans to give up their " personal rights " .
If American ingenuity does not come up with a vaccine by next winter are you ready to do this all over again ? Why does n't the world do this for climate change ? Does n't that pose a much dire consequence than COVID19 ?  And , we always react to the immediate threat .
Trump is a perfect example of that .
Not having the ability to look long term only reacting to what 's right in front of his face .
But in response to your question , Is there a rule that says we most wait on American ingenuity to come up with a vaccine or can we collaborate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from universal knowledge .
French biologist , microbiologist and chemist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination , microbial fermentation and pasteurization .
He is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases , and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since .
Also , it 's ironic , that satellite images released by NASA and the European Space Agency show a dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide emissions released by vehicles , power plants and industrial facilities between January and February .
According to space images by NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center there 's a 21% drop in pollutant in or atmospheric .
Even our waterways are clearing of pollutants .
I doubt this will be much enforcement .
Probably the focus will be on breaking up groups of people with very few fines unless people resist dispersing .
Remember the police are also supposed to social distance .
Mainly because of the " young " spring break minded " adults " .
That 's why some locations are taking down community bball hoops and tennis nets .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cities like Baltimorgue that refuse to socially distance .
According to the article , " Marylanders can go walking , running or biking , as long as they follow social distancing guidelines and do not gather in groups 10 or more , according to the governor 's order .
"  Exercise , fresh air , and sunshine are essential to well being .
As he said , just use COMMON SENSE , maintain social distancing ( 6 foot minimum ) , avoid gathering in groups etc .
