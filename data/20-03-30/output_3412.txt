Publicans seek help from landlords during shutdown  The Vintners Federation of Ireland , which represents publicans around the country , is asking landlords to help local pubs survive the coronavirus pandemic .
The VFI is asking landlords to meet with their tenant publicans and come to an understanding about rent payments during the nationwide shutdown of pubs during this health crisis .
The government asked all pubs in the country to close down earlier this month in order to prevent people from spreading Covid-19 .
" Since the enforced shutdown we have worked with the banks , TV subscription services , drink suppliers and other suppliers to come to an agreement about forbearance and payment suspension for the coming months , " said VFI Chief  " The clear majority , understanding the crisis pubs are facing , have made meaningful efforts to accommodate our members , " he added .
" We need landlords to exercise the same understanding because there is little point in demanding money that is n't there .
"  " We need to work together to get through the current crisis .
The relationships we strengthen now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading easier for all .
"  This plea for help comes as the VFI has condemned those pubs which have chosen to open despite the governments guidance that they should close .
Though the initial guidance was a request , new emergency legislation passed last week gives Health Minister Simon Harris the power to shut down premises that are not complying .
Beyond just this shutdown , Minister Harris has said himself that " we will remember those who undermined the health and wellbeing of our people when it comes to renewing licences " .
