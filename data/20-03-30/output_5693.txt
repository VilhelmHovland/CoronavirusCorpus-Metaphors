Dr Manoj Goel , Director Pulmonology Fortis Memorial Research Institute , Gurugram has so far treated six patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 , of which three have been discharged and are currently quarantined at home .
In this article Dr Goel speaks to The Better India about what happens from the time one tests positive until it is time for them to be discharged .
" To begin with , as per the government order , as of now , anybody who tests positive for COVID-19 has to get admitted , " says Dr Goel .
Most often patients come in with one or more symptoms , which may include -- cough , fever , or even breathing difficulty .
" As soon as we establish that a patient has tested positive for COVID-19 , we carry out some more baseline investigations , which may include a blood test and a chest x-ray .
Following this the patient is put into an isolation ward , " informs Dr Goel .
What are Isolation Wards ?  Stay at home and stay safe .
The isolation ward is an exclusive area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Once the patient is inside the isolation ward , we monitor all their vitals in a controlled environment through both general medication as well as individual treatment , " he shares .
Not just this , Dr Goel also speaks about the protective gear that the medical personnel put on before entering the isolation ward .
" What we wear is a sort of spacesuit , which is airtight .
All of us , doctors , nurses , and the para-medical staff wear this .
Once we put this on in at the start of our shift , we remain in it for eight hours .
"  Also , while wearing this suit , the staff can not eat , or drink , visit the washroom , or even take it off for a few minutes in between .
" For the entire duration of our shift , we are in it .
All we do is look after the patients inside the isolation ward , " explains Dr Goel .
When is it Safe for the Patient to go Home ?  " Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) we collect samples again to test and after we get two consecutive negative samples , we discharge the patient , " says Dr Goel .
However , even after discharge , the doctors advise the patient remain in home quarantine for at least 14 days following which they are advised to be cautious for another 14 days , which includes wearing a mask if stepping out .
" So at least for 28 days after the test reports are negative , we advise that patients remain under isolation and cautious , " says Dr Goel .
Being in the Isolation Ward  Representational image  " At present we have patients in need of various degrees of care being placed together in the isolation ward .
The ward in itself is self-sufficient ; as we have everything we need inside .
From ventilators to monitoring devices , " says Dr Goel .
Shedding light on the diet that is usually prescribed to patients of COVID-19 , he says , " They are given a very balanced nutritious diet , which is rich in proteins including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can or can not eat , we just ensure that the food being prepared and served is wholesome .
"  The Mental Well-Being of the Patient  " In most cases , we have seen that the patient and the immediate family have tremendous faith in the team of medical professionals who are treating the patient .
That helps to a great extent .
Other than that , we ensure that we counsel not just the patient but also the family , who , in most cases , can not visit and have no idea as to how the patient is coping .
"  Since even the family members are under home-quarantine , there is not much scope for interaction between them .
" However , we do encourage them to video call and use technology to stay in touch during these difficult times , " he says .
The doctors also ensure that the family is apprised of the situation and are kept in the know of what is happening with the patients .
" Initially , when the patients come to us they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it .
However , with repeated counselling , the patient 's fear are allayed , " says Dr Goel .
How Does the Medical Team Stay Motivated ?  Dr Manoj Goel  " The medical fraternity started preparing for this since the time we heard about the outbreak in China .
We knew it would spread to the rest of the world and we started mentally preparing ourselves as well to deal with the sudden outburst , " says Dr Goel .
" We are not scared of COVID-19 , " he says and continues , " Not just me , but the entire staff at the hospital knows what we are dealing with .
Whether it is the administration or the support staff , we are all on the same page .
"  It has taken a lot of hard work but Dr Goel feels that the spirit of each member at the hospital is very high and they are more than ready to fight this .
" Stay home and stay safe , " he says as we conclude our conversation .
