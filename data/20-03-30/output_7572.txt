Wimbledon is expected to be canceled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic , a German tennis official said Monday .
German Tennis Federation Vice President Dirk Hordorff told Sky Sports Germany that an official announcement is expected Wednesday .
Wimbledon , which runs two weeks at the All-England Lawn Tennis Club in southwest London , was scheduled to begin June 29 .
" The necessary decisions have already been made , " Hordorff said , via TMZ Sports .
" Wimbledon will decide to cancel Wednesday .
There is no doubt about it .
This is necessary in the current situation .
"  Wimbledon was last canceled during World War II .
There were no tournaments from 1940-45 , and also 1915-18 during World War I .
" It is completely unrealistic to imagine that with the travel restrictions that we currently have an international tennis tournament where hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world would travel , " Hordorff said .
" That is unthinkable .
