While many residents have a home to spend the 21 days of lockdown in , many of the Cape 's homeless do not have a family member who would take them in during this time .
The City of Cape Town has begun steadily moving the homeless to various shelters across the metropole and outliers , with the Culemborg site being one of the first .
Tents were set up at the parking lot adjacent to the City 's Culemborg Safe Space , along with sanitation facilities .
Those who are there will also be employing appropriate social distancing measures .
According to a statement by Mayco Member for Health Services Zahid Badroodien , the homeless persons will be escorted by the City of Cape Town 's Law Enforcement Department .
" City Health will also be onsite to screen individuals and ensure that they are not presenting symptoms of COVID-19 , " he added .
" Work is also underway at the Paint City site in Bellville and it should be able to go online within the next three to five days .

" The search for temporary shelter is taking some time , after initial sites , touted by the national government , were subsequently withdrawn , " Badroodien said .
" We understand that there has been immense interest in this particular issue , and we assure the public that we are doing everything possible to provide safe spaces for our street people during this challenging time .
"  Numerous other options are being considered , but have not been finalised , as the spaces are not readily available for habitation without extensive work being carried out first .
" The City will provide updates on the situation as these become available , but we would like to emphasise that it is a matter we take very seriously and we are working furiously to bring to resolution , " Badroodien added .
