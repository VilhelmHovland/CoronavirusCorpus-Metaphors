Province also confirms 4 cases of community transmission , including Saskatoon and Regina  Scott Livingstone , the CEO of the Saskatchewan Health Authority , said the modelling of worst-case scenarios was a necessary part of planning the province 's response to the COVID-19 coronavirus .
( Guy Quenneville/CBC )  There are now 72 cases of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan , up from 66 on Monday .
Of those cases , four are instances of community transmission : cases where no clear cause of exposure , including travel , has been found .
Two of the community transmission cases are in Saskatoon , one in Regina and one in an unspecified central Saskatchewan community .
An early , worst-case scenario drafted by the province says as many as 15,000 Saskatchewan residents may die from the virus .
The estimate is a necessary part of planning and is being refined , the province says .
More ventilators are on order , but the health minister said he does n't know when they 'll arrive .
An internal document from the Saskatchewan Health Authority ( SHA ) says that , even using conservative assumptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health system .
The 20-page presentation , titled COVID-19 Planning Doc : Strategy for Continuity of Health Services and Surge Capacity , was recently circulated among SHA employees , but was leaked to the media Tuesday .
It raises serious questions about the province 's current readiness to combat the COVID-19 virus .
" Demand for acute services will exceed existing capacity for hospital beds , ICU beds , ventilators as well as creating a major burden on other acute services , supports , HR , supplies , and equipment , " read one page from the PowerPoint presentation , which is dated March 19-20 .
1st sign of community transmission  The document 's release came on the same day Saskatchewan reached a new milestone in its continued fight against the coronavirus .
The province confirmed four cases of community transmission -- instances where health officials could not determine how people got exposed .
Two of those cases are in Saskatoon , one in Regina and one in an unspecified central Saskatchewan community .
" That 's not a reason to panic , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thoughtful about day-to-day activities .
You 're going shopping , you bring your groceries home .
you wash your hands .
"  Saqib Shahab , chief medical health officer , speaks at a COVID-19 news update at the Legislative Building in Regina .
( THE CANADIAN PRESS )  On Tuesday afternoon , WestJet flagged more than a dozen of its recent flights as having had guests who tested positive for COVID-19 .
Among them was flight WS3300 from Calgary to Regina on March 14 .
" The safety of our guests and crew remain our top priority , " the airline tweeted .

' Worst-case scenario planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chief medical health officer suggests the document -- which posits a 30 per cent infection rate -- may not actually depict the worst possible scenario .
" Over the course of 12 to 18 months , 30 to 70 per cent of us will get COVID-19 , " Shahab said at March 18 news conference .
The internal document does note " more accurate modelling is anticipated in the coming days , " but says that action must be taken regardless .
" Even if there was a 50 per cent error rate , we still need to do this , " it says .
In a note Tuesday afternoon , the SHA said other jurisdictions have used a 30 per cent infection rate in their models , but added that the Saskatchewan model is being updated so it 's " more specific to the situation in Saskatchewan .
"  " This plan will ensure we are prepared , " said Scott Livingstone , the CEO of the health authority , in the note .
" But it wo n't be enough .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no health system in the world can address this challenge alone without the sustained help physical distancing and self-isolation of the general public .
"  Steps already taken  At the news conference , Livingstone said the document did not take into account what the province has already done to prepare .
That includes a slowdown of non-essential medical procedures to make more beds available , the shifting of health-care workers across the province and increased COVID-19 testing .
" We 're doing surveillance in hospitals , testing for COVID-19 in all declared outbreaks in long term care homes , " Livingstone added .
Questions remain , however , about the readiness of the province 's hospital system , especially when it comes to ventilators .
Every jurisdiction on the planet right now is trying to get ventilators .
- Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter  The document estimated Saskatoon alone would need between 500 to 600 ventilators once the pandemic reaches its peak .
Some 250 ventilators are on order for the province , health officials have said .
But Health Minister Jim Reiter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Every jurisdiction on the planet right now is trying to get ventilators , " Reiter said .
" We 're dealing with our normal suppliers , we 're dealing the federal government because they 're trying to co-ordinate and do bulk purchasing .
" I 'm optimistic we 're going to get some .
I do n't know if it 'll be full orders and again it 's virtually impossible .
"  Health Minister Jim Reiter said the province is working with the federal government to try to get ventilators at a time when many other countries are trying to do the same .
( THE CANADIAN PRESS )  Up to 15,000 deaths estimated  One page of the internal document , titled " Key takeaways on incoming demand , " estimates 9,000 to 15,000 people will die from the virus in the province .
" Early social distancing will delay and lessen the peak of the outbreak .
However , even under conservative assumptions , COVID-19 will almost certainly overwhelm the health system .
"  The same page says that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of the province 's population is infected , approximately 15,000 people will require ICU beds .
It says Saskatchewan currently has 109 intensive-care ( ICU ) beds province-wide .
As of Monday , the health authority had 91 ventilators , with more on order .
" At the peak of the pandemic , Saskatoon will need the capacity to provide ventilatory support for nearly 500-600 patients daily ( ventilation and non-invasive ventilation ) , " according to the document .
The document also outlines a plan to significantly expand COVID-19 bed capacity to around 2,900 beds through the use of field hospitals at potential sites including gymnasiums , leased commercial space , community centres and arenas .
The first step , however , is to increase the number of beds at existing hospitals , where specifics areas will be reserved for COVID-19 patients , Livingstone said during the news conference .
The province 's mission statement is stated as follows in the document :  " SHA acute services will adapt and expand to meet the projected COVID-19 patient demand while continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic in order to minimize loss of life .
"  Ryan Meili reacts to estimates  Saskatchewan NDP Leader Ryan Meili offered his take on the estimates shortly after they were made public .
" I think the government should be sharing all of the information they have if they have modelling about what 's likely to happen under different scenarios , " Meili said .
" That projection would likely be a conservative projection based on a certain model .
So if we do the things we 're doing now , that 's the kind of numbers we might expect to see .
But we do n't have to see that .
This is a critical moment .
This is the moment at which we decide which track we 're on .
"  First recoveries expected soon  Some good news about the pandemic 's status in Saskatchewan may come by the end of the week , Shahab said .
" We are now at the point where some of our initial cases are going to be screened , " Shahab said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be reported as recovered .
We will be getting that information towards the end of this week .
"  The province announced its first case of the novel coronavirus on March 12 : a 60-year-old man who had recently travelled to Egypt and tested positive in Saskatoon on March 9 .
Patients will be declared recovered once they test negative on a subsequent test , the health ministry has previously said .
As of Friday -- when there were only 26 reported cases -- the vast majority of those cases ( 24 ) were well enough to self-isolate at home .
No such insights have been offered since .
Regular updates on in-hospital patients coming  On Monday , Shahab said updates on how many cases are in hospital versus how many are self-isolating at home will be provided at least twice a week .
There are at least two COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan hospitals , according to the latest information provided .
Both are there because of pre-existing medical conditions .
However , the Saskatchewan Health Authority has not answered whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care , citing patient privacy concerns .
Shaw said Monday that she did not have that information , and that if she did , " it would not be appropriate to share it because of the importance of protecting our patients ' personal health information .
"  In a later note , Jim Billington , press secretary for Premier Scott Moe , said " it is our intent to provide information for the total number of cases in hospital and the total number of cases requiring ICU admission , when the information is reported to the minister by the Saskatchewan Health Authority .
"  CBC News has directly re-asked the health authority whether any patients are now under intensive care .
As of Tuesday , 5,757 COVID-19 tests had been performed in Saskatchewan .
Below is a graph showing how the cumulative number of tests has shot up in just a short while .
