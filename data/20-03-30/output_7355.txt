-- -- --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence " that wearing face masks -- if used improperly -- could actually do more harm than good in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus .
WHO emergencies chief Dr .
Michael Ryan said he was unaware of a move by officials in Austria to require people to wear face masks when they go to supermarkets .
With some countries facing shortages of masks , Ryan reiterated that WHO believes generally they should be worn by people who are ill , to prevent them from spreading the virus , and by health care workers who really need them .
" But there is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any particular benefit -- in fact , there 's some evidence to suggest the opposite , " he said .
Ryan did n't elaborate beyond citing " risks " linked to fitting masks improperly , though he appeared to be alluding to how hands can carry virus up to or near the face as the masks are put on .
