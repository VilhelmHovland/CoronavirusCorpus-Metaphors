Pridgen on Sunday was the first local public official to announce he has tested positive for the coronavirus .
Pridgen , 55 , said he decided to go public to let his ongoing experience serve as a warning to others who may not be adhering to the guidelines to protect themselves against Covid-19 .
His adult son Craig was recently hospitalized for the virus and is now at home recovering .
In citing his belief in transparency among elected officials , Pridgen said , " Silence can be a killer .
So I decided to share with you over these next few days a journey I did not expect to be on .
"  That journey will take place over Facebook , he said .
But the big message Pridgen wanted to get out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing is not the biggest threat because you can tell .
It 's the one who is not coughing .
It 's that one who is walking around , " Pridgen said .
" There are so many people out there who have it and do n't know it .
This is the point .
They look healthy , they look strong , but they do n't know .
"  Anyone who is experiencing signs of the virus , such as weakness or fever , he said , should follow Erie County guidelines that include :  Contacting their primary care physician  Social distancing from others  Personal hygiene , such as using wipes to clean items touched by the sick person and the thorough washing of hands  There were 414 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Erie County , and seven deaths , as of late afternoon Sunday , according to the county 's most recent statistics .
Pridgen said he was notified on Saturday that he had tested positive for the highly contagious virus , but had started self-isolation more than 11 days ago when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is at greater risk than others because half his right lung had been surgically removed previously because of an unrelated medical condition .
And while Pridgen is the first known local official to go public , leaders of other countries , such as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , and celebrities including actor Tom Hanks and his wife have revealed they have contracted the virus , also in an effort to raise public awareness .
Pridgen went live on Facebook earlier Sunday to announce he had contracted the virus and plans to share his health journey with daily updates .
He said they will include sometimes humorous accounts because laughter can sometimes be the best medicine .
But there was nothing funny about how the virus gradually sapped him of energy and reduced him to bed rest .
Unlike others who say they felt they were hit by a " Mack truck , " Pridgen said , " For me , it was like I 'd been hit by a compact car , then all of a sudden like a ton of bricks .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debilitating virus , tasks that he could normally perform in a matter of minutes suddenly took as long as an hour .
" My mind wanted to do it , but my body was not reacting , " he said .
His temperature would rise to 102 degrees , but there was no cough until the last few days as his condition started to improve .
He also lost his appetite and ability to taste and smell , which others with the virus also have reported .
Pridgen also encouraged the public not to phone friends and relatives who have the virus in order to let them rest .
" You want to let that person heal .
You want to let that person get better .
There are times you just have to pray for somebody , " said Pridgen , who is also pastor and bishop of True Bethel Baptist 's three churches in Buffalo and Niagara Falls .
At 2 p .
Tuesday , he said he will lead the " virtual " Common Council meeting on the Council 's Facebook page and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City of Buffalo 's website .
