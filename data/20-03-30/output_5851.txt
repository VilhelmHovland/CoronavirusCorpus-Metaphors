Story Highlights  The provision has been earmarked to finance grants to employees , businesses , and vulnerable persons , among others who have been or are likely to be adversely impacted by the virus , for which there are 30 confirmed cases and one death since the outbreak in Jamaica .
The scaling down of activities in the public and private sectors in a bid to restrict the spread of the disease in Jamaica and other countries globally has prompted the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank Group to pledge their readiness to help member countries tackle the challenges posed by the virus .
" We are in a better position economically than we were 10 or 15 years ago .
This has resulted from steadfast implementation of Jamaica 's economic reform programme , otherwise we would be 10 times worse off today , " he tells JIS News .
The Government has been commended by business leaders for taking " decisive action " in providing the $25 billion stimulus , which includes a $10 billion contingency provision to address prevailing and potential fallouts from the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employees , businesses , and vulnerable persons , among others who have been or are likely to be adversely impacted by the virus , for which there are 30 confirmed cases and one death since the outbreak in Jamaica .
Jamaica Employers ' Federation ( JEF ) President , David Wan , tells JIS News that the Government 's gesture " demonstrates that the authorities are thinking two steps ahead of everything .
"  He says that against the background of announced closures and scaling down of business operations , the provision is " very crucial " and " well thought-out .
"  " This is so because you want to get assistance to those who are most vulnerable .
those at the lower end of the wage scale , who are least likely to have any meaningful resources available to survive this period , " the JEF President argues .
While acknowledging that " more may need to be done , " consequent on the potential wide-ranging ripple effect the virus could have on many industries , Mr .
Wan says the move by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Small Business Association of Jamaica ( SBAJ ) President , Hugh Johnson , also welcomes the intervention , describing it as " a good move .
"  Meanwhile , both business leaders believe that Jamaica is in a stronger position economically , to substantially deal with the COVID-19 and recover from the resulting impacts .
They say that the extent of resources at Jamaica 's disposal , coupled with the fiscal stimulus , should provide an ample buffer in the near term , at minimum , against the pandemic , without the need for external assistance .
The accumulated resources , inclusive of Net International Reserves ( NIR ) at the Bank of Jamaica ( BoJ ) , totaling some US$3 .
, results from the Government 's steadfast ongoing implementation of the country 's Economic Reform Programme ( ERP ) that has yielded significant macro-economic improvements for the country .
Similar sentiments about Jamaica 's position have also been expressed by global credit rating agency , Moody 's .
The scaling down of activities in the public and private sectors in a bid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other countries globally has prompted the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank Group to pledge their readiness to help member countries tackle the challenges posed by the virus .
This undertaking was given in a joint statement issued by IMF Managing Director , Kristalina Georgieva , and World Bank President , David Malpass , earlier this month .
They indicated that both institutions ' Rapid Financing Facilities can be quickly deployed to strengthen health surveillance as well as the provision of technical assistance and policy advice for affected member countries .
However , Mr .
Wan tells JIS News that " from a financial standpoint , I feel confident that we can deal with COVID-19 , " adding that he does not foresee the authorities seeking external assistance in the near future .
" What it boils down to is that we have about six months ' worth of foreign exchange reserves at the BoJ .
What this means is that if every company in Jamaica that earns foreign exchange were to shut down partially or fully , we would still have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he points out .
Wan also notes that the Government has the option of utilising inflows from the primary surplus , which equates to 6 .
per cent of the budget .
The facility 's establishment was among the conditions stipulated by the IMF for implementation by the Government , as part of the financing programme support for Jamaica .
According to the Government 's 2020/21 Fiscal Policy Paper , a total of $112 .
billion was generated during the first nine months of the 2019/20 fiscal year .
The JEF President argues that this facility could be utilised as a relief mechanism under the prevailing circumstances .
" Because we have built up so much reserves and our debt has been significantly reduced .
there is a lot we can do with our own internal actions before we reach out to the IMF .
So , I think they 'll wait until it 's absolutely necessary , " he adds .
While acknowledging that Jamaica has the option of seeking external assistance , Mr .
Johnson does not foresee the need to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better position economically than we were 10 or 15 years ago .
This has resulted from steadfast implementation of Jamaica 's economic reform programme , otherwise we would be 10 times worse off today , " he tells JIS News .
Both leaders indicate that they remain very optimistic about the prospects for Jamaica 's recovery from the onslaught of COVID-19 .
