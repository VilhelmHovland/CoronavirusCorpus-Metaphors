A Teenager 's Reaction to Learning About COVID-19  My school officially shut down on March 12 , 2020 .
They sent an email at 3 PM , five minutes before dismissal .
The atmosphere was chaotic .
Many students squealed with excitement ; others shrieked with worry regarding COVID-19 .
Had my school waited until the weekend to share the news , or given us more warning , I would feel more in control than I do now .
Suddenly , I realized the magnitude of this pandemic .
I cried myself to sleep the next few nights , fearful of my parents and grandparents catching the virus .
The sudden closure of many things I love like school , gymnastics , and Hebrew and Chinese classes compounded my anxiety .
I learned about the virus only from my freshman classmates ; I mainly heard racist jokes or hysterical comments .
My school never taught us about the virus .
Instead , they responded to the virus .
To be fair , they are not doctors or knowledgeable about epidemiology .
Hearing about it from opinionated and often unreliable sources made me more nervous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
