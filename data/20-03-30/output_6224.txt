As you shut yourself indoors , open your mind with our watchlist .
What a time to be living in .
Who would have thought even a few weeks ago that we would be practising self-isolation in varying degrees of comfort , working from home ( or at least pretending to ) , and scrubbing centuries of dirt off our hands ? There are some advantages for the privileged who are in self-quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic : as the days stretch on , seemingly forever , they finally have the time to watch or re-watch films and documentaries from around the world .
Over the next few weeks , Scroll .
will be bringing you watchlists of varying sizes grouped around themes .
The first list features 21 titles that deconstruct the art and allure of motion pictures .
These films-within-films bring out unseen aspects of the storytelling process , examine characters typically found lurking around the sets , and question the artifice involved in the creation of cinema .

The list is potted rather than definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available on any platform , legitimate or otherwise ( such as Khamosh , which converts a movie set into a crime scene , or Shukno Lanka , starring Mithun Chakraborty as an extra ) .
