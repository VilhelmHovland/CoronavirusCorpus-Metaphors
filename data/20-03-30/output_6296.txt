In this period of crisis , many amongst us have tapped into their compassionate side and become good samaritans for those in need .
But if you speak to anyone in Kerala 's Kanjirappally village , they will tell you that Najeeb , a fish vendor and one of its residents , has always been one .
A former bus driver , Najeeb returned to Kerala a few years back to take over his brother 's fish business as he had fallen ill .
Alongside all his work , he always made time to help his villagers whenever they needed any help -- whether it was providing water to those experiencing a shortage , palliative care to elderly patients , or distributing food to the hungry .
So , when he saw the number of COVID-19 patients escalating in the state , he immediately volunteered to help .
During Najeeb 's Awareness programmes .
" I knew I had to do my part .
And when I heard that soap was the best way to tackle this problem , I came up with a plan , " says Najeeb , who made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of taps to an auto .
Along with this , he distributed liquid hand wash soap to people .
" I went around almost the entire Kanjirappally town with this portable setup , so that people could understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of washing hands " , he explains .
Besides encouraging people to wash their hands and maintain proper self-hygiene , Najeeb also decided to clean all the vehicles passing through Kanjirappally town for free !  " After enquiring with the health officials , I created a disinfectant using bleaching powder , antiseptic lotion and lemongrass oil .
After making this in bulk , I got some volunteers to help out , and we went around spraying it on vehicles , roads , stores , bus stands and other public areas , " he says .
Disinfecting the Kanjirapally locality .
Along with these activities , Najeeb also distributed pamphlets and conducted awareness programmes on COVID-19 for people to get a better understanding of the pandemic and its effects .
His wife Beena and two children are his pillars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his voluntary activities .
" A lot of people criticize me saying that I do all of this for publicity , but for me , it 's solely about the satisfaction of doing my part for the society , " he explains .
Najeeb also has a deeply personal reason as to why he helps the needy .
" Almost a year ago , I was hit by a lorry .
The doctors had said that there was no hope , but after eight months of treatment , I can walk and do all physical activities without any assistance .
So when you get a chance to live again , you might as well help save lives .
"  In the past few days , several people have offered monetary help to Najeeb , but he insists that he is happy doing this work , and has no regrets in spending his own money for that purpose .
" I 'm a small-town guy , and there are a lot of limitations to what I can do to help stop the spread of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he concludes .
