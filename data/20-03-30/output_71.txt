We hear plenty about the disaster in Wuhan ( China ) and Italy .
And the unfolding disaster in USA and UK .
We also hear about the extreme measures taken in Wuhan to come out of the tragedy .
However there are other important facts that the Sri Lankan public could be unaware of .
Why is the health impact not so severe in countries such as Singapore and Taiwan ? Or even in less developed countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam ? Why have almost all countries , including Singapore , Vietnam , US and UK have not implemented extreme measures ( such as nation-wide curfew ) to curb the spread of the virus ?  Most countries have n't taken extreme measures to combat COVID-19  We are aware of the extreme measures such as locking down taken in Wuhan and Italy once things got out of hand .
However in almost all other countries such extreme measures were not taken , with the exception of Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was not curbed altogether .
In Singapore even schools are not closed still .
Working from home was advised , social distancing was implemented including a halt in public gatherings , but the economies were still active .
It was the same in Taiwan , Vietnam , USA and UK .
From an early stage , Singapore , Taiwan and Vietnam adopted strict quarantine measures for infected and a rigorous tracing mechanism to detect who could be infected next , as they tried to run ahead of the virus .
Health impact of COVID-19 is clearly polarised  The data ( as at 27 March ) , clearly shows the stark difference between two sets of countries .
One could argue Singapore and Taiwan had great systems .
But what about Vietnam and Cambodia ? Surely , USA and UK should have better systems and expertise to curtail the pandemic ?  This also raises the possibility , despite the absence of scientific proof , climatic conditions could be a critical factor for certain countries ( Vietnam , Cambodia , Sri Lanka ) to face the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these nations could be a factor as well .
It is clear that southern hemisphere and countries near the equator have got affected significantly less than the northern hemisphere .
Total lockdown is costly  Despite the grave health risk , why have almost all countries avoided a total lock-down and a halt in economic activities ? Because the cost of a complete halt in an economy is colossal .
Because the solution to a complex , multi-faceted problem should be balanced , and carefully assessed to gauge the impact on all segments -- not just one .
USA , despite not halting the economy completely has already come up with a $ 2,000 b fiscal stimulus program .
The UK has done the same .
Vietnam Government has called for donations to help the economy .
That should be sufficient to understand the costly impact of economic disruption .
If Sri Lanka is to introduce a fiscal stimulus package , proportionately similar to that of USA , it should be around $ 8 b ( or Rs .
1,500 b ) .
We have to bear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly worse than the impact on US economy , which was not in complete lock down .
Neither has the Sri Lankan Government announced such a package , nor does it have the capacity to afford one .
In that sense , the measures taken by each country could be evaluated based on the negative impact on health and the negative impact on economy ( the level of disruption to economic activity ) .
Undoubtedly countries such as Singapore , Taiwan and Vietnam have handled the crisis best so far with least impact on both health and economic fronts .
While the economic impact on USA and UK could be less , the health impact would probably reach substantial proportions .
As of now , probably Italy stands as the worst performer both in terms of health and economy .
Sri Lanka has no doubt handled the health impact well , but the same can not be said about the economic impact .
Sri Lanka 's cost so far  As most are aware , the daily wage earners by and large had been redundant over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale businesses are almost at a standstill with the curfew in place .
Only a minor proportion would be working from home .
What this means is a loss of business , and if it continues for few more weeks , a permanent loss of business .
That would follow with loss of employment .
Anybody in business would know what an uphill task it would be to regain once the business is lost .
Such an outcome could lead to a substantial collapse of the economy which could translate to social unrest in the coming months .
Many Sri Lankans seem to be unaware of this economic impact and the ensuing possible disaster .
For instance , both the Government and Private sector employees take their monthly salaries for granted , whether there is curfew or not .
In fact , the Government has already announced that the Government sector salaries for April would be paid by the 10th .
However , what one should realise is , if the economy is at a virtual halt , the Government does not earn tax income from the private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its strategy in coming weeks  One could be happy about Sri Lanka 's handling of the crisis so far .
Specially , from the impact on the health of the public .
However the situation and approach may have to be reassessed by next week or latest by the week after , considering the impact on the economy .
The following measures may have to be seriously considered .
Continue with school/university closures .
Advise working from home as much as possible .
Continue with working from home/holidays for non-essential Government sector .
Continue with quarantine measures and stringent contact tracing mechanisms to detect and isolate possible victims .
Stay ready to lock down regions/areas if there 's a risk of spreading .
However , ensure the private sector operates at least at 50% capacity based on reduced number of hours or shifts .
Prohibit public gatherings .
Strictly enforce one metre distancing in public places .
Going outdoors should strictly be for essential tasks and roaming should be prohibited .
Consider 25% reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utilize the savings to make payments for daily wage earners who may not have any income over the last two weeks .
Allow private sector to do the same ( in cases where operations were significantly scaled down ) and utilise the savings to mitigate the impact from loss of business .
Ensure the concessions given for loan repayments are implemented by the banks as there are complains that it 's not implemented yet .
The Government may have to come up with an economic stimulus plan at least at a value of Rs .
50 b to revive the economy .
These are challenging times .
The solution lies in a carefully-assessed , balanced approach .
