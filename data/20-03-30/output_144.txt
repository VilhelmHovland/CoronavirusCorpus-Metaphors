Minimum wage increases vital for over 250,000 workers -- E Tu  Tomorrow 's scheduled minimum wage increase is vital for the hundreds of thousands of minimum wage earners who are doing it tough through the COVID-19 global pandemic .
E tu Assistant National Secretary Annie Newman says that while life is difficult for minimum wage workers at the best of times , the current economic conditions make things a lot worse .
" Far too often , the poorest and most vulnerable in our society bear the brunt of economic downturns , " Annie says .
" We know that low wage workers spend the largest chunk of their wages in the local economy .
Keeping money in the pockets of our lowest paid will be vital for stimulating the economy as we go forward .
"  Annie says that the minimum wage will help many of the people in essential industries and services .

" Many minimum wage workers are also on the COVID-19 frontlines , including in security and cleaning .
These workers get up every day to make sure our communities are safe and healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be .
it 's an injustice .
" A minimum wage increase tomorrow means it will be easier for these workers to keep food on the table and keep the heaters on through the pandemic .
Surely there 's not much more important than protecting our frontline workers .
"  Annie dismisses the claims from some groups that the minimum wage increase should be delayed .
" These are the same groups that argue against minimum wage increase in any weather .
Their fears are always unfounded -- their predicted economic outcomes never come to pass .
" New Zealanders will get through the COVID-19 crisis by sticking together and looking out for each other .
Scheduled minimum wage increases are one part of that picture .
While the minimum wage will still be short of the Living Wage , the increase is a hell of a lot better than nothing .
