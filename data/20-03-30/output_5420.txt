The first images from India of what the coronavirus looks like are out .
The images of the coronavirus have been caught by a team of ICMR-NIV scientists in Pune .
The images have been captured using the transmission electron microscope imaging .
They have been published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research .
The images of Sars-Cov-2 , the virus that causes Covid-19 , are from the throat swab of the first laboratory confirmed case in India reported on January 30 .
The woman , among three students studying medicine in Wuhan in China , was diagnosed with Covid-19 after returning to India .
The gene sequencing of the samples from Kerala done at the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) in Pune found that the virus was a 99 .
per cent match with the virus in Wuhan .
A total of seven negative-stained virus particles having morphodiagnostic features of a coronavirus-like particle could be imaged in the fields scanned .
These included the round shape of the virus and a cobbled surface structure having envelope projections .
The image revealed the presence of stalk-like projections ending in round peplomeric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summary , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report from India detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus using TEM directly in a throat swab specimen confirmed by PCR .
Although TEM imaging was limited by particle load in the specimen , we could still detect morphologically identifiable intact particles in stored clinical sample without initial fixation , " the study said .
The article titled " Transmission electron microscopy imaging of SARS-CoV-2 " has been authored by the ICMR-NIV National Influenza Center Team .
The authors include Atanu Basu , deputy director and head of electron microscopy and pathology at NIV Pune .
According to the article , one particular virus particle was very well preserved , showing features very typical of coronaviruses .
This particle was 75 nm in size and showed patchy stain pooling on the surface and a distinct envelope projection ending in round peplomeric ( glycoprotein spike on the viral surface ) .
These bind only to certain receptors on the host cell .
According to the study , the description of a novel human coronavirus , initially referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) -CoV-2 as per the latest International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) classification .
It is probably the most recent human pneumonia virus with high outbreak potential .
This novel virus was initially identified through next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) and was suggested to have a possible zoonotic origin .
Till date , detailed morphology and ultrastructure of this virus remains incompletely understood .
