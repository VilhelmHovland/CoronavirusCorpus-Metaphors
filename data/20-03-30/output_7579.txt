Helpers : Food4Staff Facebook group takes off to feed medical workers  Cooper is one of several hospitals in South Jersey and Philadelphia that have benefitted from the Food4Staff Facebook group that has raised money to feed hospital workers during the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak .

? ? ?  " You can not do a kindness too soon because you never know how soon it will be too late .
"  -- Ralph Waldo Emerson  Between phone calls , text messages and app notifications , the Facebook group John Chirico started with his family has dominated his life and helped thousands in South Jersey this month .
The Sewell man 's mother , Maria , texted his wife , Jaime , about wanting to do something , anything , to help the restaurants she thought would go out of business and the medical workers she knew would be overworked as the world shut down for the COVID-19 coronavirus .
Three days after that text message was sent , the Facebook group Food4Staff was created .
In just over a week , it had close to 10,000 members .
Chirico and his family , along with a handful of friends , have facilitated meal deliveries by more than 40 South Jersey restaurants to feed more than 2,000 hospital workers throughout South Jersey and Philadelphia at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up with demand here , " said Chirico , who is the president of Champion Restoration Experts in Williamstown .
" We 're having to quickly put together processes and systems so that we can stay organized and track everything .
It 's been a big undertaking .
" We 're such a small group of under 10 people , we 're just busting our humps trying to get meals out there and just make sure that we 're feeding as many people as we can .
"  Chirico and his crew are soliciting donations through Venmo and PayPal to go toward the deliveries and help local restaurants in the process .
Neither he nor his wife work in medicine , but they have so many friends involved in the field that there were some great connections to get the ball rolling .
It keeps rolling faster and faster .
" We 're definitely predominantly South Jersey , but as we started to grow we were like , ' OK , let 's get as many people as we can , ' " Chirico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we really appreciate what you 're doing .
We have staff that 's completely inundated and does n't really have time to stop and order lunches .
We 'd really appreciate it .
' Managers and stuff are reaching out , which is nice because we do n't know unless they 're communicating with us .
It 's really nice that people are actually reaching out .
"  One of them was Jamie Skovronski , a critical care nurse at Cooper Hospital who is friends with John and Jaime Chirico and helped facilitate the first delivery that Cooper got , to its emergency room staff last Saturday night .
The meal was appreciated .
The thought behind it , even more so .
" It is absolutely so refreshing because as a nurse you do get a lot of thanks , but a lot of what you do does go unnoticed as well , " Skovronski said .
" At times like this , there 's plenty of other people that are putting themselves out there being vulnerable as well , but it is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're doing and not taking it for granted .
" A lot of people lose sight when they 're cooped up in their house of how dangerous it actually is out there .
To not only putting ourselves at risk but then potentially bring it home to our families and our loved ones .
God forbid if something happened to one of our loved ones and it was from us , that would be devastating .
I think that 's what 's in the back of everyone 's mind , so to know that no one out there is taking the risks that we 're taking for granted is encouraging and uplifting .
