OPINION  Opinion : Federal priorities left states unprepared for COVID-19  It was always a matter of when -- not if -- a new viral pandemic would make it to America .
We are not immune to global outbreaks , evidenced by previous close calls with SARS , H1N1 and Ebola .
Epidemiologists even predicted the outbreak of COVID-19 with eerie accuracy .
Yet our government was unprepared for the novel virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and around the world .
Our health agencies had the information and the resources , so they should have been planning for this , but they were n't .
The problem is n't that they 're underfunded , it 's that they are bloated and mismanaged .
The core purpose of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is to control and prevent the spread of infectious disease .
But a close look at how CDC spends its budget reveals it has strayed from this mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases , turning more toward influencing people 's lifestyle choices .

( Photo : David Goldman , AP )  In 2019 Congress authorized a budget of $7 .
billion for CDC .
Roughly $2 .
billion to $3 billion of that was supposed to go toward fighting and treating infectious disease , but most of that was earmarked for existing pathogens -- known threats .
This includes $1 .
billion for HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immunization and respiratory disease project aimed at increasing vaccinations against common infections like measles , HPV and season flu .
What about $855 million for " public health preparedness and response programs " ? That appears to be mostly a conduit for transferring federal funds ( $611 million in 2019 ) to state agencies during emergencies like natural disasters .
Just over $600 million was set aside for emerging and zoonotic ( animal-caused/related ) infectious diseases .
Of that , only $185 million went toward the emerging type -- like COVID-19 -- with the rest going to efforts at controlling known diseases , such as Lyme , prion and chronic fatigue syndrome .
At best , it seems the CDC had a paltry billion or so in its budget that might have been used to prepare for a global outbreak .
The far larger sum was dedicated to non-communicable conditions .
This includes $1 .
billion for chronic illnesses and behaviors like obesity , diabetes , smoking and oral health .
Indeed , prior to the COVID-19 pandemic , the CDC and other agencies were busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth vaping .
Collectively , they spent billions on anti-vaping advertisements , biased research and lobbying , wasted countless hours of congressional hearing time and squandering public trust .
Had they remained focused on infectious diseases , they might have been prepared to fight real epidemics like the COVID-19 .
How can we fix this ? What wo n't work is simply throwing more money at the CDC without adjusting how it is spent .
Unfortunately , our leaders are n't even talking about that kind of change .
At the Democratic presidential debate in South Carolina candidates scorned the Trump administration for cutting CDC 's funding , blaming this for making the COVID-19 outbreak worse .
The claim was untrue ( CDC 's budget is bigger now than under the previous administration ) , but it spurred Congress into passing an $8 .
billion emergency funding bill anyway .

( Photo : U .
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention )  Novel as COVID-19 is , there 's nothing new about exploiting a crisis to expand budgets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made during the 2014 outbreak of Ebola , for which various health agencies got an additional $5 .
billion .
And what do we have to show for it now ? Arguably , emergency funding mitigated the outbreak of Ebola , but it should have been followed by a dispassionate assessment of why agencies were n't ready for that outbreak and what needed to be done to prepare for the next one .
That did n't happen .
The failure is not of any single administration , agency or Congress .
The blame rests with all of them .
The threat that novel infectious diseases pose , both to individual health and national welfare , was known , but our leaders still did n't make combating pandemics a top priority .
As odd as it may sound , we got lucky .
COVID-19 is bad , but it could have been a deadlier virus .
While we all wash our hands , isolate and hope for the best , officials -- from the White House and Congress down to state and local governments -- must work together to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus , stop wasting time and money and start preparing for the next pandemic .
If they do n't , we may be far more unlucky next time .
