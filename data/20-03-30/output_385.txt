Share this story  As a pandemic upends our social order and we wonder whether life as we 've known it will last , my mind keeps returning to a less pressing question : What would Larry David do ?  In some ways , the days of social distancing seem like TV Larry 's time to shine .
Earlier this month , a friend of mine who felt sick got tested for COVID-19 , and his employer put him on mandatory sick leave while he awaited the results .
" I ca n't say I 'm too upset to be forced not to go to work , " he told me via text .
( His results came back negative ; it was nothing time and Imodium could n't cure .
) That sounded like the makings of a Curb Your Enthusiasm episode : Larry feels fine but gets tested anyway so he can use the uncertainty as an excuse to stay home .
Larry loves a cancellation , and nothing causes more cancellations than a pandemic that prohibits physical contact .
It 's not as if TV Larry would be consumed by compassion for the infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Shortly after my friend 's test , the pandemic picked up steam and the world changed .
Being ordered not to go to work was n't so special : Almost everyone who was n't laid off was working from home .
And after a few days of self-isolation , solitude did n't seem so desirable .
Larry might mine some material from the fear of contagion , the etiquette of remote gatherings via video , the dos and don'ts of face masks , the stringent rules for senior citizens , or the Covidiots who hoard supplies or keep partying while others dutifully flatten the curve .
But so much of Curb 's comedy comes from social proximity , which generates the friction between TV Larry and the rule breakers or abiders who clash with his views .
COVID-19 has the same effect as the MAGA hat Larry wears in Season 10 when he wants to protect his privacy : No one wants to go near anyone else .
But if Larry got his wish , would he be happy ? In a time of total separation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time more Curb could come out , would we be ready to look back and laugh at these dark days , or would we want this strange , unsettling episode to stay in the past ?  On Curb 's Season 10 finale ( and 100th all-time episode ) , " The Spite Store , " Larry runs afoul of pre-pandemic society .
He ca n't count on the novel coronavirus to shut down Mocha Joe 's , so he continues to wage war via spite store .
In the end , he succeeds in destroying the business that banned him -- but the monkey 's paw finger curls , and his spite comes back to bite him too .
Like the instant-classic Season 10 premiere , " Happy New Year , " " The Spite Store " is packed with plot , some of it self-contained and some of it tied to season-long arcs .
The finale features recurring bits about siren abusers , the " big Johnson community , " parents ' preferred color for biracial babies , avoiding wasted water to respect the drought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as Larry 's stray observations about robes ( " You ca n't just fling one side over the other " ) , tip jars ( " We might as well be beggars " ) , and daybeds ( " It 's like half chair , half couch -- it 's like a furniture centaur " ) .
But all of those standalone strands intertwine to bring about Larry 's comeuppance .
Alice returns to Latte Larry 's , and a taste of dry scone brings back her memory of the lawsuit she was planning to file .
After a meet-cute with Mocha Joe , she joins forces with Larry 's next-door nemesis and Frank , an annoying real-estate agent from Larry 's country club ( played by Paul Scheer ) .
Then the spite store and its target burn down because Joey Funkhauser 's new , giant Johnson knocks one of Larry 's self-heating coffee cups ( which existed long before Larry 's idea ) onto a pile of paper and Larry refuses to pull over for a fire truck , believing its passengers to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no more , but from their ashes arises a new thorn in Larry 's side : the spite house .
Using the insurance payout from the fire and the settlement from the lawsuit , Mocha Joe and Alice move in next door and start hosting loud parties to annoy their new neighbor .
Curb 's comedy works in part because TV Larry is n't always in the right : The show highlights his own flaws as often as it exposes those of others .
Larry 's failings are a theme of the finale , beginning with the cold open ( a rarity for Curb ) .
On the fake spite-store segment from Today , Larry tells a TV interviewer that he does n't care for his pocket square .
" You do n't think that 's kind of insulting ? " the reporter asks .
" No , not in the least , " Larry says .
" If you told me you did n't like my jacket or something , I would n't care .
" But when the reporter informs him that he does n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought .
" Oh , is that so , " he sniffs .
As the segment reveals , Larry 's spite store inspires other celebrities to open their own versions .
Although the imitation flatters him , it also prevents him from repairing Will 's watch , because Mila Kunis drives his go-to repair person out of business .
And while Larry is right to " foresee big problems " with Joey 's penis , it 's not just the giant phallus that fucks Latte Larry 's .
It 's also Larry 's refusal to heed the fire truck 's siren , and the flame-fanning innovations he introduced : the mugs , the bolted-down tables , omnipresent hand sanitizer , and defecation-free bathrooms .
" If I was trying to tell someone how to burn a place down , I would suggest every step you took in your business , " the fire chief informs him , adding , " You did so many stupid things , it looks like arson .
" Some of the rules Larry rebels against are rules for a reason .
And some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff says when Larry wonders whether he could induce labor by scaring a pregnant mother , " You got ta really think these hypotheticals out , ' cause they always end poorly .
" Or as Susie succinctly puts it , " What the fuck is the matter with you ? "  " The Spite Store " does n't have the highs of " Happy New Year , " and it 's not as well-plotted as the premiere .
I 'll welcome any excuse for more Sam Richardson in my life , but Tara and Will kind of came out of nowhere , as did Scheer 's " shanda for the bald .
" It 's also a tad disappointing that Cheryl and Ted do n't appear , given that Larry 's attempts to win back his ex-wife , and Ted 's efforts to undermine him , were two of this season 's central story lines .
And although Larry came close to doing his signature staredown for the first time this season when he questioned Joey about the broken watch , Joey caved before the look could linger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spite Store " was heavy on celebrity sightings , including cameos by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb , Jonah Hill , Sean Penn , and Mila Kunis .
Like Clive Owen and Jon Hamm before them , this week 's stars acquitted themselves well -- especially Hill as a scrupulous deli owner , who delivered one of the episode 's most memorable lines : " Any time I see a customer walk in here that used to go to Irv 's , it 's like my own tiny human Oscar walking in here .
"  The celebrity guest star who seemed most out of place this season was one who was n't playing himself : Vince Vaughn as Freddy Funkhouser , Marty 's half-brother .
Freddy never fully fit into Larry 's friend group , and his presence only drew attention to the void left by the late Bob Einstein .
Freddy , Joey , and even Freddy 's uncle Moke all played prominent roles this season , but Curb chose to honor Einstein by keeping Marty alive off-screen .
On Curb , what is dead may never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his character dying on the show , " Jeff Garlin said last November .
" Why do we need that on a comedy show ? That does n't fit on our show .
There is no melancholy on Curb Your Enthusiasm .
"  Nor is TV Larry likely to endure any lasting consequences of his actions .
This season revolved around the reality that thanks to that sweet , sweet Seinfeld syndication deal , he has the fuck you money to start a store just to spite someone who served him cold coffee .
He 's also able to buy his way out of every jam .
When someone sues him , he settles .
When a car salesman suspects him of visiting the dealership for licorice alone , he buys a new car to prove him wrong .
When he wrecks that car , he orders another .
When Latte Larry 's burns down , he shrugs off the loss .
And now that his enemies live too close for comfort , he 'll probably buy a new house .
I might resent TV Larry if I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season finales , " The Spite Store " could end up being a series finale .
As always , Curb 's future is up in the air and dependent on David 's level of inspiration .
Although the last episode resolves the season satisfactorily , it feels less final than most of the season-enders from the second half of the series .
David has said that whenever Curb comes to a close , it will end without fanfare , but there have been tentative indications that more Curb could be in the works .
" We 're definitely talking about talking about it , " said executive producer Jeff Schaffer in January , adding , " We definitely have ideas that did n't fit into the season .
"  That seems somewhat encouraging , considering Schaffer said after Season 9 that David ends each season drained of ideas and convinced that he 'll never have another .
A shortage of ideas did n't seem to be Season 10 's problem ; if anything , the season sometimes suffered from trying to cram in too many plot points .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
As the sage saying goes , " You got ta break a couple watches to know how to handle a big cock .
