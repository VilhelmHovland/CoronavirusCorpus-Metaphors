Covid-19 : Rural areas are under threat  Covid-19 is an environmental infectious disease that has caused great panic among the people around the globe .
This is the biggest health , social and economic emergency more serious than any world war .
Although , WHO says about 80% of people with Covid-19 recover without need of any specialist treatment .
Only about one person in six becomes seriously ill " and develops difficulty breathing .
But concern is of its infectious nature .
The mortality rate of Coronavirus patients is rising and there is no treatment available till date to arrest the diseases .
However , it once again reminds us the old proverb " Prevention is better than Cure " .
One can protect himself and others from infection by washing hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching the face .
The world has not learned lessons and this disease has not been taken seriously as it could have been .
China learnt but it was too late .
The most affected countries like Itlay , Spain have not acted very rapidly ; otherwise the situation might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have halted everything very soon instead what they are doing now .
This is not fun as Rome put it , they invited people to try a " carbonaravirus " as the tourists enjoyed their holidays rather than go home and now the results are obvious .
The virus is spreading , and public is turning to humor , with memes and videos shared across social media , and we are little worried till it attacks .
I recall the famous proverb " Noone knows the weight of another man 's burden " .
We know that the virus is following the same trajectory towardsItaly and may be to India .
People are laughing when they 're confronted with the idea of death as till date nobody is taking it so seriously .
People are still out and about , frequenting bars , restaurants , parks and beaches .
With no school or university , teenagers and students took the opportunity to socialize more with friends that need to be curbed .
As we do n't have vaccine we must lockdown to our homes as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practicing good hygiene , avoiding crowds and being mindful of our surroundings will protect not only ourselves , but also those around us .
The COVID -- 19 spreads through dropletsof saliva and discharge from nose of an infected person , hence , respiratory decorum must be maintained , that we usually bother .
The threat is that symptoms are not different as in case of our common illness that we usually avoid in our day today life .
Most people will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and improve without requiring special treatment .
The emergency warning signals include persistent pain or pressure in chest , trouble in breathing , tiredness and bluish lips and face .
Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease , diabetes , chronic respiratory disease , and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness .
We must be aware that COVID -- 19 is not a flu as many infectious diseases wax and wane with the change in temperature .
The flu , spike when the weather turns cold and cholera thrive during warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hope that COVID-19 may wane with change in weather .
In the case of certain viruses , heat or humidity can decrease the virulence and infectivity of a virus , but nothing is known about this virus .
Seasonality has the power to limit the rate of infection , but this factor will not help us to arrest this biological disaster .
The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in everywhere including areas with hot and humid weather as reported by WHO .
This virus survives up to 8-10 hours over porous surfaces and a little more than this over non porous surfaces .
hence , the most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water .
Rural area of JK  People in the villages are totally inside their homes , although they do n't know about this virus a lot but they know this is just an infectious disease that may cause death to them .
This fear has kept them inside their house and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 4 cases are positive in this area , with travel history outside the region but this is sufficient to keep them inside .
There is one more reason that they are inside as authorities have made strict restrictions for their movement .
People who violate the regulations have been penalized .
People fear to visit their neighbors , relatives and their peers .
This is a good sign that people are taking preventive measures but at the same time people in these areas who are mostly daily wagers are short of money .
Since in rural areas people mostly feed their nears and dears by working from morning till evening it is becoming very difficult for them to feed their kiths and kind under these conditions .
The administration is doing good to contain this pandemic but there is a need of food and essentials for the people who are afraid to move out of their houses .
Social networking sites play an important role to provide information .
Few medical doctors have given their mobile numbers , in case of emergency people may contact them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good initiative and we must salute such volunteers .
I have been prescribed medicines by Dr Jawaid and Dr SaqiaZahoor when I was in need .
But as we know , in rural areas people are hardly used to these sites and people fear to talk with the doctors .
There must be some sort of relief camps that will provide basic medicines to people .
While arresting one pandemic people should not suffer from basic facilities that the rural areas are currently facing .
Rural areas in Kashmir are under great stress and their economic condition is getting worse .
There must be some sort of relief for them as they are the people who will play an important role to contain this pandemic .
