According to Dr .
Kenneth Han , the chief medical officer at the Office of Student Health Services , patients who are under the age of 65 with mild clinical symptoms and are not immunocompromised are not recommended to receive testing for COVID-19 .
However , low risk individuals with COVID-19 symptoms who have had a fever ( over 100 degrees Fahrenheit ) and a cough for more than three days are eligible for possible testing .
Also , these patients should come in for an assessment to rule out treatable conditions .
Low risk adults who display classic fever and dry cough symptoms are advised to manage symptoms at home and self-isolate .
This group of patients should monitor their temperature two to four times daily .
If a patient 's temperature exceeds 102 degrees Fahrenheit , then they should call the Office of Student Health Services .
Other mechanisms for managing symptoms are : liquid hydration two to three liters a day , control fever with acetaminophen , control of cough with over-the-counter medications , stay isolated for 72 hours after fever breaks and cover cough until it is gone .
ARCHIVES / HIGHLANDER  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dyspnea should seek out the Emergency Department instead of the Office of Student Health Services .
Immunocompromised patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to go to the Office of Student Health Services .
COVID-19 testing will be considered after an assessment of the patient .
A student sharing a room in on-campus housing with COVID-19 symptoms will be considered for housing arrangements such as isolation rooms .
Clinical judgment will determine whether or not that individual will need an in-person assessment .
When one individual has a case of COVID-19 in a household or family , immediate symptomatic family members do not need testing for confirmation .
Immediate symptomatic family members are presumed to be positive for COVID-19 .
Students should call the Office of Student Health Services before visiting the Office of Student Health Services if they believe they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 .
The Office of Student Health Services will then direct students on the next steps they should take .
