Mr Pompeo last week told nations to " stay committed to applying diplomatic and economic pressure " over the North 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes while calling on the nuclear-armed state to return to talks .
A string of weapons drills by Pyongyang has come during a prolonged hiatus in disarmament talks with the US and despite recent overtures from Washington offering help to contain the coronavirus pandemic .
In a statement released by the North 's official Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) , an unnamed official in charge of negotiations with the US called Pompeo 's remarks " ludicrous " .
" Listening to Pompeo 's ludicrous language made us give up on any hopes for dialogue , " the official said , adding : " We will walk our way .
"  The criticism came after the North said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday .
