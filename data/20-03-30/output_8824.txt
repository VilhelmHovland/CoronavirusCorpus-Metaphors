Welcome to Sweden , the last holdout among the small number of Western countries to have taken a radically different approach to the coronavirus pandemic .
While social life in Europe and much of the U .
now centers on the home after governments imposed increasingly drastic curbs on freedom of movement , Sweden left offices and stores open , issued recommendations rather than restrictions , and waited to see what happens .
Businesses , kindergartens and schools remain open .

The next two weeks will determine whether Sweden 's approach can succeed or if authorities bend to the reality of a rash of new cases , said Dr .
Cecilia S ? derberg-Naucl ? r , a physician and professor at the Karolinska Institute .
She predicted the government would be forced to retreat because the virus was out of control due to the absence of restrictions and testing .
Asian countries that have managed to avoid lockdowns relied on mass testing to isolate positive cases and stop the contagion , she said .
Sweden has a long tradition of favoring voluntary guidelines -- which call on the elderly to self-isolate and the young to reduce social mobility -- over coercive measures .
Tegnell said that could lead to higher compliance .
" A majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .
" We want to slow down the epidemic until Sweden experiences some sort of peak , and if the peak is not too dramatic we can continue .
"  Unlike in the U .

Elective surgeries have been paused , and local authorities are building a makeshift Covid-19 clinic in Stockholm .
" This is a big and risky experiment with the entire population that could have a catastrophic outcome , " Joacim Rockl ? v , a professor of epidemiology at Ume ? University and one of several scientists campaigning for the government to change tack .
" It is risky to leave it to people to decide what to do without any restrictions .
As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , and Sweden is no different than other countries .
"  Dr .
Rockl ? v 's research shows that pursuing herd immunity without suppressing the spread of the virus would overwhelm hospitals and result in large numbers of premature deaths .
He is skeptical that high-risk groups can be effectively sheltered .
Fredrik Elgh , a professor of virology at Umea University , said that the current policy was frightening and called for Stockholm to be put under quarantine .
" We will be overwhelmed by cases further down the epidemic curve , " Dr .
Elgh said .
