I could not think of any opening lines but that of these words from the fashion fraternity " Covid-19 is the new sexy .
"  It is like that friend you do n't really like but you ca n't do away with .
Their names make you angry and bring you bad memories and at times panic yet you have to talk about them anyway .
You see them everywhere , you hear of them everywhere you go .
I must say it is a difficult experience .
Barely six months ago the first case of COVID -19 was reported in the Wuhan province in China on the 17th of November , 2019 .
It did n't seem like a dangerous disease because it had the symptoms of an ordinary flu .
World leaders did n't give it any necessary attention and some of them even described it in their own demeaning words .
Even though it started in China but today it is described as a global pandemic .
It has brought many nations to their knees .
The supposed sophisticated and advanced countries ca n't even seem to find their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked down , human contacts have reduced drastically , churches have been closed down with those who can afford the internet now operating an online virtual service for their followers .
COVID-19 have compelled many who doubted the existence of God to even call upon His name .
Nana Addo Danquah Akuffo-Addo in his address to the nation Ghana that called for a national day of prayer and fasting indicated that " we are not in ordinary times .
"  As at the time of writing this piece , the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world now is 651,595 and about 30,302 deaths recorded so far around the world and still counting anyway .
The knowledge of sciences seems to be against the wall now .
No one knows when and from whom the vaccine for this deadly virus would come from .
Indeed we are not in ordinary times and guess who is responsible ; COVID-19 is .
Do you see why COVID-19 is the new sexy ? With nations of the world closing their borders to immigrants and Ghana also being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures to prevent the spread of the virus .
The president in his fourth address that sought to update the entire populace on the efforts deployed by the state to fight the pandemic announced a partial lockdown of the nation that involved the big cities in the country .
It is to tell you how serious this whole pandemic is .
Due to the fear and panic that this pandemic has brought on individuals and businesses , people have lost touch with objectivity , clarity and optimism .
Why do n't you stay calm , walk with me and let 's take a look at the other side of the bigger picture of this pandemic ?  It is no surprise of how businesses are suffocating but what if I told you that all is not lost .
There are some good things that come along with this whole pandemic and if we are going to rise as individuals and businesses after this season , then we must appreciate the need to reduce fear and objectively apprehend these accompanying hidden opportunities .
Whilst in lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassess the foundation of your business and if possible offer it a fresh perspective ; Yes , I mean a fresh perspective .
Dr David Oyedepo of Nigeria once said ; " no matter how fast you run on the wrong way , you will never get to your destination .
" I could n't have agreed with him more .
The foundation for many businesses is actually wrong with some being in shambles .
Some have lost touch with the core essence ( vision or purpose ) of their existence .
They meant to achieve one thing at the beginning of the establishment but now they are living for something else .
As you are home , think deeply about the vision of your business and ask yourself this question " are we running on the right way ? " I  f you were looking at starting your business or if you started before but did not work , reassess your approach and strategies , it is an opportunity to introduce a fresh perspective and possibly start afresh .
Do you realise that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet had time to develop them into workable ideas yet ? Thank God , for now , you dent have to think about early morning and after-work rush hour and traffic .
This is the time to think , make plans , develop strategies , identify potential partners , pick up your phone and call that individual you have been meaning to call to discuss the idea and the plans but have not been able to because of what " urbaners " usually refer to as " pressure .
" COVID-19 is offering you the opportunity to restructure yourself , do n't waste that opportunity in fear and panic .
For business owners , I believe COVID-19 has come to test the resilience of your company .
How well can your business withstand such an external threat ? What strategies have been developed yet to mitigate the impact on your business ?  Now that there is a lockdown , can your company pay your staff for three months without business operations should the time period for the lockdown be extended ?  Can your business survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is the time to learn something new and make adjustments in the risk mitigation strategies and if there are none , you make provision for one .
Simply said , it is a test case for the future .
Think tomorrow , build a resilient business , thanks to COVID-19 , there is evidence of a worst-case scenario .
What is your business disaster recovery plan ? Most businesses especially SMEs do not have such .
It is one of the opportunities COVID-19 is affording you now .
Risk mitigation strategy and plan has its own magic it does but disaster recovery plan answers the question " what if ? "  What if the risk mitigation plan fails , how do we recover ? As a growing business , you are the most vulnerable to all macro-environmental hostilities , and you need to build yourself to be able to withstand every storm that blows at every growth stage .
Every billionaire today is a master of one major world and humanity problem .
Maybe it is time you take a re-look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business diversification .
What other new areas can you invest in ?  With this pandemic hitting economies , what other essential thing do you think you can produce to satisfy humanity and receive the reward for your contribution to solving human problems ?  ' Shine your eye ' , COVID-19 is probably presenting to you a new business idea that could set your feet on the path of prosperity .
To top up , there is now enough time to rest , which is good for your health , there is time to build solid family cohesion and more .
All I mean is , this pandemic is also bringing to bare that we are social beings and there is nothing greater than family .
COVID-19 has challenged our system , institutions and has drawn our attention to the flaws in our social construction , economic management , sanitation and all that .
As we find a solution to this world pandemic , I believe we have to take our time , devoid of emotional sentimentalism and look at the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it may seem .
There is nothing that is entirely good neither is there anything that is entirely bad .
There are always different sides to everything .
Since I started by borrowing words , I believe it will not be far-fetched for me to borrow words to end it .
These are the words of Apostle Paul in his epistle to the church in Rome ; He wrote ; " .
and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God , to them who are the called according to His purpose .
" -- Romans 8:28 ( KJV ) .
