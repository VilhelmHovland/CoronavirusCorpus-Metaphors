Three other members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently training with the Air Force -- Adan Gonzales , McGyver Reyes and Bnel Amiladjid .
It was only last December when they played key roles for the national team following a silver medal finish in water polo in the 30th SEA Games here -- the first podium finish in the sport for Philippines in nine years .
While other teammates were forced to a lockdown by the Enhanced Community Quarantine , Valdez and Belo -- both Seaman Second Class officers -- were deployed to separate locations .
Valdez just finished his stint manning a post at the Naval Base Cavite ( formerly Naval Station Sangley Point ) in Cavite City last Sunday and will return to the said camp on April 6 .
As for Belo , he started his stint Monday as part of a navy unit that will conduct checkpoints at the Cavitex Tollgate for the next 15 days before they undergo another 15-day quarantine .
According to Marc Velasco , national training director of the Philippine Sports Commission ( PSC ) , there are 134 enlisted athletes that belong to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guard , and two are with the Philippine National Police .
Velasco said the PSC gets a list from the following departments called " detached service " for them to be allowed to train and compete for flag and country .
" If they have that DS or detached service , these athletes report to the PSC for training and of course they compete as part of the national team .
Normally the DS is for one year , " said Velasco , adding that without the DS , these enlisted athletes return to their mother units .
