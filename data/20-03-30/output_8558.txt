Bracket : Help us pick the best coronavirus stay at home activity  Monday  With no college basketball in sight , we put together a bracket to stave off a March Madness of a different kind .
Vote to help decide the best coronavirus stay-at-home activity !  Normally , this would be the time of year for March Madness brackets .
But this is not a normal year , so instead of college basketball , we 're doing a " Ways to De-Stress " bracket over the next four days to help cure you of a March Madness of a different kind .
There 's plenty to stress about during the coronavirus pandemic -- the infection curve , rising unemployment , the stock market , your health -- but there 's also plenty of reason to sip on a cup of tea , do some yoga in your bedroom , go for a run , do some coloring -- the list goes on and on .
So we are turning to you , our readers , to determine the best way to relax .
Over the next four days , we 'll ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
What 's the prize , you may ask ? Peace of mind .
Vote in the first round below :  Never miss a story  Choose the plan that 's right for you .
