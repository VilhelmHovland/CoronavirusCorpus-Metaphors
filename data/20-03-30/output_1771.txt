THE world has been through many wars .
In the early period of human existence , the fights were mainly about territorial expansion .
Most came from tribal conflicts .
There was at one time the sugar war in the Caribbean .
Sugar , a precious commodity then , created massive wealth for many .
There was also a war over spice trade .
Of course , we are all familiar with the many wars fought over the control of oil reserves .
Some predict it will not be long before wars are fought over water , a resource which is showing signs of depletion .
The Nile and the Mekong are cited as potential hotspots for such conflicts .
The recent US-China tariff war is an example of a conflict which has arisen from trade frictions .
Not all wars end with bloodsheds .
The trade war is one example .
The war over the ownership of water resources has so far not led to killing .
But , most of the other wars involved the use of some kind of lethal weapons .
The design of weapons has also witnessed change .
They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Empire , the weapons were mainly made up of arrows and swords .
They were not capable of mass destruction of the enemy .
The use of the early weapons was also very much dependent on the skill of the individual combatant .
As the world became familiar with new technologies of fire power and precision targeting , the killing weapons became more devastating .
The so-called weapon of mass destruction was born .
There have been many types deployed .
The common ones are the precision bombing which uses sophisticated electronics to reach targets .
Such weapon has been deployed extensively in the many conflicts in the Middle East .
Chemical-based weapons have also been developed and deployed on a number of occasions in the past .
They are more destructive than the conventional weapons .
But their deployment can be stopped by destroying the facilities suspected to be making such weapons .
Nuclear weapon is another with the potential to create mass destruction .
In the world , not many countries possess the capacity to produce such weapon .
There is a global treaty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the impact of such weapon is not only widespread but can be instantly fatal .
This was clearly demonstrated in the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima which literally ended the second World War .
Nowadays , no country would dare attack another country which has nuclear weapon , which in a way is a deterrent to wars .
Lately , with the global pandemic brought about by Covid-19 , the world has become understandably worried by another weapon which has the potential for mass destruction .
This is the weapon which relies on fatally dangerous biological agents .
This biological weapon makes use of the almost invisible microbes which can not be seen with the naked eye .
These can include the viruses , bacteria and other disease-causing microbes which are not only fatal for the enemy but also have the capacity to disrupt and destroy living .
As demonstrated in the Covid-19 pandemic , such viruses can even derail world economies .
Once the economy is disrupted , the world simply loses the means to effectively fight the virus .
This makes biological weapons much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuspecting persons carrying the infectious virus .
It is much more difficult to detect until it is too late .
It is not easy to stop countries from creating the laboratories to develop such weapons .
Normally , parallel to the weapon development , it is also a practice in such laboratories to develop the antidotes to neutralise the pathogens .
The concern is accidental leakages .
Despite the often-stringent safety control on the biological agents , sometimes accidents can happen .
The leaked pathogens can be disastrous for the community .
We can already see how Covid-19 , which does not come from such laboratories , is already wreaking havoc throughout the world .
It would be much worse if the pathogens released are those meant to be weapons .
The world must agree on a proper internationally agreed monitoring of such facilities .
There must be transparent reporting .
Otherwise , the prospects of dealing with a potential leakage are scary .
