We 're in scary times , but they 're only temporary .
Take comfort : the hiss of a Diet Coke can will again soundtrack our college lives , writes Eimear Finan .
Eimear FinanJunior Editor  Dylan Furdyk for The University Times  Since the coronavirus outbreak began , our news screens have been dominated by panicked scenes of anxious shoppers selfishly stripping supermarkets of their wares .
As a sympathetic -- recently unemployed -- retail worker , I stayed away from the shops until this week .
After dragging myself out of bed , I joined a sombre social distancing-compliant queue outside my local Tesco Express .
Finally , my time came to tentatively step in .
The atmosphere was uneasy , with the anxiety of my fellow shoppers denoted by an eerie silence and the avoidance of all eye contact .
You may consider this an overreaction on my part .
You may think Diet Coke is overrated , or choose to avoid it out of concern for your teeth .
In that moment , however , that pallet became a symbol for all I had lost in the previous 10 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can is synonymous with College .
From the familiar rush to afternoon lectures to long stressful nights spent in Ussher 2 , the carbonated beverage had , unwittingly , become a part of my almost-daily routine .
Now this routine -- the coming and going between my apartment , my lectures , my friends and my job -- is gone and the drink is all I have left .
To those of you who dislike it , or choose its healthier alternatives instead , I wish you well .
You quite possibly have never experienced the first self-congratulatory sip taken after making it halfway through an article without stopping .
Maybe it is n't your go-to cure after a particularly messy night out .
Perhaps , for some reason , you do n't associate the drink with afternoons spent lamenting the latest sorry development in your slow-moving love life .
I have nothing but pity for those of you who have missed out on these experiences .
It could be that you are one of the naysayers who points to the countless newspaper articles as proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or maybe you 're the person who tags their friend for the fifth time in the Facebook memes linking it with a litany of health problems .
If you fall into either of these categories you are most likely raising your eyebrows with scepticism .
But hear me out .
Bizarre as this may sound , I know that I am not alone .
If there is one thing to unite law lecturers , Arts Block smokers and Donald Trump , it is a love for ( or dependency on ) this caffeinated drink .
( Do n't worry , even I consider Trump 's reported intake of 12 cans a day to be a bit excessive .

The drink has become a carbonated elixir for academics , students and politicians alike .
Diet Coke belongs to a very specific subset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- smokers sipping from Diet Coke cans next to conspicuously-placed " Smoke Free Trinity " stickers while wearing aging Doc Martens will live on as a zeitgeist of the Trinity Education Project ( TEP ) era .
In that moment in Tesco Express , I was transported to first year , when the disruption caused by the infamous snowstorm of March 2018 forced me and many others into a very different , shorter period of self-isolation than the one I was now experiencing .
For a very strange four days , I subsisted on nothing but Bran Flakes , potato waffles and , of course , Diet Coke .
From then on , the drink became a staple in my weekly shop .
Soon , friends slagged me for my over-reliance on what an old friend of mine used to call " low-fat coke " .
Unbeknownst to me , it had become a constant in my chaotic , ever-evolving college life .
A concerned nod from a fellow customer eventually brought me back to the present .
It was a no-brainer -- ? 13 was a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this distinct moment of both national and personal crisis .
Grinning to myself with pride for successfully venturing outside , I lugged my haul back to my apartment .
This unintended moment of nostalgic self-reflection was a welcome reminder that , though uncertain , the current upheaval is only temporary .
The metallic click of the can as the pull-tab hits the lid and tears it open will once again become the soundtrack to my panicked nights in the Ussher .
I will welcome the self-righteous grins of those who do n't rely on the drink as a reward for staying in the Ussher 's clutches for longer than an hour .
I will wear this habit as a badge of honour as I stow my can surreptitiously in the bottom of my bag , away from the glare of library security guards .
These are moments I will be grateful for in my final year , after they were so suddenly and cruelly robbed from me at the selfish and unforgiving hands of the coronavirus .
