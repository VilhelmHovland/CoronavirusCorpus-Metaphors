Dear World ,  Let me count the ways I love thee .
In Sherwood Forest in England , we are not in full lockdown mode yet but will be soon .
About to go into hiding like Robin Hood 's Merry Men , I would 've said , but that could be misconstrued as making light of this global tragedy .
But Robin Hood , remember , went underground to emerge a beacon of hope as twin scourges swept his world ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nottingham .
Not so different from our lives now .
So , making light is essential , but in the sense of keeping the fires burning .
Today I walked my children one last time to their school , finally closing after every other around the world had shut , because of the British government 's misguided plan to inject the population with " herd immunity " by exposing our children to a virus without a cure .
Like misinformed war-era parents sending their kids to chicken-pox parties in the hope they become immune ! That 's not how infection works .
But it is a war we find ourselves in , between humans and a panic-fuelled force of nature .
A war without sound and fury -- as long as you stay off social media .
I do .
I write , and I walk .
Ironically , with barely a car on the road , the walk is lovelier than it has been in a long while .
A crisply cold morning , clear to the tree-fringed horizon , there is n't a smidgeon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Just birdsong in the whispering leaves .
And , with only the occasional child and parent reluctantly meandering to school , the chatter of rodents out in force , emboldened by their tormentor 's near-disappearance .
Darting up to us daringly , they are staking their claim to the world we took away .
As we take the last leaf-lined turn to school , I tell my kids about my childhood ambles round Kolkata 's Dhakuria Lake with my great-grandfather , holding on to his index finger against the buffeting of a wily winter wind .
Something about the sunlight winking through the trees this morning reminds me of those , more innocent , times , and I 'm tempted to breathe it in gratefully .
But I 'm forestalled by the vigilant voice in my head- the virus can be airborne , surviving several hours .
Returning home half-an-hour later , I waft into a world of working-from-home husbands and their fragrant baking bread .
My toffee-haired Englishman , with chapatti flour to his elbows in the kitchen , looks up and beams .
There is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaves of bread at supermarkets .
And now , as others get wind of those of us baking our own , the flour is evaporating from shelves too .
Chapatti flour is crumbly and not the best for baking loaves but there is something deliciously devil-may-care about this fusion .
As there is in making spaghetti from sweet potatoes , or soya-milk Thai curry , because there is neither packet pasta nor milk to be found in stores anymore .
When the soap runs out however , we 'll be in a lather , because the one time I made soap in school , I got the acid-alkali balance so wrong , I singed my fingers .
But balance was never my forte and getting burned nothing new .
It 's a slow , pleasant burn I aspire to this time , working on our forest garden in the mellow English sun .
Spring is coming whether Corona likes it or not , and soon there 'll be ripening tomatoes climbing the trellis on our lawn , and chillis blazing brighter than the scarlet pots in which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , in lusciously reaching for the sun .
Last year we finally developed green thumbs and got it all to blossom before our dog chomped them straight off their stalks .
This year we hope to bring them in .
It wo n't be long either before trails of woodland nuts lead from our patch to the walnut copse .
From its secret pond last summer , our little boy caught 35 shimmering fish which he conscientiously threw back .
While it 's highly unlikely our homegrown meals will ever extend to fish from the emerald bog ( because it is a bog and not because we do n't eat fish , half-Bengali folk that we are ) , it is reassuring to know that a return to nature will keep the wolf from our self-employed door , should it ever come to that .
It will be a gilded cage .
Yet the cage I 'm most wary of is not our tree-smothered home , but my mind .
I suffer from severe anxiety that can spiral into deep depression , following a trajectory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the wrong crowd , who then take advantage , destroying both my perspective and peace of mind .
I walked this familiar , fraught path through my violent first marriage , and then again after a miscarriage eight summers ago , when I first got on social media and in with the shady sort .
This time when I self-isolate , it will be for a better tomorrow .
I will get my hands in the soil and nose in flour , my fingers inky with new writing and missives to the elderly far-flung ( my parents amongst them ) , and my eyes set firmly on the beautiful four who are my world .
Because the earth has been upended and toxic patterns must be shunned .
" Could thou and I with fate conspire To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire , Would not we shatter it to bits -- and then Remould it nearer to the heart 's desire ? " .
