Pandemic an opportunity to appreciate beauty of nature  A bird house became a life-saving respite for mice and voles as the snow began to melt in rural areas of our region .
David Hawke/OrilliaMatters  To enjoy another day of ' social distancing ' I took a wander through our tree farm to inspect for winter damage and assess what work may lay ahead in regards to pruning .
The snow had been dropping steadily and the remaining patches were still sturdy enough to walk on without snowshoes .
The freeze-thaw cycles of March were chipping away at winter in a delightfully steady fashion .
While the walking was easier I did miss the challenge of studying the tracks of those critters which passed by in the night or early hours of the day .
Turkeys , deer , coyote , cottontail rabbits , snowshoe hare , skunk and even a porcupine had been leaving signature marks in the snow as the travelled by or foraged between the rows of pine and oak .
The crusty surface of the snow now allowed them the ability to travel the farm without revealing themselves .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural denizens of the county , as many species have their lives dictated by the whims of the weather .
That blanket of insulating snow was a ' must have ' for mice , voles and grouse , and a deep layer is preferred by coyotes so that their prey species , such as deer , will flounder .
The first to feel the impact of the warmish weather were the white-footed mice and meadow voles , whose winter homes are an integral part of the snowy landscape .
Their winter residences are a dome of well chewed grasses enhanced with fluff from the seeds of milkweed , thimbleweed or sometimes cattail .
This cozy home is sandwiched within the snow between the frigid air above and the frozen soil below .
Running outwards from this home are several tunnels which lead to quiet feeding areas , possibly the base of a maple sapling or cherry tree .
Occasionally they will emerge above the snow to search for new feeding areas or to ventilate the tunnels .
But as the snow disappears , the droplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the whole structure collapsed .
And as the microscopic air pockets between the flakes were eliminated , so too was the insulating effect of the once fluffy snow .
Flooded out and forced above the protective snow , these small mammals had three options : freeze to death ( not a good option ) , become food for a predator ( I 'm sure they appreciated that their life was given so that another could live ) , or relocate to another , less than perfect home .
Around our place they went for Option 3 and have scampered up fence posts to occupy the bird houses that are perched on top .
Milkweed fluff and fine grasses have been hastily gathered and spirited up the post and tucked within the box .
Many of our nest boxes are claimed by wrens during the summer months , and wrens tend to stuff every nest box they find within their territory with twigs so as to discourage any other avian neighbours .
And so the mice have a lovely little crawl space above the twigs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the rest of the melting season .
As I paused in my wander , partially to catch my breath , partially to give thanks for being able to enjoy this setting , I had that funny feeling that I was not alone .
A glance around and sure enough , way over there , was a mouse peering at me from the shelter of its ' timeshare ' accommodation .
Perhaps I woke this up by the heavy tramping of my boots as I passed by , or perhaps it was just enjoying the warm sunshine , but it was quite fixated on me .
So I took a picture and took a step towards it .
Took another pic and another step .
Another and another .
Eventually found myself face-to-face with the wee timorous beastie which sat unblinking in the late afternoon sun .
We exchanged pleasantries ( well , I tried to but it just sat there staring at me ) and parted company .
The remainder of my walk was spent pondering the fact that I was not quite as alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many other species that share this space with me .
I realize that many ( actually all ) of my human counterparts have to display unnatural behaviors for the coming days and weeks of this health pandemic , so if and when you do get a chance to get outside , take a moment to look around and see that Nature is getting ready for a new season in the same ways it has for eons .
