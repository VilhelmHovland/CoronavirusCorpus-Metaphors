Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - The Western Cape Health Department is appealing to the public to stop using gloves and masks .
It warns these items have a risk of spreading coronavirus if not used properly .
The Head of the Western Cape Department of Health , Dr Beth Engelbrecht , says if a person is not ill and has not been in contact with infected persons they do n't need to wear masks and gloves .
" We saw that people are wearing masks and actually that could put them in more danger if they do .
If you wear a mask and you do n't need it then you fiddle with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the face is the area where most of the infection gets through to the body so it puts you at risk " , said Dr Engelbrecht .
She said washing your hands with soap and water and ensuring you do n't touch your face is the best solution .
