The committee , at the end of the meeting agreed to hold all policy parameters constant following recent interventions by the CBN to cushion potentially adverse impacts from the recent COVID-19 outbreak .
The committee 's decisions are stated as follows ;  The benchmark interest rate ( MPR ) was held at 13 .
The cash reserve ratio held at 27 .
The asymmetric corridor retained at +200bps and -500bps around the MPR  ? ? ? The Liquidity Ratio retained at 30 .
Today 's decision has reveled that the CBN has been trapped in a policy dilemma .
The past policies adopted by the regulator has left slim room for application of conventional monetary tools .
For example , interest rates can not be raised to fight inflation because it would worsen the slow growth caused by the Coronavirus and international oil price battles .
The unfolding events perhaps represent the limits of heterodoxy .
