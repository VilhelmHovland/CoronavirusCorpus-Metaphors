As the need for medical equipment grows across New York City , so does the need to keep workers using that equipment fed .
Jared and Kyle Lyons started Served Natural in February to create and delivery healthy meals in New York City .
Now , they 're delivering 750-1,000 meals to hospitals in the tri-state area each day .
" I think the biggest problem is one : a lot of restaurants are n't open , and two : especially with night shifts , no one is delivering at two in the morning , there 's absolutely nothing available , " says Jared Lyons .
The duo says after someone called to donate 100 meals a few weeks ago , they set up donations through their website .
They 've matched each meal donated so far  " While the whole world may be talking about PPE , feeding our staff is is important too , we 've got to make sure that they 're strong and they have the ability to come back and do the job that they 've been doing , " says Khari Edwards , vice president of external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
