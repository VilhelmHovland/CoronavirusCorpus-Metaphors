If you 're working from home because of the coronavirus outbreak , there are some things you can do to make sure you do n't strain your body .
Consumer Reports suggests you start with your chair .
The ideal seating position allows your feet to rest on the floor , while your pelvis and back fit against the back of the chair .
They say this will help support your body and avoid putting undue pressure on your back .
Make sure your screen is eye level , so that you 're gazing slightly downward toward the center of the screen .
This may keep your neck from straining , and will help prevent dry eyes , headaches and blurred vision .
When typing , aim to have your wrists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- with your shoulders relaxed , and your elbows near your sides or on the armrests .
Do n't cradle your phone between your shoulder and ear .
That will tighten up your neck , back and shoulders .
Instead , use earbuds or put the phone on speaker .
If working from a bed or couch , sit with your back to the wall or headboard with two pillows -- one horizontally behind your lower back , and one vertically to support your spine .
It 's also important to take breaks to allow your body to change positions frequently .
