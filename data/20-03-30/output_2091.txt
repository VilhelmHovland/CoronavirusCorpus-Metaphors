A ' Food Freak ' Describes Losing His Senses of Taste and Smell , a Coronavirus Symptom : ' Disconcerting '  Nabil Ayers is a Brooklyn-based writer and the U .
Head of the record label 4AD where he 's released albums by Grimes , The National and Future Islands .
Nabil started working from home due to illness one week before his office officially closed .
While sequestered in his apartment , in addition to his normal cold symptoms , he began to lose his senses of taste and smell .
One morning last week I woke up in the throes of a head cold that my doctor assured me was not Coronavirus .
But because of the outbreak and my cold symptoms , I stayed home , fatigued but cooking healthy , **31;310;TOOLONG meals simply because I had the time .
As my cold dissipated I experienced a strange symptom that I 've never had before : I lost all sense of taste and smell .
It came on gradually one morning and over the day , my senses dwindled to the point where I did n't even want to eat dinner because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my five senses were completely absent and I found myself staring into a refrigerator with the ability to only see , feel and hear the food on its shelves .
And none of it looked , felt or sounded appetizing .
Without taste and smell , food is reduced to texture and temperature .
Food becomes scientific , clinical , cold .
The cracker I placed in my mouth was still crunchy and I could detect a hint of saltiness , but it lacked the earthy flavor that I knew existed .
A spoonful of honey and lemon felt warm and sticky , but I missed its bright intensity as I gulped it down .
The final failed test was a big inhale over a bottle of 100-proof Kentucky bourbon , which might as well have been from a bottle of water .
It was as if a wall existed between me and food , like eating with a layer of Saran Wrap glued inside my mouth and over my nostrils .
I knew what I was supposed to taste and smell , but the sensations simply did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip a few days earlier in case the city shut down .
I loaded up on frozen vegetables , olive oil and canned goods at Trader Joe 's as if I might not return for weeks ; produce from my local bodega ; bulk rice and beans from my local health food store , where on the way out , the packaged turkey in the bright refrigerated aisle caught my attention .
I 've walked this aisle multiple times each week but this time , the turkey reminded me that it 's the perfect restorative food for such an uncertain time .
There 's something comforting about a turkey sandwich .
I learned how to make one on my own at a young age -- toasting the bread just right so it has a bit of crunch but not so much that it breaks apart when I bite into it .
In college , my sandwich consisted of two thin slices from a ninety-nine cent loaf of spongy , brownish bread that went stale because my roommates never sealed it properly .
I 'd cover one slice with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Costco run just before the school year .
Finally , I 'd place a few slices of salty , **28;343;TOOLONG turkey breast on one side and I 'd close it like a book .
Thin and simple -- that was it and it was perfect .
As my tastes developed and my income grew over the years , my turkey sandwich evolved .
Rustic rolls replaced plain old bread and sometimes , I 'd melt an expensive cheese on the roll .
Fresh cut organic turkey , seasoned with black pepper or rosemary .
replaced slimy , packaged slices .
I sliced red onion impossibly thin and added pickled peppers in an attempt to recreate the Italian subs I ate as a child in New York City .
Sometimes my sandwich ingredients cost more than I would have paid in a deli or a restaurant .
But the homemade version always tasted better .
It took me years to realize that while I do actually enjoy a turkey sandwich , there 's a lot more to my ritual than I thought .
My need to make and reinvent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something I can always make on my own ; something I can always afford no matter how dire my circumstances ; something that always tastes kind of the same , no matter how I make it .
Even at its most elaborate , the basic version can make me just as happy .
Back at home , my instincts kicked in and as I placed a plate in front of the toaster , flashbacks to a dozen kitchens rolled through my head from childhood to college to adulthood .
But the ding of the toaster alarmed me in an unfamiliar and distant way .
It surprised me because it was n't preceded by the warm , wholesome smell of toast .
I scraped the toast with my finger and it felt perfect -- warm with just the right amount of resistance to my fingernail .
And I thought about my body 's strange ability to quickly adapt -- to know that since my nose ca n't tell me the toast is done , my finger can -- something I likened to people who lose their sight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayo -- if I ca n't taste its zip , it 's a filler food that I do n't need .
I spread a layer of hummus on both pieces of toast , opting for the healthy protein and thinking , I could be spreading dog s -- t on my sandwich and I would n't know it .
Three slices of slightly damp turkey and a few pickle slices added purely for texture , and my sandwich was complete .
Without smell or taste , sound played a bizarrely significant role in my lunch .
My chewing took place in a secretive but loud meeting between my mouth and my ears , during which every crunch and every lip smack interrupted my thoughts .
I felt self-conscious , like I was eating with annoying volume , glad nobody else was there to bear witness .
I took a few empty gulps , hoping to trick my body into giving me just a glimmer of taste , but no such luck .
My sense of comfort juxtaposed against an undercurrent of fear and panic .
How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This simple meal , which had been so comforting for years , did n't do the trick anymore because my body had turned against me .
I continued to chew as if pretending to eat for a camera and I began to worry : what if I never regain my senses of taste and smell ?  I 've always been a food freak .
I love the ritual -- whether an indulgent four-hour dinner or a quick late night slice that burns the roof of my mouth .
I love the idea that people gather around food and that over the years , every culture has brought a version of theirs to New York .
I plan work meetings and vacations around meals .
But when taste vanishes , so too does much of the enjoyment .
Until now , I 'd never understood people who say , " I only eat because I have to .
" To make things even worse , not only could I not go out and eat with friends , I was incapable of enjoying food alone in isolation .
We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor we can easily talk to .
We live in a nice apartment surrounded by stores and restaurants who deliver .
Our refrigerator and cupboards have never been more full .
For the foreseeable future we were happy at home , basing our meals not on how they 'd taste , but on what they 'd look like and how they 'd feel , and the unappetizing nutritional consideration : What do our sick bodies need to get better ? We still talked about food .
Our brains remembered what pizza tasted like even though our mouths could n't .
But it was still so disconcerting to have something so taken for granted , suddenly taken away .
My sickness has passed and my senses of taste and smell are coming back now -- I 'm at about 50 percent -- and it feels like a gift .
The expression about not missing something until it 's gone has never felt closer to home .
I now appreciate more than ever my ability to smell and taste food in its most basic form .
Never before have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given so much thought to the complexity of peanut butter and why it tastes so different from peanuts .
As our senses return , our cravings return to the whims that we once took for granted .
We might not be able to enjoy foods from outside our immediate vicinity for quite some time , but we can make the meals we know , the ones that keep us healthy and provide the comforts of home .
