' My OkCupid date said he wanted to cook my body , turn me into ham and hang me up in his room '  Andreea , 25 , lives in London and works at a marketing company .
She was on a date with an OKCupid match when he chillingly told her he wanted to cook her body .
17  Andreea says her date seemed " perfectly normal " on the app - but that soon changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I met a London-based pastry chef on OkCupid two years ago .
He seemed like a perfectly normal guy and even made me a Spotify playlist of his favourite songs , which was nice .
The conversation was flowing so when he asked me out , I had no reason to say no .
For our first date , we decided to play pool , then go for some drinks .
He was a bit late , which I did n't like , but I thought , ' It happens ' .
He said he 'd stabbed another pupil when he was at school - then told me ' they deserved it '  Andreea  Yet when he finally arrived , the guy did n't look like he did in his pictures .
I knew he was n't my type at all - but I did n't want to be rude , so I still went ahead with the date .
I was n't very good at pool , so we had a few laughs about that .
Then the conversation got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best childhood and had experienced some issues with school .
When I asked him to elaborate , he said he 'd stabbed another pupil .
I remarked that he probably regrets it now - but he said : ' No , that person deserved it ' .
I suddenly started to feel very concerned .

I nervously made a joke about him being the dangerous ' bad boy ' type .
In response , he said if he was to actually kill me , he would probably cook me because he is a chef .
But he said he 'd only cook my bottom half .
He told me he 'd turn me into ham because I have nice legs and the upper half he 'd hang in his room because I 'm beautiful .
He told me he 'd turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  I know it was probably meant as a twisted compliment , but it made me feel more uneasy .
I told the guy I needed to catch my last train home , despite knowing full well I 'd missed it already .
He was n't very happy about it - he 'd wanted me to come over to his place .
But fortunately , he walked me to the station then let me go .
Later , the guy text me trying to explain why I needed a ' bad boy-type ' in my life .
I replied saying I did n't feel attracted to him at all , and the conversation ended there .

I decided to join Tinder a few months later - but was never really into the whole online dating thing .
I 'd say 80 per cent of the 20 or so guys who contacted me on the app were sleazy .
Some of them then added me on Snapchat , Instagram and other social platforms .
I 'd get all sorts of images sent to me - including guys showing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just the shape of it through clothing , but I got completely nude ones too .
They 'd tell me , ' This is what your photo has done to me ' .
As well as the usual d*** pics , I also got topless ones .
I even had someone send me a photo of their feet , asking if I 'd send one back !  Some guys sent me awful insults when I did n't respond to them .
17  One Tinder match added her on Instagram , Facebook and Twitter , before sending her abusive messagesCredit : Supplied  17  The man continued to harass her for years , despite not receiving a responseCredit : Supplied  In 2016 , not long after joining Tinder , I started talking to a guy coincidentally called Paris .
He messaged me saying how beautiful I was , and asked me where in the capital I was living .
I had some chit chat with him , but he got intense really quickly .
He came off a little creepy straight off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up b**** ' and ' f***ing wh*** ' - but I was too scared to block him  Abby  As soon as I deleted Tinder - for the sake of my mental health - Paris added me on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram , where he began sending me messages and liking my photos .
I ignored him - which made him furious .
He started insulting me - calling me things like " stuck up b**** " and " f***ing wh*** " - and asking me who the guys in my stories were .
I was too scared to block him in case it made his reaction even worse .
You do n't know what these people are capable of .
He knew what area I lived in , so I avoided riling him up further .
17  Abby was bombarded with pictures of roses and love heart emojisCredit : Supplied  17  And she was n't only abused by dating app users - one stranger got in contact with her via Facebook and told her " go kill yourself " Credit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now dating someone she met at workCredit : Supplied  I just waited for the harassment to fizzle out .
Finally , in December last year , it did .
Today , I 'm back in London and dating someone I met at work .
It 's not OK to be abused when you 're simply trying to find love  Abby  I definitely do n't want to go back to online dating .
I think people , including women , are pretty blas ? about it .
You sort of expect a certain amount of abuse or harassment when you join dating apps - but that attitude is n't right .
It 's not OK to be abused when all you have done is put yourself out there to try and find love .

It was a bit daunting , but not in the way that dating is in real life .
You do n't have to worry about shaky speaking or sweaty palms , but I did worry about who was seeing my account .
My first bad encounter was with a seemingly normal guy , who was 23 .
At first , we were having a normal chat and getting to know each other .
He was really open on his profile .
He talked about what uni he used to go to , what he did now , and his two dogs .
He messaged me late at night saying ' I fancy a chocolate midnight snack '  Emmanuela  One day , I replied to him at around 11pm because I 'm a night owl and it was a busy day .
My message was n't remotely sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late .
He replied with : ' Oh , it 's fine , I fancy a chocolate midnight snack ' .
I remember sending him a question mark because I was very , very confused .
In response , he said something along the lines of : ' Do n't be shy , we all know why we are on here ' .

But he kept going , asking me to add him on Snapchat and telling me : ' I have never done it with a black person before ' .
He then sent me a picture of himself topless on another social platform .
I felt so uncomfortable and fetishised , and stopped replying to him .
But he continued sending me messages well into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and ' I am just horny ' .
I reported and unmatched him , but I ended up feeling guilty - like it was my fault  Emmanuela  From past experiences , I knew he would n't take it well if I simply told him he made me feel uncomfortable - people like that are n't very self-aware .
So I reported and unmatched him - but I ended up feeling guilty .
I felt it was my fault for some reason .
Not long after , I deleted Tinder altogether .
Other users had added me on platforms like Instagram and sent me unsolicited pictures of themselves naked .
Some had got angry when I did n't respond fast enough .
