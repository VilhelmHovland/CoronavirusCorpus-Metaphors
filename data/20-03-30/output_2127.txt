business helps protect those still on the job from COVID-19 with transparent sheets of vinyl  Christine Zareck is helping protect those still working from COVID-19 by providing a transparent vinyl fabric as a sneeze guard , where feasible , to protect against droplet transmission .
- Contributed  While most Islanders are staying home to stop the spread of COVID-19 , some still have to work .
Christine Zareck , the owner of Material Girl in Charlottetown , has a solution for these frontline workers .
She makes a transparent vinyl fabric that can be used as a sneeze guard to protect against droplet transmission .
The idea originated with a recent trip to the drug store .
" I live in a mother-in-law suite , and the lady that owns the house , my neighbour , asked me to get her a thermometer from the pharmacy because she was n't feeling well .
I went to our local pharmacy and saw the painter-style plastic hanging as a shield of protection , " Zareck said .
" When I returned home , I started thinking about how these workers should have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on the job can be shielded with clear sheets of vinyl , thanks to a fabric business called Material Girl P .
" It takes a lot to hurt this material , which is easy to install , flexible , and it can be sanitized and cleaned with disinfectant sprays .
"  The pharmacy accepted the installation of her product , which included a white border , attachments , and a pass-through window , to safeguard their employees .
" I already have some of this fabric in my shop , and it only takes a week to get more from my supplier .
But if a customer needs this vinyl desperately , I can get it shipped at an earlier date .
My vendors , the warehouses , are still open , " she said .
In March 2018 , Zareck started her custom sewing business that specializes in repairing sailboat sails , boat covers and patio enclosures .
" Since opening , we have been very successful .
I just had the Home Show and the best response .
I was so excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this coronavirus happened , and all that work from the Home Show just shutdown .
My business virtually stopped .
"  In the current climate , Zareck has evolved to stay open while social distancing behind closed doors .
" We are certainly open to making outdoor cushions et cetera .
Our storefront has closed , but this does not mean we have stopped working , " Zareck said .
