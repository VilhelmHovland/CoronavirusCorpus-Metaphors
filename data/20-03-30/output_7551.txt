Air New Zealand to lay off 3,500 employees as virus halts travel  Air New Zealand said on Tuesday nearly a third of its employees , about 3,500 , will be laid off in the coming months , as it grapples with severe global travel curbs due to the coronavirus that has forced it to cancel nearly all flights .
The national carrier , which employs 12,500 people , said the announced number of layoffs was a " conservative " assumption , and that it could rise if the domestic lockdown and border restrictions were extended .
Large scale layoffs of its global staff will start this week , the company said .
Pictures : Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak around the world  " Unfortunately , COVID-19 has seen us go from having revenue of NZ$5 .
billion ( AUD$5 .
billion ) to what is shaping up to be less than NZ$500 million ( AUD$487 .
million ) annually based on the current booking patterns we are seeing , " Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said in an email to staff and customers .
" This has the potential to be catastrophic for our business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand is an example of the dire situation facing airlines across the world due to curbs on travel to control the spread of the virus .
" We have had to cut more than 95 per cent of our flights here in New Zealand and around the world .
The only flights remaining are in place to keep supply lines open and transport options for essential services personnel , " Foran added .
Earlier in March , the New Zealand government offered the airline an NZ$900 million ( AUD$877 .
million ) lifeline to keep it in the air .
The company also noted that " every dollar we use from this loan facility comes with interest ( more than double current interest rates for a household mortgage ) and must be re-paid .
"  " Burdening our airline with massive debt would significantly lessen our ability to compete with airlines emerging from COVID-19 , " said Foran .
He also said that in a year 's time he expects staffing levels to be 30% smaller than it is currently .
