You are here  Coronavirus : what Canadians need to know  " Since the outbreak began , 50 Ontarians who tested positive for COVID19 have been hospitalized , 17 of those needed ICU care , 17 have needed ventilators .
Out of the total of 588 , that means : 8 .
hospitalization rate , 1/3 of those needed ICU .
"  " The emergency measures announced March 19 by the Liberals in response to the economic distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic fall well short of what is needed .
The Canadian spending response - $27 billion for workers in need - amounts to a woefully inadequate one percent of GDP .
"  " .
It is no coincidence that Iran and Venezuela , two countries targeted by the US , are both being hit hard by the pandemic .
American sactions have wrecked both countries health infrastructure by curtailing access to foreign exchange and the capacity to import key medical inputs .
"  Regions across Canada are ramping up efforts to identify people with COVID-19 but some labs are facing a backlog due to diminishing supplies of essential chemicals needed for tests .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada 's chief public officer Dr .
Theresa Tam said Tuesday .
The World Health Organization has said expansive testing is the way to curb the pandemic , but global demand has outpaced the supply of reagents -- the specific chemicals needed by laboratories to complete the tests .
The Center for Disease Control in the United States has also said that important reagents are " now are in short supply , " a worry echoed by medical associations around the world .

?  When I first read about the possibility of a multibillion-dollar bailout of the oil and gas sector by the federal and Alberta governments , I was exhausted .
I was exhausted from days of ER work , personal protective equipment drills , obsessive counting of ventilators and considering how to encourage Canadians to have courageous conversations around end-of-life care .
I was too exhausted to even think about responding .
That was precisely the point .
Oil and gas companies , lobbyists and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians being too occupied coping with an ongoing health crisis to register that our country is considering a massive transfer of public funds to support the very industry most likely to cause the next health crisis .
And the health crisis after that .
And the health crisis after that .
" People are waking up to the fact that the US State and government does not belong to them but to a capitalist class that is only looking out for itself .
The oppressed should have no illusions .
The revelation of truth will be the only positive that will emerge from this crisis .
"  I wrote to Jagmeet Singh ( along with my MP and Trudeau ) about the problem with people who were unemployed before the virus hit .
These people did not lose employment because of the virus but have no realistic ability to get a job given the social distancing and closed organizations .
They are impacted by the virus but have no help .
I am in this position .
Singh 's office referred me to my MP despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program .
" We are sorry to hear about your difficulties .
To have your concern properly addressed , you will need to contact your Member of Parliament ( MP ) .
Each MP is responsible for making representation to the appropriate government department on behalf of their constituents .
"  Perhaps some people here might understand why I might never vote again .
In case anyone is interested the response from my MP included a personal phone call and offer to try to help .
The PM 's office ( not my MP like Singh ) at least stated referred the issue to a cabinet member for political polciy consideration ( my messages were identical ) :  " In your correspondence , you raise an issue that falls within the portfolio of the Honourable Ahmed D .
Hussen , Minister of Families , Children and Social Development .
I have therefore taken the liberty of forwarding your email to Minister Hussen for his information and consideration .
"  Not much of a response .
Only 10x better than that from Singh .
My MP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any possible support for me .
This I do expect from any MP for a constituent but I recognize the call was from the MP personally and came only a few hours after I sent the message .
I am sure the answer will be that there is nothing there .
So the only alternative is political and the NDP is not interested .
The NDP is supposed to be an opposition party taking suggestions and considering making proposals .
Maybe I should try my luck with the BQ and Green party and see if anyone there gives a shit about the people excluded from consideration in this emergency ?  Yes , I did respond to the NDP asking them to remove me from all lists of supporters and to please never contact me again looking for support .
Survival for me , after a career in communications will involve begging retail places to hire me in the surge they need .
It is true that I am in the age group where this exposure is stupid .
But like things are in the US - work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of money .
this is where the support for Trump to re-open the US comes from : people without alternatives or support .
I was nervous to even enter the store for supplies with mask and gloves and I may end up working there without protection -- if I am lucky enough .
This is where some of us are .
I have seen in online comments that I am far from alone .
Many in my position are also over 50 as this is the group that had difficulty getting work before the crisis .
Only now things are worse .
Of course if I could get the virus , I would get support and I might survive - better than 50-50 chance even at 55 .
It might be a better plan -- no ?  So sorry to hear that Sean .
How can anyone be that tone deaf to have a worse answer than Justin Trudeau and the Liberals ?  I am shocked .
Really .
The Liberals have presented their idea of what they think is right to parliament .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the Liberals even might be invested in their choosen option .
The NDP is supposed to consider what is coming from people and produce a response .
You would think apart from principles and the entire purpose of the party that the NDP would be in the position hard-wired to see if there was political policy merit in the point made .
I can not imagine how the NDP thinks it can grow support by blowing off people in ridings they do not hold .
No , I did not say I was a supporter in my first message .
I should not have had to .
I think it is truly astonishing that the NDP could not read my message and come up with an understanding of why I sent it to the leader of the party in the House that claims to care about people who is tasked with opposing a Liberal aid package in a crisis .
Are they that stupid ?  Yes , my message had wording that was along the lines of please let me know if things are as hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should get an administrative response from my MP but the copy that went to the PM and to the leader of the NDP should have been recognized as a political question even if I did not underline that .
They should have been able to see that I was pointing to a problem in the Liberal package and they could have taken it as a request to respond by looking at the package to see if it might be altered .
I did not change the wording of my message because it really explained my position .
I sent my message on Monday before the House met to debate the package .
The timing should have been clear to a competent politcian .
Singh 's assistant expressed sympathy but did not even fake interest other than to wish me well with empty words .
That was not his job .
The NDP either needs a new leader or Singh has to consider who is working for him .
There is no way I could support the NDP again with this leader in place at least -- if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does not come back by itself .
It needs to be earned by actually giving a shit .
ETA : If the NDP can not hold my vote , then really how viable are they ? I always was willing to criticize but I am in the ideology whose support they should count on .
I am in the loyal roup who has voted for them for 35 years .
The NDP is a third party .
Their main value in parliament is to take letters like what I sent along with expert ideas and produce alternatives .
They are not going to win any time soon .
their value is in standing up for Canadians who are vulnerable and who have fallen through the cracks .
After all -- what else are they for than to stand up and call for what is needed - at least - even if they can not do anything else ?  BTW - I am reading that there are likely thousands who were already looking for work when this hit and who officially have nowhere to turn and are directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as EI has already run out .

The Canadian Armed Forces offers an unmattched level of job security .
Jobs for those that want to work immediately and manager jobs for those interested in being paid to goto university .
And it does n't have to be a military university .
Many members go to Queens , Ottawa U and other universities across the country .

It is like the party had lost its soul .
Sean I empathize with you .
I am disgusted with the NDP but I do n't know who else to vote for .
it is pretty sad when you are more principled than the party you have supporter and worked hard for .
It is disillusioning actually .
I am so sorry to hear about your current situation .
It really bothers me to realize how bad this country has really sunk .
We really are n't that much better than the Unired Stares .
We are just a step above .

They are drafting the legislation now .
Write to every fucking MP in this country .
Let everybody know who votes that there is a problem .
Sean , your situation is horrible and unfair but maybe let it play out .
He called you personally and said he would look into it .
When he discovers there is nothing he can do maybe he will elevate it .
I am hoping that my MP will notice that this is a problem and that others are reporting the same thing .
Becuase I have roomers here and I have some small savings I may be able to last a little while , perhaps long enough for policy makers to notice .
Of course this also means impoverishing me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  In the past when I have approached my MP I found that if it is an administrative thing they can help but policy concerns are passed off to others and ignored without a reply .
It is hard to feel hopeful .
Given the size of the bailout and the number needing help now , I do not understand why the government is leaving out what are essentially small numbers of people compared to the need now but still quite a few who are affected by the pandemic .
I think the cost to have made it comprehensive would not have been much more .
The fact that it is often people in their 50s makes this worse .
The idea that people who were looking for work when this hit are not affected by this is bizarre .
I do feel dismay at the lack of interest of the NDP .
I reached out to Charlie Angus with personal messages and sent some to whoever is monitoring Singh 's twitter account .
It is possible somebody will decide to care .
The moment when the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel betrayed by the NDP which always claimed to care about people .
This was the only political story this week and the NDP mishandling a contact on this topic is strange .
Forgiveness is not imagineable at the moment .
On the other hand I do not feel well today .
My partner is also unwell .
We are afraid to go to the doctor for fear of getting the virus as we both do not think we have it as yet .
The worry that we might still there though .
We think we have something viral but pre Corona like a lingering flu .
She is here with a Quebec medical card and so going to a doc costs money ( doctors in Gatineau are scarce on a good day ) .
Venturing out to apply for a job when unwell seems unthinkable in the context of the public health directives .
I wish there was a way to get graphics contracts I could do here and deliver through the internet .
These have dried up though .

In the middle of this I am really worried about India , Palestine and Africa .
They are on the edge of a crisis without the resources .

Sorry for the derail : )  I am 55 .
I do have photography as a part of my communications background but the rest is complicated .
The short version is that my loan was called ( an error ) while I was in school and had a family member dying so I dropped out without the finances to continue .
I lack a formal university degree .
I worked in publishing ( started the company ) and have a lengthy informal education of 14 years where I edited for content and style manuscripts of university professors among others .
Lack of formal degree is a problem .
My French is functional but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communications position .
I moved on to a number of communications positions until being laid off at 53 .
I then had to fight with my last employer as there was no severance and they did not even pay accumulated vacation .
I did get this in the end but at cost of any recommendation .
Last year I got the last part of the settlement from that employer and have worked both the federal election for Elections Canada and for the Ontario by elections .
I also did a design contract for a few hundred in December .
This is what I have been living on .
This is why getting work has been a problem and why eligibility is a problem .
I do not think CF are interested in this profile .
I would try anything that has a chance though .
Desperation does that .

"  This could not be more clear .
The need to stay home is not only to flatten the curve but also to delay the peak .
Let me explain this :  Flattening the curve means that people get sick in a more spread out way so that the peak demand is lower .
We have all seen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constant .
This capacity is increasing as companies switch to produce more ventilators , beds , gloves and gowns .
By staying home you are not only flattening the curve but also delaying the peak .
Imagine the capacity as a rising line over the charts you have seen of flattening the curve .
The flatter curve in these models we have seen also peaks later where it may be below the rising capacity line even though the same level of peak earlier could be above it .
This is an additional explanation of the flattening the curve requirement .
It is also a major flaw in Trump 's argument .
Not only does a flatter curve have a lower peak , this peak is later so that increased capacity can catch up in key areas like venitlator beds and PPE for health workers .

As for Americans wanting to come here : they would not be able to get healthcare without status ; status will be refused ; the trip to the border would be dangerous -- their numbers would not justify a militarized border even as the crisis worsens in the US .
Canada of course will send any troops we have to provide assistance as needed as supply chains are interrupted , temporary hospitals need to be created -- for the emergency not for a fantasy problem at the border .

If you were unemployed in the market looking for a job then you did not lsoe your job becuase of this .
