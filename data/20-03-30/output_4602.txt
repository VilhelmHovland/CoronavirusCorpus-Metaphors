Queensland tech expo to hold ' virtual ' event after virus shutdown  The threat of coronavirus has seen multiple events and conferences shut down around the world , however one Queensland tech expo is determined to continue , using the very innovation it was set up to showcase .
QODE was gearing up for just its second year running in a few weeks after a successful launch last year in conjunction with the World Science Festival Brisbane and Curiocity .
While those latter two events have been cancelled , the event 's chief organiser Jackie Taranto said they wanted to still go ahead with their event .
This year 's QODE event in Brisbane will now be " virtual " after the main conference was shut down due to coronavirus concerns .
However , they also did not want to have a large number of people together in the same room , and so decided to make the second year QODE expo a " virtual " event .

Some speakers who are overseas we 'll bring in digitally and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom studio , " Ms Taranto said .
" We wanted to really show that Brisbane and Queensland is leading the world in this sort of thing , this is the new normal .
"  The studio set up in Brisbane will have all the bells and whistles of the main conference , just scaled down slightly , with users able to register and access the livestream through a YouTube channel .
Anyone who has bought tickets to the conference will get a refund , with the livestream free to access .
Ms Taranto said organisers were still working to finalise the revised line-up , but were trying to include as many of the original presenters as planned , with many already travelling to Brisbane ahead of the start of the conference on Tuesday , March 24 .
They were still trying to figure out a way to replicate the networking side of the conference , including a formalised pitch session with tech industry experts .

" That 's the thing about innovation , you 've got to be agile , able to pivot and shift - we talk about the future of work , but it 's not just a tagline any more , it 's real .
"  Full details of the revised program have been posted on the QODE website .
