SOUND OFF : Nurses sign letter demanding mandatory social isolation  As frontline British Columbia nurses , we want to join our voices with the Royal Columbian Hospital doctors in expressing our alarm at the insufficient and slow response of the federal and provincial governments to the current spread of COVID-19 .
The doctors ' warning must be heeded -- " we need to act now to prevent a catastrophic number of preventable deaths .
At our current rate of spread , our hospitals will be overwhelmed in a few weeks without drastic action .
We must slow the community spread of COVID-19 in B .
A community lockdown may seem drastic , but experiences throughout the rest of the world clearly demonstrate how critical it is to act decisively and urgently .
"  The measures taken so far have been welcome , but they are not sufficient .
In the last week alone between Monday and Friday , the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in British Columbia tripled .
On Monday , March 16 , there were 103 cases .
By Friday that had risen to 348 .
This means that if they continue to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by April 1 .
28,000 by April 8 .
84,000 by April 15 .
( * )  That is bad enough , but it actually understates the present situation .
The problem is not just that the number of confirmed cases is growing , but the rate at which they are growing is itself increasing .
On March 9 there were 32 confirmed cases in B .
Five days later there were 73 , an increase of 128 per cent .
On March 15 there were 88 cases .
Five days later there were 348 , an increase of 296 per cent .
COVID-19 in B .
( and presumably in Canada as a whole ) is still spreading exponentially .
There is no reason whatsoever to think we can not become another Italy .
If nothing changes radically , we are certain to .
The only step that can prevent this is massive social distancing on a scale qualitatively beyond what has been done so far , because what has been done so far is simply not working .
To work , social distancing needs to include a mandatory shutdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery stores , gas stations , pharmacies and healthcare facilities .
It needs to include a shutdown of every place that can multiply the spread of the virus .
We need to apply the same logic requiring the closure of schools to every similar institution .
For example , every construction camp needs to be closed , or we will continue to concentrate thousands of individuals in close quarters , with shared dining halls , bathrooms and bunk facilities , only to have them periodically fly out on leave and disperse across the province every few weeks .
Social distancing requires that we house the homeless , but in a way that disperses them rather than jamming them into shelters that will only accelerate the virus ' spread .
There are thousands of unoccupied housing units , hotel rooms and motel rooms in the Lower Mainland .
They need to be accessed .
Finally , we need to make social distancing possible .
We need to provide financial supports for everyone who has lost their job .
We need to provide guarantees against eviction for non-payment of rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and medication for everyone housebound due to quarantine , voluntary isolation or mandatory social distancing .
We need to resolve the problem of daycare for every class of essential workers ( truckers , grocery employees , couriers , firefighters , janitors , healthcare workers ) to keep them working .
There needs to be free hotel accommodation for doctors , respiratory therapists , nurses , housekeeping , paramedics , security , kitchen staff so we do n't have to fear we will bring the virus home to our families .
We also need to be guaranteed adequate supplies of PPE -- N95s , gowns and gloves -- to keep us at work as caregivers , not patients .
Governments must take every step they can to remove the barriers that force people -- especially poor people -- to ignore calls to stay at home .
We are all too aware of the risks we are facing , not only to our own health but to our families as well .
We will stay at our posts nonetheless .
But we insist -- we demand -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date are not working .
This is an emergency .
We need to act like it 's an emergency .
