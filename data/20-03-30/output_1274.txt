But Australia 's PM declares it does n't align with national values  The UK 's Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) has provided advice to the government that it can use anonymised mobile phone data in the fight against coronavirus .
Deputy commissioner Steve Wood took to the interwebs on Saturday to state : " Generalised location data trend analysis is helping to tackle the coronavirus crisis .
Where this data is properly anonymised and aggregated , it does not fall under data protection law because no individual is identified .
"  " In these circumstances , privacy laws are not breached as long as the appropriate safeguards are in place , " the statement added , before concluding : " The ICO has provided advice about how data protection law can continue to apply flexibly to protect lives and data .
The safety and security of the public remains our primary concern .
We will continue to work alongside Government to provide advice about the application of data protection law during these unprecedented times .
"  Several nations -- among them Israel , Taiwan , Singapore and Hong Kong -- are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or new arrivals who are felt to be at risk of having encountered coronavirus carriers .
Now the UK has legal opinion that will let it join their ranks .
Privacy International , in a post made before the ICO announcement , suggested that any such use of data must be subject to " extraordinary protections " and pointed out that it is possible under some circumstances to deanonymise data .
No such problems in Australia , where Prime Minister Scott Morrison replied to a question about the ICO advice , and whether Australia would adopt it , by saying : " Well the Australian government is n't doing that .
What I want to be clear about is the policies and measures that we will put in place for Australia will be right for Australia .
They will understand how Australia works and how Australia thinks and what our rules are and what our society understands and accepts .
Our values .
That is what we will do in Australia .
We 're not going to go and cut paste measures from other places , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China they were welding people 's doors shut .
That might be okay with them , but what I 'm saying .
And the UK is a different society to Australia , I would also stress .
