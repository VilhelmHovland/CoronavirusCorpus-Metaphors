People of diverse faith persuasions keep invoking God because the situation we are in warrants .
People pray to God for His intervention at this time of peril and calamity .
It is to be borne in mind that God is not playing dice and He shall never intervene to our calls .
It is absurd to constrict God to our time and space .
God is beyond and is infinite .
His infiniteness is beyond time and space and so expecting God 's interventions in such scenarios leads to reductionism .
Prayers and actions are needed , but our proximity with God should become closer because we keep distancing from God as we are totally engrossed with the demands of the worldly things .
The material world lures and pushes us towards that .
In the process , we have mammonized the divine and divinized the mammon .
We as mortals have no control over God 's space and time and so in His time and space God shall answer to our prayers .
God is in total and absolute control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world belongs to Him .
It is this faith affirmation that keeps us to move on in this world .
We may talk about our time and space and should never impose our time and space to God 's time and space .
When we affirm that He is our Creator and Sustainer -- whatever we face and are happening around us and in this world have to come to an end not in our time and space , but in God 's time and space .
It 's absurd to call God and expect God to intervene whenever we are struck with grief and calamity .
God is not playing dice , but watching over His created order , because He is All-Knowing and All-Encompassing .
Having created us in His image , God has given the complete dominion to us -- not to dominate , but to be the stewards of God 's created order .
We went in our own ways and destroyed the nature and trampled upon His commands and mandates because of our selfishness , greed and avarice .
We did abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our own ways and failed to take note of God 's commands .
We at this juncture do not know the very origin of COVID-19 .
We keep speculating many theories but nothing seem to moving in the right direction .
Nothing can be done except waiting patiently , praying to God and engaging in services helping our neighbors and community .
When we acknowledge God who is Supreme , then , who are we to measure God 's time and space -- Omnipotent , Omniscient and Omnipresent ?
