A cyclist in Italy has posted a bizarre video to YouTube showing him arguing with police officers who stopped him for violating a ban on riding bikes due to the coronavirus outbreak , telling them he did not consider himself subject to the country 's laws .
Meanwhile , a video in Spain shows a police officer apparently shoving an English speaking cyclist , telling him he was n't allowed to be out in the street due to the country being in lockdown .
Italy and Spain are the two European countries currently worst affected by coronavirus , with 1,809 and 288 deaths recorded so far .
