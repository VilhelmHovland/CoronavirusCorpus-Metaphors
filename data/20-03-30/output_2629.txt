Opinion : P .
city council needs to show they can work together amid COVID-19 pandemic  OPINION : The opinions , beliefs and viewpoints expressed by the writer of this editorial do not necessarily reflect the opinions , beliefs and viewpoints of paNOW or the Jim Pattison Broadcast Group .
paNOW News Director Glenn Hicks comments on the optics of what happened at Monday evening 's council meeting .
Prince Albert city council is playing an embarrassing game of hide and seek in the open .
At best it 's another example of our politicians ' inability to get along and work collectively ; at worst it 's a dangerous move that hinders democratic debate at a time when such behaviour is certainly not needed .
There 's a reason why sports across the planet have been cancelled .
This is not the time for city councillors to attempt to fill that void .
paNOW generally does not do editorials -- we leave the community engagement and comment to our very popular Facebook page -- but , given the extraordinary times we 're in amid the COVID-19 pandemic , we thought it necessary .
Folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a period of great social isolation .
It could be very stressful for some .
We should be talking to each other ; councillors included .
On Monday night , with an important council meeting about COVID-19 on the agenda , three councillors were already missing .
Evert Botha and Charlene Miller chose to maintain their self-imposed absence based on their social distancing stance that such meetings should now be happening electronically or not at all .
We understand the third councillor , Dennis Ogrodnick , was self-isolating as a precautionary measure .
As proceedings unfolded , Coun .
Terra Lennox-Zepp went through a long laundry list of motions and attempted to get them on the floor for debate .
Most of them gained no traction and , without a seconder , they went nowhere .
When she continued to bring further motions forward two other councillors followed each other out the door , about five minutes apart : Ted Zurakowski and Blake Edwards .
Edwards told paNOW the next day he walked out because of his frustrations with Lennox-Zepp in the manner in which she brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he had a personal family matter to deal with .
This is not right .
With three people already choosing to stay away , it means any two others can now technically and mathematically hold matters to ransom -- intentionally or not -- whether that 's because they do n't like what 's being put on the council floor , they are frustrated , tired , or because they think they have something more important to deal with .
This is not a good situation at a crucially important time for collective decision-making and leadership .
Should we be surprised by what happened Monday night ? This is after all a council that , by the self-admission of its most veteran member , Don Cody , is " dysfunctional .
" He has already wondered , very publicly , " why do n't we trust each other ? "  This is a council that has the mayor and a councillor taking each other to court in a " he said , he said " spat which has been the basis for sanctions on ethics grounds -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already divided chamber .
That followed a council imbroglio surrounding the sexual innuendo social media message mini-scandal that resulted in further sanctions .
This is a council where divisions are palpable around the table each week and where you can almost see the internal cringing and the eye-rolling of senior staff as councillors bicker .
This is the council that when offered a course on conflict resolution , squabbled about it .
Go figure .
Forget social distancing ; this is a council where it seems some ca n't stand the sight of each other .
Two metres social distancing ? Try two miles .
The optics of Monday night 's walk-out are ugly .
As always , city councillors will likely hold their own personal grudge-based territory on this one , dig in , and claim it 's the other guy 's or gal 's fault .
At least one councillor took to Facebook to keep the already incendiary situation ablaze .
Well , like it or not P .
city council , you need to get along .
In case you have n't heard there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for leadership and togetherness .
Yes , there are more personal vendettas around the P .
council table than in a Godfather movie , but how about just faking the collaboration if you really have to guys ? Optics is everything at the moment .
It says much about this city council that some of its members may now be reading this editorial desperate to put their social media fingers to work in reaction , others may just be seething quietly , others might laugh , others may contemplate legal action , and at least one wo n't care a darn because of their ( perhaps astute ) ability to completely ignore social media .
We 're all missing sports on the TV at the moment , but what Prince Albert could do without is the second-rate soap opera we 're witnessing again around the council table .
Actually , maybe it 's a psycho drama .
One thing it certainly is not is comedy .
Not during a COVID-19 pandemic .
Editor 's note : paNOW does not have a regular editorial section but in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paNOW regarding the events that unfolded Monday evening .
Family and friends of a local high school student found a way to figuratively come together to give her a birthday surprise , despite social distancing protocols .
Szell , 19 , organized around a dozen of her younger sister Bria 's loved ones to fill the family 's driveway with birthday messages written in chalk .
Calling it horrific and incomprehensible , the chief of the Prince Albert Police Service ( PAPS ) says an investigation is underway into the killing of three people in the city Sunday night .

Also , a five-year-ol .
A member of the Prince Albert RCMP has tested positive for COVID-19 and is now self-isolating as per direction from the Saskatchewan Health Authority .
