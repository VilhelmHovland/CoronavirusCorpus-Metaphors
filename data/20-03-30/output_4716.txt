CASH AND DATA : Wage subsidy good idea , not so means of delivery  To submit a letter to The Age , email letters@theage .
Please include your home address and telephone number .
The government 's plan to pay a subsidy to workers made unemployed by COVID-19 is excellent .
However , the idea of channelling the payments through employers is a curious one .
Surely , to determine the amount of money the employer is meant to transfer on , said employer would have to provide details of their previous employees and their wages .
Illustration : Andrew Dyson  Why not avoid double handling by simply paying the money directly to the employees .
Heaven forbid to think that some employers might exploit the government 's plan , but just in case .
Bill King , Camberwell  Advertisement  Super implications need explaining  Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has criticised super funds questioning the government 's decision to allow people impacted by the pandemic of " poor investment performance " .
Fund members suffering hardship are entitled to withdraw $20,000 tax free from their fund in two tranches of $10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be withdrawn at more than Treasury estimates of $27 billion .
Superannuation is to provide a comfortable retirement for workers and should be a last resort for fund members , but no mention of this by Bragg .
Industry Super has estimated a 20-year-old taking out $20,000 could retire on $120,000 less than they might otherwise , a huge setback for their " comfortable retirement " .
Some will wipe out their entire super balance .
The concern is that the implications of early withdrawal will not be explained thoroughly to those withdrawing .
Neil Hudson , East Melbourne  An expectation , reasonable and unrealistic  Sean Kelly ( Comment , 30/3 ) wants the government to be upfront with us about the rationale for its decision-making in its efforts to contain the viral spread .
Although this is a completely reasonable expectation , it 's not going to happen .
In a defensive political mindset of always hedging its bets , always trying to second-guess the opposition in order to gain the upper hand , the government will forever be unable to escape into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was elected to do : show some leadership .
Now is not the time for it to hesitate while it quibbles about details , it 's surely the time for real leaps of faith and resolute action .
Jenifer Nicholls , Armadale  It 's economics over health  I agree with Sean Kelly in his thoughtful and sensible article .
The lack of detailed information from Scott Morrison is causing much anxiety because we have so little information about how the government is assessing the risks .
It appears that economic considerations are taking precedence over health .
My concern is that the lack of testing in the population must mean that there are people carrying the virus who are either not aware that they are , or know that they have some symptoms but are carrying on regardless .
Therefore nobody knows , so in the situation where there is no lockdown and people are still flocking in numbers to certain retail outlets , there may be many more people with the virus than we know about .
Irene Bolger , Fairfield  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85-year-old potential victim of the virus I was more reassured by Rob Harris ' " Inside the PM 's circle " than Sean Kelly 's " Morrison ca n't turn the tide " ( 30/3 ) .
Mathematical modelling is a useful tool not an exact science .
Given the breadth of expert advice available to both the federal and state governments , I see no value in encouraging the public , or former political advisers , to access modelling and second guess decisions made under extraordinarily difficult circumstances .
That would only lead to more confusion and anxiety .
Geoffrey Green , Toorak  FORUM  It 's only a fortnight  As the coronavirus has been spread to this country by mainly Australians returning from overseas I find the resentment by hopefully a minority of these people at being quarantined to be most puzzling , especially as their stays in hotels are being paid for by taxpayers .
Surely they have loved ones waiting for them who they wish to protect from any possible infection they might carry .
As well , these travellers may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who remained in the country and have lost their jobs due to the spread of the infection .
How about less selfishness and consideration for others .
A fortnight is not long .
Iris Owen , Geelong  Exercise consideration  Do the under-40s understand or care what social distancing means ?  I am 77 and need to walk daily for health reasons .
I walk around residential streets avoiding the shopping centre .
Along the way I encounter a few people .
Most of us make sure that there is plenty of room to pass by either stepping into a driveway or crossing the road , but the joggers under 40 just do n't care .
They occupy the footpath , leaving no space to pass safely even though they have seen me .
Or perhaps I am the cellophane lady , invisible as I just do n't count ? When they are at traffic lights , they exercise , arms swinging , regardless of others waiting to cross .
When will the messages penetrate their bubble ? With more workers staying at home and their gyms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day .
I just want to be able to do my walk , in safety .
Brenda Mouritz , Toorak  Educate , and enforce  Drivers mostly flout temporary road-works speed restrictions , just as many folk seem to be ignoring social-distancing advice for coronavirus protection .
Two possible explanations arise : ( a ) this is a temporary disturbance to normal routines , and ( b ) the chances of enforcement are small .
Both imply anti-social attitudes : if it does n't affect me , why should I care ?  Sadly , therefore , it looks like enforcement is as necessary as education .
( Citizen intervention is likely to be counter-productive , judging by the climate wars .
)  Peter Greig , Colac  General health , too  As a retired pharmacist I agree with the need for physical distancing , but I am concerned that people will fail to monitor their general health .
It is important for people to maintain contact with their GP and pharmacist .
I believe that you can consult your GP per phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safely send to the patient or pharmacy via email .
However , there has not been much detail as to how to do this .
I would also like a physiotherapist to write on how to deep cough to prevent a build-up of fluid in the lungs before it becomes a problem .
Robert Sinclair , Glen Waverley  The ' me ' syndrome  I 'm not surprised by the behaviour of so many who appear to be oblivious to the dangers of COVID-19 .
( " Locals upset as visitors flock to sea " , 30/3 ) They 're suffering from the 21st century disease of entitlement , which has given them the illusion that they are immune from life 's most unpleasant surprises , and free to do exactly as they please , and damn the consequences .
A vaccine may well be on the way to counteract the coronavirus , but unfortunately there are too few antidotes to ignorance , complacency , and the " me " syndrome .
Helen Scheller , Benalla  A puzzling essential  On Sunday , the Prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
He tried to illustrate by describing that his wife had gone out to buy jigsaws for their girls .
My wife and daughters have been buying new toys for our little ones online .
Why go out when there are options ? Can someone please clarify what is essential for the Prime Minister .
Geoff Cheong , Aspendale Gardens  Super publicity  The government is now allowing eligible people to withdraw up to $20,000 from their super .
It is said this may damage the funds , as they might have to sell assets in a depressed market .
I understand the minimum drawdown rates from funds in pension mode has been temporarily halved .
This needs to be far more widely publicised as it would act to offset the negative effects on the superannuation funds ' cash outflow .
Joan Broadberry , Templestowe  Shooting ducks advice  Even with the government 's continued warnings to stay at home due to the coronavirus pandemic and with Victoria in total lockdown , the duck shooting season is still scheduled to go ahead at 8am on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a mockery of the government telling Victorians that " only essential travel is permitted " due to the coronavirus .
Gail Nowaski , Buninyong  Child 's play  I do n't have to " imagine a bright six-year-old asking : Mum , what are those funny things on the telly ? " ( Letters , 30/3 ) .
The dog park has many of those vivid tactile spherical objects " with strange protrusions " .
Rather than causing distress , an eight-year-old simply yelled " do n't touch Fido 's corona ball , it 's covered in dog slobber " .
Mother and child had already investigated the " frightening " nature , structure and chemical composition of what constitutes a virus in a textbook and on the web .
The child 's demeanour and comprehension suggested that she will survive to romp in her STEM studies .
Ronald Elliott , Sandringham  Look into Telstra  My sympathies , Linda Jarvis ( Letters , 30/3 ) .
I was forced to abandon my broadband and landline services three years ago because both were unreliable ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working service ) .
Last November the download speed on the 4G service on which I now rely dropped to less than 1Mbps .
The service now is variable , and often becomes unusable .
I went through four complaint levels , starting with a phone call and ending with a letter to the CEO .
We need an inquiry into Telstra just like we had into the banks .
It was responsible for providing an essential service .
It is now responsible for providing a critical service .
Jan Lacey , North Melbourne  Invest in resources  In South Korea , Malaysia and other countries , widespread testing , the isolation of infected individuals and the tracing of their contacts have helped limit the spread of coronavirus .
Why has Australia done so little testing ? Is it because we lack facilities for producing test kits ?  If so , it shows negligence on the part of successive governments .
Previous outbreaks of new diseases such as SARS and swine flu have shown the need for preparedness .
The government must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Chris Slee , Coburg  A good walk spoilt  Banning golf in Victoria is draconian ( " Fair way to go before golf 's back " , 30/3 ) .
Golf is a non-contact sport .
During a round , the only time there is any personal contact is at the end of the round when the players shake hands .
This practice must be banned .
The rest of the time , the players are several metres and up to 100 metres apart .
Of course , clubhouse access and socialising must be banned , and all golfers would agree that this must continue during the COVID-19 emergency .
The two irresponsible golfers who skipped isolation to play golf should not be a reason to ban golfing in Victoria .
It should be remembered that for many elderly golfers , golfing is the only exercise they have to keep fit and healthy .
Bill Mathew , Parkville  The age divide  I am over 70 and wonder how this government-ordered demographic divisiveness will be healed when COVID-19 wanes .
The implication appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you receive if you become ill .
As other older letter writers have said , we 've faced our inevitable mortality , but I really do n't enjoy being treated as one of an expendable group .
Something to ponder when this is over ?  Julie Stayner , Mernda  Do n't forget the needy  The headlines say it all -- " Disabled in ' crisis ' as carers overwhelmed " and editorial " Struggling renters must be helped " ( 27/3 ) .
There 's no doubt that Scott Morrison and Daniel Andrews are doing a sterling job in hellish circumstances trying to keep us safe and healthy while managing the sinking economy , but I put in a plea for them to do all they can to support the disabled , the homeless and renters .
Hopefully we 'll come through this crisis a more compassionate and caring community .
Fr Kevin Burke , Sandringham  Be rid of pokies  With gaming machines now idle because of coronavirus-induced closures , an opportunity will present itself to make their non-functioning permanent .
These addictive poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our broader society and economy a huge benefit .
A no-pokies Victoria emerging from the otherwise crippling virus emergency will guarantee an edge and a new dawn .
A Labor government introduced them and a Labor government should rectify that mistake and get rid of them .
Let 's go for it .
Tony Delaney , Warrnambool  Research funding  When life returns to a semblance of normality after the pandemic will the federal government commit to greatly increased funding of medical research institutions working in the fields of virology and epidemiology ? And will this funding be increased on a yearly basis ?  Graham Williams , Glen Waverley  AND ANOTHER THING  Pandemic  Scott Morrison thinks jigsaw puzzles are essential items .
Those without jobs are just hoping they can keep a roof over their heads and food on the table .
Julie Carrick , Leopold  So , was today 's message stay home unless you need jigsaws ?  Lindsay Donahoo , Wattle Glen  What I understood from the PM 's news conference is if you go for food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawthorn  Next weekend we turn our clocks back ; four months would be good .
Henry Herzog , St Kilda East  All of a sudden , " preppers " are n't that crazy after all .
Ed Veber , Malvern East  With the huge spike in unemployment , not only job-sharing may be considered , but well-off baby boomers could just retire .
Angus Reynolds , Ashburton  Virtually everyone has a credit or debit card these days , perhaps now is the time to move to a cashless society .
Reg Murray , Glen Iris  Anthony Albanese , take the opportunity to show leadership by insisting Labor MPs take a pay cut .
Others will be shamed into following .
Ralph Frank , Malvern East  We would not have had a problem with Aspen skiers if they had not gone skiing at the cheap end of the season .
