UK trials new breathing aid developed by Mercedes Formula One  3 Min Read  LONDON ( Reuters ) - A new version of a breathing aid that can help coronavirus patients has been developed in less a week by a team involving Mercedes Formula One , and is being trialed at London hospitals .
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) devices have been used in China and Italy to deliver air and oxygen under pressure to patients ' lungs to help them breathe without the need for them to go on a ventilator , a more invasive process .
The new CPAP has already been approved by the relevant regulator and now 100 of the machines will be delivered to University College London Hospital for trials , before being rolled out to other hospitals .
Reports from Italy indicate that approximately 50% of patients given CPAP have avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation , which involves patients being sedated , freeing up ventilators for those more in need .
" These devices will help to save lives by ensuring that ventilators , a limited resource , are used only for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mervyn Singer said in a statement on Monday .
" We hope they will make a real difference to hospitals across the UK by reducing demand on intensive care staff and beds , as well as helping patients recover without the need for more invasive ventilation .
"  The new breathing aid was developed by engineers and clinicians at UCLH teaming up with Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains who worked at UCL 's MechSpace hub to reverse engineer a device that can be produced quickly .
Asked about the risk to healthcare workers of using CPAPs as contaminated droplets can escape from the device , Professor Rebecca Shipley , Director of UCL Institute of Healthcare Engineering , told the BBC , that the risks were very low if those workers wore appropriate personal protective equipment .
She also said that the new device could be scaled up very quickly .
" Mercedes can make 1,000 a day within a week , and if the tests go well they can be in the NHS by the end of this week , " Shipley told BBC radio .

The team working on it also includes Oxford Optronix , a small company that will manufacture the oxygen monitors for the CPAP devices .
Britain announced separately on Monday that it has placed an order for 10,000 ventilators to be made by a consortium of companies including Ford ( F .

) and Rolls-Royce ( RR .
) as part of efforts to fight the coronavirus , an industry source told Reuters .
