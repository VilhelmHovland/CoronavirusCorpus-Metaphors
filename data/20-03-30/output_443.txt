The key : Will the adults in the room recognize a full exploration of repricing is warranted now ?  You have to believe right now that the lawyers and numbers crunchers in and around the Eldorado Resorts Inc .
deal ( ERI ) to acquire Caesars Entertainment Corp .
( CZR ) are massaging scenarios as the coronavirus continues to deflate sector values in an endless downward spiral at the moment .
The questions they could be wrestling with are many .
But only one qualifies as a burning : The deal was closed pre-virus , with valuations then based on current and recent trades .
Since then , we have fallen into the dark ages .
The Roman Empire collapsed around 460AD , and it took nearly 700 years before the world emerged from the Dark Ages period into the early Renaissance .
While we are now in clearly in a dark ages market , we are hopefully not looking at 700 years before we see the light again .
Data by YCharts  They say that those who do n't learn from history are condemned to repeat it .
We think there are enough adults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ERI deal to recognize that investors deserve clarification on the possibility of repricing before closing sometime within the next 90 days .
Carl Icahn has casually raised the possibility .
Although he is known as a man who never leaves a dime on the table he thinks he can sweep into his kitty , he is also one of the key adults in this drama .
The history first  The deal was largely the brainchild of Icahn and ERI CEO Tom Reeg .
Both these men are among the savviest operators in the gaming business : Call them Mr .
Inside and Mr .
Outside .
There were other potential suitors .
But Icahn was the key here because , from his perspective , Reeg was the only guy who was short on talk and long on action : he put money on the table while others blew up trial balloons .
In brief , ERI will acquire all outstanding shares of CZR for $12 .
a share for cash and ERI common .
The cash component is $8 .
, and the deal exchanges 0 .
of ERI common for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set at the May 23 , 2019 30-day volume weighted average price .
The key cash component of the deal would amount to $7 .
billion .
The new company would also assume CZR 's long-term debt of $18 billion as of 12/2019 .
The solid CZR created VICI Properties is a key REIT player in the deal as well .
It committed to a $3 .
billion transaction that will bring together Harrah 's properties in Atlantic City , Laughlin , Nevada , and New Orleans , which will pour $1 .
billion into the new CZR coffers .
It will blend the above master leases , adding $154 million to the $98 million already paid by CZR 's Caesars Palace and Harrah 's Las Vegas .
At closing , ERI shareholders will own 51% of the new company and CZR holders 49% .
Total price tag : $17 .
billion , a heavy number some analysts believed to be far too pricey .
Pricey yes , but from our perspective on a go-forward basis , Reeg and Icahn would be creating the runaway casino giant of the US with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverse and propelled by the near-60 million member CZR/ERI blended Total Rewards database .
Pre-virus , the expectation was that the new company ( under the CZR name ) would debut in a robust US economy .
Here 's a look at the pre- and post-virus related price movement :  Stock May 23 , ' 19 Pre-virus 2020 At writing  CZR $9 .
ERI 48 .
There could be a bit more downside here .
It 's anecdotal , but as of this writing , the April 17 option put at $3 .
is implying high volatility to come .
We wo n't speculate what options traders and arbs may see in a stand-pat or a repricing to come because they probably do n't know anything you do n't at this point .
They are making proposition bets common in craps games coming from the gut .
We in the business tend to look at prop bets laydowns as having an emotional sucker element .
But sometimes you blow on the dice and they do listen .
What actually counts : The mover-and-shaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6,000 lb gorilla in the institutional ownership cages .
The question : If the deal is repriced , will they rattle and growl enough to change the state of play in the deal ?  Carl Icahn : Now sitting on 114,250,942 shares , or 16 .
of the outstanding , worth at $814 million as at writing .
Just below is BlackRock with 51 .
million shares , representing 7 .
of the outstanding , or $367 million .
Together , these three biggies control 31 .
of the deal .
Logic dictates that the soft spot here for a repricing is to reduce the cash component from $8 .
in order to shrink the total cash ERI will need to borrow to close .
Perhaps there will be pressure from lenders for just such a move , perhaps not .
Are these guys open to this possibility ? On the basis that post virus , would the fundamental potential of the deal would make ERI stock ( under the new CZR name ) far more valuable than the $8 .
in cash in a rapidly recovering market ? The bet : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark ages to come , it 's a bad bet .
On the other hand , if we finally do get a handle on the virus and we begin to see a rapid decline of new cases post June , the fattened stock component could begin to look very much richer than the cash would have been .
What is key here is that any reduction in borrowing to close the deal will have a salubrious effect on the new , emergent CZR .
It lowers leverage and strengthens the cash position .
At of this writing , CZR is sitting on $1 .
billion in cash , translating to $2 .
per share in a stock now trading at $7 .
With the concomitant reduction in interest cost , the new company can incrementally improve its chances for producing a better forward EBITDA performance , impressing Mr .
Market and pushing the stock higher .
The result : Big holders who agreed to reduce the cash component of the deal will have a successor stock traded potentially higher because it would produce better-than-anticipated earnings in a recovery phase .
( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will sit at the apogee of the biggest gaming company in the US with both Vegas and regional scale .

The nuclear option : Force Majeure  Now , suppose any repricing proposal triggers a thunderous " No way ! " from key players as well as small holders .
Add to that possible growing pressure from lenders to either reprice or pull their financing commitment .
This could easily explode into a cannonade of lawsuits that , in the end , would do little else than drain already strained resources .
But we need to be realistic here .
The market indeed is ruled by fear and greed .
And when they rear their ugly heads , the lawyers step into the breech .
But that , in turn , opens this question : Can ERI seek relief claiming a force majeure event for which the coronavirus qualifies in many respects ? Such a claim can be tricky .
We do n't know if the deal has an epidemic clause in the lineup of laundry list force majeure events .
To dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Akin Gump law firm as well as our own inner circle of gaming attorney friends .
The legal consensus  ERI would assert that the virus was an event that was beyond reasonable control .
No problem there , but if a court sees a force majeure event as a single rather than ongoing threat , a precise definition , the company could be out of luck .
Then , the attorneys would have to lean on English common law - a slender reed , at best .
ERI would need to prove that the event produced a material adverse change in the operating assumptions behind the structure and pricing of the deal .
This would present an easier legal hurdle but no certainty either .
Deals have a longstop deadline .
Given the catastrophic impact of the virus wreaking havoc on visitation , ERI would petition to extend the closing date to such a time when the virus is behind us .
The properties can be reopened and business as usual , if not better , owing to cabin fever marketing programs aimed at Total Rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little question that a serious discussion of legal remedies in repricing the deal needs to be undertaken , if it has not been seriously considered already .
Who will rule , adults or puckish children in the deal ?  The biggies in the transaction need to face facts now .
There is no escape from the hard reality that the deal they did pre-virus reflects valuations devastated by the pandemic and its aftermath .
And it wo n't be easy .
Icahn , for example , we believe paid between $8 .
and $9 a share before the trade ramped up pre-virus to the $12 .
deal price .
He , in effect , would be positioned on the current deal to take cash off the table at $8 .
In other words , his position returns his entire cash outlay , and he then sits on a huge chunk of the new stock essentially free .
That surely fits Icahn coup strategies of the past .
Other institutional biggies may have other ideas - we ca n't say .
They may well slam the door in ERI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them all turning to the lawyers to battle for keeping to the deal as struck , then it 's " bye-bye deal " time .
You could see a very quick announcement either postponing the close or killing the deal by mutual agreement .
That would be a pity .
On fundamentals , this is a great deal post virus  ( Below : The spread and scale will increase to 60 properties in 16 states with diverse geography .
Source : Caesars presentations ) .
You have a " can't-lose " combination of two US regional gaming giants with a powerhouse position on the Las Vegas strip as well .
You have complementary operating platforms that will create the single-biggest footprint in US gaming with a scale far beyond that of any competitor .
You have the entry of ERI management culture at the top C-suite spots .
From the viewpoint of this CZR alumnus who knows the company well , I see a tremendous decentralization of control in operations and marketing that sweeps the corporate " belt and suspenders " bureaucracy of CZR out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has just completed a $1 .
billion in room upgrade program to make it super-competitive .
The upgrade translates into proven higher REVPARS for the entire Las Vegas property portfolio .
The dealmakers promise to find $500 million in synergies going forward .
I have looked at the possibilities from an operational point of view .
I have talked with colleagues and people I mentored now in the CZR system .
It 's hardly a time for sunshine and flowers , for sure .
Yet , all agreed that ERI 's decentralized management culture will drive tons of new business once momentum is triggered post virus .
I think the company can make it across the proposed $500 million finish line in two years .
It is highly likely that the new CZR will abandon some of the delusional moves it made too little , too late in Asia .
That includes a $775 million investment in South Korea and lots of empty talk about being a possible player in a Japan IR .
Look for the new management to possibly unload its 50% interest in the Incheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sports betting in the US will continue to explode .
The new company will be a national player in the space .
Source : AGA )  Sports Betting  Post virus we will see a burst of new legalizations of sports betting across US states .
It will be driven by officials desperate to replenish the disastrous depletion of state coffers by the virus pandemic .
It will benefit from the starvation diet sports bettors are now subsisting on until play resumes .
Once the spigots are open , we see sports betting moving to 24 states from its current 14 within the next year and a half .
CZR and ERI had good positioning with sports betting partners before the virus hit .
The new company will become a national player in the space .
Conclusion  We think there is a powerful case to be made to reprice the ERI/CZR deal springing from the cold realities of the current dark ages of the gaming business .
Anything that could reduce the leverage of the successor company is a big plus for shareholders , even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reworked share exchange formula .
More important for those who can see beyond the present disaster , you will have bought by far what will become the single-most dominant player in the US casino space .
And remember going forward , ERI 's Reeg , who will assume the CEO spot in the new company , has had an ongoing itch to build and expand .
Think ahead a few years and it 's not hard to envision more transactions to come .
We think it 's time the companies addressed the issue of repricing head-on .
It 's time they came up with a creative way to achieve it without ringing multi-millions of class action lawyer cash registers .
By any measure , this is a solid deal post virus and warrants very serious investor consideration .
The cash burn factor  Anyone glued to the daily media whose columns are stuffed with pundits - medical , official and economic - can come away more scared and confused than enlightened .
You have a spectrum that runs from sheer panic to complacency , with everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone 's guessing .
The world has not faced a crisis of this magnitude since the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918-20 , which infected 500 million people worldwide and caused an estimated 52 million deaths .
The exponential advance of medical science since offers at least some comfort that we do not face a duration of 2 years .
For one thing , we are told an effective vaccine will come into play perhaps in 15 months , including clinical trials .
Massive global vaccination will not present a problem for Big Pharma 's global capacity .
But the grim reality is that right now , we must take the longer view that medical authorities currently believe to be the most likely cycle .
That envisions an easing with the arrival of warm , moist weather through most of the stricken geography .
Beyond that , assuming governments continue to act responsibly , we could be looking at a mid- to late-summer semblance of return ramping slowly toward normal .
This poses the question here : Do the parties to the deal have the cash cushion to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they do under most potential virus durations .
Assuming the ERI/CZR deal is either repriced and its date closing extended or just continue to be pushed against the virus interregnum , investors will need to decide their own sense of duration and act accordingly .
In any event , management owes investors transparency as to how it sees the structure of the deal either going forward as is , being repriced , or cancelled .
It 's not a time to hide .
And the aforementioned adults in the room , we believe , will not hide but at some point announce a viewpoint on repricing , plowing ahead as is , or postponing the closing date .
