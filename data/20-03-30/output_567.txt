The state has also been promised 50 ventilators , which would add to its current inventory of just under 1,000 .
The state currently has enough supplies , Lamont said , but wo n't remain as well-stocked without help .
He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency had recently redirected a load of PPE to another state , claiming Connecticut had lesser need .
Lamont said the state 's hospitals have succeeded in growing their capacity in recent days .

" And they will have increased their capacity I think by the end of this week .
