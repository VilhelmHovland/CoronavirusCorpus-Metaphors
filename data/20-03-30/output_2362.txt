Real estate transactions , even at the best of times , are complicated and stressful for buyers and sellers .
For the thousands of people who made or received firm offers before the coronavirus outbreak changed everything -- and who are now left wondering whether their deals will close in the weeks or months to follow -- the anxiety level is even greater .
Some have wondered whether a pandemic is considered force majeure ( unforeseeable circumstances or " acts of God " ) , which could free them of their obligations in case housing prices were to plummet in the next few weeks .
Others may be facing other liquidity issues .
Data from the Canadian Real Estate Association ( CREA ) indicates that 65,494 homes were sold across Canada in the first two months of 2020 , meaning that as many as 130,000 families may be in limbo , waiting for their transactions to close .
Residential sales often involve a few weeks or months between when a firm offer is accepted , and the deal is " closed .
" When a transaction is booked , buyers transfer a deposit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At closing , buyers transfer the remaining amount to the sellers .
In uncertain times , much can change between a sale and its closing .
When prices fall before closing , buyer 's remorse sets in , and purchasers may feel they have overpaid .
Even those who would like to follow through on the transaction may face challenges .
Valuation metrics might change by the closing time such that declining prices could increase the loan-to-value ( LTV ) ratio , leading lenders to require that buyers put up additional funds .
In a highly unlikely scenario of severe liquidity constraints , financial markets might not extend credit , thus preventing sales from closing .
If firm sales fail to close , even sellers will be at risk .
Also , many buyers are simultaneously trying to sell their current residences ; a failure to sell may limit their ability to buy .
Another concern is the trillions of dollars lost in investments since the onset of the pandemic .
Some buyers had planned to cash in on investments to make their down payments .

So what kind of recourse do buyers have in this situation ?  We consulted lawyers specializing in real estate transactions and contract law and the unanimous advice we received was that in at least Ontario , B .
and Quebec , standard residential real estate transactions do not include force majeure provisions .
Hence , in Ontario , buyers and sellers are bound by their obligations under the Ontario Real Estate Association 's ( OREA ) Agreement of Purchase and Sale .
Mark Weisleder , a partner with the law firm Real Estate Lawyers .
LLP , told clients in a note that the " only way a deal can not close is if the government registration system closes down or lenders can not fund loans , which is not the case right now .
"  Real estate businesses have been deemed an essential service in Ontario .
Thus , real estate brokerages and law firms are allowed to function but with new guidelines to observe social distancing .
At the same time , financial institutions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remorse is real , it is no ground to back out of the deal , warned Weisleder .
During and after the Great Recession in 2008-09 and when the foreign homebuyers ' tax was imposed first in British Columbia in 2016 and later in Ontario in 2017 , many buyers tried to avoid closings after housing prices declined .
Courts , though , have found in favour of sellers in cases where buyers reneged on a signed deal .
An Ontario couple who reneged on a firm offer to buy was ordered by the court to pay $470,000 to make up for the difference in the price they agreed to pay and the subsequent sale price paid by a different buyer .
Rosa Lupo , a partner with the law firm Gowling WLG ( Canada ) LLP , advises that whereas force majeure is not covered in OREA 's Agreement of Purchase and Sale , parties can include additional clauses in Schedule A of the Agreement .
However , such terms must be entered at the execution of the agreement and not after the fact .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforeseen circumstances make it impossible to perform their obligations under a contract .
However , the bar to prove the frustration of contract is very high .
If a deal hits a snag , the best way forward is to work it out collegially , advises Andrea Sanche , a partner at the law firm Ricketts Harris LLP .
Instead of trying to nullify a contract , the parties could agree to a postponement until such time that the transaction can be completed .
It is up to the parties to demonstrate that they have made reasonable , good faith efforts to fulfill their obligations , advises Sanche .
Given the current pandemic and recent uptick in flooding and severe weather , which can cause severe damage to homes , it might be time to review standard buyer and seller agreements , which are province-specific .
Much can transpire during a sale and its closing .
Introducing new standard clauses to protect both sides while providing opportunities for insurers to price risk will offer greater stability in uncertain times .
