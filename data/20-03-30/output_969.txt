For six German students in a Dortmund flat , the Covid-19 lockdown has its upsides .
With no classes to attend and their social lives interrupted , four young women and two men sharing a three-bedroom flat are suddenly enjoying a lot of quality time , as they join millions of Germans in staying home to slow the pandemic .
" I 'm so glad I do n't live alone right now , the walls would be closing in on me , " said 22-year-old IT student Thilo .
