Let them eat cake : The new must-have : A mask  LAST week I sent an email I had been hesitating to send for two weeks prior .
I cancelled my trip to Moscow for Fashion Week Russia .
I am especially interested in new markets -- such as Shanghai , Tel Aviv and Tokyo -- comparing their cultures and clothing traditions with those of India .
But this year none of this will be possible as we are staring at a global pandemic .
Among the several industries that will be hit by the lockdown that has followed the coronavirus , the fashion business will probably be the worst .
Considering that two of the biggest nations hit by COVID-19 are China , the world greatest manufacturing hub , and Italy , the centre for European fashion , the mood is bleak .
Chinese factories have been closed since December , bringing most production to a near standstill .
Samples are stuck and there are backlogs of orders and logistical delays .
Global trade is almost impossible .
Last month , the FDCI head Sunil Sethi sagely called off the fashion week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The capital had barely any cases of coronavirus then , but Sethi has probably saved a few lives .
Bhairavi Jaikishan 's show for Knight Frank at a Bandra hotel was cancelled at the nth hour as well .
Tokyo 's Rakuten Fashion Week , that was scheduled to begin yesterday , has been called off .
Fashion weeks in Shanghai and Beijing have been postponed .
Ralph Lauren has postponed his April show in New York .
Gucci has cancelled its show in San Francisco and Prada in Tokyo .
The fashion writers at ' The New York Times ' have chronicled the mood in Europe during the fashion week season in February .
They are among " the international travelling circus of retailers and reporters , high-spending customers and Instagram influencers , executives and a small army of public-relations professionals , many travelling from New York to London to Milan and finally Paris " .
By the time the motley was in Milan in mid-February , Italy had become the worst-hit country outside China .
" And so , a thousand or so very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a global public health menace , a vector of transmission from the elite front rows of fashion shows to the world at large ? " the article ponders .
By February 24 , the action had moved to Paris , where France had reported just 14 cases .
But in five days of Paris Fashion week , the number moved to 200 .
Design houses handed out face masks , the maximum number of a show audience was 1,000 , while one show took place in a sealed plastic tube .
But fashion shows are industry events .
Does a slowing down of a fashion theatre affect more than its spectators ? Arguably not .
The real threat to the business comes from its shoppers .
Is anyone in the mood of buying ? Is it safe to keep shops open , where personal interface and the touching and feeling of expensive items is moot to the business ?  The answer will come once details for the next quarter are revealed .
The virus could n't have arrived at a more ill-opportune time , with a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many luxury boutiques closed in China , sales are already down by almost 90 per cent .
Retailers in luxury hubs like Paris are worried about the significant decline of Asian and American tourists .
H&amp;M has declared its stores in several European countries closed .
Louis Vuitton apparently used the personal airplane of Bernard Arnault , the head of LVMH and the third richest man in the world , to transport handbags from Italy to less infected France .
The company has also upped its social etiquette , and possibly won some ethical brownie points , by asking some of the fashion houses it owns ( Christian Dior , Guerlain and Givenchy ) to make hydro-alcoholic sanitisers and distribute them for free to hospitals .
South African designer Gavin Rajah found a little political statement to make when his models at Africa International Fashion Week in Cape Town wore rhinestone-studded glitter as face masks .
Rajah says he was talking about racism , with the mask being a symbol of exclusion and isolation .
But in these times of quarantine , we are being forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling us what a polarised and irresponsible world has done to us .
Something to think about , while we are home and alone , wearing a surgical mask instead of a pretty new dress .
