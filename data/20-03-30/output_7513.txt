Let virus run its course  I 'm a board-certified emergency physician with physician licenses in multiple states .
Most physicians and front-line caregivers like myself not on television are very frustrated with the general media and public firestorm that has been generated , along with our leaders ' haphazard and knee-jerk responses to the pandemic .
We recognize that overall this is worse than the flu -- but it still is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same demographics as the flu along with similar complications .
We find it interesting that tens of thousands die of complications of the flu every year , but the world does n't shut down .
A more appropriate response would be to simply allow the general population to go back to work while the at-risk populations practice a self-imposed quarantine .
Forcing companies and individuals out of work , forcing companies to make respirators that they are n't equipped to make , throwing antibiotics ( Plaquenil and Zithromax ) at a virus ( completely different organism and does n't work ) is only fueling mass hysteria and wasting resources .
Herd immunity is the only real cure as the virus will eventually run its course .
Kurt Kaczander , Laingsburg  doctor of osteopathic medicine  A motorcycle passes by almost empty street as the enhanced community quarantine is enforced to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus in downtown Manila , Philippines on Thursday , March 19 , 2020 .
( Photo : Aaron Favila , AP )  Media is out of touch  As Finley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 very highly while the media coverage is almost 100% negative .
What 's obvious is the media is very out of touch with public opinion and values .
I 'll go further -- it appears the media is acting as an operative for another entity .
I 'd say that controlling entity is a unified Democratic Party and China .
Many times CNN , MSNBC and others use the same words , phrases and tone .
They all got the memo .
And we , the people , are on to them .
