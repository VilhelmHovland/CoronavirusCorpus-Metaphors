Coronavirus hits rich and poor unequally in Latin America  Port-Au-Prince , Haiti -- From Mexico City to Port-au-Prince , Haiti , and Santiago , Chile , the coronavirus is taking root in the world 's most unequal region , where many of Latin America 's first cases arrived with members of the elite returning from vacations or work trips to Europe and the United States .
Many of the wealthy are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of the poorest people , who must work every day to feed their families , live in unsanitary conditions and lack proper medical care .
Some countries are making payments to informal workers -- maids , street sellers and others who have been told to stay home to reduce the spread of the virus , but the effort is patchwork and does n't apply to everyone who needs help .
" I stay home , I will lose all my goods .
I have no way to save them , " said Marie-Ange Bouzi , who sells tomatoes and onions on the street of Haiti 's capital .
" I am not going to spend money fighting corona .
God is going to protect me .

One was imported by one of its most successful artists , an R&amp;B singer who had just returned from France , according to the director of health in Port-au-Prince .
Singer Roody Roodboy , who 's real name is Roody P ? tuel Dauphin , quarantined himself when he got back to avoid infecting others and sent his entourage to be tested , manager Narcisse Fievre said .
He said the singer had received death threats from people who accuse him of bringing the disease to Haiti , although there is no evidence Dauphin had infected anyone else .
For hundreds of thousands of Haitians who earn a few dollars a day selling goods on the street , quarantine like Dauphin 's would mean near-starvation .
' ' People are not going stay home .
How are they going to eat ? " Bouzi said .
" Haiti is n't structured for that .
' '  The Haitian government has cut banking and government office hours , closed schools and broadcast radio messages asking people to stay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street markets , buses and repurposed pickup trucks known as tap-taps .
In Chile , which has seen cases grow to more than 2500 since March 3 , many coronavirus diagnoses have been in upper-middle-class neighborhoods , in people just back from Europe , particularly Italy .
Health Minister Jaime Ma ? alich has complained that wealthy residents of the Las Condes and Vitacura sections of Santiago , the capital , are routinely violating required quarantines after they tested positive or encountered someone who did .
Las Condes Mayor Joaqu ? n Lav ? n says more than half the cases in the city are in Las Condes and Vitacura .
The health minister says he has personally called wealthy residents supposedly in quarantine and discovers they are defying the order .
Mexican authorities say at least 17 of the country 's wealthiest people returned after being infected during a ski trip to Vail , Colorado .
The first person to die in Rio state was Cleonice Gon ? alves , a 63-year-old who worked as a maid for a woman in Leblon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the household was infected during a trip to Italy but Gon ? alves ' family members said she was n't informed her boss was in isolation awaiting test results , according to Camila Ramos de Miranda , health secretary for the town of Miguel Pereira .
Gon ? alves , who had hypertension and diabetes , fell ill and died on March 17 in Miguel Pereira two hours north of the capital .
" I know we need to work , need our daily bread , but nothing is more important than the value of a life , " Miguel Pereira Mayor Andr ? Portugu ? s said in a video posted on Facebook .
In Lima , Peru , the fallout from the pandemic is starkly different depending on class .
Nadia Mu ? oz watched her 8-year-old son , Luka , follow online lessons from his private Catholic school on a recent afternoon .
The makeup artist and her family live in an upper-middle-class neighborhood , where Lima 's 15-day quarantine has n't been too disruptive .
" We have a supermarket nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable TV , " Mu ? oz said as she recorded a makeup lesson to post on Instagram .
In a shack on a nearby hill , Alejandro de la Cruz , 86 , his wife Mar ? a Zoila , and his son Ramiro , who sold clothes on the street until the quarantine started this month , were cooking with charcoal .
They have no running water , electricity , internet or phone service .
They live among security guards , cooks , drivers , tailors , shoemakers , car mechanics and construction workers who are unemployed during the lockdown .
While there are more poor people in other regions of the world , Latin America remains the region in which the greatest proportion of wealth is held by a small number of citizens .
" Latin America is the most unequal region in the entire world .
We 're talking about class disparities that are unlike anywhere else on the planet , " said Geoff Ramsey , a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America .
Some Latin American governments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the social safety net , including unemployment payments or severance packages .
Peru has announced a payment of $108 for the 2 .
million homes classified as poverty stricken .
But the hillside shanty where de la Cruz and his unemployed neighbors are waiting out the quarantine are n't poor enough to qualify .
" My son has n't worked for a week , there 's barely enough to buy a bit of food , ' ' Zoila said .
In Argentina , the center-left government approved a $151 payment in April for informal workers , who make up 35% of the nation 's economy .
Argentina plans to make more payments soon .
Brazil 's right-wing government has no such plans .
On Twitter last week , left-leaning politicians called for maids to receive their salaries while self-isolating , adding the hashtag #PaidQuarantineNow .

" The person who 's a cleaner , the person who counts on that money to survive , to sustain their family -- they 're going to bring in money from where ? " she said of anti-virus measures .
