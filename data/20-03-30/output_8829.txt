The life of an NBA player looks a whole lot like everyone else 's right now .
With the novel coronavirus suspending the league 's season and most of society at large , the nonstop and high-profile lifestyle of basketball 's best has transformed into quiet , social distancing days .
" It 's horrible , " Utah Jazz forward and former Iowa State star Georges Niang told the Ames Tribune last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you .
"  The biggest change for these players has been the simple lack of basketball in its most rudimentary form -- gyms are closed , meaning even getting a few shots up is n't feasible .
" I have n't gone this long without being in a gym shooting since I was a kid , " Toronto Raptors guard and former Iowa State standout Matt Thomas told the Ames Tribune this week .
" At the same time , there are bigger things going on in the world right now than basketball .
Just got to take it one day at a time and hope this virus runs its course and affects the least amount of people as possible and we can get back to living our normal day-to-day lives .
"  Utah forward Georges Niang has found his way into a reserve role with the Jazz this NBA season .
( Photo : Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports )  Both Niang and Thomas endured 14-day quarantines due to their interaction with other players who tested positive for COVID-19 .
It was that first positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the league to shutter on March 11 .
The Raptors and Jazz had played just two days prior .
" Rudy tested positive and it was minutes later when the league got suspended , " Thomas said .
" An hour after that , we got calls that we all needed to go to the hospital to get tested here in Toronto .
Everyone from our travel party -- media , coaches , players , everyone that was on that West Coast trip -- obviously because we had direct exposure .
We were also out in San Francisco and Sacramento , which is kind of a hotbed for the virus , too .
" So we all got tested that night and got the results a couple days later .
Thankfully we were all negative .
"  Spending quarantine days in isolation were both trying and an opportunity .
Niang is spending time watching World War II documentaries on Netflix , working out with equipment provided by the team and checking in with his teammates .
" It 's no fun , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and do n't worry , I wo n't do that any longer .
"  For Thomas , it 's been a chance to play catch-up .
" I 've never spent this much time in my apartment , " he said .
" For me , I 'm trying to make it into a positive , make the most of the situation .
I have a hard time slowing down and shutting off , so it 's kind of like forced relaxation .
" I 've done a lot of things that I 've been meaning to do , but it 's just so hard to find time during the season -- whether it be meditating more , reading a book , journaling , connecting with friends and family .
I 've been able to do that a lot .
FaceTiming a lot of friends , catching up with people .
"  Niang was averaging 13 .
minutes per game for the Jazz in his fourth season in the NBA after being taken in the second round of the 2016 draft .
Thomas was averaging just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his rookie season after playing two years in Spain , a place now ravaged by the coronavirus .
" One of my buddies ( in Spain ) was telling me how helicopters were flying real low over the city , " Thomas said , " making sure everyone is in their homes and no one is in the streets .
"  Thomas ' current situation is complicated by the fact that he 's international .
" I know a few of my teammates have gone home to be with their families in the States , " the Wisconsin native said .
" I thought about going home but at the same time , I did n't want to put myself or anyone else at risk by traveling right now .
And just the thought of potentially having to quarantine two weeks there , then coming back to Canada , quarantining again -- I 'm pretty set here .
"  Set and trying to stay ready for an NBA season that may never come given the virus that has changed so much over the entire globe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're living through this , " Thomas said .
" This is like the Great Depression , the Spanish Flu that hit 100 years ago .
This is what kids are going to be learning about in their textbooks in 30 , 40 , 50 years .
" Hopefully we 'll still be able to finish ( the NBA season ) in the spring or the summer , but there is so much uncertainty .
It is hard .
I want to play .
I think everyone wants to play .
Everyone wants to get back to their normal lives , but there are bigger issues right now than basketball .
Just trying to stay positive and do my part , stay inside as much as possible .
