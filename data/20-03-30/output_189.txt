The government has eased restrictions slightly to allow the sale of some essential goods , which people may need to safely isolate , stay connected to one another , and work or study from home .
Photo : RNZ / Rebekah Parsons-King  The Ministry of Business , Innovation and Employment ( MBIE ) said stores selling these goods must do so using online orders , or phone orders , and keep premises shut .
Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford said retailers had been looking to sell a range of goods online ever since the lockdown was announced .
" Retailers are now going to be permitted to sell a range of essential goods online , that 's things that keep people warm , key household appliances , computer equipment and mobile phones , " he said .
" These are some of the things that are really in demand particularly as the weather changes and it 's really important people are able to access those goods .
"  Harford said it would provide a little respite for businesses that have had to close entirely , while giving consumers options .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught short as the weather changes , perhaps they have n't got heating in their house already , potentially there 's people who have a fridge or washing machine that has stopped working over the last week or so , so they may be looking to buy a new one .
"  He said it was not " open slather " for retailers to start selling goods online .
Retailers wanting to sell essential household items online must register with MBIE and provide a list of essential goods they plan to sell .
Briscoes sells $70 million worth of goods online each year but sales stopped when the country went into lockdown six days ago .
Its managing director , Rod Duke , said resuming some online sales would be a relief .
" We 've been speaking to government about heating , on a lovely warm day cooling , blankets and the like , and we 've managed to get it through which is great , " he said .
