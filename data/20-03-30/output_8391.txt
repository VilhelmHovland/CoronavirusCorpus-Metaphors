Eli Imadali/The Republic  Kate McClendon feels tired .
She 's lost nine pounds in two weeks and can barely sleep .
Her job is to provide food , but she does n't even know what 's in her own fridge .
Every morning she and her husband , Sean , immediately go through their messages .
Among them are orders for Grab and Go produce boxes their farm McClendon 's Select began offering to keep the business going during the new coronavirus pandemic .
The new venture , while helpful , has also stretched their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teenage son to help out .
The demand for the boxes is so high , they had to stop reservations temporarily .
And while McClendon is grateful for the support , it wo n't be enough to fill the hole left behind by restaurant closures .
Doug Ducey 's executive order to close dine-in service at restaurants has affected not only the restaurants themselves but also the local farms and distributors that depend on them .
Now farmers are scrambling against time to change their business model and find a way to survive .
" There 's only so much we can physically do , " McClendon said .
" Unfortunately , filling restaurant orders , we thought that was so demanding before , but it was so much easier .
That 's how we were set up .
"  ' It 's probably going to do us in '  Wendell Crow 's family has been dairy farming in Arizona for 101 years .
He has around 300 goats on his Buckeye farm , Crow 's Dairy , where he and his crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred restaurants in the Valley .
In a matter of days after restaurants in Maricopa County shut down , they lost every one of their customers , Crow said .
Since almost all of the farm 's business comes from wholesale to restaurants , he estimated he only has two months before he goes broke .
He 's already called his banker to warn her .
" We 're just trying to switch over to more of a retail business , " Crow said .
" Being a farmer , I should have known better to put all my eggs in one basket , but I did .
"  Wendell Crow among his goats at Crow 's Dairy , a family-owned dairy farm in Buckeye .
( Photo : Courtesy of Crow 's Dairy )  Regardless of sales , goats do n't have an on and off switch , he says .
And it costs about $600 a day to feed them .
Crow 's held onto his six employees , who he 's still paying for their labor .
He and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they dry up and no longer produce milk , he said .
It 's also hard on their udders if they go without milking .
Since losing their customers , his family has opened a self-serve store in front of the barn and plan to start home deliveries soon .
Crow hopes it will be enough to squeeze by .
If he goes broke , he would have to sell the goats and sell or lose the farm .
" Without some kind of government bailout , it 's probably going to do us in , " Crow said .
" We would n't have any money left .
"  Why one farmer wo n't ' pull the plug '  Joseph Martinez and his brother David Redwood operate Arizona Microgreens , a greenhouse farm in south Phoenix .
In the recent past , they focused mostly on plants that restaurants wanted , such as micro onions , because 80% of their sales came from wholesale distributors that serve restaurants .
People could find their microgreens garnishing plates at restaurants including FnB , Wildflower Bread Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they began doubling down on their other 20% -- farmers markets and direct pickup from the greenhouse .
" I 'm trying my best to not throw away product , " Martinez said .
" In our walk-in right now , we have 225,000 pounds of pea shoots that were supposed to go to restaurants , harvested and packed .
"  Joseph Martinez , co-owner of Arizona Microgreens , carries racks of Pea shoots at the Phoenix greenhouse where Arizona Microgreens grows their microgreens on Monday , October 2 , 2017 .
( Photo : David Wallace/The Republic )  When the order was canceled , Martinez decided they would donate the plants to Creighton Elementary School District .
Arizona Microgreens now focuses completely on growing plants for individuals and families , such as salad mixes and microgreens for smoothies , and wo n't be growing anything for restaurants until the demand returns , he said .
They 've also added delivery service using Lyft , but that requires more coordination and time for less money , he said .
Packing 80 boxes of micro cilantro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns than many small transactions .
For now , their priorities are providing nutrient-dense food to people and keeping their three workers employed .
" We 're not making any money this year , we 're breaking even at best , " Martinez said .
" We could pull the plug , shut it down and stay inside reading books and doing board games .
But I think that would be a big disservice to people looking for high-quality , healthy food .

( Photo : Eli Imadali/The Republic )  Will government assistance be enough ?  Janna Anderson , a first-generation farmer and owner of Pinnacle Farms , said farming requires a sense of optimism .
Subject to market and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe would n't be in this business at all , she thinks .
But in her 20 years of farming , she never anticipated something like this could happen .
Anderson runs three businesses in one .
has a small orchard in Laveen with a self-serve farm stand , plus 50 acres in Waddell where she grows produce and heritage grains primarily for wholesale distributors , restaurants and small buyers .
She also runs an Airbnb and hosts events at the Laveen farm , nestled at the base of South Mountain .
Anderson figured that if one part of the business slowed , the other parts would keep her afloat .
But the coronavirus pandemic , which has led to travel decline and the shutting down of restaurants and events , devastated all three avenues of income .
Janna Anderson takes a walk through her peach orchard near South Mountain .
Anderson owns and operates Pinnacle Farms .
( Photo : Courtesy of Pinnacle Farms )  Her Airbnb , which had been completely booked for March and April , now has no bookings after all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled for April 30 , a beautiful time right before the peaches start ripening , she described .
The event was canceled .
Starting early in May , the squash , watermelons , cucumbers and cantaloupe will be ready for harvest .
She does n't know who 's going to buy them , but she hopes somebody will .
Unlike other businesses , she does n't do delivery .
Driving her F-250 truck around the Valley to drop off $100 orders is n't profitable , she said .
" I 'm a one-woman show , " Anderson said .
" I have set up everything I do for wholesale because all I can do and do well is the supply part of it .
Somebody else has to do the distribution and delivery to people .
It 's just not viable , dollars and cents , unless it 's big orders .
"  No amount of money the government can throw will be a lifeline that can fix this problem because everything is connected , Anderson said .
A reprieve for renters helps people who ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rental income for their mortgage , she asks .
Where will the money for unemployment benefits come from when employers ca n't pay into unemployment ?  Despite the situation , Anderson said she 's still optimistic and believes things will get better .
" I think this has shaken a lot of people to the core , " Anderson said .
" It taught us a lot of things we never thought possible until now .
This is a new reality .
It is n't going to be the first time this is going to happen .
"  ' There is a break in our system in food distribution '  Kate 's father-in-law , Bob McClendon , started the family 's organic farming business about 20 years ago .
Marsha McClendon , Kate 's mother-in-law , already tended to a three-acre garden where they grew some of their own food and experimented with heirloom seeds .
Today their business includes more than 90 acres between the original farm in Peoria and a larger one in Goodyear , plus food they bring in from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .
Prior to the dining restrictions brought on by COVID-19 , McClendon 's Select sold to nearly 90 restaurants throughout the state of Arizona .
In the course of a week after restrictions began , their sales to restaurants plummeted by 95% , Kate said .
McClendon 's Select employs 34 people they 're still holding onto because there 's still work to be done .
There 's weeding , watering and maintenance .
They have to rotate crops based on the nutrients they put in and pull out of the soil .
They ca n't afford to let the farm suffer because the operational cost of reviving a farm is incredibly expensive .
" The farm is a living , breathing thing , " Kate said .
" It needs to be worked regularly .
"  But beyond her operation , the biggest thing she 's watching is how this crisis affects the way people eat and how food gets from farms to consumers .
She hears stories about grocery stores running out of food .
Kate said the McClendon farms are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new way of getting that food to people .
" We ca n't supply grocery stores overnight , " she said .
" There is not a scarcity , there is a break in our system in food distribution .
