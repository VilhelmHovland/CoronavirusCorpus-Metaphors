THERE have been renewed calls for better protective equipment for frontline medical staff , with one Oxford doctor calling the present system an " utter disgrace .
"  Dr Rachel Clarke , a palliative care specialist in the city , condemned the Government 's announced review of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for healthcare workers , as the coronavirus death toll in the county rose to 11 , with a further 140 positive cases .
NHS England confirmed the deaths were all at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , which runs the John Radcliffe , Churchill and Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre , as well as Horton General Hospital .
The total number of confirmed reported deaths in England stands at 1,228 -- with patients aged between 33 and 100 .
All but 13 had underlying health conditions .
The weekend also saw the death of another NHS doctor .

Medical staff have complained of not having adequate protective gear , leaving them at risk of contracting the virus .
In response , the Department of Health and Social Care , Public Health England and NHS England , announced they would re-examine current guidance over PPE .
The medical director of Public Health England , Dr Yvonne Doyle , said : " Now that Covid-19 is much more widespread , we will carry out a rapid piece of work ensuring the guidance is clearer on which PPE should be worn in different NHS settings .
"  However , Dr Clarke queried why our overdue PPE guidance differed from that of the World Health Organisation .
Taking to social media , she said : " I simply can not understand why I am not an infection risk to other staff and patients when only a skimpy plastic apron covers my body .
" Arms , neck , back and lower legs all bare , uncovered , potentially covered with Covid-19 from infected patients .
"  The role played by frontline medical staff , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor of Oxford , Craig Simmons .
In a statement , he said : " These are challenging times and I am proud of the way that Oxford is stepping up to make the changes necessary to beat the coronavirus .

Thank you .
" I know that this is not easy , but this is short term pain for long term gain .
We must all continue to follow expert advice .
No shortcuts , no exceptions .
This is for the greater good .

" This lockdown will not last forever .
I do not know when it will end .
What I do know is that we will emerge stronger as individuals , as a city and as a society when we do .
" In the meantime , we need to look out for one another and try to find some joy in the gloom .
