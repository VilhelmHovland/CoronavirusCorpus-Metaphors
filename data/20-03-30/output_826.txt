Coronavirus resources  Weeks into the coronavirus panic-buying spree , toilet paper is still high on the list of most-wanted products .
But why ?  At Roche Bros .
in Boston 's Downtown Crossing , for example , packs of toilet paper continue to sell out before 9 a .
, even with restrictions on how many shoppers can buy at one time .
It 's a scenario playing out daily at supermarkets across the state , and for no good reason , according to supply chain experts .
By now , many people are likely running out of space to store their stash of rolls .
Yet the illogical hoarding continues .
As Harvard Business School professor Willy Shih put it , " it 's not like all the factories for toilet paper suddenly burned down .
"  Advertisement  " The manufacturers and distributors are trying to catch up , and they will catch up at some point , but buying more than you need is not very helpful , " he said .
" It 's the appearance of shortages drives people to buy more .
"  Arthur Ackles , vice president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said distribution centers are rationing the amount of toilet paper they deliver to supermarkets as they try to recover from the recent surge in demand .
" Just like we are limiting products in the stores to one or two packages of rolls per customer , our distributors are limiting our allocations , " he said .
" Customers are buying more , stores are ordering more , distributors are ordering more -- everyone is trying to get a fair shot of the product .
"  Roche Bros .
is ordering three to four times more toilet paper than normal , but is only receiving 20 to 30 percent of what it needs , Ackles said .
" We are trying to fill shelves that are already empty , so we really need much more than we are getting , " he said .
" It 's a lot of strain on our stores , and it is frustrating that we ca n't get enough product in .
"  Advertisement  Ackles said he is n't surprised that the coronavirus panic buying has sent shockwaves through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods when our toilet paper sales increased by 600 percent , and I do n't think manufacturers were ready for that -- why would they be ? "  Shih agrees -- there was no way for companies that make toilet paper to anticipate a virus creating such a shopping frenzy .
" If you are a manufacturer of toilet paper , you are going to plan your manufacturing capacity for a stable demand -- you want to be as efficient as possible , " he said .
" It 's not like there is a season where you use more toilet paper .
"  That means there is not much wiggle room for quickly ramping up production -- like there might be for seasonal or fashion goods -- since most manufacturers already operate close to full capacity .
Georgia-Pacific LLC , the maker of Angel Soft and Quilted Northern toilet paper , regularly operates its plants around the clock .
" We are working hard to maximize the number of deliveries we can load and ship out of our facilities -- you can only load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an e-mail .
Georgia-Pacific 's regional distribution centers have been shipping up to 120 percent more than their normal capacity since the outbreak .
Kimberly-Clark Corp .
, the makers of Cottonelle and Scott toilet paper , said in a statement to The Boston Globe that the company has plans in place to address increased demand , such as accelerating production and reallocating inventory .

" It is a chore to catch up -- you have to get it on trucks and into stores , so it 's a complex problem , " Shih said .
" Manufacturers are all trying to produce more , but they also need the logistics capacity to move it .
"  Jeff Hopper , chief marketing officer of online freight marketplace DAT Solutions , said the demand for trucks is up by about 11 percent because of COVID-19 .
" The replenishing and stocking of the shelves is happening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as ever , there are just not enough of them to make every run .
"  Last week , the demand for truck shipments into the Boston area increased by 65 percent compared with the same time last year , but the supply of trucks only increased by 12 .
percent , according to DAT .
As a result , the price to ship goods into Boston also increased from $2 .
per mile to $2 .
this week compared with the previous week , indicating that it has been harder to find drivers , according to DAT .
The recent spike in demand for trucks is unprecedented , Hopper said .
" If it 's a hurricane , some coastal areas get hit hard and that disrupts the supply chain for that area , and in California .
wildfires are disruptive for that particular area , " he said .
" But this is global and national -- it 's almost impossible to prepare for .
"  Advertisement  Georgia-Pacific is not sure when the toilet paper supply chain will return to normal , Ambercrombie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying in bulk .
" More products are coming in , so they do n't have to buy hundreds of rolls , " Ackles said .
" The expectation is that it will continue to be available -- if they do n't hoard .
"  Shih said stores are likely to end up with a surplus of toilet paper once the pandemic subsides and consumers realize they have several years worth of the product in their homes .
It 's a well-known phenomenon in supply chains called the bullwhip effect , he said .
" Right now we are telling manufacturers to make more , make more , but at some point they are going to catch up and have waves of toilet paper crashing into the grocery stores right when people do n't need it anymore , " he said .
