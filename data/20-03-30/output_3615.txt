No Championship better than shortened season - Cook  ? ? ? ? ? ? ? FORMER England captain Alastair Cook has said that he would prefer a season without the County Championship to playing a greatly reduced version of the competition .
The first seven rounds of Championship cricket have already fallen victim to the COVID-19 ( novel coronavirus ) pandemic , with the ECB announcing last week that no professional cricket will be played before May 28 .
When it is possible to resume playing , chief executive Tom Harrison has made clear that the more lucrative domestic competitions will be prioritised , meaning the T20 Blast and the Hundred would take precedence over the Championship .
That means there could be limited time in which to play the Championship , and Cook - who won the competition in 2017 and 2019 with Essex - said that he would rather wait a year to defend the title than have to do so in an abbreviated season .
" In this year , over the next six months , the bigger picture is the most important , " Cook told BBC Radio 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play any sort of cricket which hopefully we will , what I hope is that they do n't try and have a six-game County Championship or something like that .
I would rather have one or two full tournaments , because if you do then play that tournament or two tournaments it is so much more rewarding to win it .
" If there is not time for a meaningful County Championship , say you can only play three or four games , there is probably not much sense us having it .
" I would rather concentrate on two full tournaments than saying : ' We have four tournaments that we need to play , let 's get them all in even if we have to shorten them .
' I think you would rather have two tournaments played full length so there is meaningful cricket at the end of it .
"  Previously , Essex 's chief executive Derek Bowden had suggested that " there is an opportunity to be creative with the schedule " , raising the possibility of playing a regional four-day competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's look at regional four-day cricket , maybe four or five regional competitions with round-robin four-day cricket , " he told Sky Sports .
" Spectators and members would love that and it would also give us some four-day cricket to support England 's Test series in a very tight schedule .
" Essex could play Kent , Middlesex and Surrey , while Yorkshire could play Lancashire , Durham and one other team , maybe Nottinghamshire .
