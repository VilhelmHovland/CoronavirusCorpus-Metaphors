What 's worse than a nationwide lockdown ? A lockdown with extremely poor or no internet .
And that 's the reality for many people in South Africa at the moment who now have to deal with two " downs " -- a COVID-19-enforced nationwide lockdown and an internet slowdown ontop of that .
According to reports , South Africa is suffering internet outrages and frustrating slowdowns because the country 's internet is broken again .
Literally .
It is understood that two of the undersea cables that connect South Africa to the global network are again suffering outages , dragging down mobile and landline data speeds nationwide .
As per a story on Quartz Africa , the same cable breakage that happened in January this year has repeated itself .
The West Africa Cable System ( WACS ) , a submarine fiber-optic line that carries data between the United Kingdom and the west coast of Africa , tore on Saturday about 24 miles from Britain in roughly the same spot that the cable broke in January .

The damage is requiring providers to reroute traffic to cables that drape the continent 's east coast .

" We are aware of increased latency , slow speeds due to damaged undersea cables , affecting most ISP 's , " Axxess , an ISP that serves cities across South Africa , told customers on Saturday .
Besides South Africa where the disruption of a lockdown has now been compounded with a slowdown in internet speeds , all countries that use the WACS are likely to be affected by the cable damage to some degree .
And this would include most countries on the west coast of Africa .
On January 17 , we reported that internet users across more than a dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa including Nigeria , South Africa , Ghana , Cameroon , and Ivory Coast were suffering poor internet service because two undersea cables connected to the continent 's western coast had been damaged .
