British Army adopts WhatsApp for formal orders as coronavirus isolation kicks in  Yh capten ? ? bruv , charlie fireteam brups ? dat tr33line ? ? at 9 ? ?  ' I say , Rupert , can you understand what those bally boys of ours have WhatsApped us ? '  The British Army has made a coronavirus-related tech U-turn after telling soldiers that commands issued over WhatsApp are now legally binding .
In written orders posted to a Ministry of Defence intranet site , an Army unit told its soldiers that from now on , orders delivered over WhatsApp are to be treated just as seriously as written instructions delivered through the usual chain of command .
The move is controversial because only last year , the Army 's top sergeant major stated WhatsApp is not an acceptable way to distribute formal military demands .
For years soldiers complained that it was n't clear if WhatsApp messages were a proper substitute for written orders ( or disciplinary measures ) delivered by email or hard copy .
The order itself , part of which has been seen by The Register , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times via their mobile phone .
Orders and Sqn direction will now be passed directly through WhatsApp and all work related information passed across this means is to be considered an order .
Barely a year ago , the army 's top enlisted soldier stated that WhatsApp was not to be used for delivering formal orders .
Army Sergeant Major Gavin Paton , the most senior sergeant major of them all , told military social media personality , insurance salesman and dressing gown model Alfie Usher in a video interview : " You ca n't tell people off over WhatsApp ; it just does n't work .
If you want to give orders or direction , WhatsApp is not the place to do that .
"  Usher , an ex-soldier who posted a screenshot of the order on his Forces Compare insurance website , today told El Reg : " It has always been Army policy to not give orders via any instant messenger services .
Now we 're living in different times .
This new direction seems to be a direct reaction to dealing with coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping those in self-isolation in the loop .
"  The Register verified from the full screenshot ( not published ) that the WhatsApp order was posted on the internal Defence Gateway intranet .
Use of remote comms tech has soared over the past few days as Britain goes into self-imposed lockdown following government advice to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 .
This has had an impact on those platforms as demand jumps through the roof thanks to home working - and some services , such as Microsoft 's Teams , evidently were n't prepared for the leap in traffic .
We were unable to contact the Ministry of Defence for comment , perhaps because its press office are all working from home and one unlucky staffer currently has the red-hot office mobile phone .
Sadly we do n't have their number to send them a WhatsApp message .
