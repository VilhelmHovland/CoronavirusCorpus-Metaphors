' I can only hope we can carry on where we left off ' : Castle Quarter 's boss on the coronavirus close-down  He is the man who never stopped believing in his shopping centre .
so how does it feel to be the one to shut it down ? CAROLINE CULOT spoke to Robert Bradley , centre manager at Norwich 's Castle Quarter .
It was only two months ago Robert Bradley was reaping the rewards of a year-long effort to turn around the fortunes of a shopping centre that had been sadly dwindling .
And , against all odds , he did it .
In January Mr Bradley was reporting numbers of visitors up by 10% -- starkly contrasting the national , bleak picture for shopping centres with the number of visitors down across other sites by as much as 0 .
He had secured two big new leisure operators opening for Easter and things were really looking up .
But , then coronavirus struck .
Gradually , even before the government lockdown , some stores closed because people were staying away and finally Mr Bradley had to shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen 80 tenants operating went down to just two selling essential items -- Poundland and Boots which still remain open .
He himself now goes into the centre office once a week .
He is the only worker just checking that the managers of those shops have everything they need .
" It is quite sad to go from seeing the mall become busier to now , there 's just five people queuing for Boots .
" But I am a naturally positive person , so year on year , next March will be the best ever , I 'm doing something wrong if I 'm not up year on year then .
"  He said it was a smooth transition from being open to closed , monitoring the news daily and checking with store managers before the final lockdown from the government .
" I 'd been following the news so I was expecting it .
I 've had training in major incidents and over the last few weeks we had asked managers how they would cope if they were asked to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what we have to do today .
" I 'm still very positive and we 've still been getting enquiries from firms wanting to come into units going forward .
" Last week I had a conference call with the centre owners and I was talking about how everything was so positive in February , above the national average , even the first week of March was brilliant but obviously the rest of March is n't going to be as good .
" We are still talking about the good October and December we had .
" We have cut our costs , we are not spending as much money .
For instance we now have two cleaners rather than eight because only a very small area of the mall on level two is open .
The car parks are all closed .
"  Mr Bradley and his team defied many people when he turned around the fortunes of the centre .
In 2017-2018 many retailers pulled out and many people thought the centre was finished .
Last year was the turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Castle Quarter , reflecting the ' shop , dine , watch and play ' theme as well as many new tenants .
After the opening of PureGym and the amusement arcade came new announcements last month of big leisure operators such as game complexes like Boom : Battle Bar and XIST , both creating many new jobs .
This coupled with other units filled in a different way with social enterprises and some for free games including ping pong and table football as well as others for relaxation and reading in an honesty library .
The result ? Castle Quarter became a vibrant hub again and with more visitors , came more retailers .
Units were filled with new life from the likes of Moya Bubble Tea , to new owners taking over the Tea Junction , a new Delightful Desserts cafe and even a huge charity shop space taken over by the YMCA .
A common sight if you walked through the centre was Mr Bradley himself strolling through the levels , talking to staff and customers .
" I can only hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think people will come back , People will love to do the things again they took for granted , like parking in Castle Quarter and standing in the atrium -- it 's a privilege now a lot of people do not have .
" To go for a walk around the market and get a bag of chips , how good is that going to feel ? To shake people 's hands again , and the day to day interaction , that 's what I myself am missing most .
