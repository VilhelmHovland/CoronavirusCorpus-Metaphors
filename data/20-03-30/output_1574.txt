UK will be left with high burden of coronavirus cases -- health expert  UK will be left with high burden of coronavirus cases -- health expert  A public health expert believes the UK will be left with a " high burden of coronavirus cases " following its response to the Covid-19 outbreak .
Dr Gabriel Scally , president of Epidemiology and Public Health at the Royal Society of Medicine in London , said there will be populations across the UK with a high exposure to the virus .
The UK Government has been urged to change its response to tackling the spread of coronavirus by health experts .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested , advising anyone with symptoms to self-isolate at home for seven days .
The Republic of Ireland , like many other countries , is following international advice from the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
Speaking to RTE Morning Ireland , Dr Scally , who led the CervicalCheck review in Ireland , said : " The things that both the Republic of Ireland and the UK have in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is now being reinforced by strict rules that are being implemented very successfully in both jurisdictions .
" The second thing is , hospitals are in a high state of readiness and preparedness and that is a common feature , but there is a great deal of concern in the UK about the availability of protective equipment .
( PA Graphics )  " The case numbers are expected to climb substantially , particularly in London , which is a hotspot .
" A big difference is that the UK is making no effort to control the spread of the virus in the community by testing for cases and by contact tracing , and so the United States , the UK , and Sweden are the three real outliers on this .
" Those three countries are taking a different route .
" I think the end game is going to be really very , very different .
" There are going to be a high burden of cases , particularly in the US , and I think in the UK as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've not done .
" When we get past this -- what is likely to be a very large surge -- we 're going to end up with populations in the UK , with a high exposure to the virus .
The ExCeL centre in London is being made into a temporary hospital -- the NHS Nightingale hospital , comprising of two wards , each of 2,000 people , to help tackle coronavirus ( Stefan Rousseau/PA )  " So a lot of people will have had it compared to the Republic of Ireland and other European countries , and it will then be difficult to lift some of the restrictions , particularly around travel and so on because the two countries , the two groups of countries , will be in completely different places .
" Personally , I think there 's no doubt in my mind that the Republic of Ireland is taking exactly the right course , based on international experience , and the very best advice .
" That will buy the country time , it 'll buy time for vaccines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " even more importantly " , this would " buy time for some of the drug trials to take place , so we can treat people more effectively " .
