A new analysis warning that U .
health insurance companies could hike already exorbitant premiums by 40 percent or more next year amid the coronavirus pandemic was received by Medicare for All advocates as further confirmation that America 's healthcare system -- driven first and foremost by the profit motive -- is ill-equipped to provide necessary care for all , particularly in a time of nationwide crisis .
ADVERTISEMENT  The research conducted by Covered California , the state insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act , found ( pdf ) that " if carriers must recoup 2020 costs , price for the same level of costs next year , and protect their solvency , 2021 premium increases to individuals and employers from COVID-19 alone could range from 4 percent to more than 40 percent .

Judd Hollander , Thomas Jefferson University  The health and economic impacts of the coronavirus outbreak are " potentially staggering , " the analysis states , and could result in even more " consumers and employers no longer being able to afford coverage , leading to employer groups dropping coverage or individuals deciding to go uninsured .

Lee , executive director of Covered California said in a statement .
" Consumers will feel these costs through higher out-of-pocket expenses and premiums , as well as the potential of employers dropping coverage or shifting more costs to employees .

" State leaders and doctors are cautiously optimistic that the Bay Area 's early moves to lock down residents two weeks ago have prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region 's health care capacity thus far , " Politico reported Monday .
" Six Bay Area counties were first in the country to adopt aggressive tactics with an enforceable March 16 order requiring residents to stay at home , " Politico noted .
" After 14 days -- the outermost period at which symptoms are believed to emerge post-infection -- doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected to see at this point , and officials credit the lockdown with stemming the tide of patients they feared would flood into emergency rooms .
