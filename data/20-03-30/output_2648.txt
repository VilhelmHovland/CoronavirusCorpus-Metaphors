We have learned what pandemics can do to communities not prepared for such events .
As COVID-19 reaches Newfoundland and Labrador , where my fellow Inuit and family live , I wonder if we are ready .
There are new reports every day .
At least 135 cases have been confirmed in Newfoundland and Labrador .
At least one case has been linked to Happy Valley-Goose Bay -- a town Inuit from the coast must pass through when travelling most anywhere in the region .
Inuit across Canada 's Arctic fear COVID-19 .
We have learned what pandemics can do to communities not prepared for such events .
The Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918 taught us that .
Today 's novel coronavirus is every bit as scary , as it could repeat history .
Chris P .
Sampson/Nunatsiavut GovernmentNain , N .
is where my family is from .
In the last week of October 1918 , Inuit from camps surrounding Okak , N .
began gathering in town anticipating the arrival of the SS Harmony , a ship owned by the Moravian Church .
The vessel would arrive from St .
John 's on Nov .
4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also brought mail .
For the mission stations it serviced -- Hebron , Nutak , Ramah , Nain ( where I 'm from ) , Hopedale and Okak -- the ship was also a source of information .
The First World War had just ended , and residents of Okak had n't heard any news from the outside world .
Unknowingly , one of the ship 's crew had the Spanish Flu , and carried it with them from ship to shore .
The Harmony 's crew loaded up on supplies from Okak -- char , cod , seal fur , seal oil and whale oil -- and sailed off into the sunset .
Likewise , several families that camped near Okak left the community for their winter camps .
There , nobody at that time knew about the global Spanish Flu pandemic .
In less than a week , people started getting sick and dying .
There were no clear symptoms .
Because of this , nobody knew who was sick and who was n't .
The flu seemed to hit older people in Okak in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those with the flu would often seem to stop working , first , then just die .
Their dogs roamed , starving .
They would break into homes and eat the dead bodies inside .
My late grandfather , Isaac Suarak , was four years old when Spanish Flu hit Okak .
Like many survivors , he did n't talk about the event .
Maybe he just did n't want to .
Another survivor , Martha Okkoatsiak , said she was about eight when the flu killed her parents .
She was left to take care of her baby brother .
Okkoatsiak 's brother died in her arms .
She blamed herself , because she did n't know how to take care of him .
It was n't long before there were fewer survivors than those who had died of Spanish Flu .
The community tried keeping the dead in one house , but there were too many .
Moravian Church members and survivors burned the bodies .
Okak closed down the following years , along with Nutak , Killinik and Ramah .
People moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Inuit who arrived in Hebron were relocated to Nain in 1959 by the Newfoundland Government .
All told , the Spanish Flu had killed a third of the Inuit in Northern Labrador .
A century later , we 're facing another global pandemic -- COVID-19 .
Is our community better prepared than we were in 1918 ?  People seem to assume that isolated Inuit communities will not be affected , compared to people living in urban settings like Ottawa , Montreal or Toronto ( where many Inuit live now , too ) .
But after generations of living off the land , seas and air , Inuit immune systems tend to be susceptible to diseases like influenza , tuberculosis and other viruses .
I am very concerned for elderly citizens and people with health issues in Northern Labrador .
Unlike 1918 , Inuit in Northern Labrador now have access to social media , news and long-distance phones to keep up to date on events like COVID-19 .
This isolation has been hard on us .
Socially , Inuit are used to greeting people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family .
Now we 're being told to stop hugging and kissing .
For faraway communities throughout Inuit lands , living in isolation also comes at a cost .
Food must be flown in , and prices can be very expensive at the local grocery stores .
How much is a 5 .
L Mr .
Clean in your city ? This is what my relatives in Nain , Labrador has to pay to fight germs when cleaning our homes .
**26;1540;TOOLONG  I am very concerned for elderly citizens and people with health issues in Northern Labrador .
In a typical Inuk community , unity is strength .
Helping others , especially the handicapped and the elderly , is a daily routine .
Since fear of illness , these visits have been reduced drastically to keep our elders safe .
There is no cure , yet .
Until there is one , I feel Northern Labrador communities are not ready .
I think this needs better medical planning from the government .
Getting medical assistance is already difficult for isolated communities .
Small health clinics have opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are no doctors on site .
They 're each run by a single nurse and would not be sufficient for isolating someone with the novel coronavirus .
For serious illnesses , we have to travel to Happy Valley-Goose Bay by plane , or even further to St .
John 's for life-threatening medical conditions .
We can only follow protocol and pray that it can be contained to a minimum .
