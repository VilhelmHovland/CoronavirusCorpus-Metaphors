By  Notre Dame de Namur University 's interim president said a decision announced last Monday not to admit new students is buying time for university leaders to find a way to keep the university open .
Faculty members are less hopeful .
One faculty leader described the decision as a temporary stay of execution .
The unsettled situation demonstrates why it 's so difficult to close a college or university .
Faculty and staff members resist the idea of giving up on their employer 's future -- and their own jobs -- too early .
Leaders who want to do right by current students and staff are left with few paths forward and are very often criticized for giving up on the colleges they lead .
Similar situations have unfolded in the past .
Hampshire College 's leaders tried last year to suspend admissions and seek a merger partner , only for alumni to revolt and force the institution to reverse course .
Before that , Sweet Briar College leaders attempted to close the college and wind down operations because of poor enrollment and financial trends but were stopped by outraged alumnae .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those fighting to maintain the college 's independence .
Notre Dame de Namur appears to be different -- at least so far .
Faculty have called for many of the university 's leaders to resign but said in a letter to interim president Dan Carey , " Dan , you can stay .
"  Under plans announced last week , current students on track to graduate by spring 2021 will do so , and other students are receiving assistance to transfer to another college .
Athletics will be suspended at the end of the current semester .
The university will refund deposits for already-admitted students .
" It would be unethical for the university to accept more students , " Carey said , because the university 's financial situation is grim , and staying open is becoming increasingly difficult .
But Notre Dame de Namur did not announce that it 's closing , and Carey refused to speculate whether and when it may shut its doors .
Instead , the university is holding out for a solution and stretching what little resources it does have to graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half .
" Our goal from the very beginning is to do right by everybody , " Carey said .
" Our goal is to serve the students in every way that we can and to get them to graduation , instead of just to give up and say , ' We 're closing .
' "  The small , private , four-year university is not alone .
Many similar institutions have been facing declining enrollment and upping their tuition discount rates , leaving little cushion between operating expenses and revenue .
The new coronavirus has heightened that financial pressure : room and board refunds will create a temporary budget hole in many cases , students will likely require more financial assistance , and universities with small endowments are watching them shrink in the bear market .
Together , the pressures could force many institutions to close in coming years .
Notre Dame de Namur 's troubles came before the coronavirus outbreak .
Nonetheless , it is worth watching to see how the university 's leaders and faculty handle financial crises at a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
According to Michael Horn , co-founder of the Christensen Institute , Notre Dame de Namur 's approach in winding down its operations is unique .
" I do n't think I 've seen something quite like this before , to be totally candid , " Horn said .
" My sense is that normally schools , Boards of Trustees come together , make some clear plans , figure out teach-out options and make a clear announcement .
"  But then this Friday , after Horn was interviewed , MacMurray College in Jacksonville , Ill .
, followed that format .
The college announced that it will close at the end of the spring semester , citing declining enrollment , rising costs and an insufficient endowment .
Carey hopes there 's still time for an intervention .
The university is not currently negotiating with any other colleges about a potential merger .
That does n't mean it has n't explored potential merger options , Carey said .
He remains open to the idea .
" We 're buying time to see whether there could be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the odds of staying open ? I do n't even want to go there .
It would take something major .
"  In response to a question about rumored merger negotiations between Notre Dame de Namur and the University of San Francisco , USF issued the following statement .
" As two private , not for profit Catholic institutions , among the oldest in California , USF and NDNU had conversations with a goal of serving our students while preserving the legacy of Catholic higher education in the State of California , " it said .
" After wide-ranging discussions , it became apparent that the current environment did not present a context for a successful relationship .
"  Many faculty members at Notre Dame de Namur will not be employed by the spring of 2021 .
Layoffs are certain , Carey said .
How many faculty members will be let go and when such moves will be announced is still undecided .
Faculty are pessimistic .
Vince Fitzgerald , chair of the English department and president of the university 's Faculty General Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" The school keeps insisting that we 're staying open , but the pathway we 're on now is the pathway to closure , " Fitzgerald said .
" It feels like a temporary stay of execution .
"  He estimates that based on the number of returning students , only one-fourth to one-third of the faculty will be retained .
The university would not comment on this estimate 's accuracy .
Notre Dame de Namur is in negotiations with faculty and staff unions .
Carey received a letter from the faculty union SEIU Local 1021 on Wednesday evening .
It asks for numerous financial and employment documents and calls for the entire board , the university 's chief financial officer and its lawyer to resign .
" We would prefer to do this the easy way , but if NDNU prefers the hard way we can do that too , " wrote Nato Green , campaign coordinator for the faculty union .
" These others have to go .
Dan , you can stay .
"  According to Fitzgerald , the faculty has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly believes that we need a new board .
If the board is not willing to do everything they can to do the heavy lifting to save this institution , then they need to step aside and let other people do it , " he said .
Fitzgerald is hoping to rally for outside help and to forge community partnerships that could keep the institution afloat .
The university 's announcement last week could jeopardize those relationships , he said .
" They 've chosen the pathway where we 'll have no students in May , and that makes it exponentially more difficult to find people who would want to donate to the university , " he said .
Carey is asking for the faculty 's cooperation .
" The bottom line is this , " he said .
" If there 's not cooperation , then we might not be able to meet our goal of serving our students .
