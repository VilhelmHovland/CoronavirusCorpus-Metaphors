On March 20 , IHC had ordered release of under-trial prisoners detained in Rawalpindi 's overcrowded Adiala jail in minor crimes and directed the Islamabad police not to make arrest in petty matters .
During today 's proceedings , the additional attorney general said that the high courts are giving different rulings regarding the release of prisoners .
He asked the SC to decide the matter .
The CJP questioned how the high courts could have ordered the release of under-trial prisoners .
" Coronavirus is a grave matter .
Under what pretence did the IHC issue the directives for releasing the prisoners ? "  " How can a high court take suo motu notice in this regard ? " the CJP asked .
Those involved in petty crimes should be released , but the IHC has ordered for the release of all prisoners except those charged with terrorism , he said .
It can not happen that people start making decisions which are not within their jurisdiction during a crisis , the CJP said , adding that those prisoners who have two to three months left in their sentences should be released .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in the country .
Therefore , the release of prisoners involved in serious crimes can not be allowed because of a coronavirus scare , he said .
The apex court adjourned the hearing until April 8 and issued notices to the federal government , all advocate generals , provincial home secretaries , Islamabad IG , the National Accountability Bureau prosecutor general and the IG jails .
Syed Nayab Hassan Gardezi had moved the six-page appeal before the Supreme Court on behalf of Raja Muhammad Nadeem , questioning whether the IHC had any jurisdiction to exercise suo motu powers .
The appeal had pleaded that the March 20 IHC order militated against the concept of trichotomy of powers since it was within the exclusive domain of the executive to frame any policy to deal with under-trial prisoners in a manner it deemed appropriate keeping in view the coronavirus emergency .
The petition had also raised a plea asking whether the inherent powers vested in the high court under Section 561-A of the Criminal Procedure Code ( CrPC ) were unfettered or whether they can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Glaring omissions and mistakes have crept into the March 20 IHC order violating the law , the Constitution and public policy , the appeal had contended .
Advances are made by those with at least a touch of irrational confidence in what they can do .

Saeed  Mar 30 , 2020 02:28pm  Who is eight ? If Supreme Court is right in its decision to suspend all rulings of Provincial High Courts , then it should also discipline the provincial chief judges for giving faulty and highly dangerous rulings  Recommend0  ashfaq ahmed  Mar 30 , 2020 02:57pm  How could higher courts be that ignorant ? Those serving sentences for petty offences and above 60 can be but not UTPs ? Some could be very grave cases .
A very right ruling .

Only genuines .
Recommend0  patriot  Mar 30 , 2020 04:09pm  A good decision .
Recommend0  Mujahid  Mar 30 , 2020 05:03pm  Idea floated to release under trial defendant is absurd .
SC has taken a right decision .
These scoundrels are trying to get away from punishment by hook or by crook .
Prison is a very safe place from Covid18 , 1000 times better and safer than outside .

( Texas )  Recommend0  jaredlee007  Mar 31 , 2020 01:12am  Release all , but not Hamza and other corrupt politicians .
Recommend0  Judge  Mar 31 , 2020 01:19am  They should release all political prisoners from all jails , NABs , plus whoever on long term jail with couple months left and petty criminals few weeks early ( not waive all the punishment ) and all people disappeared by authorities .
This will reduce over crowding and good solution .
SC missed the bus .
