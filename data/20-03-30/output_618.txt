The Deadspin Sports Quarantine Nintendo Club so far has featured Ice Hockey and 10-Yard Fight , both resulting in losses to a computer with varying degrees of enjoyment along the way .
Will your humble , terrible-at-video-games correspondent have any better luck with RBI Baseball ?  I 'm playing with the Mets and taking on the Red Sox , because why not ? Well , a good reason why not would be to avoid what 's about to happen , but that 's not really what you think of when you start playing a video game .
It starts very poorly for the Mets , as Roger Clemens works a 1-2-3 inning .
There 's only one strikeout , so at least I 'm making contact , which bodes well , or so I think .
Then comes the bottom of the inning .
After Dwight Gooden strikes out Marty Barrett leading off , Bill Buckner comes up and hits what appears to be a routine ground ball to shortstop .
Rafael Santana fields , throws , and .
Buckner is safe at first .
Bill Buckner .
That Bill Buckner .
The Bill Buckner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1986 that .
you know .
He 's on first base .
Advertisement  And Buckner can run at whatever speed he wants after that , because Wade Boggs takes Gooden deep .
The handy scoreboard clock shows that I 'm losing after one minute of gameplay .
Advertisement  I 'm worried that this is going to turn into a blowout without ever having had the chance to score like I did in 10-Yard Fight .
But Gooden settles into a groove , and the question becomes whether I 'll be able to get a hit off of Clemens .
Ray Knight becomes the Mets ' first baserunner when Boggs boots a ground ball , but that only leads to a strike-em-out , throw-em-out double play due to Rafael Santana being awful and some accidental button mashing to send Knight .
The hit does come in the fourth inning , a check swing dribbler off the bat of Keith Hernandez on which he somehow has time to round first base and think about second before the ball is fielded .
The left side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , which .
did anyone bother to test this game before it was released ?  Advertisement  It 's not how I wanted to get a hit , but the way things are going , I 'll take it .
It 's also , somehow , enough to get Clemens out of the game in the fourth inning .
The computer brings in Bruce Hurst , who proves just as dominant .
Advertisement  Also on the list of nagging annoying things here , Jim Rice leads off the fourth with a single off Gooden , bringing Don Baylor to the plate .
Do you notice anything wrong in the realism department here ?  Advertisement  Maybe the technology was n't there to assign skin tones to individual players , but making " peachy white dude " the default was a choice on its own .
Anyway , I 'm just getting grouchy as this game continues to be frustrating .
Baylor hits into a 1-6-3 double play , which does n't really make the predicament feel any better -- how can I turn that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a base hit ? That 's why I 'm down by two instead of one after that fat pitch to Boggs .
In the seventh , Hurst fades .
Is that why Clemens came out so soon ? Why would starting pitchers be programmed to fall apart so quickly ? This is a game from the ' 80s , and each team only has four pitchers anyway .
I took out Gooden after five for a pinch-hitter , but he did seem to still be going well at the time .
Advertisement  Gary Carter rips a double down the left field line , and Darryl Strawberry follows by blasting a Hurst offering on a line drive all the way to the wall in right-center field .
The triple gets the Mets on the board , with the tying run at third base !  Advertisement  Wally Backman , somehow batting between Strawberry and Knight , pops up in foul territory to end the threat .
Because the universe has a sense of humor , the Red Sox bring in Calvin Schiraldi to face Knight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not .
Advertisement  Schiraldi works a 1-2-3 eighth inning , including a strikeout of Howard Johnson , pinch-hitting for Bobby Ojeda .
That 's important , because I only have two pitchers left , Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell .
I pick Orosco because , for obvious reasons , he 's always been my favorite .
And I 'm so sorry about what happens next in this game , although I blame the makers of RBI Baseball entirely , and myself not at all .
Advertisement  The way it goes down is a blur , but there are pop flies that drop right in front of fielders , an utter biffing of a ball by .
you know what , I do n't know whether the game has Mookie Wilson or Dykstra in left field , let 's say Dykstra because he 's been a worse human being over the last 34 years .
and then the big blow .
There already are two runs in when Dwight Evans hits one way the hell out .
All of this happens -- and the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to program Jesse Orosco as a submariner .
Orosco was n't an over-the-top pitcher , but he definitely was not a submariner !  Advertisement  Hernandez takes Schiraldi deep as consolation in the top of the ninth .
It 's probably enough to get me to come back and play this game again , especially because the emulator site does n't have Bad News Baseball , any of the Bases Loaded games , LJN 's Major League Baseball , or Tecmo Baseball , all of which I always liked way more .
RBI Baseball gets talked about as the best NES baseball game there was .
It does n't even crack my top 5 .
