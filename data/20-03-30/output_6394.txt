As of now , there are 11,750 confirmed cases in the Netherlands .
This is an increase of 884 cases since the last count , with 93 more deaths as well .
The Netherlands is now in the top 10 countries when it comes to coronavirus cases , and the number is expected to increase over the following weeks .
