" I have had some issues with mild anxiety and stress before .
If things start to go downward , then I can really spiral , " she says .
Mental health impacts of coronavirus  Charlie 's story comes as no surprise to Patrick McGorry , one of Australia 's leading mental health experts , who warns young people 's mental health needs during the COVID-19 response require urgent attention .
Professor McGorry , executive director of the youth mental health service Orygen , says in usual circumstances young people are at high risk for mental health issues .
Coronavirus update teaser  " It 's the period of life where you get the biggest rise in mental health issues .
In fact , 75 per cent of mental disorders appear by age 25 .
So , it 's the main health problem of that age group , by far .
And the biggest cause of death is from suicide , " he says .
" Now we 're going to see a lot of new episodes of mental health issues and mental illness appearing even in people that previously had n't experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is about a quarter of them at any one time , are going to get worse in many cases .
So , I think that it increases the risk of youth suicide .
"  He 's calling for a national mental health strategy in response to COVID-19 , which operates in a similar way to how the state and territory chief health officers are working with the federal chief medical officer .
" There 's got to be a central command post established for this because this is going to be a very significant .
And also , not a brief thing .
The mental health crisis will be severe and prolonged and it 's going to affect a very large number of people , " he says .
Professor McGorry also says there needs to be " a fairly significant injection of funds " to make a switch to online and digital mental health services to allow people to access the help they need while maintaining social distancing .
Layering up of issues  Professor McGorry points out that until coronavirus came along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health problem facing the country in many ways and we were starting to tackle it " .
He says this generation already has stressors that other generations may not have faced -- including climate change , financial and vocational insecurity .
What the experts are saying about coronavirus :  " The enforced social isolation imposed by the COVID-19 crisis has the potential to make this situation worse , " he says .
" Combined with the rising level of anxiety , financial stress and other threats and losses , the mental health of young people , their major health problem , is coming under severe pressure .
"  Professor McGorry says the anxiety many of us are feeling in response to the pandemic is an " appropriate response because a lot of people are going to die " .
" It 's a question of how to manage it , " he says .
" Obviously you do n't want to be paralysed by anxiety , so .
if you are starting to decline into an episode of let 's say , severe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the time to seek help from health professionals .
"  " I 've got friends that work in cafes and friends that work at local gyms , and they do n't really have jobs anymore , " he says .
" The amount of stress that you have when you do n't have money or you ca n't pay rent is through the roof , it 's something that ca n't be discounted .
Also , that loss of emotional and social connection at work and with other people is huge .
"  While it may not be quite the same as hanging out in real life , Professor McGorry says trying to stay connected via technology is really important for young people right now .
" Key advice is that one-to-one interactions are key here , though friendship groups can be expanded via the various social media platforms , " he says .
" We 've heard for many years that resilience is a key skill we want to build in young people , the ability to bounce forward , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these skills in mindset and thinking to problem solve , self-resource and practice being solution-focused .
Instead of looking at what 's falling apart , she says , young people need to ask : " What can we build out of the ruins ? "  " The whole phoenix rising idea can be applicable here , and can be quite positive , " Ms Brewer says .
But she 's very clear that this is not the same as resorting to " toxic positivity " , or being excessively optimistic in what will be a difficult situation for many of us .

Ms Brewer points to the example of young people who are forced to go back home and live with their parents during the pandemic .
" Just the way we narrate , some of that story is really important , " she says ,  " You 're still an independent person who , because of circumstance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not ideal and it 's not necessarily what you would choose , but the fact that it 's an option is positive .
Your parents , for many people , have wide open arms .
"  Conversations with young people that help  For parents talking to young adult children about COVID-19 , Ms Brewer advocates " being able to have tough conversations , really honestly and knowing that we do n't have to have the answer " .
" With those emerging adults it 's not about necessarily reassurance , it 's about almost a peer-to-peer conversation .
It 's about being able to share what you 're hearing and what you 're seeing , " she says .
" If I can tell you how I 'm feeling and I can verbalise that and get out of my head and have a conversation around that , that is a really helpful first step .
"  Professor McGorry says we can not treat young adults like children during this period .
" We 're talking about people who 've got a brain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of older people , " he says .
" I do n't think we should think that we 've got to look after them .
They need to look after us , just as much as we need to look after them , I would say .
It 's a question for all of us to actually manage our anxiety and the situation .
