Fitch slashed its outlook for the average oil price by over $20 in 2020 to $41/bbl on the back of global recession fears  By Ben Aris in BerlinMarch 24 , 2020  Fitch Ratings has cut its short and medium-term oil and natural gas price assumptions in expectation of very large market oversupply in 2020 .
The agency cut its outlook for average prices for the Brent blend for 2020 from $62 .
per barrel to $41/bbl and its 2021 forecasts from $60/bbl to $48/bbl respectively .
" We assume the market will gradually rebalance in the next two to three years , but we have also trimmed our long-term assumptions to reflect continued efficiency gains , low break-even oil prices of many greenfield projects and a potential for demand to slow due to energy transition , " Fitch said in a note to subscribers .
Some economists are predicting that the series of " stop shocks " following the crash of oil prices in March and exacerbated by the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic will tip the planet into a global recession of -0 .
this year , although there is still no consensus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversupply in the works  Fitch estimates the crude oil market will be " massively oversupplied in 2020 , " because of waning demand due to the coronavirus outbreak and growing production following the OPEC+ failure to agree on output cuts .
" Saudi Arabia intends to increase production from April and utilise its significant spare capacity .
This could keep the Brent price below $40/bbl for the rest of this year , as the magnitude of oversupply in 2020 in various scenarios is likely to be much larger than the maximum of 1mn barrels a day ( bpd ) seen in the past decade , " Fitch said .
Fitch is more upbeat about the medium term and expects the market to rebalance over the next two or three years due to a recovery in demand once the coronavirus outbreak is contained , as well as the impact on the US shale production , which will slow at low prices .
At the same time the agency suggested the OPEC countries will eventually cut production again to boost prices within the foreseeable future as their economies will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long .
" We expect US shale production to return to growth when oil prices stabilise , as happened in 2016-2017 , which would limit the extent of the price recovery , " says Fitch .
Gas glut , but prices to recover slowly  Natural gas markets are also vastly oversupplied , says Fitch .
Europe in particular faces a gas glut following the unusually warm winter and the large supplies of gas in storage as a result of a gas war between Russia 's Gazprom and Ukraine 's Naftogaz over the renewal of the transit deal that was averted at the last minute in December .
And thanks to the warm winter the gas glut extends beyond Europe .
" Current prices in Europe and Asia rarely cover the half-cycle cash costs ( that include variable operating costs and transport to Europe ) of natural gas and LNG suppliers , including Gazprom and US producers , and are therefore unsustainable , " Fitch said .
" We assume the Dutch TTF and UK NBP gas prices in Europe will gradually recover to $5 .
over three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of US producers , including shipping to Europe and capex .
We assume the US Henry Hub price to recover to $2 .
in the long term .
"  But gas prices will remain low in the meantime over the next two years , according to Fitch , due to weak demand for LNG in China , high volumes of gas in European storage and commissioning of new LNG capacity , albeit at slower pace than in 2016-2019 .
" Our ratings will be driven by issuers ' expected credit profiles in 2020-2023 ( assuming their liquidity remains sufficient ) , rather than when prices trough .
This is in line with our " rating-through-the-cycle " approach , " says Fitch .
" We do not anticipate that this revision of oil and gas prices will trigger portfolio-wide negative rating actions , but we will assess the credit impact case by case .
High-yield issuers are more exposed , particularly those with high liquidity and refinancing risks , given tough capital and asset sale markets .
"  Analysts weighing up likelihood of wave of food nationalism and protectionism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may face pandemic " catastrophe " , local corporate titans suggest it might be better for country to bite bullet and go for short , sharp shock rather than long , drawn-out battle .
