, The Times-Picayune The New Orleans Advocate )  From the editor  We think the role of local journalism is to inform us about our world here in Louisiana , but journalism also informs the world outside Louisiana about us .
Sometimes that helps our state , in unexpected ways .
We saw that during Hurricane Katrina , when The Times-Picayune and other local media had a better understanding of the realities on the ground than the government that was supposed to be protecting us .
It was local media , not the authorities , who helped the nation appreciate the magnitude of the catastrophe .
The same thing happened in 2016 , when a summer flood assaulted Baton Rouge and Lafayette .
The nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied to a hurricane and Baton Rouge and Lafayette just do n't tickle the American imagination the way New Orleans does .
On August 18 , we published a 422-word editorial criticizing President Obama for vacationing in Martha 's Vineyard when he should have been coming here to see the disaster firsthand .
That day , I was invited to appear on each of the three cable news networks .
Fox News even sent a limousine to fetch me over to the River Center , where I waited in the summer heat for my fifteen minutes of fame .
The technique worked : Republican nominee Donald Trump came the following day , trailing TV cameras .
Obama appeared the next week .
( Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton promised to come , but never did .
)  Their work quickly focused attention on Louisiana as the most significant hotspot for the virus outside of the two coasts .
Louisiana has twice as many cases as Texas , with six times our population .
We have four times as many deaths .
Within a day , President Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid the state with need in its fight against the disease .
When you support local journalism , you support the work of reporters like Jeff Adelson and Gordon Russell .
Their contribution goes beyond helping inform Louisiana 's four million people .
They are also alerting a compassionate nation to our needs -- and getting results .
But they need your help .
Orleans Parish has the highest per-capita death rate for the coronavirus among all American counties to date , a new analysis by The Times-Pica .
The Times-Picayune and The Advocate are locally owned , but we are not immune to the economic damage being caused by the virus and the precautionary shutdowns .
So -- just like in 2005 and 2016 -- we are depending on you , through subscriptions .
