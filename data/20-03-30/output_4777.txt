Due to the global novel coronavirus covid-19 pandemic , many people are not only staying at home but working there .
In Japan , the editorial department of game site Inside decided to hold meetings in the happiest place there is : Animal Crossing .

According to Inside , those include :  Compared to other apps like Slack or Discord , chatting in Animal Crossing is way more fun .
It 's a change of pace from the office .

There are also demerits , including :  Sending attachments is not possible , so you 'll end up sending those via your computer .

This is Animal Crossing after all .
