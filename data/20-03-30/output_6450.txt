Starbucks to fight coronavirus by making coffee ' to go ' , limiting hours and closing some stores  Starbucks ( SBUX ) said on Sunday it would halt in-store customer seating in North America for at least two weeks , while limiting hours and shuttering a few shops in high traffic areas , in a bid to help reduce spreading of the coronavirus .
In a memo sent to more than 220,000 partners across the U .
and Canada , Starbucks plans to limit customers to carry out orders only , and will temporarily close company-operated stores in " high-social gathering locations " like shopping malls and university campuses .
" Over the last 24 hours , as more communities , including the federal government , have called for increased social distancing to help contain the virus , we have made the decision to move to our next level of protocols , " Rossann Williams , president of U .
company-operated business and Canada , wrote in a memo to Starbucks partners .
" Starting today , we will move to a ' to go ' model across the U .
and Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering in our caf ? s , " Williams added .
In Seattle and New York -- two states particularly hard hit by the virus -- Starbucks will reduce operating hours or temporarily close select stores , the memo said .
No more ' third place ' -- for now  Starbucks , which has established itself as a " third place " between home and work , is temporarily curtailing the use of the lounge-like common areas -- both inside and outdoors -- where customers frequently linger to talk , surf the Internet or work on laptops .
Meanwhile , stores will also have a modified condiment bar where items are available upon request .
Customers can still order in-person inside caf ? s or use the Mobile Order &amp; Pay offering , and drive-thrus and delivery will remain open as well .
As for exchanging cash , a designated partner will handle those transactions and be allowed to wear gloves .
" These are the actions we know are effective based on our experience in China " -- where Starbucks was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Williams .
" Working together , I am confident we can modify operations in all stores quickly and seamlessly , as we know the majority of our customers already get their order ' to go ' and most of our customers who typically use our caf ? seating are also used to visiting us at Mobile Order &amp; Pay and Drive Thru , " she wrote .
In late January , Starbucks said it closed more than half of its 4,000 China-based stores , its second-largest and fastest-growing market , amid the coronavirus outbreak .
A month later , Starbucks said it had reopened most of the stores .
At the moment , 90% of the China locations are now open .
In a regulatory filing posted this month , the company said it expects comparable-store sales in China for the fiscal second quarter to fall by about 50% versus a year ago because of the closures .
Starbucks also expects quarterly revenue in China to stake a hit of approximately $400 to $430 million in the quarter .
At the time of this writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit 3,244 , with the death toll rising to 62 .

Last week , Starbucks expanded its existing sick pay and personal time-off benefits to offer catastrophe pay for 14 days to any employee diagnosed or exposed to COVID-19 .
