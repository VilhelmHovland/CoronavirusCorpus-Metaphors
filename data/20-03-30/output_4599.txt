Stop stand downs of support staff in independent schools  The union has been advised that a small number of independent schools are considering standing down support staff without pay in Term 2 because of COVID-19 .
The union is calling for an immediate stop to any such steps .
" In light of the government 's recently announced job-keeper wage-subsidy payments , there is no reason to stand support staff down , " said IEUA NSW/ACT Branch secretary Mark Northam .
Businesses will be paid a wage subsidy of up to $1500 per fortnight per employee , under a Federal Government plan to keep Australians in work during the coronavirus crisis .
" Staff must not be stood down while these plans are still evolving , " Northam said .
" The union is seeking for all staff in schools and early learning centres to remain fully employed , even while schools and centres are operating with reduced numbers of students .
" There is no shortage of work to be done .
Schools need to creatively explore ways to ensure school sites remain safe for the staff and small numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students .
" Support staff are already playing a valuable role in assisting teachers to provide online learning and maintaining contact with students and their families .
Schools can not be expected to deliver a new hybrid model of education without teachers and support staff working together .
"  All awards and enterprise agreements require the employer to consult with employees and the union about potential stand-downs .
" It is not clear that schools will need to stand down employees in the current situation and they must consider all the issues before taking any drastic steps .
Schools delivering online education are NOT shut .
We are calling for an immediate halt to any threatened stand-downs , " said Northam .
Teachers and support staff should not hesitate to call the union if they are concerned about work health and safety at their school , their requests to work from home , or their employment rights .

( Media ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world ( more on this ! ) .
Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward , fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country .
According to independent assessment , about 98% of the media sector is held by three conglomerates .
