U of M team joins researchers from around the globe in pursuit of COVID-19 vaccine  Virology professor Xiaojian Yao leads a U of M research team pursuing a vaccine for COVID-19 .
Yao 's research proposal was one of six chosen this month for funding by the federal government .
Xiaojian Yao recalls watching with shock as a new contagion swept across mainland China in late January ; the number of infections grew each day , so too did the death count .
The Winnipeg virologist had a professional interest in the outbreak because of his role as director of the University of Manitoba 's Laboratory of Molecular Human Retrovirology , and he had a personal interest : the threat was encroaching on Beijing , where he is from .
Shock quickly turned to resolve for the 63-year-old professor .
He became determined to contribute research that would help contain , treat and control the highly contagious COVID-19 virus .
" The virus has spread so fast because the whole population is vulnerable to viral invasion , " Yao said by phone from his laboratory at Max Rady College of Medicine .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why so many groups in the world right now are working on vaccine development .
" I 'm a virologist , so my only concern is the virus pandemic .
"  Yao is the lead investigator of a research team at the University of Manitoba studying a potential vaccine for COVID-19 .
His proposal was one of six selected by the federal government this month to receive funding specifically for vaccine research , with $326,578 coming from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and $270,550 from Research Manitoba .
Worldwide , members of the scientific community have started the difficult task of analyzing and understanding the novel coronavirus .
Researchers are racing to find diagnostics , drugs and ultimately vaccines to be used in the battle against the disease .
Yao 's laboratory is working around the clock to test whether the receptor binding domain of COVID-19 could be a vaccine candidate , and researchers are using a university patented technology platform to test the theory .
" The pandemic happened so fast , so to use our technology to deliver a coronavirus vaccine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUTH BONNEVILLE / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS  Yao believes the work of researchers around the globe , which is being accelerated by increased government funding , means a treatment will be found .
" I 'm very excited .
I work every day now in the laboratory , " he said .
" I 'm very happy to contribute , and I will do my best if I can develop a vaccine that can be used to combat this virus we 're fighting .
"  Yao 's area of expertise is human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) .
His academic record stretches back more than 40 years .
He received his medical degree from Suzhou University of Medicine in China in 1983 and worked as a physician before turning to research .
Yao said he was fascinated by the nature of viruses , how they survive and function within the host .
He left medicine to complete his doctorate in molecular biology and retrovirology at the University of Montreal .
In 2004 , he was attracted to Manitoba 's research community and joined the U of M .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel coronavirus is unique to the U of M and represents a significant contribution to the overall body of research on COVID-19 .
A molecule of the virus -- called the spike protein -- is key to infecting a host cell and is the main target of the host 's immune responses .
Previous studies into SARS have shown the receptor binding domain of that virus has multiple epitopes ( a molecule fragment ) that produce potent neutralizing antibodies .
The antibody can bind to SARS and interfere with its ability to infect a cell .
The question is whether the receptor binding domain of COVID-19 will behave similarly and produce an immune response .
Stay informed  The study is poised to lay the groundwork for the development and production of other vaccine candidates in the effort to control the pandemic .
Trials on animals will begin this week , Yao said .
He made of point of wanting to reassure the public .
He said the work of researchers around the globe , which is being accelerated by increased government funding , means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the university have launched a clinical trial to determine whether common malaria medication can be used against COVID-19 , and his collaborators across Canada and at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg are aggressively pursuing solutions .
" Other virologists , we will do our best to develop some way to make some treatments , prevention and vaccine available , " he said .
" There are so many people who are working , so who will be the fastest ? "  Links  The Free Press would like to thank our readers for their patience while comments were not available on our site .
