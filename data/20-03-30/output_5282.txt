SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY  Thanks for signing up !  Food courts are closed , but the restaurants inside are open .
You should n't leave the house unless it 's necessary , but retail stores are still doing business .
Your little nephew 's birthday bash is forbidden , but school is still in session .
And you can have five people at your wedding , but ten at your outdoor boot camp .
That 's some of the latest advice from Prime Minister Scott Morrison , who last night used a press conference to announce an expansion of lockdown measures to combat the Australian outbreak of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) .
In case you missed it : as of midnight tonight , food courts around Australia will close , with the restaurants inside still permitted to serve takeaway .
Beauty salons will close , but hairdressers will remain open , with strict 30-minute-per-customer time limits .
Auction houses , amusement parks , open house inspections , arcades , play centres , libraries , museums and community facilities like RSLs will all shut their doors .
Stunningly , weddings are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knot , the celebrant , and two witnesses .
While the announcement intended to clarify which aspects of Australian life should be postponed as we fight the pandemic , many viewers were left confused by the tidal wave of new advice .
In one stunning exchange , a journo asked Morrison why , for example , personal trainers will be permitted to conduct outdoor classes with more people than a wedding .
The PM said it was simple advice , designed to keep people in a job .
" What we are talking about is people , up to ten , for training , that is a business , that is someone 's livelihood and you are saying that I should turn their livelihood off , " Morrison said .
" I 'm not going to do that lightly .
"  It was just one peculiar aspect of a sprawling press conference , but viewers and reporters immediately found a loophole : if you can have that many people at an outdoor sweat session , what 's to stop you from getting hitched at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to 5 people but boot camp is limited to 10 .
can you get married while you exercise in the park ?  so you can only have five people at your wedding but ten at your boot camp ? looks like we all getting married in yoga pants bitches  -- Babes do nt threaten me ! ghan with a good time ( @babyouremyqueen ) March 24 , 2020  Boot Camp v Wedding  A man and his fianc ? , the celebrant , the best man , maid of honour , both sets of parents and the wedding singer can do a boot camp on the morning of the wedding .
but only half of them can actually go to the wedding #COVID19Aus#COVID ? 19#auspol  While those suggestions are pretty obvious piss-takes ( we hope ) , they do suggest flaws in the Federal Government 's messaging on which activities are necessary and which are not as we clamp down on community infections .
More crackdowns are expected .
It 's a devastating and difficult time for everyone in Australia , as Morrison said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white gown turns you from a vector for infection to an Australian hero supporting a local business , some clearer guidelines might be beneficial .
Listening to the PM like everyone here in Aust &amp; what I understood was .
" It 's essential .
Unless it 's not .
Then it 's essentially not essential .
I ca n't be clearer " Plus people can buy a new shirt at a shopping centre ? WTF ? PM just had a shocker .
Surely should be in lockdown now .
