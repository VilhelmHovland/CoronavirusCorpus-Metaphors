Last week during our first #VirtualFDOC , we saw our community come together in new ways to help others across North Carolina .
Our researchers made significant contributions in the fight against COVID-19 , faculty and staff quickly transitioned to remote instruction and provided valuable online resources to local governments .
Many students also reached out to volunteer .
Our community has extraordinary people who rise to the occasion -- that 's what it means to be a true Tar Heel .
View photography from around the world in this exhibition featuring work by University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni , faculty , staff and students .
The exhibition will open January 8 and run through July 10 , 2020 at the FedEx Global Education Center .
All photography on display was submitted as part of UNC-Chapel Hill 's 20th annual Carolina Global Photography Competition .
This University Libraries exhibition features two centuries of written news , including newspapers , newsletters and magazines .
It looks at the important role specialty news sources have played in informing , connecting and empowering North Carolina communities .
