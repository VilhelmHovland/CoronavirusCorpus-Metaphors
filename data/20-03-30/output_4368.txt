Beara Community School is reaping rewards as the division pulls together  The Beara Community School team that won the Munster colleges ' senior D football final in Killarney .
Share this article  SEAN O'Leary has had strangers approach him on the street to congratulate him on Beara Community School 's recent football success .
It 's the players that deserve the plaudits , he insists , not him .
This is a team effort .
The school , the coaches , the players and the local clubs came together , committed to working hard and the end result is that the Beara secondary school in Castletownbere are now Munster senior ( U19 ) D football champions .
It 's a welcome good news story for Beara football .
' Coming from where we came from , having lost the first round the year before , this was huge progress -- but they got the results because they committed , ' Beara Community School teacher O'Leary explained .
The Whiddy Island man is better known as a Bantry Blues ' footballer , and a former Cork minor and U21 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his school .
Last year , Beara Community School lost the Munster U16 .
final to Cahir .
This year the school 's senior team went one step further .
It started with a 4-14 to 2-5 win against Col ? iste Mhuire Askeaton .
Then they hammered Ard Scoil Na Mara Tramore by 5-15 to 2-5 , followed by another convincing performance as they defeated Hazelwood College Dromcollogher , 3-14 to 0-7 .
That catapulted Beara CS into a Munster semi-final against Ballyvourney ( including Cork U20 Aodh ? n ? Luasa ) played at Dr Crokes pitch in Killarney -- that was a real test , as O'Leary explained .
' The semi-final was a massive one , ' he said .
' We eventually won by five points and it was a sensational game of football .
' It was a cracker that could have gone either way .
'  It went Beara 's way .
They won 3-8 to 1-9 .
It was onto the Munster final next .
***  Everyone has bought into this .
They had to for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In the ongoing Beara GAA Strategic Review , the local schools were identified as an area for improvement .
' The buy-in from the clubs was very important , ' O'Leary said .
' They came to us , asked us what we needed , we told them and that included us asking for Wednesdays to be left for us to train because we have a half day in the school .
'  That wish was granted .
The buy-in from the players was even more important .
Footballers from Castletownbere , Urhan , Adrigole and Garnish feed into the school .
' The lads have fully committed and they gave us their all in every training session and in every game , ' O'Leary said .
' They put in the work and they have got the rewards .
' Most of them are playing in low grades with their clubs and that 's down to numbers more so than anything else .
' When they come together now with Beara , they have this groundwork behind them .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and on the pitch as footballers , and he has watched them grow in both , pointing to the Munster D final against Me ? n Scoil Castlegregory as one example .
' I remember being in the dressing-room in Fitzgerald Stadium for the final and it was the young fellas who were taking charge -- and it was great to see them take on that leadership , ' he said .
Memories were made that magical day in Killarney .
***  An early Beara blitz rocked the Kerry school .
Ben O'Sullivan from Urhan struck for a goal as they surged 1-2 to 0-0 ahead .
By half time they led 1-5 to 0-1 , having played with the wind .
Captain Alan Elphick from Urhan was a rock at full back with Adrigole 's Darragh O'Sullivan , on the Cork minor panel , impressing at corner back .
2019 All-Ireland winning Cork minor Joseph O'Shea from Urhan was powerful at centre back .
The midfield pairing of Alan O'Sullivan ( Urhan ) and Fintan Fenner ( Castletownbere ) , another on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punching holes in the Castlegregory defence , but not taking all their chances .
Early in the second half , there was another Beara blitz .
Goals from Ben O'Sullivan , who finished with 2-3 , and Dylan Crowley , saw Beara CS power 3-5 to 0-1 in front .
Game over .
They won 3-8 to 2-4 , but could have won by a lot more .
' To win a Munster final at Fitzgerald Stadium , that will live with them until the day they die , that can never be taken away from them , ' said O'Leary , who is helped by Kenmare man Dara Crowley .
' They have put in the work and they are getting the rewards -- that 's a great lesson for them right there .
No matter the sport , success helps breed success .
' The Wednesday before we finished up due to the coronavirus we called a training session at school and we said that the U16 .
panel could train with us .
We had 42 players there , ' O'Leary said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellas who had given up football come back and they now have Munster medals in their back pocket , which is great .
' Before you would struggle to get 15 fellas to play a game , now you struggle to pick the starting 15 -- that 's a huge difference .
'  Winning Munster opened the door to the All-Ireland series , though Beara Community School 's semi-final against the Connacht champions Dunmore was called off due an outbreak of mumps in the Beara team .
Given the blanket ban on all GAA due to the Covid-19 pandemic , when and if that game will be played is up the air , but some things are bigger than football insists O'Leary .
Still , whatever the coming months hold for this team , their commitment , dedication and success is a boost to Beara GAA .
' To put this in perspective , I 'd walk down the street on my lunch and I 'd have five or six people come up and shake my hand saying " well done " and " keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who they are to be totally honest , ' O'Leary added .
' This success is for the whole community , it lifts the place and the mood , and these young players can take that back to their clubs .
'  These are memories and lessons in life that these students will remember long after they stop walking the corridors of Beara Community School -- but they 'll leave a legacy that lasts .
They are the young heroes of 2020 .
