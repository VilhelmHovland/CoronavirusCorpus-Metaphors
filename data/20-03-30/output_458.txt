Instead of traditional phone banks , meetings and canvassing , NEA has moved to digital get-out-the-vote efforts , including emails , social media and digital ads to encourage members to vote .
Weingarten called the pandemic " the greatest challenge we have battled in generations , " and she blasted President Donald Trump and his administration for failing to secure testing and personal protective equipment to safeguard health care providers , concealing the severity of the virus and downplaying the public health risks .
She said the administration has " refused to deploy the full arsenal " of federal resources , leaving leadership to governors .
" Now more than ever , we need a standard-bearer who is actually looking out for us , and who has a proven track record of steering the country successfully through economic and social upheaval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2016 primary .
The early endorsement did n't go over well with some of the rank-and-file members who supported Sanders and with other labor leaders , who questioned its timing .
Their endorsement this year follows candidate events , town halls , polls , regional conferences and other efforts to maximize member participation leading up to the November election .
The polling memo shows support for Biden " has consolidated throughout the union , making him the first choice of every constituency , every region of the country , and both men and women .
He not only enjoys a large 46-point edge among moderate/conservative Democrats , but he also leads among liberal Democrats ( +17 ) .
" Most members believe he can beat Trump .
Last month , AFT announced it would encourage its local and state affiliates to back or endorse the presidential bids of Biden , Sanders ( I-Vt .
) or Sen .
Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass .
) and Weingarten announced her " personal support " for Warren before she dropped out of the race .

Weingarten described Biden 's presidential candidacy in a November interview with POLITICO as being from " a different era .
" People love that about Biden , she said , but it also means he 's " not as attentive to the cues of this era .
"  On Sunday , she lauded Biden 's character and his plans for investing in public education , making college " a reality for everyone " and fixing the " broken " Public Service Loan Forgiveness program .
She also said Biden is with the union on making health care a human right , prioritizing clean energy and environmental justice and building a pathway to the middle class .
" His whole career has been devoted to building a pathway to the middle class for the millions of people facing an affordability crisis daily .
It 's time to give him the chance to do that as president , " she said .
