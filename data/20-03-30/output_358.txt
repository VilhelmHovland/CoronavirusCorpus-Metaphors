And yet the Trump administration has been so reluctant to use the authority of the federal government to direct the country 's capacity to those needs that in some respects , it 's already too late .
It 's a failure that typifies the broader leadership vacuum that allowed the United States to become the world 's most coronavirus-infected country as of last week .
Despite having a quarter of the population of China and months to prepare for the pandemic , the country has more known infections than the contagion 's ground zero or any other nation .
It was n't until March 18 that President Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act , a post-World War II law that gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of goods needed in wartime and emergencies .
But it was n't until Friday , 10 days later , that Trump said he would use the act to compel General Motors to produce ventilators .
He did so only in a fit of pique at GM and its chief executive , Mary Barra , whose company had been working with a ventilator maker to ramp up production but was reportedly waiting for the administration to provide information such as how many devices are needed .
In between belatedly threatening to use the law designed for emergencies like the one at hand and actually doing so , the president and other administration officials issued a volley of contradictory and confusing comments about whether they would need to use the act , whether they already had and whether any shortages exist .
Trump doubted New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo and others citing a coming surge of critically ill patients needing the devices and at one point said he would not invoke the production law because it would amount to Venezuelan-style nationalization of industries .
This was puzzling given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017 .
More important , the president appears to misapprehend the law 's purpose and his government 's role .
Rather than engaging in power and public-relations struggles with the nation 's governors and chief executives , he should be marshaling , organizing and directing resources to needs .
In a vast and varied country , the federal government is the only authority able to do so .
The neglect of that duty has created a counterproductive scramble for supplies by governments , companies and others .
An Oakland-based union announced last week that it had discovered a cache of 39 million high-grade masks for health care workers , who have resorted to making their own and pleading for donations from the public .
Forcing one willing company to manufacture medical equipment hardly begins the difficult and necessary task of bringing order to this chaos .
