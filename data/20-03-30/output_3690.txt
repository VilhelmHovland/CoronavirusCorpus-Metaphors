Moody 's downgrade of SA to junk status is ' heartless ' -- SACP  Eric Naki  Homeless persons line up outside a shelter in Johannesburg , on March 28 , 2020 after having been rounded up by officers of the Johannesburg Metro Police Department ( JMPD ) .
South Africa came under a nationwide lockdown on March 27 , 2020 , joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus across the continent .
( Photo by MARCO LONGARI / AFP )  The ANC 's allies had some harsh words for sovereign rating agency Moody 's decision to downgrade South Africa 's investment rating to junk status , with the SA Communist Party describing the move as " heartless , insensitive and inconsiderate " in the light of the coronavirus crisis that has brought the country to a standstill .
But some opposition parties blamed the ANC 's track record of corruption , the escalating public spending and the national debt .
They put the blame for the decision squarely on burdensome state-owned enterprises .
SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo said the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , national disaster , and a nationwide lockdown in South Africa resulting from the coronavirus crisis .
He said a number of economic sectors would n't be running during this period and South Africa was not alone in this .
Other countries also faced the same emergency situations .
" It is clear that certain global rating agencies and other forces want to usurp the economic policy formulation from democratically elected governments , such as ours in South Africa , and impose a foreign monopoly finance capital-driven agenda , opposed to the interests and aspirations of the people , especially the workers and the poor , " Mashilo said .
He said the party was opposed to the agenda of " weaponising " the rating agencies and other attempts of exploiting the global emergency to undermine South African sovereignty or " impose private profiteering agendas " .
Congress of SA Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said the below-investment grade rating was not surprising because SA 's economy has been stagnant for some time and nothing had been done to fix it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the economy because it will squeeze our already scarce public funds .
It will also likely deter international investments , in particular pension funds , " Pamla said .
" We need a serious recovery package to fix this and kick-start the economy .
The country needs to focus on employment creation by making funds available for clean energy , technology , and infrastructure projects .
"  Pamla suggested a three-month payment holiday for all loans , which would represent the largest stimulus package injected into the economy .
" The Reserve Bank needs to cut interest rates by a further 100 basis points in April .
The UIF needs to ramp up its capacity to roll out relief to workers now on unpaid leave , " he said .
Debt counselling firm Debt Rescue CEO Neil Roets said the substantial drop in the fuel price of about R2 a litre in April should be seen as a short-term reprieve and the investment grade to junk would hit consumers hard .
Roets warned consumers against further hoarding .
" There is absolutely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near future .
We have seen widespread evidence of consumers buying bulk food on credit and store cards -- both of which carry high interest rates .
"  Dawie Roodt , chief economist of the Efficient Group , said he expected a " deep " recession bottoming out at a negative rate of around 3% and 5% .
Freedom Front Plus chief of finance Wouter Wessels said Moody 's downgrading of SA could not have come at a worse time , but it was to be expected due to the ANC government 's mismanagement of the fiscus and the lack of fiscal discipline underlying its destructive economic policy .
" The government allowed public enterprises to be driven to the very verge of bankruptcy by corruption , mismanagement and looting , especially in the time of state capture .
That was the main reason for Moody 's decision .
"  Wessels said a new budget would have to be tabled as soon as possible after the lockdown .
" It is , therefore , absolutely imperative to make drastic changes to improve fiscal policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public enterprises so that they are no longer a burden for the state .
"  According to National Freedom Party secretary-general Canaan Mdletshe , Moody 's decision " adds salt into an already bleeding wound of South African pockets " .
" This would hit the poorest of the poor hard .
We were hopeful that Moody 's would spare the country a lifeline .
"  Congress of the People said the downgrading was a serious blow .
Spokesperson Dennis Bloem said it warned the ANC corruption would have devastating consequences on its economy .
" This will hit all of us very hard , especially the unemployed .
