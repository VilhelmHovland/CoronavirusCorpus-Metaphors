Lumos Diagnostics Supports the Victorian Healthcare System by Providing FebriDx ? for a Pilot Evaluation in the Triaging of Acute Respiratory Infection Patients  March 26 , 2020 07:36 AM Eastern Daylight Time  SARASOTA , Fla .
&amp; MELBOURNE , Australia-- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) --Lumos Diagnostics and Planet Innovation , its strategic investor and partner , have mobilized a philanthropic effort to provide the FebriDx ? diagnostic test to general practitioners ( GPs ) and other healthcare professionals in the state of Victoria .
This initiative will aid in the testing , subsequent triage and timely clinical management of patients presenting with symptoms of an acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) during these unprecedented times of increased patient demand and concern .
Sam Lanyon , chairman of the board for Lumos Diagnostics and co-chief executive officer for Planet Innovation states , " We are honored to be able to contribute even a small amount to the enormous challenge faced by Victorian and global healthcare providers due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
We are working with the Victorian Government to demonstrate the benefits and impact that the FebriDx test may deliver to improving community health by assisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point-of care ( POC ) tests such as FebriDx allow results to be rapidly delivered to patients in initial care settings , such as GP clinics , fever screening clinics , hospital emergency rooms and aged care facilities , instead of samples being sent to a laboratory .
Unlike pathogen-specific molecular tests , FebriDx is a 10-minute test that rapidly assesses the body 's immune response to an ARI from a simple fingerstick blood sample , helping to identify viral infections that may necessitate isolation and bacterial infections that require antibiotic therapy .
The test simultaneously detects two unique biomarkers , Myxovirus resistance protein A ( MxA ) that becomes elevated in the presence of acute viral infection and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) that is elevated in the presence of clinically significant infection .
FebriDx is an all-in-one , disposable test that is easy to use in an outpatient setting and/or apply to large scale screening efforts .
By enabling a rapid diagnostic triage at the initial visit or screening stage , the FebriDx test can assist health professionals with decision-making and may thereby help identify patients who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flu A/B ) when the FebriDx test result is positive for viral infection andlimit unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions that lead to antibiotic resistance when the FebriDx test is negative for bacterial infection .
Clinical performance from a prospective multi-center U .
clinical trial found FebriDx to be 95% sensitive , 94% specific and have a negative predictive value of 99% to exclude a bacterial infection and a positive predictive value of 90% to confirm viral infection in febrile patients .
European outcome studies show that FebriDx is able to alter clinical management decisions in 48% of patients tested and reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions by 80 - 90% .
" The ability to rapidly triage an influx of patients with respiratory infection symptoms as bacterial or viral in the outpatient setting -- for example , differentiating high risk patients who may have a viral infection like SARS-CoV-2 and would benefit from confirmatory testing from those with an underlying bacterial infection requiring antibiotic therapy -- will improve the flow of care , " said Robert Sambursky , MD , president and chief executive officer of Lumos Diagnostics .
