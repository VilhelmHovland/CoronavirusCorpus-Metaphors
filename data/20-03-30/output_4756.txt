Victoria to go it alone with tougher coronavirus restrictions  Victoria could be the first Australian jurisdiction to move into heightened lockdown as the state government prepares to go further than the rest of the nation in its attempts to slow the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus .
Government sources have told The Age that Victoria is prepared to go much further than the Commonwealth or even NSW , the state hardest hit by the virus , with moves to shut down social activity and the economy in a bid to save lives as the pandemic escalates .
Authorities say the unprecedented measures taken so far are not slowing transmission of the illness , with the number of confirmed cases in Victoria now at 466 following confirmation of 55 new cases .
The state moved to " stage 2 " restrictions on movements and gatherings at midnight on Tuesday , imposing strict curbs on weddings and funerals , and instructing beauty therapists , food courts in shopping centres and play centres to shut their doors .

One cabinet minister , Adem Somyurek , tweeted on Tuesday night after the stage 2 restrictions were announced by the Prime Minister that he wanted an immediate lockdown to suppress the spread of the disease through the state .
Mr Somyurek has since deleted his online post .

" I 'm being upfront with people .
There will be a stage three , " Mr Andrews said .
But he would not speculate on what measures would come in the next stage of restrictions .
" What 's going on in the Northern Territory is not the same as what 's going on in the northern suburbs of Melbourne , " Mr Andrews said .
" We will have to move and put in place different measures , more measures .
"  Mr Andrews said it was unlikely that individual regional centres in Victoria would be placed in lockdown , although he did not rule it out .

"  So far 12 people are receiving hospital treatment in Victoria for COVID-19 .
Mikakos confirmed two people were being treated in intensive care -- one of them aged in their 30s .
" I make this point which is to stress that COVID-19 is not an elderly person 's disease , " she said .
