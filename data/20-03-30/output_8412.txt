The Missouri State Athletics Director has had to use it quite a bit when talking with his coaches throughout the coronavirus pandemic .
He does n't want to give his coaches false hope about when sports will get started up again , but he also does n't want everything to be doom and gloom .
One thing he does know is that Missouri State athletics is going to be different once the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the athletics program amid the coronavirus pandemic that put an abrupt end to the 2019-20 athletics season and is sure to have an impact for years to come .

( Photo : Nathan Papes/Springfield News-Leader )  How those changes will look immediately remains to be seen but the quicker things get back to normal , the better .
" I 'm not prepared to think of armageddon yet , " Moats said Monday morning in a phone interview with the News-Leader .
" No matter what , I think we 're going to have sports .
It may not be the way the coaches currently have it and I think all of us understand that things are n't going to be quite the same .
" We 've had those discussions with our coaches and the reality of our society -- they know things are n't going to be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're trying to figure out .

( Photo : Andrew Jansen/Springfield News-Leader )  From a financial stance , Moats said losing the remainder of the spring athletics season is n't a " catastrophic " blow revenue-wise .
Baseball ticket sales will be lost but the two basketball programs generate the most ticket-revenue and both of their home seasons already ended .
But the longer the pandemic goes on , the more it threatens the fall athletics season -- which could have a much larger impact .
Moats referenced Missouri State football 's season opener at Oklahoma as an example .
The university is set to make $600,000 for the game that is scheduled for Sept .
The two schools agreed on the deal in July 2017 .
" That 's critical to our budget and we ca n't make up $600,000 in revenue throughout the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and football do really , really well , " Moats said .
" I think it will get done .
It may be modified in terms of fewer games or it may be started later .

The more games that are lost , the more potential revenue the program will lose .
Following the News-Leader 's interview with Moats on Monday morning , the NCAA Division I Council voted to extend eligibility for spring-sport student-athletes an additional season of competition and extension of their period of eligibility .
The athletics director said the university is in favor of giving an extra year to those who had their spring seasons come to an early end but there will be additional financial situations to deal with when doing so .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more members on scholarship to account for incoming recruits and student-athletes who had been in their last year of eligibility and decided to stay .
The Council vote also provided schools with the flexibility to return for the 2020-21 season without requiring that athletics aid be provided at the same level awarded for 2019-20 .
The flexibility applies only to student-athletes who exhausted eligibility in 2019-20 .
Winter sports were not included in the decision .
The Council increased the roster limit in baseball for student-athletes impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic .
It should be noted that it 's not a guarantee that all senior athletes will want to return for an additional year as jobs might be lined up for some or others might want to move on with their lives .
" We are certainly in favor of it but we need to see what the numbers are , " Moats said .
Missouri State University Director of Athletics Kyle Moats speaks during a press conference regarding the university parting ways with former head football coach Dave Steckel during a press conference on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jansen/Springfield News-Leader )  Missouri State athletics has n't been the strongest financially in recent years , considering it had to shave over $1 million from its annual budget when it eliminated field hockey among other moves in 2017 .
It makes this unprecedented situation that much more difficult .
" It 's not like we 've been working off a lot of excess fat , " Moats said .
" We were really , really lean to begin with .
We 're just going to have to look at things .
It 's not a matter of ' if we want to ' but we 're going to have to .
"  Some of the changes Moats has his coaches prepared for are the different steps they 'll have to take when scheduling and in their finances .
He said it 's safe to say not everyone will have the same amount in budgets as they 've had in the past .
" How we get to those situations is still being worked out , " he said .

Andrew Jansen/Springfield News-Leader  Missouri State athletics fundraising efforts have been put on hold , according to Moats .
He does n't think it is currently the right time to be fundraising for the different projects the program was working on .
Instead , coaches are reaching out and talking to donors and giving them updates along with thanking them .
Moats said the most helpful thing for Missouri State and all of college athletics right now would be for people to abide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to normal .
Although the financials are difficult right now , Moats said the three most important things are keeping his student-athletes safe , helping them graduate and getting them back on the field to compete .
" I think we 're all wired in athletics to compete , " Moats said .
" It 's not a whole lot of fun when sitting in front of a team when players are upset they may not play their last year .
Anytime you take an opportunity away from a student-athlete and a coach to compete , that 's the worst thing you can do .
