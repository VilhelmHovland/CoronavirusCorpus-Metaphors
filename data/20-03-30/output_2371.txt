With consternation and an eye-popping , abominable lack of unity , Israel is dealing with an unprecedented crisis -- the coronavirus -- that consists of four crises intertwined one with another :  Health crisis : A worldwide pandemic is spreading rapidly from continent to continent , from country to country , carried from place to place by global connectivity .
Governmental crisis : After three rounds of elections , as I write this , Israel still does not have a government .
Two political blocs keep attacking each other like two exhausted boxers flailing away at the other 's sweaty body , neither with the ability to land the deciding blow .
Economic crisis : Israel 's economic train , bearing millions of anxious citizens , is hurtling downwards to an economic crisis the likes of which we have not witnessed since the recession at the time the country was founded .
Societal crisis : The political-governmental crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fear and anxiety are intentionally exploited , reflects the global trend of elevating the " I " at the expense of the " we .
"  The State of Israel has the knowledge and ability to deal with massive challenges and crises , and has done so since its founding -- from the War of Independence , to the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War , as well as many other trials along the way .
But the coronavirus crisis has one unique characteristic : There is no " Amalek .
"  In Jewish tradition , Amalek has been the code throughout the generations for our most implacable foes , whether the Amalekites who attacked the Israelites just after they left Egypt , Haman the Agagite in the Book of Esther , Hitler , or the arch-terrorist Arafat and all the rest of the Jew/Israel-haters .
We read about our mythic enemy every year on Shabbat Zachor ( " Shabbat Remember " ) when the Torah reader recites , " Remember what Amalek did to you .
" ( Deuteronomy 25:17 ) so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must defend ourselves .
We know who Amalek is : a demonic figure whom we should fear , fight , kill .
But at the same time , the image of an Amalek gives a concrete focus that religious , political , and other players can exploit for their own ends , an image that is used to unite us in the struggle against it .
But in this crisis we have no Amalek , only a tiny , invisible , Satanic virus .
So whom will we hate ? Whom will we blame ? Whom will we fear ? Whom will we call " the enemy " ?  Our world is changing drastically .
Today just about the only certainty is uncertainty .
But after 72 years during which we blamed the enemies in our neighbourhood for so many of our troubles , claiming that if not for them we would be living in a paradise , perhaps it is time we came to our senses .
During the coronavirus crisis , we are in the same boat as they are : the proliferation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangers the health of Israelis no less than its proliferation in Kfar Saba .
So as we need to find renewed strength to deal with these unprecedented crises -- governmental , economic , health , societal -- we can already learn one lesson from the coronavirus : Not all of our troubles can be blamed on Amalek .
