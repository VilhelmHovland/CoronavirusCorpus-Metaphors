The whites-only Afrikaner enclave in the Northern Cape acts as its own entity .
Turning its back on South Africa 's democratic project as apartheid came to an end , the clutch of citizens who still live in the town -- an estimated 2 000 to 3 000 -- still pay homage to the system that was labelled a " crime against humanity " .
The ' Little Giant ' statue which looks over Orania is taking no chances .
But where , exactly , do they stand on the current coronavirus crisis ? Are they following the rule of the land which engulfs and dwarfs their humble landscape , or do they simply follow their own advice ? Well , in contrast to certain other policies in Orania , it 's not actually that black and white .
Orania vs coronavirus -- how is the town dealing with it ?  We know that they are observing social distancing , and they 've been taking quarantine measures since the middle of March .
Local sewing groups have stitched together masks that people are being asked to wear during the coronavirus crisis .
They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they 're leaving nothing to chance in the face of a global pandemic .
There 's an abundance of masks here -- to the point where you can accessorise .
Not many people leave Orania , and even fewer visit .
Their base in the Northern Cape is one of the most remote in the land .
But , ' playing it safe ' is very much the mantra here .
They have even manufactured some of their own hand sanitizers , treating the gravity of the situation with the respect it deserves .
They have published their own set of hygiene guidelines , very similar to those issued by the South African government .
An emergency command centre -- made up of the town board -- provides regular updates on their preparedness to deal with coronavirus , and how the situation outside of their compound is developing .
Gawie Snyman , Ronald Bain , Harry Theron and Frans de Klerk are named as the information-givers .
Still a bit off with the social distancing , mind .
Those who have shut themselves away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps never thought the biggest battle of their lives would be related to germ warfare .
The communities within communities -- such as elderly care facilities -- also receive visits from singers and performers to lift their spirits during times of isolation .
Although there is no full lockdown , social restrictions are in place  Has there been a coronavirus case in Orania ? No , just a scare .
" Virtual braais " and radio-streamed concerts make up for the lack of open-air activities on offer to the inhabitants of Orania .
It has n't been all fun and games , though .
The idyllic image this settlement likes to portray -- against the backdrop of its controversial origins -- suffered a slight wobble last week .
A statement shared on the town 's official Facebook page stated that one resident of Orania was showing symptoms of coronavirus .
It 's claimed that they were privately tested while receiving medical treatment .
The test came back negative .
But the fear factor of COVID-19 remains in place .
An image showing a warehouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa 's most treasured commodoties by the pallet-full .
Indeed , this desperation to prove something to the rest of the country runs deep .
" The SAPS came to visit in Orania yesterday to check that everything is in order .
Thanks to Oranian 's discipline , they found nothing that upset them .
After the visit , Colonel Jooste said : ' Thank you to the residents of Hopetown and Orania for your obedience .
It goes bad in other towns and cities in the country .
I love you all and I do n't want you to die .
"  Life continues in the whites-only enclave  Work continues in the town : Binmen are seen wearing full hazmat suits and masks , whereas families are now learning how to cope with homeschooling .
Pieter Krige , a community leader in this enclave , posts a photo of his two children beavering away at their studies .
It still remains anyone 's guess as to when " normal life " resumes -- both within the gates of Orania and beyond -- despite our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as unusual for Orania 's grafters  A small world comes full circle  Social distancing has always been Orania 's " thing " -- but they are now faced with keeping themselves apart from each other , without having a say in the matter .
It 's not business as usual here , nor is it anywhere in the world .
And that 's perhaps a source of great humility for this unique , often-maligned town .
As much as Orania has tried to isolate itself , the world is too big of a place to stay shut-off from .
Society is n't exactly something you can opt in or out of .
The looming threat of coronavirus casts a shadow over this region , and although it may only strengthen their resolve to hunker down and keep themselves in exile , one fact is inescapable : The enemy is not , and never will be , your fellow South African .
