Royal Academy of Music : Fees will be due in the usual way  This message has gone out to students from the principal of the Royal Academy of Music , in London .
TO ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF Dear All , The COVID-19 emergency is causing financial hardship for millions of people in this country and elsewhere , students included .
I , along with other UK University leaders , will be talking with government about possible fee support measures , but I do not expect these discussions to reach a conclusion for some time .
In the meantime , a number of you are asking about fees for next term .
Along with the Principals of our sister Royal conservatoires , I 'm writing to you to outline our position .
Like almost all conservatories and universities around the world we are making the transition to digital learning because we believe this is the best way of ensuring continuity in your studies .
While this does create new challenges ( and all of us are on a learning curve ) , I am enormously grateful to teaching colleagues and students for the positive way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-line ' teaching costs the same as ' in-person ' teaching , along with almost all the activities and support provided for students ' learning .
This covers those aspects within the credited curriculum and those beyond it , such as the library , counselling services and other student services and pastoral and academic support , plus all our essential professional support services , like Registry , IT , Finance , Communications and HR .
All these departments are functioning as before , even if staff members are having to work from home , and some are actually carrying additional costs to support the required work .
All are working extraordinarily hard and with dedication to make sure that the forthcoming period of study is the best it can possibly be , in these highly unusual times .
We are also planning ahead for when we can return to the Academy 's buildings , and with plenty of projects to make up for lost time .
All of us wish we could be in different circumstances , delivering our learning and teaching in the way we do normally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't and , like all conservatories everywhere in the world , we must operate digitally .
We will do this the best we possibly can and defer only those elements of the curriculum we must .
The Registry will be writing to you later today regarding all aspects of assessment in the coming period .
For those students who pay by instalment , fees will be due in the usual way .
We ask as many of you as possible to pay on time , to make sure that the Academy can continue with its work .
It is only with tuition fees that the Academy can continue to operate .
If you will struggle to be able to pay your fees on time and need to revise your instalment plan , please contact fees@ram .
and we will help reschedule your fees .
We recognise that some students will have been relying on concerts , teaching and other work , both to pay their fees and to cover their living costs , and most of this work will have been cancelled .
This is a reminder about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- please email .
for an application form .
We know that some of you who live in various different types of student accommodation have had to return home .
We will be contacting you shortly to clarify arrangements and help where we can .
To be resilient and withstand this crisis we rely on the commitment of our wonderful staff and our incredibly talented students , who display all the best qualities of our communities : flexibility , teamwork , creativity and innovation in all circumstances .
We need the Academy to be resilient -- for you and for the future of the arts .
Coming full circle from my opening paragraph , the Minister of State for Universities has told us that the UK Government is looking at all potential avenues for supporting students through this challenging time .
In light of the government 's recent announcements about helping employees and self-employed workers , we hope that a package to help students will follow .
We will welcome any such move from the British Government , and will update you as soon as we have news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Principal 27/3/20  If I were in these students ' shoes nowadays , I would strongly consider putting my degree on hold for a while and seek private instruction at probably a tiny fraction of the cost .
There are probably many private teachers in London -- all over the world , in fact -- currently offering remote teaching for a much more affordable price than the cost of tuition at one of these schools where unnecessary fees are charged for things one often does n't even use .
Remember , if you plan for a career in an orchestra , as a soloist , or as a chamber musician , that no one cares on audition panels where you studied .
In fact they do n't even know where you studied : they only know you by a number , playing more often than not behind a screen .
They only care about one thing : how well you play .
It does n't matter one bit where your degree came from -- in fact it does n't even matter if you have a degree altogether .
I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree might be more of a requirement , but I 'm not sure what the world will look like after this difficult time ends .
Focus on your playing , find a good teacher twice a month online and keep motivated -- the last part might actually be the biggest challenge right now .
And , if you can , acquire non-musical skills that may be very helpful to have in the new world awaiting us .
Not entirely true that no one cares where you studied .
They all want a resume with your application , and you 'll frequently see language like " the orchestra reserves the right to reject any applicants not meeting the highest standards .
"  The highest standards are often determined in the first 30 seconds of your audition , not by looking at a resume .
That 's really all one needs in order to gauge what kind of player they are hearing .
Having studied with a recognized teacher , even privately , may make a small difference on one 's resume , but even then it 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have studied with .
It may not be glamorous to say so , but the harsh reality of the music profession is that degrees are mostly worthless unless you want to go into teaching , and it remains to be seen what kind of teaching opportunities will be left after this .
There are tons of musicians graduating from music schools who will either never get a regular job in music or will somehow muster enough entrepreneurship skills in order to create their own opportunities , and no one will care then where they might have graduated .
It was already an incredibly difficult and saturated field before , I shudder to imagine what the music profession will look like a couple of years from now .
I encourage young musicians to seriously consider acquiring non-musical skills that may remain marketable in any economic environment .
Being a musician , except for a very few who are extraordinarily talented , is going to become an extremely precarious proposition .
Having been the subject of audition panels during the last 40 years , and having sat ON audition panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you can perform ( play or sing in the case of musicians ) that is all most audition panels listen for -- they really DO N'T give much credence to what paperwork you may or may not have .
The missive of the Principal of The Royal Academy of Music is an inappropriate and inadequate response to an international catastrophe .
The Royal Academy is a wealthy institution with ? 171m of Reserves indicated in its latest published Accounts .
It also made a surplus of ? 13m in the same Accounts .
A term 's tuition fees are approximately ? 4m , which would make a minor dent in the Reserves ( reason why companies/institutions have Reserves ) .
But the shortfall could be offset by using the Chancellor 's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme for the non-public funding element of staffing cost .
The Principal protesteth too much -- now is the time to show empathy , understanding and compassion .
