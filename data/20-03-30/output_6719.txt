@ @ J .
Warner Wallace responds to a common objection to the Resurrection of Jesus : If Jesus did n't actually die on the cross , the Resurrection could be explained as a simple resuscitation .
Are there good evidential reasons to believe Jesus died on the cross ? J .
Warner examines some hidden biological evidence in the Gospel of John and describes the reason why those who buried Jesus were n't mistaken about his death .
The more I learned about the nature of death , the more convinced I became that Jesus really died on the cross .
Whatever I may have thought about the claims related to the Resurrection -- the empty tomb or the committed testimony of the eyewitnesses -- one thing was sure : The Resurrection of Jesus was not a resuscitation .
Why do you think some skeptics claim Jesus never died on the cross ? .
