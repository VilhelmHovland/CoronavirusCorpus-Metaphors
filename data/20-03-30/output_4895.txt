How To Adapt Your Digital Marketing In Times Of Uncertainty  In this guest post , Becky Cheseldine , Head of Biddable at Yoghurt Digital , provides insights on how to adapt your marketing in times of uncertainty .
If you had asked me three months ago if I was prepared for a global crisis , I would have confidently said yes .
But this pandemic has been more disruptive than I ever imagined .
It invaded our lives with very little warning , causing borders and businesses to close , and a quarter of the world 's population to be confined to their homes .
With business as usual officially out the window , the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us all to rethink how we approach our work .
It 's an unnerving time for both markets and brands , and the most unsettling thing is that there 's no precedent to follow .
No " best practices .
" But before we get whiplash from pivoting too much , we can -- and should -- make educated guesses based on the information we have right now .
While there 's no master plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like COVID-19 , I believe there are a few grounding principles that will give your brand the best chance of succeeding during this crisis -- or at the very least weathering the storm .
Follow the data ( even if it 's limited )  Working in biddable media , we have access to a wealth of data and human behaviour insights , and I 've always been proud of my ability to leverage those insights to improve consumer engagement , drive performance and increase conversions .
Thanks to the COVID-19 , I may not be able to forecast as far into the future -- but I will still be relying on data to drive my strategy .
Why ? Because data does n't lie .
It 's easy to assume how customer behaviour will change when the market shifts , but you need the data to back it up .
And even though we 've only been dealing with the pandemic for a few weeks , there 's already plenty of data to analyse .
Here are just a few examples :  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting at an all-time high according to Nielsen .
Experts say we 're a few weeks behind America in terms of the spread of the virus , so there 's a good chance Aussies will soon be clocking around 12 hours a day on streaming services while they 're in lockdown .
Messaging , voice calling and video calling has risen by more than 50% over the last month , says Facebook -- which means people are spending more time on social and communication apps .
The key is to keep a close eye on all of your channels and monitor any changes in demand .
Then , shift your strategy and reallocate your budget accordingly so you can stay connected to your customers during the crisis .
Your job is to be nimble and use the data to your advantage .
Worried about a drop in efficiency ? Set clear ROAS/ROI/CPA targets with your agency and establish the point where activity is no longer driving the results you need so you can pivot rapidly .
Be prepared to pivot  Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Treat this time as a creative challenge .
At my agency , we 're pivoting , too .
For example , with most of our clients we actively remove mobile apps from campaigns because a ) the creative is n't suitable or b ) the results have been historically poor .
However , we know that if one sector is going to get a boost from everyone being stuck at home , it 's mobile apps .
So , we 're rethinking our approach to creativity .
We 're testing heavily .
We 're experimenting with new strategies and channels , throwing out tightly-held beliefs that wo n't serve us well in the current landscape .
Sticking to the status quo wo n't give you the room you need to navigate through a time where the ground we 're standing on is seemingly shifting daily .
Can you do the same ?  As a brand , you might also be pivoting towards new audiences .
Let 's look at retail , for example .
Shops are closed with no end date in sight , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In fact , 74% of customers are purchasing online at the same rate as two weeks ago , with 1 in 3 reducing in-store shopping , according to Kantar .
By adjusting your business model to focus on online , you 'll be setting your brand up for the foreseeable future .
Boost your content production  With lockdowns in place around the world , internet use has exploded .
This presents a great opportunity for brands , so think of ways to get in front of your audience and give them what they want .
Depending on your brand and what you sell , you may need to change up your messaging a little so as not to be insensitive .
Now might not be the best time to push heavy sales messaging , but offering your customers exclusive discounts or some light relief in the content you share , they wo n't forget it .
You might also consider a shift to social messaging , where you tell your customers how you 're " doing your bit " to help .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately engage with their customer base over this period are the brands that will still have one when this passes .
While it 's tempting to schedule a ton of ads , audiences can get bored easily -- especially if they 're scrolling or streaming all day long .
Track your frequencies across ad sets and make it a priority to plan fresh and tailored creative to avoid repetitive ads .
People may be spending more time at home consuming content , but their standards of personalisation wo n't slip .
With ad variations in play , you have a better chance of capturing and keeping your audience 's attention .
Plan for the short and long term  Some brands are quick to panic when numbers start to drop , but hasty decisions can have a detrimental impact on your bottom line .
A study that reviewed the effect of marketing during and after recessions found that businesses recorded a -0 .
drop in profitability when they cut marketing during downturns , while those that ramped up their marketing came out with a +4 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do n't stop marketing .
In the short-term , look at your advertising funnel and assign clear goals and KPI targets for each individual channel .
This will give you a good benchmark to work towards and help you spot any red flags ahead of time .
Just remember that each channel serves a different objective in the conversion funnel , so be realistic when setting your goals .
For example , setting a high ROI target for your display prospecting activity will lead to disappointment since that 's not what that channel is meant for .
When you 're done with your short-term strategy , consider opportunities outside the next four weeks .
If you 're dealing with low stock levels or demand , you can still make changes that will benefit your business long-term .
When this health crisis passes -- and it will pass -- consumers will resume buying and competition will once again be high .
Use this downtime to your advantage , so you 'll be ready and raring to go when everything goes back to normal .
You could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll out your content strategy , or fix the technical SEO issues that have been pushed down the priority list .
Think opportunities , not setbacks  There 's no roadmap right now , and it 's hard not to get caught up in the news when it 's painting a grim picture .
But you got into the industry to be innovative , so let that drive you and focus on what you can do , not what you ca n't .
