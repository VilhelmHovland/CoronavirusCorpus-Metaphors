Aid sought for Malaysian artistes affected by Covid-19 pandemic  Persatuan Karyawan Malaysia hopes there will be some form of assistance from the government for the working people in the entertainment industry , as their livelihood has been put on hold due to the spread of Covid-19 .
He said : " We hope the government could work out a compensation package for out-of-work artistes , similar to what has been offered to workers who have been forced to take leave without pay , which is a government aid package of RM600 per month per individual for as long as the premises remain closed .
" This assistance will be timely as it will help them meet their costs of living and continue with their lives , at least on a moderate basis .
"  He concluded : " We hope the government will give full consideration to our request to alleviate the suffering faced by our artistes in these difficult times .
