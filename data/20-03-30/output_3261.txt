Governments , central banks and the WHO will not defeat coronavirus alone ; the private sector must play a key role .
As companies respond to COVID-19 , business leaders who back moral statements with practical action will stand out .
Protecting employees and redeploying their unique capabilities to meet society 's immediate needs could build more loyal workforces and public goodwill while helping to fight a global crisis .
The many layers to the COVID-19 crisis are unfolding in front of our eyes .
Our political leaders , financial institutions and global governance structures are being severely tested .
Their job is made all the harder by low levels of public trust and broken social contracts in many parts of the world .
Many countries are bracing themselves should their health services buckle as services have in those countries already badly affected .
Despite the many wonderful acts of charity being witnessed in communities in lockdown , we know imminent hardship will take a toll on social cohesion .
As the limits on our go-to crisis-management tools become clear , it is increasingly apparent that we need the private sector to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House has asked Walmart and others to help with drive-thru testing and Downing Street wants manufacturers to shift production lines to building ventilators .
Governments , central banks and the WHO will not defeat this disease alone .
Responsible capitalism , which seeks to move corporate culture beyond shareholder primacy , now faces its biggest test yet .
Today 's CEOs are knee-deep in invidious choices as they attempt to absorb losses , steady cash flow and balance the competing needs of their investors , customers , staff and suppliers .
There are no firm answers , just best judgements and countless unknowns over supply chains , volatile markets and the impact of travel bans and social distancing .
It will be impossible to keep everyone happy .

In recent years we have seen that employees and consumers increasingly reward businesses that use their powers for good .
Companies which uphold clear values to advance a bigger societal mission regularly exhibit stronger financial performance .
We saw this clearly at Unilever during my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our business model delivered a 300% shareholder return .
As companies respond to coronavirus , false virtuousness will be easy to spot .
Business leaders who back moral statements with practical action will stand out .
Firstly , some businesses can redeploy their unique capabilities to meet society 's immediate needs .
Think war-time effort : Luxury goods giant LVMH is producing hand sanitizer in its perfume factories , for use in French hospitals ; Johnson &amp; Johnson has donated a million surgical masks to Chinese health workers ; IKEA is helping to kit-out hospitals in affected areas .
These acts will not be forgotten by their recipients and will build goodwill among the wider public for a long time to come .
Secondly , responsible firms will do everything possible to protect their people , meaning employees , customers and supply chains .
Promoting health and safety is priority number one ; next is trying to mitigate the financial impact , especially for staff on precarious contracts .
Microsoft has agreed to keep paying regular wages to the hourly workers who support their campus , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hardship fund for employees facing difficulties as a result of the virus .
Others are following suit , some by initiating paid sick leave .
While governments can and must provide support to families , it is foolish to hope that overstretched national exchequers can do all the heavy lifting .
If our societies are to emerge from the turmoil as strong as possible , it will be essential for businesses to do their bit .

It is always tempting to ensure your investors get paid first .
But long-sighted firms who balance this demand by providing real help to other groups will see immense benefits in the months and years ahead .
These companies will build more resilient and more loyal workforces , better positioned to weather a prolonged economic storm .
All but the hardest-hit large firms should be able to protect vulnerable workers through dedicated schemes and guaranteed minimum income , including those people unable to perform their duties because of sickness or through no fault of their own .
Doing everything possible to insulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only ethically right but is in companies ' enlightened self-interest .
The fewer businesses that go to the wall , the better for the overall health of the economy and our eventual recovery .
None of this is revolutionary .
The last decade has seen a growing movement towards longer-term , multistakeholder business models .
And it 's obvious that most businesses ca n't thrive in faltering economies .
But do n't underestimate the siege mentality that will be gripping many boardrooms and the powerful instinct to protect profits , even if compassion and humanity are the cost .
The greatest business leaders will , by contrast , play a longer game to serve the societies which host them in this moment of great need , offering people security and stability as an antidote to panic and fear .
Employees above all will expect this .
This extraordinary and overwhelming crisis demands more of our top executives as they help lead our response .
The best will advance the interests of others knowing that it makes us all better off .

For C-suites everywhere , that time is now .
