It 's been a lazy morning , a rare day in my hectic life .
We are only days into the three-week lockdown in India and the gravity of the worldwide havoc created by the COVID-19 virus is deeply concerning .
We are staring at an uncertain future and against an unknown enemy .
The lessons I learnt from cricket are very relevant now .
As the situation demands , we have to take fresh guard , read the pitch , manage the swing and bounce and above all , be circumspect .
Those words we 've heard a million times -- application and temperament -- are really the key in life too .
Nobody wants to give his wicket away !  For me and my family , our lives are in reboot mode and believe me , it 's one of the best phases we have had at home together .
From Arjun , the youngest member in the family at 20 , to my mother , who is 83 , we are witnessing how one reacts to a situation variably as per one 's age .
We all have different tastes and choices but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptability .
Collectively , we must really think for each other -- for India 's 1 .
billion people , and for our global community at large .
There is no pressure of meetings and stepping out of home is an absolute no-no .
Sleeping well , going to the gym , a leisurely breakfast , a lunch of my choice and then it 's time for some family entertainment .
My mother must be the happiest seeing her son and grandchildren away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life .
As a family , we are doing those simple things -- watching TV serials , playing games and eating together -- things that we otherwise tend to miss quite regularly .
As I said , ' accept ' and ' adapt ' .
that works whether it 's a hard top at Perth or a crumbling fifth-day Nagpur pitch , or life .
The better we accept this situation and follow the simple do 's and don'ts , the faster we combat the fear factor , and higher the chance that we survive .
and thrive .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sterner reappraisal of our playing style itself ! As a family , we have accepted that Coronavirus is a challenge to humankind and we need to revisit the whole way we lead our lives .
What 's good ? For one , it 's quite incredible to see the whole world united against a common foe .
And what 's not ? Well , when a few people callously flout the basic precautions , I find it very disturbing .
Clearly , it 's a matter of discipline and trusting the information shared by credible health organisations .
I have been saying these in my messages for UNICEF , so do guard against fake news ! And play within yourself .
For me , this has been the time to introspect and plan ahead .
I feel a person who utilises this time properly will always be a step ahead of the other person who thinks he has nothing to do at home .
The Doctor Is ' In '  What better than having a doctor wife at home in this hour of need ! Anjali has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep ourselves sanitised .
This includes the people who help us at home .
We have stopped guests at home -- for one thing , it 's not allowed ; and with my mother being at a vulnerable age , we are extremely careful about who 's meeting her .
I am glad our children have grasped the challenges and are doing their bit by making our lives easier at home .
A lockdown can be quite challenging for young girls and boys but both Sara and Arjun have understood the repercussions of what a wrong step could mean .
As parents , we have tried to keep them mentally stimulated and that means spending a lot of quality time together , going to the gym with each other , eating home-cooked food , watching the TV serials and movies we love and , of course , music .
Of Varan-Bhaat and Bharta  I have tried testing my cooking skills a bit , but here too I tend to play in the ' V ' ! Which means sticking to the basics and having simple , normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish ) is my favourite , so also varan-bhaat ( a Marathi dish consisting of lentils and white rice ) .
A bit of chicken adds to the spread , like that four off the last ball .
We are foodies at home but there is so much sense in eating basic stuff .
It is distressing to hear of the conditions out there , with lots of people not getting even basic food or ration .
Pink Floyd se Panga .
We have been watching the latest serials and movies on TV .
We enjoyed the series Special Ops that showed how our security agencies use intelligence to combat terror and keep us safe .
We also saw Panga , the Kangana Ranaut-starring sports movie on the life of a kabaddi player .
Also Good News , Chhapaak -- and among series , Truth Be Told , and Formula 1 : Drive to Survive Season 2 .
Knowing my love for cars , Anjali has also recommended a few documentary series on Formula One and I ca n't wait to watch them .
But what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a music freak and I have enjoyed a lot from the ' 70s onwards .
Generally , I can enjoy any good music .
I may be listening to a Hindi song one minute , but five minutes later it could be a Spanish one .
We are also enjoying plenty of unplugged versions on YouTube .
Pink Floyd has been simply awesome .
So also Coldplay , Dire Straits and U2 , and any number of Hindi singers .
But the children love modern songs and here too we have to show our sense of adaptability in accommodating their choices !  Rain Stops Play  Finally , I must appreciate the call taken by the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Tokyo Olympics in July-August .
I wo n't be surprised if the IPL is deferred too .
These are challenging times and rescheduling sporting events or cancelling them outright is the right way forward .
We ca n't afford to lose any more lives .
We already have lost many .
There are solutions for all other sorts of challenges but death is an irreparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times by maintaining social distancing but emotionally , we must be together .
I have been part of a World Cup-winning team in 2011 , when we fulfilled the dreams of a billion people and I know what adulation means .
But when I think of the hundreds of health workers and other personnel who are confronting the COVID-19 virus by putting their lives at risk , I feel their levels of achievement and commitment are immeasurable .
They are our real-world champions .
Let us all do our bit and ensure that their efforts do not go waste .
A Credo for the Corona Age  Sport , they say , is a great leveller , cuts across boundaries and knows no caste , colour or creed .
The script you are handed in sport is always an open one , and it 's never perfect .
The more one reflects on it , the more I see parallels with life .
This virus too has been a true leveller .
It has affected all of humankind , no matter what your status is .
While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side .
It offers us a chance , like a difficult pitch , to unmask our deficiencies -- including a lot of our prejudices and beliefs .
Also , it gives us time to introspect and look at humanity 's effect on our planet as a whole .
How , in the middle of it all , nature has found space and time to breathe and heal .
For now , it 's stumps , folks ! We are all together in this challenging match .
Let 's follow all the precautionary measures shared by the authorities .
Let 's pad up and wear our guards and helmets .
We will come out of it stronger .
