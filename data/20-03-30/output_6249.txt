Corona lockdown silence reminds Joy Bimal Roy of the time he helped a colleague to safety during Mumbai riots  Design maven and son of legendary filmmaker Bimal Roy , Joy Bimal Roy recently shared his experience triggered by the silence in these times of COVID 19 .
His old memory is linked to the aftermath of the 1992 riots in Mumbai .
He recalls the Saturday he and colleague Sunil Lulla were in their BKC office when he received a call .
" There was a hysterical voice at the other end .
It was Najma Merchant , our Recording Officer .
She was quite incoherent , but when she finally calmed down a little , l understood the cause for her hysteria .
She was Muslim , but lived in a predominantly Hindu area in Andheri .
She was single , and lived alone .
Her home had been surrounded by men who were threatening to break open her door , and drag her out .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was palpable .
She begged me to come and save her .
"  " I am not a particularly courageous person and nor am l a macho stud , " he narrates .
" Somehow l could n't picture myself to be a gallant knight in shining armour charging in to the rescue Najma , who though in distress hardly qualified as a damsel .
But I could n't let her down .
Sunil promptly volunteered to accompany me .
I was most relieved to have his company , because l was not looking forward to this Mission Impossible .
"  The two drove off in his ramshackle Ambassador barely exchanging a word , wrapped up in their own thoughts .
" It was not difficult to find Najma 's place even though it was in a narrow cul de sac , because there was a group of menacing looking men armed with lathis , blocking the front door of her ground floor flat shouting slogans at the top of their voices .
Our arrival caused a bit of a stir , because it was completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men automatically moved aside for us to pass through .
I think they were so taken aback to see us , that they were at a loss to know how to react .
We took advantage of their momentary confusion and reached her door without having to utter a sound .
Najma was so scared to come out , that Sunil and l had to almost pull her out of the door .
By now the men had stopped shouting and stood around in sullen silence .
The three of us walked through the phalanx without making eye contact with any of the men .
They let us pass without even a murmur of protest ( when l look back now , l wonder why ) and we continued to walk to the car at a steady pace without a backward glance .
It was the longest couple of minutes in my life .
I kept thinking the men were going to stop us , but l did n't dare to look back , in case it was considered to be a hostile move .
We finally reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the main road .
Najma was weeping quietly , more out of relief than fear .
We did n't want to trigger off another panic attack by questioning her about it .
"  It was only after they got back to the office that realisation dawned that Najma 's was not a stray incident ; there were riots all over Bombay .
" Just as well we had n't heard about the riots before leaving , or we may never have gone , " he quips .
The silence in these times of Corona lockdown and the silence of those men that day are worlds apart , he muses .
" One can not compare the two with each other .
