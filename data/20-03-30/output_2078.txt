Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz speaksk during a press conference in Ottawa on March 18 , 2020 .
Justin Tang/The Canadian Press  In normal times , tracking the Bank of Canada pretty much begins and ends with subtle shifts in interest-rate policy .
These are far from normal times .
Over the past two weeks , the Bank of Canada has introduced a dizzying set of financial-market instruments to which we would n't normally give a second thought .
Forget ( for the moment , anyway ) about the target for the overnight rate .
Meet your new friends : term repos , bankers ' acceptances , Canada Mortgage Bonds and U .
dollar swaps .
Story continues below advertisement  The Bank of Canada helpfully took a little break this week from its rapid-fire announcements of arcane financial-market supports to publish on its website a short guide to everything it is doing in the fight against COVID-19 , and why .
The bank -- to the surprise of many -- held off further rate reductions after an emergency cut of its benchmark overnight rate target three weeks ago .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddling that our central-banking ducks are doing beneath the surface .
It all boils down to making sure problems in the system related to liquidity -- essentially , the ability to quickly and efficiently move in and out of holdings in securities -- do n't morph into more serious credit problems .
At a time when access to credit is seen as the critical bridge to get families and businesses over widespread shutdowns of their usual sources of income , and when there are urgent demands on banks and governments to deliver funds , a seizing-up of the markets essential to the credit system could make a bad situation much worse .
" The central bank must therefore intervene to prevent a sudden contraction of credit when credit is most needed , " the bank said in its guide .
" If Canadians ca n't borrow to weather this economic storm , the impact on the economy would be worse , the recovery will take longer and there will be long-lasting damage to Canada 's productive capacity .
"  It 's a useful metaphor to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " plumbing " of the financial system -- not only because it 's usually out of sight and taken for granted , but more importantly right now , because it 's a finite pipe through which money flows .
You try to jam too much through it all at once , it gets clogged .
The liquidity problems that have surfaced in funding markets -- basically , the markets that serve as de facto credit cards for companies , banks and governments as they conduct their day-to-day and month-to-month business -- stem from a sudden and enormous surge in the need to access credit and raise cash , in light of the unprecedented pressures stemming from COVID-19 .
A rush to tap into credit lines , and to liquidate holdings to raise emergency cash , has overloaded the pipes .
So the Bank of Canada is stepping in on several levels to act as plumber -- and has indicated that it is prepared to do more as needed .
The bank has introduced a program to buy bankers ' acceptances , a crucial funding market for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond ( CMB ) program to purchase bonds that financial institutions use to fund residential mortgage lending and renewals .
It introduced the Provincial Money Market Purchase program to help keep provincial governments ' short-term credit needs running smoothly .
For financial institutions , it has loosened collateral requirements on borrowing from the Bank of Canada and launched a new standing term liquidity facility , to help the banks themselves deal with short-term stresses and keep their lending taps open for their customers .
And at the very top of the market 's food chain , the central bank has expanded its program of buying Government of Canada bonds -- which , as a benchmark for the bond market , are at the core of maintaining the stability of the entire system .
In many ways , the Bank of Canada has been preparing for these sorts of actions for years -- taking lessons from the the 2008 financial crisis to develop a game plan to put to work when the next big shock threatened to tie up market liquidity .
The central bank is much better prepared than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shore up market liquidity show it .
Story continues below advertisement  Similarly , the bank has also done the research to hone a set of still-unused tools in its monetary policy toolbox to further ease interest-rate conditions -- things such as forward guidance , quantitative easing and negative rates all remain options to drive down borrowing costs .
But the bank has signalled pretty clearly over the past couple of weeks that its liquidity actions are prerequisite to further moves on rate policy .
Making credit cheaper does n't do much good if the system for delivering it is broken .
First things first .
