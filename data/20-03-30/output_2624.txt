OTTAWA - Canada 's central bank made yet another unscheduled rate cut Friday to bring its key interest target down to a crisis-level low , and the federal government upped its financial lifeline to businesses in a two-pronged effort to further combat the economic shock from COVID-19 .
It was the double shock from the novel coronavirus and a sharp drop in oil prices that spurred the Bank of Canada 's surprise announcement - its second unscheduled cut this month and third overall this month - to lower its rate by half a percentage point to 0 .
per cent after it started the month at 1 .
per cent .
The interest rate cut takes the key rate to what the central bank referred to as " its effective lower bound " or the lowest level that rates can be set , although they alone may not spur economic activity because workers are being asked to stay home .
Governor Stephen Poloz said there are still tools left in the central bank 's kit , but it was trying to do everything it can right now to deal with deep economic shock .
" A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Poloz said .
" We want to make sure that we 've got a great market function and indeed that the economy has a great foundation for growth when activity resumes .
"  Economists had expected the Bank of Canada to cut rates at its next scheduled announcement in the middle of April , but it needed to react to the extent of the economic damage to date to bring rates to " crisis-level lows , " said Benjamin Reitzes , director of Canadian rates at BMO .
Brett House , Scotiabank 's deputy chief economist , said the only reason the bank did n't move sooner was because the previous cut had n't trickled its way through the system and brought borrowing costs down .
What helped was a series of financing programs over the last week , he said , including two new ones that could be described as quantitative easing .
One of the new programs announced Friday will aim to alleviate strains in short-term funding markets , while the other will see the central bank begin acquiring federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion per week .
Not long after Poloz spoke , the federal government announced it was upping its proposed wage subsidy for businesses to 75 per cent .
A broad swath of business and labour groups had criticized the original proposal of a 10 per cent subsidy for falling well short of what was needed to avoid mass layoffs .
The United Steelworkers welcomed the change , but noted the subsidy needed to be available to all employers and workers who need it .
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said that backdating the subsidy to March 15 will allow some small businesses that have had to lay off staff rehire them quickly .
As one example , the wage subsidy may let financial technology startup Borrowell Inc .
keep all 80 of its employees , said chief executive Andrew Graham .
Canadians will get a better picture of the employment situation early next month when Statistics Canada releases its monthly labour force survey .
Chief statistician Anil Arora issued a plea Friday for more companies to respond in multiple cities , including Toronto and Vancouver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation .
"  The Liberals said they are also working with banks to provide loans of up to $40,000 for small businesses .
They will be interest-free for the first year and up to $10,000 could be waived for repayment if the loan is paid off by Dec .
31 , 2022 .
Speaking outside his Ottawa residence , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government needs to hammer out the details of the proposal , which he hoped to provide by Monday .
Asked about paying for the measures , the prime minister said the government would provide a full costing to Parliament of what he called " unprecedented investments in the economy , " but did n't say when details would be public .
He added that the spending was necessary to " get through these coming months of restricted economic activity .
"  The moves add to the value of the bailout package to date to more than $200 billion , including $52 billion in direct spending , $85 billion in tax deferrals for individuals and businesses , and $65 billion in loans .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost to the wage subsidy could add $25 billion in direct spending to the total .
During an afternoon press conference alongside Poloz , Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government has n't put a cap on what it might need to spend to bridge the economic storm .
" We 're going to do whatever it takes to support Canadians , " Morneau said .
" We 're always going to responsibly look at what these programs cost , but that is not the key issue right now .
We 've got literally millions of people who are worried about whether they 're going to have the money to support their families in the coming weeks .
"  Parliament 's budget watchdog said in a report Friday that the government has fiscal room to spend more , particularly with rates as low as they are .
The report from budget officer Yves Giroux , which paints one possible scenario for the Canadian economy from a six-month downturn , suggested the federal deficit for the coming fiscal year could be $112 .
billion - a jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't include extra spending the Liberals announced this week to provide a $2,000-a-month benefit , for up to four months , to Canadians whose income dries up due to COVID-19 .
Nor does it include the money the Liberals will now spend on the increased wage subsidy .
An RBC report earlier this week suggested that a $200-billion deficit may not be out of the real of possibility , depending on the depth and duration of the downturn .
