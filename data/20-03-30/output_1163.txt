Leaving Las Vegas .
for good ? IT industry conference circuit wo n't look the same on other side of COVID-19 pandemic  O'Reilly has quit the events game , and it might not be the only one  Comment You 've been there , done that and you quite literally have the T-shirt .
Love them or loathe them , IT conferences are a feature of industry life .
My first was CA World in New Orleans in 1998 .
In front of an audience of thousands , then Computer Associates CEO Charles Wang wandered across the stage pontificating as a chorus of children danced about him ( no , really ) and I knew I had indeed entered a whole new world of weird .
But is that world about to come to an end ? Some think so .
Earlier this week Laura Baldwin , president of IT education and conferences company O'Reilly , announced plans to permanently end mass face-to-face events .
Restrictions around COVID-19 had forced the conference online , and O'Reilly , for one , was not about to turn back .
" Without understanding when this global health emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for or execute on a business that will be forever changed as a result of this crisis , " she said .
" With large technology vendors moving their events completely on-line , we believe the stage is set for a new normal moving forward when it comes to in-person events .
We also know we are poised to accept that challenge .
"  At the end of last week , SAP threw in the towel on its Sapphire Now and ASUG Annual Conference : saying that the 2020 in-person event would " become digital experiences " , while just days before , Google said its May I/O 2020 event , normally used for announcements relating to Android and other products , was cancelled completely , with product announcements to be emitted via blog .
But maybe O'Reilly is different .
It sells books , videos , conference talks , interactive coding environments , custom training , and online events .
It is not in the multibillion-dollar software business , per se .
Those companies invest huge sums in conferences to press the flesh with customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was set to have 4,500 exhibitors , 2 .
million square feet of space , and 180,000 attendees .
Oracle OpenWorld San Francisco attracted some 60,000 visitors , and SAP Sapphire saw 30,000 people attend .
For these companies , IT conferences are not about helping users learn .
They are about selling more product to a captive market .
And that does n't just mean enduring the keynote sound system booming the audience into an impersonation of enthusiasm at 8am as a CEO bounces onto the stage to declare a golden dawn in their computing dynasty .
It 's not about sleeping through the 4 .
breakout session addressing the intricacies of data transformation in R .
It 's about knowing which vendor is doling out free beer and turning up at the exhibition stand before it runs dry .
It 's about the fun , the food and the meeting of minds .
" There 's a serendipity factor at in-person events that virtual events just ca n't offer .
Hallway meetings , finding that obscure booth in the back corner that has exactly what you need , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another said : " Folks REALLY like Vegas .
"  But perhaps it is time to change .
" People have been asking for years why companies fly all over the planet for events , meetings etc .
when video conferencing etc .
exists , " another correspondent said .
" This crisis might just force the old habits to stop when they SEE it 's unnecessary and money can be saved .
"  And money is what may settle the issue .
Undoubtedly , many conferences will be pushed online for the remainder of the year .
Sales will be down and IT companies will blame COVID-19 for the depressed state of the market .
When the market bounces back , vendors will get a visceral sense they are missing out on sales , and conferences will be back .
But they will be smaller , fewer and cause less environmental damage .
And that 's a good thing .
Perhaps it 's time to let what happened in Vegas stay in Vegas .
