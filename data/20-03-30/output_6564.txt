Kim Brown : Welcome to The Real News .
I 'm Kim Brown .
The COVID-19 pandemic is undoubtedly honing a very serious public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis as well .
A new policy brief by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia or ESCWA focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Arab region of the Middle East where many countries dependent heavily on oil revenue and also have a highly stratified economic system with little or no social safety net .
Now the policy brief predicts a loss of about 40% GDP as a result of the pandemic in the loss of at the very least 1 .
million jobs .
In other words , a economic disaster plunging millions into poverty .
Eamon Tomi 00:00:56 has a flower shop in Beirut , Lebanon , and she was given a special dispensation to open her store for Mother 's Day .
Let 's have a listen from her .
Eamon Tomi : There 's no comparison between Mother 's Day this year and last year .
Most people are n't going out because of coronavirus fears even though we have taken precautions .
We have sanitized the shop and are offering delivery services .
We put out ads so people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will start delivering and that we will disinfect the flowers but despite it all people are afraid of any contact .
Kim Brown : Today we are joined with Niranjan Sarangi .
He is a macroeconomic and fiscal policy expert at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ( UN ESCWA ) he joins us today from Lebanon .
Niranjan , thank you so much for joining us .
Niranjan Sarangi : Thank you .
It is my pleasure .
Kim Brown : If you could please tell us what makes the Arab region specifically vulnerable to the economic consequences of the measures to prevent the pandemic that are happening right now ?  Niranjan Sarangi : Yes , it 's a very , very important issue for the region because the whole Arab region has been facing crisis for a long time .
I mean in terms of growth , so almost the last decades is a decade of loss .
In our previous publication on fiscal policy review , we have shown how the region has faced a decade of loss in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some parts of the country , the oil prices fluctuations , plus several other protests and challenges that several countries have faced .
Altogether , it has been facing that kind of crisis due to both internal and external challenges .
On top of it , this health crisis , which is the global pandemic fall on it .
It is at the time when .
so the challenge is compounded for the region particularly because many countries in the region are also at a high debt stress .
They 're on a fiscal pressure .
Our debt to GDP is very high in several countries that are already feeling the pressure of debts who are raising .
Growth , as I mentioned that it is stagnating or going down .
There are demands , but there are aspirations of people that has to be met .
When governments are already under pressure , the global pandemic is causing a more compounding pressure on them and some of the countries really are very much vulnerable how to address this challenge both financially and technically .
As it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has been its impact in the past a few days and months as a preliminary estimate .
We found that the region 's estimate has gone down .
I mean in fact only if we assume that by the same rate as the global growth is going down , then the region has lost almost $42 billion of GDP .
Then number two , we counted its impact on employment rather unemployment , I would say .
The region is losing something like 1 .
million jobs .
It 's a 1 .
point increase in unemployment rate .
Kim Brown : The ESCWA policy brief talks about the Arab region as a whole , but I was wondering if you could be a little bit more country specific as to where this economic impact is being more strongly felt .
For example , Egypt has a population of 100 million .
It 's already been plagued with overcrowded schools and issues with food and security .
However , on the other hand , some of the Gulf States are among the richest in the world and they absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more heavily dependent on oil revenues .
Where are we going to see this loss of jobs and loss of GDP ? What countries will this be concentrated in ?  Niranjan Sarangi : Okay , that 's a very important question .
Actually we did the estimate for the whole region and the region constitutes 22 countries and it 's very diverse .
As you mentioned , one party 's oil rich , all resources dependent or one part it 's middle income countries are not that are significant number of countries also who are least developed countries .
The crisis is going to impact differently to different countries .
We did not do any specific countries , specific estimates at this point because of lack of evidence from the country level , but the pandemic is going to impact more in the middle income countries for example , the jobs because the service sector is heavily impacted in this global pandemic because of social distancing particularly .
The countries that are more dependent on service sector are going to be hard hit .
The countries that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low income countries of the region who have the informal sector is higher , they are going to be more affected .
The jobs will be more affected there .
Similarly , these countries are also depending on remittances .
If the Gulf is not doing well if the oil prices is going down , then remittance 's flow is also going to go down .
Obviously the challenge compounds as I mentioned .
On the other hand , in the oil rich countries , the Gulf countries where the economic activities are depended on oil revenues more or less .
What I 'd seen the oil prices have gone down systematically since the outbreak of the pandemic .
In recent month , I mean in recent days , in March particularly , it is compounded the market pressure and that led for the price competition and the market share competition .
That has led to collapse of the oil prices .
Obviously the means to satisfy the economics from the expenditure level is difficult for the oil rich countries .
Obviously , they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 .
The pool of resources that they can rely on , it 's shrinking .
It 's not a very , I mean optimistic situation where we can say that yes they have much more resources and they can handle it without facing the heat of it .
Kim Brown : At the end of the policy brief , you offer six recommendations so that countries can help mitigate the economic impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic .
In your opinion , which of those recommendations are most important ? Also if you could give an example , is there a country already in the Arab region that is adhering to some of these recommendations and that you would like to single out as doing a good job relative to the circumstances ?  Niranjan Sarangi : Well , yes .
I mean the recommendations as it is explained , it requires both national and a regionally coordinated actions .
At the national level there are several examples , particularly coming from the Gulf , the oil rich countries , they have announced a stimulus packages to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packages to support the economic activities and to fight against this COVID-19 pandemic .
There are other measures than the stimulus packages that countries are using for example , lockdown , social distancing , work from home , schools and universities are shut down .
There are several other measures are taken into account to fight the impact of the pandemic because once it puts the outbreak stage , the region may face really catastrophic situation .
In terms of stimulus packages , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Oman have , I mean , declared several stimulus packages to support the businesses and that 's the more concrete examples we have .
Otherwise , there is a call for coordinated action and a regional support as well as international support is required to take into account the scale of the challenge .
Except the Gulf and the Egypt , other majors in the region are more locking down or nonfinancial measures .
That 's not going to help much in terms of jobs or social protection .
Social protection as it is low in the region and extending for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social bracket is very , very difficult .
On the one hand , the fiscal pressure is high .
The finances needed to support those new poor or new vulnerable people who lost their jobs is high .
On the other hand , the resource base for most of the countries is low .
Tax to GDP reservoir is much low .
There is a requirement for both extending the social protection and raising the finances .
The national actions will not be sufficient to address the challenge of the problem that they are facing , in the scale of the problem that they are facing .
It would require a combination of national and regionally coordinated actions .
It would also require support of the private sector .
At the national level , raising domestic resources is essential .
There is the opportunity in the sense that the region has also wealthy businesses and they account for a lot of the wealth in the region .
There is opportunity to see how in terms of solidarity with those who are vulnerable , how finances can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth people or support of the businesses and regionally coordinated action .
All measures need to be taken into account to fight against the virus .
Kim Brown : Ranjan , I know that you 're an economist , not a health official .
However , you are a person .
You are an observer from your corner of the world and you are coming to us today from Lebanon .
Can you tell us from your observations , what are you seeing , how the pandemic is impacting where you live ?  Niranjan Sarangi : Yes .
It 's impacting heavily to Lebanon , particularly heavily to Lebanon and because Lebanon has been facing a debt crisis for a long time and Lebanon has been placed in economic crisis since last three months or so .
People were protesting for better public service , protesting against the raise of taxes and all sorts of things and they were losing their incomes .
They were losing their jobs .
On top of that , the COVID-19 arrived and that led to lockdown .
We are in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shut .
The seaport is shut .
They have a crisis of the dollar as it is , which makes trade difficult because the dollar depends a lot on import .
It just compounds the effect .
I can see that several businesses are shut and those were operating three months ago , several and now the streets are empty .
In a financial crisis , the debt crisis , the COVID-19 , coronavirus crisis is just one on the top of another on Lebanon .
Kim Brown : Okay , well we 're going to leave the conversation there .
We 've been speaking with Niranjan Sarangi .
He is the macroeconomic and fiscal policy expert at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia .
He 's been joining us today from Lebanon .
Niranjan , we appreciate your time and your expertise today .
Thank you so much .
