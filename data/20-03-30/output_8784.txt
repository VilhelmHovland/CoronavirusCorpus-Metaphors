The mystery surrounding the details of Chris Sale 's Tommy John surgery has finally been solved .
After saying that Sale would need the surgery 11 days ago , the Red Sox stayed tight-lipped about it until Monday , when they announced their ace successfully underwent the operation on Monday morning -- which was also Sale 's birthday .
The procedure to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching elbow was performed by Dr .
Neal ElAttrache at the Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles .
The Red Sox waited to share details of Sale 's surgery due to various issues at play , mostly the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , which has complicated surgical procedures that may be viewed as elective surgeries .
Elective surgeries have been suspended in some areas of the country and the team wanted to be cautious about putting anyone at risk in the midst of a global health crisis .
Red Sox chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom said that when the team announced Sale needed surgery on March 19 , it had n't been scheduled yet .
" Needless to say , these are not normal times , " Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some difficult challenges .
We knew that to schedule this or any surgery right now would not be routine , that there might be scheduling or logistical difficulties .
Neither we nor Chris wanted to work through any of those potential hurdles in public so we chose to stay quiet until the surgery was complete .
" We understand that choice is not ideal for our fans and for those following us .
We did it only to avoid unnecessary daily speculation regarding the logistics .
As I said earlier this month , it was important to all of us to do this in a way that would not place any undo burden on anyone suffering because of the coronavirus .
"  Bloom said it was his understanding that Dr .
James Andrews , the renowned sports orthopedic surgeon who has advised Sale through the duration of his elbow problems that started late last season , was not doing surgeries of this kind right now during the pandemic .
But ElAttrache has also been working with Sale throughout the process and was obviously willing to perform the surgery .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't as much of an elective surgery as it was essential to Sale 's livelihood , Bloom did n't want to get too much into details .
" I do n't want to get too caught up in the semantics here , " Bloom said .
" Obviously it is important and even necessary to his livelihood but we know this is not life and death and there are people who are suffering in situations that are life and death and that 's why it was important for us to make sure we were n't putting any burden on the health system that would be a negative for people who are battling the coronavirus or any other ailment .
So it 's certainly something we all know is necessary for his livelihood but we 're aware it 's apples and oranges when you talk about this versus something that 's life-threatening .
"  Sale now begins a long road to recovery .
Generally , Bloom said , recovery from Tommy John surgery takes around 14 months .
If that 's the case with Sale , a realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Some guys come back quicker , " Bloom said .
" Some guys take a little longer , obviously depending on how the rehab proceeds if there are any bumps in the road that they encounter .
Typically that 14-month range or so is where it lands .
"  Sale , who resides in Fort Myers , Florida , will soon return there and Bloom said that 's where his rehab will take place .
Even though JetBlue Park is closed for the time being , Bloom said it 's a possibility he could be hosted there , and if not , they 'll make necessary arrangements for him .
He said some staff members have remained in Florida and will be available for him .
Sale 's rehab plan has yet to be mapped out , but Bloom said he and his staff are working on that .
He said it will be a " little while " before the lefty is throwing and that the early stage of rehab is mostly devoted to range of motion exercises and conditioning .
" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are in the area for him , " Bloom said .
" They will help him to the best of their ability .
Our training staff all the way up through ( head trainer ) Brad Pearson will stay in close contact with Chris and with the staff working closest with him obviously making sure we 're doing everything we can for him .
Some things require a little more hands-on care than others .
We 're going to make sure he gets that care .
" We know how driven ( Sale ) is to do it right .
We 're eager to see him on the Fenway mound again when it 's time .
