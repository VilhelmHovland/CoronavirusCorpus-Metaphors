Opinion  Starting a startup : Flipping my business strategy because of coronavirus  By Sally Branson-Dalwood  I know startups need to be agile , especially in this time of coronavirus , but even so I had not really imagined within the space of a few days I would totally change how the Suite Set operates .
Sales have continued to be stagnant but online engagement has increased .
I feel like the product has become second to the service element of the business .
This is n't ideal in a financial sense , but it seems the only way to engage with my customers at the moment .

There are times this week that I have been in tears , I 'm sure our underlying financial pressure is contributing to this , but the immediate trigger has been hearing from the Suite Set 's followers on social media who are expecting their first child and experiencing extraordinary levels of anxiety .
I spent two days this week in talks with my professional contacts to find resources to help pregnant women deal with anxiety - and then spent the rest of the week planning and writing a free 14 day course of emails to reduce anxiety and prepare calmly to welcome a baby into this world .
Seven months ago , having been out of the workforce for three years I did n't have the skills or knowledge to code in our webpage , develop an email program and do the graphic design for this .
The past seven months of startup skills development , with no budget seems to have served me well this week .
Being able to do a pop up sign up sheet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt pleased I could .
We 've been checking in daily over WhatsApp as well as video calling , we share any updated information that may help us financially and share ideas for each other 's business .
The skills that startup-ers have seem almost made for these times - and when we can get through this with our health and wellbeing intact the stories of rising to support our customers will be extraordinary .

Next week : Working with a charity partner .
