TRAVEL ADVISER : Travel in the time of the coronavirus  Business travel too wo n't suddenly return to normal .
There are no conferences planned for the summer , no Olympics in Japan .
PASSENGERS WAIT for their flights at Marrakesh Airport earlier this month .
Several special flights departed Morocco , taking thousands of stranded Europeans home as the kingdom announced it was suspending all regular air traffic due to the coronavirus .

Like everyone all over the world in the tourism industry , the coronavirus has decimated us .
I 've sent 38 of my 41 employees on two months unpaid leave .
Along with one agent and one person in accounting , we 've been coming into the office to work .
Now that is no longer an option .
Do I believe that after two months , the virus will have been pushed back and life will return to normal ? Sadly I do not .
In the last two weeks we 've been preoccupied with four different items : retrieval , repatriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their very nature are inveterate travelers .
Low-cost carriers flourished in Israel ; new airlines to exotic locals thrived .
Reason is we are not just the wandering people but the travelling people .
From post-army adventures to golden age tours , going abroad has been the birthright of almost every Israel .
Now with the pandemic , the skies are closing .
Entire countries are shutting their borders , closing their airlines and refusing to let tourists in .
Like most of us , health is high up on their list of concerns and many of the countries that Israelis found themselves situated in were not known for first-class hospitals .
Coupled with our own Foreign Ministry 's summons to return home , they have bombarded the airlines and agencies with their fervent plea .
El Al , Arkia and Israir took the initiative when there were no scheduled airlines to bring their citizens home .
As far distant as Perth to cities in Italy , the three Israeli airlines showed their mettle .
Repatriation :  Israel attracts a myriad of tourists and students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs that are offered .
As soon as those programs were shut down , those budding scholars wanted to depart the country .
As airlines cancelled their flights , it was no easy task in finding reasonable solutions .
No foreign country sent their planes to assist them , so they were forced to pay any price they could to depart Israel .
To the US , for example , the only two nonstop flights to either Newark or JFK can only be flown on United Airlines and El Al .
Delta stopped coming to Tel Aviv quite quickly and Air Canada also pulled up stakes .
Low-cost carriers like Ryanair shut down completely with no planned flights until after May 31 .
Almost all the European airlines ceased flying .
( British Airways has been the shining example of continuing a daily flight from London .
) So , getting those partakers of Israeli programs out of the country was no easy task  Renewal :  While the airports are empty and the airlines that still fly quite uninhabited , this is still a temporary situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake up one day with COVID-19 in the rear-view mirror .
It may be in the late spring , or in the summer .
The airlines have already anticipated buyer trepidation .
Most are permitting free changes and all have opened their lower classes in the hopes that there are certain people who will take the plunge and book a ticket .
My office recently sold three tickets to Rome for August along with a cruise .
Even I guffawed with the client on his optimism .
Refunds :  The majority of any travel consultants time these days is spent on one item and one item only : sending tickets in for cancellation .
If an airline cancels your flight , the law is clear , they must refund you .
That 's why I always advise people to wait until the last minute to cancel their flight to see if the airline winds up cancelling the flight .
If you cancel when the flight is still in the system you will incur the regular cancellation fees .
In Israel , most airlines process their credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed as a clearing house and works quite simply .
Every ticket issued in a calendar month is remitted on the 18th of the following month .
Every ticket that is sent for refund is deducted from that remittance .
And thus the passenger should get his credit immediately after the airlines have refunded it .
What happens though when almost no tickets are issued , and rather than reducing the refunds from what is owed the airline must make massive remuneration to the travel agent ? Or worse , what if an airline , say United or Air Canada , decides it simply wo n't have the cash flow , so it demands that the passenger gets a credit that can be used for 12 months .
And only at the end of that period , if unused will they refund the money ? That 's what is happening today in the travel industry .
Many airlines , like El Al , have stated unequivocally that they will remit the money on April 18 , while others , United , for example will only offer a credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to aviation lawyers to delve into that .
What are your options if they refuse to give you the refund , in full ? You can dispute the charge with your credit card .
Just note that if you used a personal travel agent and if they charged your card that you 'll be taking the money out of their pocket rather than the airline 's pocket .
You can file a complaint with the Transportation Ministry or with the relevant Israeli consumer association .
If those options fail , you can take the airline to small claims court .
I understand the airlines .
Many will go out of business if the governments do n't step up .
El Al , Arkia and Israir have been negotiating with the Finance Ministry and to date an agreement has not been reached .
Same with the US carriers beseeching for some relief .
In principle the Trump administration agrees but to date nothing has been signed .
The Italian government , for years trying to sell off Alitalia , was forced to step in and cease all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support them .
Lufthansa has already asked the German government , and rest assured every airline will be asking their local authority for assistance .
2020 is over .
Whatever revenue is salvaged will not cover the billions lost in the tourism industry this year .
The cruise industry along with the hotels will need at least a year to recover .
There will be many bankruptcies .
The effect of the novel coronavirus on human life is what is discussed constantly ; the economic effects will be far deeper and will result in a brand-new paradigm .
We will not return to normal for some time .
With high unemployment and so many people forced to cut into their savings , there will be little disposable income for leisure travel .
Some have opined that when it 's over , the pressure of quarantine and not being able to travel will result in a surge .
Poppycock ! Economic realities will not permit such a surge .
Normalcy for most will be to return to their daily lives .
Taking a vacation overseas will be a luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal .
There are no conferences planned for the summer , no Olympics in Japan .
Business clients wo n't need to travel for several months once we return to our normal cadence .
It will recover faster than leisure travel as new conferences will be set and contracts will need to be signed .
This will take time though .
Client retention is still the most important attribute in the tourism industry .
If the hotel you booked in Tahiti , chooses not to take a cancellation fee , you 'll book again .
If the airline accommodates your refund request , they will have bought your loyalty .
And if you used a travel consultant who handled your every need , you will continue using their services .
The best way to know a company or a person is within a crisis .
How they handle themselves and their clients today will determine if they succeed tomorrow .
