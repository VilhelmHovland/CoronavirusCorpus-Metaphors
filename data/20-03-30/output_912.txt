Hunkering Down New Orleans comes to grips with coronavirus : Read the full edition of Gambit  This is the time of year that Gambit 's team of talented journalists would be working long hours to bring our readers comprehensive festival coverage , spring dining news , and a local take on the upcoming elections .
Suddenly last week , our story and business ( like the rest of the world ) changed .
Gambit 's editorial team quickly scrapped the plan they originally had in place for this week 's print edition and rose to the occasion to cover local news stories on coronavirus .
To continue our mission of providing entertainment coverage , we also included features on local authors to read , new albums by Louisiana artists , and movies to stream recommended by Patois New Orleans International Human Rights Film Festival ( originally scheduled for this week , but has been postponed because theaters have been closed ) .
Meanwhile , we also called our 300+ distribution locations to see who was open and where we could safely deliver in light of stay at home orders .
This week you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores .
A few restaurants , including Pythian Market and Brown Butter , will even deliver a Gambit to you with your food order .
Even with this , the restrictions on daily life may still make it difficult for our regular readers to find a copy .
We have you covered .
Our e-edition is available to download at **28;4546;TOOLONG and read at your leisure .
If you enjoy this week 's issue , please share this digital edition on social media .
