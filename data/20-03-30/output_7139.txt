Share this story  Seattle restaurants will be allowed to continue only with delivery , takeout , and drive-thru service for the next two weeks .
On Monday , Washington Gov .
Jay Inslee , King County executive Dow Constantine , Seattle mayor Jenny Durkan , and others held a press conference to go over the new statewide order to try to slow the spread of COVID-19 .
As previously announced , all restaurants and bars across Washington will need to close for dine-in service through at least March 31 , but delivery , takeout , and drive-thru will still be allowed .
Constantine said , " Perhaps our resilience is going to be represented by the takeout box .
"  No further restrictions were revealed , although the order was clarified to apply to wine and beer taprooms , doughnut shops , and coffee shops .
While the order will be in effect for two weeks , Dr .
Jeff Duchin , health officer for Public Health , emphasized that the outbreak in the area could last " for months " and that it would be difficult to determine on March 31 precisely the impact these measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 'll be primarily reevaluating to logistical issues associated with the implementation and seeing how we can do better , if we can do better , " says Duchin .
Inslee was asked about ways to support workers displaced by the new order and the economic impact the coronavirus has had in general .
He said that " paid sick and family leave policies would be strictly enforced , " first and foremost .
And while there are existing mechanisms to help the unemployed , Inslee hoped the federal government might allow pandemics to be considered on the same level as natural disasters , which he said could logistically open up more unemployment compensations .
He also said he would n't be opposed to universal basic income at the federal level to address the crisis .
When asked about rent deferment for certain individuals and businesses ( something that could help local restaurants weather the storm ) , Inslee would only reveal that they are exploring various options that would be announced soon .
" We are going to look for every creative solution , we can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state would enforce the new regulations , Inslee said that there could be injunctions that Washington could seek out if there was " willful , conscious disregard " for the order , but believed the " vast majority would respond " to help protect themselves and their loved ones .
