As a boy , sitting in my room overlooking the Dal through Kashmir 's many lockdowns , I rolled with laughter at the wit of Rene Goscinny and the artistic genius of Alberto Uderzo .
My father owns all 38 titles of the Asterix comic series .
Given that he lovingly covered each comic with talc sheet as a teenager himself and has not allowed even a single comic book of this series to be moved from his personal library , they are in as good a condition as can be expected .
My father has guarded his entire collection the way the sword-wielding Asterix and the roly-poly Obelix guarded their village from the Roman legionaries .
As a teenager , I coined the word " overcare " for my Dad and his Asterix series .
The overcare piqued my curiosity .
The curiosity made me promise my Dad in all solemnity that I would take care of the comic books as well as he did if he allowed me to read them .
And one of the ways ' like father , like son ' fits is here .
For both of us , Asterix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with guffaws and hoots thrown in .
As a boy , sitting in my room overlooking the Dal through Kashmir 's many lockdowns , I rolled with laughter at the wit of Rene Goscinny and the artistic genius of Alberto Uderzo .
Asterix with his winged helmet , bulbous nose , and horseshoe moustache and Obelix , a stonemason who had fallen into the cauldron when he was a baby ( Asterix lovers know it by heart ) became my childhood companions when I could n't go out .
Druid Getafix , Chief Vitalstatistix , bard Cacofonix , Geriatrix , Unhygienix , Fulliautomatix , Roman Gluteus Maximus ( I never saw it as a muscle again ) , Centurion Crismus Bonus and more were the cause of happy cheer in those long weeks of lockdown -- and Dogmatix no less .
Albert Underzo , one of the two creators of the beloved comic book character Asterix passed away on March 24 , 2020 at the age of 92 .
( File photo : AP )  What as a schoolboy I missed out on , my Dad delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gags and caricatures of French politicians such as Jacques Chirac .
The Fresh President made his way into the comic series disguised as a Roman economist .
Of the 38 Asterix titles , 24 were written by Rene Goscinny , with Uderzo working on the art .
After Goscinny 's death in 1977 , Uderzo took over the writing as well .
I was thrilled to discover that Asterix and theBlack Gold , which was rated as Uderzo 's best writing work , had a tribute to Sean Connery 's James Bond ( Dubbleosix ) .
Uderzo , who died on March 24 as the world grapples with coronavirus , cleverly put in a tribute to his late friend Goscinny ( Saul ben Ephishul ) as the Jew who guides Asterix and Obelix from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea .
I can bet that if Uderzo were still writing , the charmingly named coronavirus would have found its way into the comic book -- as a sidekick to Impedimenta , maybe ?  Goscinny died too early , but not before witnessing the stupendous success of Asterix , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in France during his lifetime .
The country 's first satellite was named Asterix .
When Goscinny died , one French obituary likened his passing to the collapse of the Eiffel Tower .
Asterix in Belgium is the last book in the series that Goscinny wrote .
It is said that Uderzo took over his friend 's job with much hesitation .
The Asterix comic series went on to outsell Voltaire , Flaubert , Hugo and every other French author before .
The books created an international record -- more than 380 million Asterix books sold in more than 100 languages worldwide .
The story of Uderzo 's own name seems to be lifted from the Asterix series .
His father Silvio Uderzo , an Italian immigrant who moved to France , wanted to name him Albert .
It was registered as Alberto because the government official misunderstood Silvio 's heavy Italian accent .
Uderzo said in an interview , " I once asked my father : Why did you give me an Italian first name , considering we live in France ? His reply was typical of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberto , but instead as Alberto .
" It was hopeless .
Without noticing it , my father pronounced ' Albert ' the Italian way .
"  Albert or Alberto , the cartoon character that this man co-created , became a mainstay of French culture for more than six decades .
After debuting in the French satirical magazine Pilote , Asterix spawned dozens of books as well as animated movies , radio and television shows .
Uderzo would have turned 93 a month from now -- on April 25 .
French writers have admitted that Uderzo , the son of Italian immigrants who lived in France , helped the nation rediscover her proud ancient roots .
