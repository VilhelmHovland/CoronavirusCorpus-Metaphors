Since the onset of the Covid outbreak , the economics profession has been extraordinarily reactive on traditional and social media .
This column introduces " Covid Economics , Vetted and Real-Time Papers " , a new review from CEPR which will bring together more formal investigations , based on explicit theory and/or empirical evidence , to improve knowledge .
Very quickly after the onset of the epidemic a large number of policy papers have been written by economic scholars , many of which have appeared on VoxEU .
This has been enormously helpful in improving our understanding of policy options .
The next step requires more formal investigations , based on explicit theory and/or empirical evidence .
This is what Covid Economics , Vetted and Real-Time Papers aims to provide .
This online only review is based on three principles :  Since the onset of the Covid outbreak , the economics profession has been extraordinarily reactive on traditional and social media .
Now comes the time for academic research to improve knowledge .
Given how fast the situation is changing , there is a need for real-time publication of quality research results .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions online .
In order to speed up the process , all submissions will be promptly evaluated by the Editorial Board , over a maximum of 48 hours , on an accept/reject basis , i .
no resubmission and no referee report .
When a sufficient number of papers are accepted ( three to five ) , an issue of the Review will be published online by CEPR Press .
Thus the frequency of the review will be determined endogenously .
In order to attract the best works , papers are published as pre-prints , meaning they can be later be submitted to regular professional reviews .
CEPR-affiliated researchers may also issue them in the CEPR Discussion Paper series .
The title of the new Review , Covid Economics , Vetted and Real-Time Papers , has been chosen deliberately :  Vetted makes it clear that the refereeing process , while uncompromising , does not involve the usual back-and-forth of standard review processes .
Real-time indicates that the time between submission and publication is very short .
Papers rather than Journal in order to maximize the acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakout challenges all areas of economics including , but not only , health , industrial organization , macroeconomics , finance , history , development , inequality , political economy , public finance .
It concerns theory as well as empirical evidence .
A large Editorial Board has been assembled to be able to deal with all these aspects .
We also aim to have a wide geographical coverage .
Submissions are invited as of today via the CEPR website .
We prefer reasonably short contributions ( approx .
5000 words ) though this is not a requirement ; submissions could be longer or shorter than this .
Accepted papers will be copy-edited by CEPR staff before publication , and a VoxEU column summarising each paper will be commissioned automatically on acceptance .
