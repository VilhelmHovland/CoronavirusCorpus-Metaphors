Subjects  Abstract  A novel SARS-like coronavirus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) recently emerged and is rapidly spreading in humans1,2 .
A key to tackling this epidemic is to understand the virus 's receptor recognition mechanism , which regulates its infectivity , pathogenesis and host range .
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor - human ACE2 ( hACE2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) ( engineered to facilitate crystallization ) in complex with hACE2 .
Compared with the SARS-CoV RBD , a hACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD takes a more compact conformation ; moreover , several residue changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/hACE2 interface .
These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD enhance its hACE2-binding affinity .
Additionally , we show that RaTG13 , a bat coronavirus closely related to SARS-CoV-2 , also uses hACE2 as its receptor .
The differences among SARS-CoV-2 , SARS-CoV and RaTG13 in hACE2 recognition shed light on potential animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 .
This study provides guidance for intervention strategies targeting receptor recognition by SARS-CoV-2 .
