Clinical laboratories in Western New York racing to find new ways of testing for the novel coronavirus face the same problem many people find at the supermarket these days .
A dearth of products , especially nasal swabs , transport tubes and reagents -- substances used in chemical testing -- has handcuffed efforts to process more coronavirus tests in the county , said Dr .
John E .
Tomaszewski , professor and chairman of pathology and anatomical sciences in the University at Buffalo 's Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences .
" Like there 's a run on toilet paper , there 's a run on all these things , " said Tomaszewski , who also serves as chief of service , pathology and laboratory medicine for Kaleida Health .
" We really need access to reagents .
That 's the A No .
1 thing .
"  Less than a month ago , about 130 public health laboratories in the country , including one in Erie County , were the only labs authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test for novel coronavirus , using a CDC testing regimen approved by the U .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus overwhelmed the ability of public health labs to keep pace , and the FDA has since allowed many clinical laboratories to process tests -- a move that allowed New York State to rapidly expand testing , particularly in New York City and downstate counties .
Testing took off as well in upstate counties such as Albany , Monroe , Onondaga and Saratoga , according to state figures .
The University of Rochester Medical Center and Rochester Regional Health , for example , have conducted many of the 2,196 tests taken in Monroe County , which does not have a public health laboratory , according to Julie J .
Philipp , a spokeswoman for Monroe County Executive Adam J .
Bello .
Erie County 's pace of testing , though , continues to lag several smaller counties , even as its number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 has grown .
" In general , it 's very clear the testing measures that have been available have gone downstate , and so it should be , because they are a couple weeks ahead of this thing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller upstate counties have been able so far to test more .
Erie County officials have n't been able to explain the gap , either .
Clinical labs may start coronavirus testing only if they have lab instruments for which the FDA has given an " emergency use authorization .
" The FDA so far has approved 19 such authorizations to companies such as Roche Molecular Systems , Thermo Fisher Scientific and Abbott Molecular , which manufacture instruments and test kits used in laboratories for virology testing .

( Robert Kirkham/Buffalo News )  Some counties may have clinical labs with instruments that already received an emergency use authorization , as well as test kits that go along with the devices , said Tomaszewski .
Andrew M .
Cuomo on Thursday encouraged greater testing to help flatten the escalating curve of cases across the state .
But he said he also recognized that some communities do n't have what they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity issue , right .
If you have the capacity to test , test , " he said .
" If you do n't have the capacity to test and you can only test people , for example , who are coming into your hospitals , then you do n't have the ability to do it .
But if you have the ability to do it , do it , because it 's a way to flatten the curve .
"  In Erie County , Catholic Health officials have said they are trying to buy 72,000 tests from Cepheid , a California company that received an emergency use authorization March 20 for its GeneXpert Xpress system .
The purchase would allow Catholic Health , which already has the GeneXpert Xpress system , to do 800 tests per day .
But it 's unclear if or when the deal will happen , and Catholic Health officials have said they still would need help getting additional supplies , such as nasal swabs , to do the tests .
Kaleida Health started March 22 doing 100 to 200 tests per day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its Abbott RealTime system , said Tomaszewski .
Abbott Molecular , which makes the system and testing materials , received an authorization for them March 18 .
" But it 's not enough , " he said .
With the limited supplies , Kaleida is primarily testing health care workers to ensure that it can maintain robust health care in its hospitals as the virus surges in Western New York , Tomaszewski said .
To conserve tests , county officials have been discouraging people who suspect they have been exposed to coronavirus from seeking a test , unless they are health care workers , first responders or older people with Covid-19 symptoms , per the recommendations of the Association of Public Health Laboratories .
Another emergency use authorization granted Tuesday may also help boost testing in Western New York , he said .
PerkinElmer developed a diagnostic procedure to be used with its chemagic 360 instrument .
The University at Buffalo uses those instruments in its biorepository , a facility that collects , process , stores and distributes biological specimens for research .
Tomaszewski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biorepository 's research instruments into a clinical setting to conduct coronavirus testing .
" This is where the innovation comes in , " he said .
" All the labs in the community have been scrambling to adopt alternatives .
"  Tomaszewski said he is currently scouring the market for reagents that would work with five different testing systems .
Two of those systems combined could process as many 2,000 tests per day , he said .
But much of the world also is in the market for testing materials .
Some of the upstate counties that have outpaced Erie in testing so far also are running out of those materials and scrambling for more .
Albany County Executive Daniel P .
McCoy this week cautioned residents not to get a " false sense of security " about the county 's lowering rate of increase in positive cases of Covid-19 because the county 's ability to test had slowed with the depletion of test kits .
" They just ca n't make enough , as quickly as you want up front , " said Tomaszewski .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kits .
