" Stay home if you 're sick .
our preference and our instruction is , more generally , stay home unless you 're going out for essentials .
"  These comments reflect the calls for social distancing and self-isolation -- already a difficult task for many Australians unable to work from home .
But for around one in every 200 Australians currently crashing on couches , staying in boarding houses or , in the most extreme cases , sleeping rough on the street or in improvised dwellings , these measures are impossible .
While homelessness differs greatly for all those affected , one uniting factor is the inability to self-isolate -- even those with a roof over their head are often in overcrowded and temporary living spaces .
Government advice to stay one and a half metres away from others is just not an option .
As such , homeless persons are disproportionately at risk of contracting the virus .
This is particularly true for those sleeping rough , who are at anincreased risk of illness .
While the coronavirus will put the homeless more at risk , this situation was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The most comprehensive data on the issue , from the 2016 Census , showed that homelessness in Australia increased by nearly 14% in the previous five years .
While young people make up the plurality for those affected by homelessness , people older than 55 without a home increased by 49% between 2006-2016 -- a statistic that should be of great concern considering the threat of COVID-19 to the elderly .
Capital cities were also acutely affected , seeing a rise in homelessness of between 48% and 63% between 2001-2016 , while people living in overcrowded dwellings doubled -- thanks in large part to rising house prices .
The drastic increase in homelessness within urban areas in the context of the current pandemic -- a virus that spreads in dense populations -- once again only compounds the two crises .
The rise in homelessness also has put a massive strain on service agencies , with an estimated 65,800 people each day calling for assistance and 253 of these requests not met .
The majority of these concern the need for accommodation .
" There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who need accommodation during this crisis .
Before the pandemic , waitlists for housing were already almost a year for people in the most urgent need and as many as ten years , or even more , for other households on social housing waiting lists .
"  Since the Howard Government in 1996 , public housing has been on the decline , despite the increase in homelessness .
Community housing , provided by civil society and NGOs has tried to fill this gap but can not keep up .
IT COULD GET WORSE .
A LOT WORSE  On March 17 , Victoria 's peak body for homelessness the Council to Homeless Persons warned of a " tsunami of homelessness , " due to COVID-19 .
In Australia , around 600,000 households are in rental stress , meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent .
With the Federal Governmentpredicting that one million people will be made unemployed by the crisis , many wo n't be able to pay rent .
Already underfunded and undersupplied , social housing would not be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BE DONE  The Victorian Government has also offered $6 million in emergency funding to homelessness service agencies .
But as Smith points out :  " It wo n't be enough for all the tens of thousands of people losing their jobs or living in overcrowded housing .
The scale of this problem means it requires a Federal response .
"  While the Federal Government 's coronavirus supplement saw an increase for those on the JobSeeker payment , Smith again noted that this  " .
does n't start until April 27 and people have several rent payments to make before then .
"  Backpackers left homeless broke stranded in Aust by coronavirus at a hostel for 8 months they just kicked me out because of social distancing they closed the hostel and then on Monday , I lost my job in a call centre .
So I was jobless homeless in 24 hours .

Furthermore , not all homeless people are on JobSeeker or other relevant social safety nets ; while people on the Disability Support Pension ( bearing in mind people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line with JobSeeker payments .
Those on working visas , student visas and asylum seekers are also at serious risk .
Smith says :  " The only immediate solution is vacant tourist accommodation , like hotels or AirBnbs .
"  Inaction or indecision in addressing homelessness during the pandemic would be disastrous , but homelessness was already a crisis -- the outbreak of COVID-19 has only starkly emphasised the need for adequate social housing for all .
