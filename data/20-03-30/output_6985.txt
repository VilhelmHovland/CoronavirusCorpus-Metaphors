MLB is reportedly still just in the early stages of discussing how it would create protocols to ensure the safety of players and staff if baseball returns this year .
Among the preliminary discussions , the league would reportedly require a stockpile of COVID-19 testing kits and a prepared treatment plan for personnel that test positive .
Even the initial plan runs into problems given the shortage of testing kits and medical resources available across the entire country .
At a time when New York needs to build more hospitals to account for the rapid increase in patients and hospitals nationwide are dealing with shortages of necessary equipment , MLB 's potential request would come at the worst possible time .
MLB was already preparing for a shortened season that could start in July , but the agreement with players outlined what would happen in a worst-case scenario .
As the COVID-19 pandemic worsens , it appears increasingly likely that we wo n't see baseball in 2020 .
