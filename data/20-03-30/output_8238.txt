Spring flurries in Tokyo bring a rare sight of snow and cherry blossoms  Snow is not a common sight in Tokyo -- winter rarely falls below freezing and any snow that does fall melts long before it can pile up on the ground .
So far this year , it has only snowed in the city once , in February , and Tokyo 's last truly heavy snow fall was in early 2018 .
Although spring temperatures have already climbed above 20 ? Celsius , Sunday March 29 saw a rare snowfall in the morning and early afternoon , which resulted in the unique occurrence of snow falling amongst delicate cherry blossoms .
Unfortunately , this scene did not have many spectators , as Tokyoites were urged to stay at home over the weekend to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 coronavirus .
But fret not , we 've rounded up a few of the stunning shots circulating on social media for your viewing pleasure .
Enjoy ! .
