Tom Coburn was one of the best senators of our era  Former Sen .
Tom Coburn , who died Saturday morning of complications from prostate cancer , was one of the finest public servants of my lifetime .
The Oklahoma Republican , a practicing obstetrician , combined fierce devotion to principle with rigorous intellectual integrity and tremendous personal decency .
One of the most hard-line conservatives in first the House and then the Senate , he nonetheless enjoyed the respect and friendship of many liberal Democrats .
Not the least of these was President Barack Obama , with whom he reportedly spoke in private , as a friend and sounding board , almost weekly throughout Obama 's White House tenure .
" I 'm adamantly against 80 percent of President Obama 's policies , " Coburn told the Oklahoman newspaper .
" But he is an honest liberal .
Am I to hate him because he has a different viewpoint than I do ? Or should I love him and try to touch his heart and change him ? "  When Coburn arrived on Capitol Hill in the " Gingrich Revolution " Republican class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , though , there was a difference : Whereas some super-hard-liners are full of sound and fury without much thoughtfulness , Coburn obviously had depth and intellect .
Still , he perhaps lacked proportion .
He and several conservatives clashed repeatedly with Gingrich .
They were right on principle , but Gingrich may have been more practical in terms of accomplishing conservative goals .
Gingrich , though , was certainly imperious with them and not always true to his word , and he tried to bully them rather than reason with them .
The result , eventually , was that Coburn took part in an ill-advised , midterm , internal coup attempt against Gingrich in 1997 rather than more sensibly waiting to challenge the speaker at the end of that two-year legislative cycle .
Gingrich 's allies quashed the rebellion .
Most of the coup leaders lost their political careers .
Coburn , though , learned and grew .
He abided by a term-limits pledge and retired from the House at the end of 2000 , only to win an election to the Senate in 2004 .

Rather than being a gadfly , Coburn became an effective leader , without ever doing the " go-along to get-along " kind of games .
He began publishing an annual Wastebook highlighting absurd government spending and also a weekly " pork report " listing egregious examples of wasteful projects from almost every federal agency .
He took the lead in opposing Obamacare while pushing real healthcare reforms of a conservative variety , some of which have gone into law piecemeal over the years even without passage in a single , comprehensive bill .
And , often working with Democrats , he became a leader in providing effective congressional oversight and insisting that government operate with public transparency .
As Democratic Sen .
Carl Levin of Michigan put it , Coburn was " tough , fearless , and more interested in facts than politics .
"  Journalists knew him as one of the few senators who would always give straight answers , and thoughtful ones , rather than poll-tested sound bites .
He was both so supremely intelligent and so tirelessly industrious that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in reasonable context .
Mostly , it was clear that Coburn was in the political game not for self-aggrandizement , but for real service to the public , in furtherance of what he saw as the best means of guaranteeing freedom and right reason .
I just checked my email inbox , and his last exchange with me ( from the summer of 2016 , on an off-the-record matter ) was fitting .
He ended it like this : " Thank you for loving our liberty .
"  Change the period after " liberty " to a comma , and that 's what we should be saying to him .
More Washington Examiner  Unsatisfied simply condemning the public for using the term " China Virus , " the media are now rejoicing in America 's rising infection rate .
The New York Times wrote that the United States apparently leads the world in coronavirus cases , an argument echoed by NBC , CNN , and the Guardian , among others .
With last week 's jaw-dropping unemployment figures showing 3 .
million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how seriously Americans are facing abrupt and devastating personal consequences due to our prudent and necessary social distancing measures in the face of the coronavirus pandemic .
In the final analysis , history will undoubtedly judge President Trump 's fundamentally American strategy for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic to be far more effective than China 's heavy-handed actions .
The spread of the novel coronavirus from China to the rest of the globe has heightened Americans ' awareness of the deep connections , and serious vulnerabilities , that shape our lives in the 21st century .
American energy independence amounts to much more than a mere talking point .
It is an undeniable benefit to our economic prosperity , our national security , and our environment .
But unless certain measures are taken , both in the short-term and in the long-term , we are at serious risk of losing it .
The MSNBC " expert " who claimed President Trump gave white nationalists a wink and a nod when he ordered flags lowered to half-staff through August 8 to honor the victims of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to do their jobs .
On March 29 , Jackson Diehl , the Washington Post 's deputy editorial page editor , published a column labeling Secretary of State Mike Pompeo " among the worst secretaries of state ever " based on his response to the coronavirus pandemic .
China would have us believe that its Wuhan region , where the novel coronavirus originated and spread to become a global pandemic , has not had a single new case for the past week .
What do you think the odds are that this resembles the truth in any way ?  Ancient Rome placed great importance in " prodigia , " or unhappy omens from the Gods requiring some rite of redress .
Following Rome 's defeat to Hannibal at Can nae , human sacrifices were made to earn back divine favor .
One of the most constitutionally and morally problematic responses to the coronavirus pandemic is that of Florida Gov .
Ron DeSantis in strongly dissuading residents of certain states from entering Florida 's territory .
The entire Washington area is nearing a shutdown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Ralph Northam announcing mandatory stay-at-home orders in light of the coronavirus crisis .
As the nation tries to flatten the curve before our medical facilities face fatal overcapacity , it makes perfect sense that state health departments would use their authority to authorize specific and limited shutdowns of businesses and congregations .
But Virginia has exemplified how to take it too far .
