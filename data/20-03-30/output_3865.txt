Santa Claus comes to town to say ' stay at home '  IT may be nine months until Christmas but Santa Claus has emerged from lockdown in the North Pole with a very important message .
" Stay at home .
Help our hospital staff , " urges Santa from his prominent perch outside a house on the northside of Limerick city .
And Santa sees and knows everything .
Sean Ryan , the eagle-eyed photographer who kindly sent the photos to the Limerick Leader , said it is part of an emerging trend .
Christmas lights are also going up , he says .
" It 's for hope , " said Sean .
It started in America with families putting up their Christmas lights to help brighten the darkness surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic .
Good Morning America reported that people are going on social media , specifically Twitter , to put the lights out to show there is still life outside while everyone is cooped up practicing social distancing and self-quarantines .
