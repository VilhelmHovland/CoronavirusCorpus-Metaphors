Main menu  UO jumps into remote learning with passion and innovation  The beginning of any academic quarter typically brings a flurry of activity , but as the spring term gets underway this week the University of Oregon campus is unusually muted .
Any sense of emptiness , however , is an illusion .
The campus community has not disappeared -- it has merely dispersed .
In extraordinarily challenging times , the UO has quickly adapted and gone remote .
In keeping with state 's " stay home " orders and to protect the campus community during the COVID-19 ( coronavirus ) pandemic , the UO is modifying its operations and providing remote classes .
As UO faculty members , graduate employees and students come together for the first sessions of the new term , they are not connecting in any physical lecture halls or laboratories , but strictly in virtual space .
This fast-moving experiment , necessitated by extreme circumstances , is bringing out creative and innovative teaching approaches and challenging instructors and students to move outside their comfort zones .
" I am tremendously proud and encouraged by the resilience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforeseen challenges , " said UO President Michael H .
Schill .
" The faculty and staff are moving with lightning speed to ensure that our students educations ' stay on track and that their dreams are n't dashed by this terrible virus .
"  Across the university , employees have worked to put in place the structure and systems necessary to support all students .
The university has a large incident management teamdedicated to COVID-19 mitigation , and status updates are regularly posted to the UO 's coronavirus information page .
With the suspension of noncritical campus operations , one of the biggest steps was laying the foundation for more than 1,000 instructors to quickly transition to remote work , using technology to deliver their classroom lectures , discussions , office hours and other face-to-face course content over sometimes-vast distances to a widely dispersed student body .
" Foundationally , it was a big technology challenge , " said Jessie Minton , vice provost for information services and chief information officer .
" On very short notice , we had to scale up to accommodate 2,182 faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UO moving their teaching and learning to a remote model , as well as over 3,000 other UO employees now working remotely who support our mission .
"  To this end , the university has implemented the videoconferencing application Zoom across campus , allowing real-time instruction as well as counseling and health services via telemedicine .
The UO also implemented virtual computer labs and upgraded its virtual private network , the service that allows faculty members , staff and students to securely connect to certain mission-critical tools and services from off campus .
Instructors also have tools and support through Canvas , the university 's online learning management system .
Beyond the technology hurdles , human challenges remain .
Remote instruction will be a big adjustment for most UO faculty members and students .
Patrick Phillips , provost and senior vice president , asked faculty members to take every step possible to help students maintain solid connections to the university .
" As mentors and teachers , it is incumbent on us to find new ways to maintain connection with our students in this challenging time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek , " he said .
Janet Woodruff-Borden , executive vice provost for academic affairs , urged instructors to be mindful of the anxiousness that many students were experiencing and of the need to make their classes feel engaged in the initial weeks of the term .
" Some students might not have consistent access to the internet , and international students who are studying remotely from home might be in a different time zone , " she said .
" Additionally , some students with disabilities or medical conditions may encounter barriers with remote instruction that were not apparent in in-person classes .
"  To help guide instructors through the process of planning and delivering their course content remotely , the Office of the Provost has prepared an academic continuity website .
To help students navigate through the unusual circumstances , resources are being maintained by the Division of Undergraduate Education and Student Success and the Graduate School .
Throughout its schools and colleges , the UO has faculty and staff members with expertise in the area of online education , a specialty unto itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials -- in some cases , to create entirely new course plans and materials -- in the span of only a couple weeks .
Faculty collaborations , tip-sharing and peer-to-peer advising have played a key role .
" In English , a wise prof has set up a departmental online-teaching listserv to trade tips and everyone is trading hints and expertise , lots of great collaboration , " said Martha Bayless , a professor in the Department of English .
Bayless has four years ' experience teaching classes online .
She also helps other faculty members new to the process .
" I try to get other profs to take away that online teaching is a superpower , " she said .
" The initial setup can be a bear , but running it is simple and very manageable .
"  Her main advice for beginners ? Keep it simple .
" Our students may be working from a home with few computers or with limited capacity , " she said .
" For your first lessons , I would n't recommend trying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you at the same time .
Save that attempt for some calmer time .
"  Sung Park , a senior instructor with the School of Journalism and Communication , began creating online video tutorials in 2013 , when he was at the University of Ghana on a Fulbright .
Returning to the UO , he continued to record and use these videos in his Gateway to Media course .
He acknowledged that remote learning has some shortcomings -- " there 's a lot of front-end work , and technology can fail " -- and that it would require a pivot for many faculty members .
" With any disruption , there is always innovation , " Park said .
" I 'm looking forward to figuring out solutions for the future of education and to see how we can give students a better experience .
It will help us design better classes both in person and online .
I 'm hoping for some pleasant surprises during this process as we try to tackle the challenges .
