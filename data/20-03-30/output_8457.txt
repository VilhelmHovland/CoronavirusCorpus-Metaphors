A private clinic in Tulsa is offering COVID-19 testing to anybody , even asymptomatic people , who wants one .
You do n't even need a doctor 's referral .
MCI Diagnostics near 71st and Utica says you can register and pre-pay online , drive up , and a worker will take a mouth swab for testing .
Keep in mind that it 's not cheap , at $250 per test .
But the clinic says they 're ready to go and can test around 1,000 people a day .
" Our equipment manufacturer supplied us with 5,000 kits on Friday , " said a manager .
They said their supply of kits will be replenished every three to four days .
Elsewhere , Cura TeleHealth and Wellness near 81st and Sheridan is also offering testing , but you DO need a doctor 's referral there .
It 's cheaper though , at $60 per test .
A day after telling Americans that he would extend his call to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , President Donald Trump said his administration was making big gains in making more tests available to check for the Coronavirus , even as some elected officials said it was clear not all needs were being met .
' Over one million Americans have now been tested , ' the President said from the White House Rose Garden , praising companies for developing newer processes to more quickly test Americans .
' Today we reached a milestone in our war against the Coronavirus , ' Mr .

As the President reportedly told Governors on a Monday call that he has not heard of testing shortages , there are examples readily available - like this from Huntsville , Alabama .
President Trump began his Monday briefing by referencing his Sunday announcement that he would extend social distancing guidelines through the end of April , in a bid to slow the spread of the virus .
Voicing his support for scientific models about the spread of the virus , the President said the move to extend restrictions on social activities would pay off in a big way .

' ' And hopefully , we will keep the deaths down to a minimum , ' the President said , after telling Americans on Sunday that if his administration can keep deaths from the virus to 100,000 , that would be a ' good job .
' For weeks the President had sought to downplay the threat of the virus , saying at one point the number of cases would soon go to zero - but on Sunday , he accepted new scientific models which showed deaths ranging from 100,000 to 200,000 if mitigation efforts to slow the spread are effective .
In his Fox News interview , Mr .
Trump spoke again about conditions at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens , New York , near where the President grew up , as that hospital has been swamped by Coronavirus cases .
' It 's terrible what 's going on , there 's body bags all over , they 're bringing in refrigerator trucks , ' the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built at several locations to bolster medical treatment - including one in Central Park - as the scenes inside local hospitals are getting extra attention from the city tabloids .
While the President has focused on the situation in New York , top health officials have also raised red flags about growing virus problems in other areas - like Louisiana , Chicago , and Detroit .
The total number of deaths in the U .
was nearing 2,500 on Monday morning , as the President said the peak rate was expected by Easter .
Currently , the total number of deaths in the U .
is doubling every three days .
If that pace continues in the short term , the U .
would pass the number of swine flu deaths next week ( 12,000 ) , and reach over 60,000 deaths by Easter .

' Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won .
' ' We will be extending our guidelines to April 30 , to slow the spread , ' Mr .
Trump said , urging Americans to help by limiting their social activities .
' The better you do , the faster this whole nightmare will end , ' the President added .
The President said the decision was made after new modeling made available to the White House estimated the death totals from the Coronavirus could run over 1 million unless strong mitigation efforts were taken by Americans .
At the White House , top federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that the mitigation we are doing right now is having an effect ' The decision to prolong - not prolong , but extend - this mitigation process until the end of April , I think was a wise and prudent decision , ' said Dr .
Anthony Fauci .
White House Coronavirus expert Dr .
Deborah Birx said the ' growing number of potential fatalities ' shown by the models made clear the need for more action to hold down the spread of the virus .
Birx told reporters it is ' not a simple situation when you ask people to stay home for another 30 days , so they have to know that we really built this on scientific evidence and the potential to save hundreds of thousands of American lives .
' " To every metro area out there , we have to do better , ' Dr .
Birx said at the Sunday briefing .
With some public friction over the federal Coronavirus response , President Donald Trump on Friday again singled out the Governor of Michigan and the Governor of Washington State for criticism , telling reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either one to discuss the virus response .
' When they 're not appreciative to me , they 're not appreciative to the Army Corps ( of Engineers ) , they 're not appreciative to FEMA .
It 's not right , ' President Trump said at a Friday White House briefing .
' All I want them to do , very simple , I want them to be appreciative , ' the President added .
' We 've done a great job , ' the President said .
' I think the media and governors should appreciate it .
' The President 's comments came as he continued to spar long distance with Gov .
Jay Inslee ( D ) of Washington State , and Gov .
Gretchen Whitmer ( D ) of Michigan .
Inslee has already been a frequent target of the President - who referred to him in one briefing as a ' snake ' - acknowledging that he has urged Vice President Pence not to call the Washington Democrat .
' I say Mike , do n't call the Governor of Washington , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
' Do n't call the woman in Michigan .
' In an interview Thursday night with Sean Hannity on Fox News , the President took aim at Whitmer , who has complained of troubles in getting medical supplies for hospitals to combat the virus outbreak .
' We 've had a big problem with the young , a woman governor , you know who I 'm talking about from Michigan , ' the President said .
While Gov .
Whitmer went on TV to respond to the President , Inslee used Mr .
Trump 's favored mode of social media .
' I 'm not going to let personal attacks from the president distract me from what matters : beating this virus and keeping Washingtonians healthy , ' Inslee tweeted .
While Inslee avoided barbs from the White House on Friday night , Whitmer did not .
" Governor , Gretchen " Half " Whitmer is way in over her ahead , she does n't have a clue , " the President tweeted .
Michigan has become a flash point in recent days in the fight to stop the Coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as the two previous days combined .
28 deaths were announced on Friday in Washington State , raising the death toll there to 175 people , second most of any state .
