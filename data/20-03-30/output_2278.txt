Ontario allows youth to remain in care after passing cut-off age during pandemic  TORONTO -- Youth in Ontario 's child welfare system who pass the cut-off age during the COVID-19 pandemic will remain in care , says a new moratorium issued by the province .
That means the 800 to 1000 young people who would age out of state care this year in Ontario wo n't face losing their home , caregivers and financial supports while also navigating the pandemic .
Other provinces have not made the same commitment , raising fears that hundreds of youth will end up couch surfing or sleeping on the streets at a time that physical distancing is recommended , and housing , employment and community supports are not easily accessible .
" No young person should be worried about losing their support system in this situation , " said Hannah Anderson , a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Children , Community and Social Services .
" We have officially filed a regulation so that throughout the COVID-19 outbreak , no youth in care or former youth in care in Ontario will age out of the supports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  While age cut-offs vary across the country , children who grow up in foster care typically lose that placement and their caregivers at the age of 18 .
" They are essentially evicted from foster care , " says Jane Kovarikova , founder of Child Welfare Political Action Committee Canada and a former foster child herself .
She says that some then get an allowance and other supports to live independently until 21 but others receive no supports after 18 .
The new Ontario regulation directs child welfare agencies to provide the same level of support that is currently being received throughout the pandemic for youth who would otherwise age-out of the system .
Advocates welcomed the step .
" Children in the care of the Canadian child welfare system are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious impacts of pandemics .
Issuing a moratorium on youth aging out of care is an important acknowledgment of our profound responsibility to meet the needs of youth and I applaud this action , " said Barbara Fallon , Canada Research Chair in Child Welfare at the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been advocating for this change .
The Child Welfare League of Canada issued a statement earlier in the week calling on all governments to " immediately and indefinitely " suspend legislated aged cut-offs for youth reaching the age of majority .
" Youth are worried and need clear reassurance that all of their provinces will have their back , " says Rachel Gouin , the group 's executive director .
" Once youth age out , many experience homelessness or increased mental health problems , as well as food insecurity and isolation , " says Alisha Bowie , aging-out program manager for the Adoption Council of Canada , who was involved with the child welfare system as a child .
She says that outcomes for youth leaving care are not good at the best of times .
" Now with the pandemic , it will be harder to access services .
"  Outside Ontario , many continue to advocate for change during the pandemic .
Susan Russell , organizer for Fostering Change in B .
, has been campaigning for improved support for these youth for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says two of her siblings transitioned from the system without supports and did not survive into adulthood .
British Columbia has 700 youth each year who leave state care at the age of 19 , she said .
" I want all youth to look forward to their 19th birthday , " Russell said , but most face the reality of trying to find housing and support themselves on a maximum of $1,250 per month , and officials have told her that although they are reviewing the issue , not to expect a moratorium similar to Ontario 's .
Meanwhile in Alberta , which had the highest age cut-off for services at 24 , new legislation was already scheduled to come into effect on April 1 to reduce the age to 22 , says Bowie , of the Adoption Council of Canada .
" As far as we know there is no extended support being offered in Alberta .
That means about 500 young people in that age group will be losing their financial support and the support of their worker .
