Fake news or real news .
The virus sure as hell started somewhere and spread from there .
Not exactly impossible for us to work that out .
Question is will that ever be established now .
Somehow I doubt it .
Like all events on earth it had a cause and a beginning .
This ridiculous idea that ' Fake News ' and the mistrust of the media , politicians and newspapers is somehow something new is absurd .
already have classified information secured away by living politicians that can not be realeased in our lifetime .
the death of Mr Kelly over the Iraq War for example .
Chilcott spent 7 years wasting tax-payers money and we are still no nearer the truth .
do n't expect truth from the media , the politicians or anyone .
are all condemned by your own prejudices , political persuasions and your infuriating point scoring .
it does n't matter how long you live you will never be honest , truthful and worthy of our trust .
I have always had contempt for the entire media .
Could have been a non issue if the government had been honest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n a specific website .
The real fuel for fake news is the lies from politicians that make us look for other answers .
Lord Sumption : " Anyone who has studied history will recognise here the classic symptoms of collective hysteria , " he claimed .
" Hysteria is infectious .
We are working ourselves up into a lather in which we exaggerate the threat and stop asking ourselves whether the cure may be worse than the disease .
"  Only we wo n't know whether it 's a hysterical reaction is intended , or whether it 's simply happened through a natural progression of events .
's so much fake news , with countless apps that allow any photos to be photoshopped .
Believe at your peril .
People have theories , and they 're either ignored , hyped , maligned .
People 's reactions are usually built on subconscious prejudices .
thrive on this human weakness , as do businesses and religions .
They love it , and the Internet has been a godsend for them .
Electronic devices are now readily available that can create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread it at lightening speeds .
Anybody who has n't known anything but the Internet to receive their news and stories has n't got a chance .
They 'll go on the number of clicks .
More clicks means they 're more likely to believe .
More likely the story 'll become viral and held to be true , but with no basis .
Emptor  I received a well made one yesterday , which looked like an official post on gov .
, claiming that studies showed alcohol increased the risk of contracting coronavirus and as such the government were about to ban sales .
I panicked for a full 3minutes , carefully checking online that it was definitely a hoax , I needed a large gin to settle the nerves : - )  Most people do n't want objective truth .
They want their own views to be reflected back at them .
In the UK , all mainstream ' print ' media has a narrative to which nearly all articles are sculpted to fit .
If you read the Torygraph and the Guardian on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same but the messages being imparted are almost diametrically opposed - " red meat to the base " , if you will .
If there was demand for a ' centrist ' , objective publication - it would exist .
The only surprising thing is that there are still people that believe there is such a thing as completely unbiased truth .
Most news is just people doing stupid stuff , which happens in all places at all times , to a degree , and is therefore not really ' news ' .
And when stupid stuff happens , people naturally have different ideas on who did it , how stupid it actually was , and what it really means , if anything ; and they 'll never ever all agree .
So fake news is n't really fake , or news , but the history of humanity unfurling somewhere .
Yes I 've already heard myths that this Coronavirus was made in a lab .
Do people have anyway of verifying this ? No they do n't , but seems a lot of people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Coronavirus is also reinforcing people 's prejudices about whatever group of people they have prejudices against .
" Almost half of people think the government failed to act fast enough to tackle the coronavirus outbreak in the country , and a third do not trust the prime minister to manage the crisis , polling suggests .
"  This of course may well mean that more than half did not agree that the government failed to act fast enough .
But this would not occur to the casual news reader , unaware as thry may be of the inbuilt agenda of the news source in question , and they will therefore leave with the wrong impression .
Outrageously fake news - the news which is an outright lie - is fairly easy to spot and tk combat .
It is the more subtle type , by the more professional news organisations , where lying is done by omission , or over- or under- emphasis , or is even done unconsciously , which is more insidious .
But it is our responsibility .
It has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingertips it is easier than ever to fact check claims made by dodgy media and even dodgier politicians but our innate laziness and desire to believe the worst encourages this behaviour .
Only the other day a friend posted a video on Facebook of an American doctor who links covid 19 to the rollout of 5G and the Spanish flu epidemic to the spread of radio .
It took just a couple of minutes search to be able to completely debunk the claims .
Charlatans and shysters need to be challenged at every point and their lies exposed .
That is the responsibility of us all .
James O'Brien of LBC has an excellent phrase that encapsulates this problem viz " it 's easier to sell tickets for the ghost train than the speak your weight machine " .
Our society has become one that desires to be spoon fed thrills and scandals rather than the truth .
Unless we change we will be forever stuck with charlatans like Johnson and Cummings who are ever willing to play fast and lose with people 's livelihoods and their very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes off on one of his many uninformed rants as if what he says is the gospel , and his supporters ( who apparently do n't have ears to hear what he says ) , believe it .
, Trudeau and company ( and provincial premiers and mayors of all cities large and small ) have done a very good job here , but then they do believe in science .
The most fake news in the USA , comes from Trump and his Fox News friends , yet he has the nerve to call most serious stations and newspapers " the fake news .
" And the tragic reality is that Trumpists believe him .
