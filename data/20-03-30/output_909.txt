WASHINGTON -- In another warning sign of how hard the coronavirus crisis may punish the U .
economy , American consumer confidence in March saw its sharpest drop since the Great Recession in 2008 .
Until now , relatively high levels of confidence have consistently buoyed personal spending and the economy as a whole because 70% of total U .
economic output , or gross domestic product , is tied directly to consumer spending .
Richard Curtin , director of the University of Michigan 's closely followed confidence survey , said the findings may significantly understate the reversal underway because most of its interviews were conducted before lockdowns and physical distancing were widely ordered in mid-March .
The survey was released Friday .
Separate reports Friday provided some glimmers of hope .
They showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In February after-tax income , important for consumer spending , kept growing at about a 4% annual pace .
Anecdotal reports indicate online sales are also up sharply at many firms .
And House passage Friday of the roughly $2-trillion stimulus plan is expected to help lift consumer sentiments and spending , as well as the broader economy -- at least for the immediate future .
The package includes direct payments of $1,200 to most individual taxpayers as well as a wide range of spending to boost unemployment compensation and to help keep people from getting laid off .
" If we could replace some of the lost income , that 'll provide a backstop for people to at least feel they have spending power when they need it , " said Jack Kleinhenz , chief economist at the National Retail Federation , a trade group .
President Trump has been eager to lift restrictions that have kept millions of Americans hunkered down in their homes , and he has repeatedly predicted a sharp economic turnaround due to pent-up demand .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said Friday before signing the $2-trillion bailout bill .
But many economists agree that the recovery is likely to be slow , not the quick snap back that Trump suggests .
" Will we have lingering issues that will mute some of the recovery ? Yes , " said Shawn DuBravac , an economist who specializes in consumer electronics .
One big reason is uncertainty over the spread of the COVID-19 disease and the many months likely to be needed to produce a vaccine for widespread distribution .

Another reason for analysts ' concern is that many businesses and households have lost incomes and earnings , and the plunge in stocks has hammered people 's retirement finances , as well as their feelings of security .
The Dow on Friday ended a three-day rally by falling 915 and is now down 27% from its mid-February high .
The University of Michigan survey showed a sharp negative turn in people 's attitudes not just about current conditions but also future expectations for the economy and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data suggest that the economy has already entered a recession and that " the economic downturn could persist at least until the end of the year .
"  The index saw an 11 .
percentage point drop , compared to the 12 .
point drop during the Great Recession .
" Perhaps the most important takeaway is that the largest proportion of consumers in nearly 10 years anticipated that the national unemployment rate will increase in the year ahead , " Curtin said .
Consumer confidence is closely linked to job and income trends , and both look ominous as layoffs have skyrocketed across the country .
Curtin said Friday that he doubts the economy will bounce back quickly after the worst of the pandemic passes .
Some spending will rise as people replace broken appliances and vehicles , but overall spending will " seriously diminish , " he said .
Even if consumers feel comfortable going out to shop again in physical stores , Curtin thinks many will put off big discretionary spending and instead save more money because of uncertainties .

" Most households wish they had more cash on hand , and that 's going to continue in the next several months .
"  On the bright side , consumers are spending substantially more at supermarkets and drug stores as well as other sellers of personal goods .
And many Americans are buying more online than before .
Garrett Breton , president of Comfort One Shoes , which operates 16 stores in Maryland , Virginia and Washington , D .
, said his company had the best-ever sales online on Wednesday -- up 140% compared with the same day a year ago .
Some of the biggest increase has been in running shoes .
" I think what people are doing and able to do right now is to take walks with their families , go running and exercise outside , " Breton said .
NEW YORK -- Stocks scored their first back-to-back gains Wednesday since a brutal sell-off began five weeks ago , but much of an early rally fad .
