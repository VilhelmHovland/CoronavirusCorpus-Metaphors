Source : Breakfast  Foodstuffs last night announced that they will be giving the bonus to all waged front-line , distribution and transport employees who continue to work through the Covid-19 lockdown .
Their supermarkets include Pak'nSave , New World and Four Square .
" This is in recognition of their willingness to ensure New Zealanders ' grocery needs are met and for the tireless commitment they continue to show , " Foodstuffs said in a statement .
" We 've been totally focused on keeping shelves full and ensuring our customers and teams are safe - now that we have a better handle on these things , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and essential team members .
"  Speaking this morning to Breakfast , FIRST Union representative Tali Williams said it was a step in the right direction , but also that the change should have come sooner .
She said the union has been arguing with Foodstuffs to secure a Living Wage for all workers for some time , as many remain on the minimum wage , but Foodstuffs had argued it could n't make decisions on behalf of all of its franchisees .
However , with yesterday 's U-turn , they had shown they could do precisely that if they wanted to , Ms Williams said .
" It took a pandemic for them to hear our cries , but finally they 've done it , " Ms Williams said .
She pointed out that the bonus payments will only apply for the four weeks of the lockdown , and said she does n't want to see those workers going back to minimum wages afterwards .
The union 's phone lines had been " running off the hook " about conditions in supermarkets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being provided with things like personal protective equipment , hand sanitiser and even soap .
She said the union is meeting with Countdown tomorrow to see if a similar arrangement can be reached .
