A coronavirus vaccine from Virginia ? These researchers are working on it .
Carol Gilchrist and Noak Oakland work in the laboratory of Dr .
William Petri at the University of Virginia on Tuesday , March 24 , 2020 .
Petri 's team is working on one approach to a potential COVID-19 vaccine .
( William Petri )  The spiky proteins of the new coronavirus appear all over the place .
From the evening news to this newspaper , close-up pictures of the proteins poking out of a sphere represent the virus at its most pared down .
The virus gets its name from the crown-like points .

William Petri , those proteins are more than an informative illustration .
At his lab at the University of Virginia , he believes understanding them is key to unlocking a potential solution to the ongoing crisis .
Petri , vice chair for research at the school 's Department of Medicine , and his team are working on a COVID-19 vaccine using a new approach that would jumpstart people 's immune response to the virus by adding a new ingredient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not only protect people against the coronavirus , but also improve upon existing vaccines like those used with the seasonal flu .
Scientists around the world are scrambling to develop a coronavirus vaccine , each doing things a little differently in the hopes someone will find the right way .
" In the current setting , the more different approaches , the more chance you have that something will prove to be effective , " said Dr .
Steven Zeichner , another University of Virginia professor who is exploring whether antigen-producing bacteria could be used in a coronavirus vaccine .
" It 's an all hands on deck situation .
"  And with new research suggesting the virus is not mutating quickly , experts believe an eventual vaccine could confer long-term protection , according to the Washington Post , comparing it to a measles or chickenpox vaccine .
" We fully expect there is a protective immunity against COVID-19 , " Petri said .
It 's just a matter of which technique works best .

He expected something like this coronavirus pandemic to happen .

It was " designed to respond to biothreats like this .
"  His research started with work on a vaccine against a parasite that causes amoebic dysentery .
But the assumption was that the scientists could use the work to apply to almost any vaccine , swapping corresponding proteins to protect against other emerging viruses in a kind of " plug and play .
"  The method involves mixing what are called adjuvants -- substances that can produce immune responses -- with the proteins from what you 're immunizing against .
This , theoretically , can stimulate a more potent immune response .
A traditional vaccine would inject the proteins alone .
Petri believes the adjuvants could be used to improve existing vaccines as well .
In recent weeks his team shifted focus to the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cell 's membrane .
Here 's how Petri aims to fight it : The adjuvants mixed into the vaccine would help switch on tollbooth-like receptors that are on cells all over our body , Petri said .

The Virginia team is using compounds that look like bacteria as the adjuvants .
In this way the formulation could be used against any virus -- just swap in the right one .
But Petri stressed the team is a long way off .
He recently applied for a grant from the National Institutes of Health and does n't expect to hear back for at least a couple months .
That , he said , is actually a much shorter timeline than usual because the agency is accelerating related research as it works to mitigate the public health emergency .
Over the next few months in the lab , Petri 's team should be able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response .
What they 're looking for is the ability to neutralize the virus , making antibodies that would prevent the spikes from effectively binding to their target .
" It should work .
But like a lot of things , it might not work , " he said .
Petri knows his would n't be the first vaccine on the market : NIH is already sponsoring one further along , and clinical trials take time .
But he thinks his could help make it better .
" You have an important problem , you want to do work on it from as many angles as you can , " he said .
" The end result we all want is to get a vaccine that protects people .
"  His team is waiting on the DNA they designed to be shipped by companies that make it .
Then they will put them into bacteria and see if they really make the desired antigens , followed by testing whether immune response is boosted in animals .
If it were to work , it 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeichner said .
" All you 'd have to do is grow up the bacteria .
"  It 's very early stages , he said .
He 's also planning to apply soon for NIH funding .
" At this point you feel like if anybody has anything to contribute that could be possibly helpful , you feel obligated to try , " Zeichner said .
