Pedestrian crossings in Sydney will become automated so you wo n't need to push a button  The most consistent piece of health advice that has been shared with the public since the outbreak of Covid-19 in Australia has been to keep our hands clean , primarily by not touching anything outside our homes .
This is because the coronavirus that causes the disease can survive on certain surfaces for hours or even days .
However , some systems , most notably pedestrian crossings , require physical contact to activate , making them potential transmission points for the virus .
Transport NSW is now addressing this issue by making many of its pedestrian crossings automated , so no potentially infectious button-pushing is required .
The system was trialled last week in the CBD area around Martin Place , and now , following the success of that pilot , it is being rolled out across greater Sydney around major health precincts and in areas where there are known to be a greater number of vulnerable people , such as the elderly .
The first deployment will begin in Randwick at the Sydney Children 's Hospital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown , St Vincent 's Hospital in Darlinghurst , the Children 's Hospital in Westmead , before arriving in Liverpool , St Leonards and Blacktown in the next week .
