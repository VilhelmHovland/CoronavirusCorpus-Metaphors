Covid-19 : A global threat  Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) is an infectious horrific disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .
The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan , the Capital of China 's Hubei province in December 2019 and has since spread globally , therefore , it was recognized as pandemic by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on 11 March 2020 .
Health authorities in Wuhan , reported many pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 , and an investigation was launched in early January 2020 .
The cases mostly were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin .
The virus that caused the outbreak is SARS-CoV-2 , a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses , pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV .
The earliest known person with symptoms was later traced back to 1 December 2019 , someone who did not have visible connections with the later wet market 's cluster .
Of the early number of cases reported in December 2019 , two-thirds were found to have a link with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report from South China Morning Post suggested that a 55-year-old from Hubei province may have been the first case identified on 17 November 2019 .
The WHO on 26 February , 2020 reported that , as new cases reportedly dropped in China but suddenly increased in Italy , Iran , and South Korea .
There may be substantial underreporting of cases , particularly those with milder symptoms .
Some governments have had an official policy of not testing those with only mild symptoms , including Switzerland and Italy .
By 26 February , relatively few cases have been reported among youth , with those 19 and under making up 2 .
of cases worldwide .
The COVID-19 infected one 's may either be asymptomatic or develop symptoms such as fever , cough , fatigue , shortness of breath , muscle pain , diarrhoea , headache , sputum production , sore throat and loss of smell or taste .
The U .
Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) lists emergency symptoms including difficulty breathing , persistent chest pain or pressure , sudden confusion , difficulty waking , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if these symptoms are present .
Complications can lead to severe pneumonia , acute respiratory distress syndrome , sepsis , septic shock and death .
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic ( test results confirming infection but showing no clinical symptoms ) , therefore , researchers have advised that those with close contact to confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection .
Incubation period ( the time between infection and symptom onset ) ranges from one to 14 days ; it is most commonly five days .
The World Health Organization and Centre for Disease Control stages that the virus mainly spreads during close contact and via respiratory droplets discharged when people cough or sneeze .
Respiratory droplets may be produced during breathing but the virus is not considered airborne .
While there are concerns it may spread via faeces this risk is believed to be low .
People may also catch COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then their face .
It is most contagious when people are symptomatic , although spread may be possible before symptoms appear .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Recommended measures to prevent the virus spreading include frequent hand washing , social distancing , covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue , keeping unwashed hands away from the face , travel restrictions and quarantines .
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 .
Management involves treatment of symptoms , supportive care , isolation , and experimental measures .
To prevent the spread of the disease , frequent hand washing is recommended .
The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds , especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty ; before eating ; and after blowing one 's nose , coughing , or sneezing .
Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume must be used when soap and water are not readily available .
However , in some other countries , like Lebanon , they recommended a hand wash for at least 30 seconds while avoiding using alcohol-based hand sanitizer .
The WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes , nose , or mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public .
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places .
Thailand 's health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home out of cloth and wash them daily .
The Czech Republic banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one 's nose and mouth .
Social distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between individuals .
Methods include quarantines ; travel restrictions ; and the closing of schools , workplaces , stadiums , theatres , or shopping centres .
Individuals may apply physical distancing methods by staying at home , limiting travel , avoiding crowded areas , using no-contact greetings , and physically distancing themselves from others .
On 22 March 2020 , Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people .
Older ones and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes , heart disease , respiratory disease , hypertension , and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak .
In late March 2020 , the WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term " social distancing " with " physical distancing " , to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections , either virtually or at a distance .
The use of the term " social distancing " had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation , rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others via alternative means .
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV .
It is thought to have a zoonotic origin .
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus , in subgenus Sarbecovirus ( lineage B ) together with two bat-derived strains .
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples ( BatCov RaTG13 ) .
In February 2020 , Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between the viruses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison to date found at most 92% of genetic material shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 , which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host .
The standard method of diagnosis is by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rRT-PCR ) from a nasopharyngeal swab .
The infection can also be diagnosed from a combination of symptoms , risk factors and a chest CT scan showing features of pneumonia .
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 , but research into developing a vaccine has been undertaken by various agencies including testing of existing medications .
Depending on the severity , oxygen therapy , intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required .
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes .
Several compounds , which were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases , are being investigated .
