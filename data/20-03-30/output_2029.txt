Taming coronavirus rampage  Running out of ventilators is a real possibility .
And Walton comes to rescue .
For weeks now , the nation has been obsessed with one set of numbers : how many confirmed cases of coronavirus and how many have died ?  But there is a whole other set of numbers the public needs to start paying attention to : how many ventilators do we have in this country ?  Ventilators blow oxygen into the lungs of patients suffering from severe pulmonary stress and are essential for saving the lives of the sickest COVID-19 patients .
Bangladesh has just 1,250 ventilators -- 500 in public hospitals and 750 in the private ones -- according to Md Aminul Hasan , director for hospitals and clinic at the Directorate General of Health Services .
If the pandemic spreads , the country with more than 16 crore population will need at least 25,000 ventilators , said AM Shamim , managing director of Labaid Group , which owns a chain of private hospitals .
But ventilators are in short supply at the moment , given the rate at which the lethal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent weeks , countries around the world have been scrambling to build and buy as many of them as possible .
Although regular manufacturers like Medtronic , Philips , Draegerwerk and Getinge said they have boosted their production , big names of other industries such as General Motors , Airbus , McLaren and Dyson have offered their engineering expertise or factory lines .
At the time of writing , the total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the globe stand at 740,157 and the total number of deaths 35,097 .
One of the options available to Bangladesh is to explore scope of getting the device brought in from China , where the number of COVID-19 cases have dropped .
And another way is to explore the scope of making ventilators locally and develop manpower by training to run the devices properly .
The government is on this course and has enlisted the service of local tech giant Walton to manufacture it with support from Medtronic .
" We have already had a huge chat with the Medtronic team , which is run by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured us to help in manufacturing ventilators in our country , " said Zunaid Ahmed Palak , state minister for the ICT division , yesterday in an online press conference .
Palak with this team attended a video conference on Saturday with the research and development team of Medtronic and they have assured to share their source code .
" We are very hopeful to get their source code and patent by Wednesday and might go for manufacturing within the shortest possible time .
"  The junior state minister said he has already informed the prime minister of the development and spoke with the health minister over phone .
" It will be a huge mileage for Bangladesh , " Palak added .
Access to Information ( a2i ) programme under ICT division is coordinating the issue and with its help Walton has already applied before the directorate general of health services yesterday , Golam Murshed , executive director of Walton , told The Daily Star .
Other than ventilators , Walton said it is planning to manufacture a few other medical devices like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen concentrator and PAPR .
Walton has also applied to import the components for the life-saving machines .
About 50 local engineers have already started work on this project , Murshed said , adding that the company can begin manufacturing the goggles and protective shield from the first week of April and the other equipment after that .
Another group of local engineers and physicians have developed a ventilator named Spondon recently too , said a press statement .
Whether they would go into production anytime soon is undecided .
But the government though is planning to buy another 300 ventilators without further ado , according to Hasan .
" We are getting a lot of call .
But none have the device anymore now , " said Mohamad Saifur Rahman , manager monitoring and analytics therapeutic care of Philips Bangladesh , adding that all five portable ventilators its distributors had were sold recently .
Medical equipment sellers said nearly a dozen firms import and market ventilators made mainly by manufacturers based in the US and Europe .
And because of slow demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they usually do not maintain a large inventory .
" We usually do not have ready stock .
And it is supplied mainly based on order , " said Shahidul Islam , director technical of Widespread Solutions , a medical equipment supplier and marketer in Bangladesh .
It may take seven to 15 days to import the devices into the country if the manufacturer has available stock .
However , getting supply from the US is unlikely right now as demand is through the roof there , he said .
But Md Maniruzzman Bhuiyan , president of the Bangladesh Private Clinic Diagnostic Owners Association ( BPCDOA ) , is not too worried about the shortage of the lifesaving equipment .
" Only a small portion of COVID-19 patients will need ventilator support .
"  Some 80 per cent of the patients recover normally .
Of the remaining 20 percent , the condition of five per cent among them may be critical and they may need ventilator support .
" Let us not think of the worst , " he added .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease by getting people to stay in , said Mohammad Mushtuq Husain , adviser of the Institute Epidemiology , Disease Control and Research ( IEDCR ) .
The government should provide support to the needy so that they do not need to get out of their homes , he added .
Shamim says ventilators can still be managed if the government provides support to the private sector .
The government has given Tk 100 crore for the health sector and if the state bears half the prices of each ventilator the private sector will import a lot .
" We will import 1,000 ventilators in 15 days if the government provides subsidy , " he added .
As of now , the Directorate of Drug Administration ( DGDA ) requested the National Board of Revenue to remove all duty and taxes on import of ventilators , said Director of DGDA Md Mostafizur Rahman .
Arif Mahmud , head of medical of Apollo Hospital that is set to renamed as Evercare Hospital , said the hospital is in the process of adding 20 more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siddique , chief administrative officer of Square Hospital , however said having the equipment only will not be helpful .
" It requires trained manpower including trained intensivist respiratory therapists and trained nurses to run the machines , " he said , adding that Square can help train human resource to run the machines .
