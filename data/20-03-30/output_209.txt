Airbnb will waive all fees for stays arranged through this initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifesaving support during the coronavirus outbreak and we want to help , " said Airbnb 's Co-founder Joe Gebbia .
" We 've heard from countless hosts around the world who want to provide a comforting home to heroic first responders .
We are connecting our nonprofit partners , government agencies and others with our incredible host community to work together in these extraordinary times .
"  The initiative builds on a pilot program launched earlier this week in France where Airbnb and the French government announced that doctors , nurses , caregivers and other medical support staff who are responding to the outbreak in the country can access free accommodation through Airbnb .
The Airbnb community has already responded to the call , with nearly 4,000 hosts in the country offering their homes after the announcement on Tuesday .
To enable healthcare providers and other COVID-19 responders to find housing , Airbnb will be working with businesses , nonprofits , and government and emergency management agencies supporting these responders .

If hosts are not able to host for free , Airbnb will still waive all fees on the stay .
Accommodation for relief and medical workers , who have higher exposition to COVID-19 , requires robust preventive practices and stringent safety standards .
Airbnb takes the health and safety of its community very seriously and has worked with leading experts and officials to develop a protocol for hosts who support this collective health effort .
The protocol will be updated to incorporate new requirements from local and national authorities and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
We are working with experts to continuously enhance our approach , including Dr .
Larry Brilliant , a renowned epidemiologist and Chair of Ending Pandemics .
Brilliant will also involve several nationally recognised experts from his consultancy , Pandefense , in this effort .
" While science is still developing around COVID-19 , and there is a lot we do not know , we have provided guidance to support the Airbnb community participating in immediate efforts with governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for response and preparedness , the Airbnb community is in a unique position to help .
I applaud Airbnb for working under conditions of such uncertainty to provide housing for first responders and medical staff working in this pandemic .
We are working to provide clear communication and resources , based on rapidly evolving knowledge about this novel virus and best practices on sanitation , in order to help keep communities as safe as possible , " said Dr .
Larry Brilliant .
Examples of safe hosting recommendations include listing entire homes and agreeing to a number of safety requirements including enhanced cleaning , social distancing with their guests , and allowing 72 hours between stays .
Airbnb 's partners or affiliates will ensure that stays are COVID-19 related and responders are familiar with safety protocols .
To learn more and to open their homes , hosts can go to airbnb .
