Dozier , Detroit Free Press  " It was good for her to win Miss Basketball , " Blakely said .
" I 'm trying to win Mr .
Baseball , but this year there 's a lot of stuff going around .
"  Specifically the coronavirus pandemic , which shut down most of the high school winter sports postseason tournaments and is holding the start of spring sports hostage with schools " very unlikely " to resume this school year , Gov .
Gretchen Whitmer said Friday .
Edison was scheduled to begin its baseball game schedule March 25 .
Blakely , a shortstop , is the top high school prospect in the state and one of the best in the country -- Kalamazoo native and Hall of Famer Derek Jeter has noticed him -- which is why he is desperately waiting for the season to begin .
" I 'm upset , but I 'm still taking advantage of my days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit .
" I still go outside .
I 'll still run , I 'll still go to a field and take ground balls and hit just in case something gets reversed .
I 'm disappointed , but it 's out of my control .
"  Last spring he hit .
in 96 at-bats with four home runs , six triples , 10 doubles , 34 RBIs , scored 44 runs and had 24 stolen bases .
He first visited Michigan , then Auburn , Texas , Arizona State and Florida State before deciding on the Tigers , who put together a generous scholarship offer in a sport where no one receives a full athletic scholarship .

Dozier , Detroit Free Press )  " Auburn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They really stood out to me .
In college you do n't get everything .
I was able to get an offer I could n't refuse .
"  So this is not a guy in need of a scholarship .
This is about someone who also could be an early-round pick in the upcoming major league draft -- though his odds of that may have changed with Friday 's reported agreement to shorten this year 's draft to possibly as few as five rounds .
But in order to be an early pick , Blakely needs to reassure scouts and front office personnel that he can play even better than his impressive showing last summer .
" That 's the biggest thing -- pro scouts , " he said .
It is n't as if Blakely is a stranger to scouting departments of major league organizations .
In fact , it is easier for him to list the teams that have n't had an in-house visit with him -- the Mets , Nationals , Astros and Phillies .
" There were times it was me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouts and the special director of operations , one step below the general manager , " Blakely said at the dining room table , pointing to six chairs .
" There were plenty of teams that came with their scouting directors .
"  Those are the kinds of people who only go to the home of a player who is in demand .
At 6-foot-3 , 184 pounds , Blakely checks a lot of boxes .

Dozier , Detroit Free Press )  " With his body , he projects really well , " said a local scout , who is not authorized to speak with the media about prospects .
" He 's going to get nothing but bigger and stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he can throw .
He hits from the left side .
He can field at shortstop .
"  But there is more to Blakely than being a slick fielding , good-hitting shortstop .
' He 's a baseball rat , " the scout said .
" He understands the game , understands the process .
Auburn does n't walk in and give scholarships to just anybody .
"  Baseball , not football  There were signs he was a baseball talent as far back as T-ball .
His older brother , Christian -- a junior at Michigan , where he was on the 2019 fall baseball roster as a walk-on -- remembers how Werner drew attention during one of those games .
" He was up to bat , and this was T-ball , mind you , so nobody was completely crushing the ball , " he said .
" He hit the ball so far , it literally went over the street , the parkway and another street .
" Everybody just looked at him and it was like : ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really just do that ? ' "  Werner Blakely who plays baseball for Detroit Edison high school is one of the top prospects in the state works out in his backyard Sunday , March 22 , 2020 .

Dozier , Detroit Free Press )  Their father , also named Werner , was more of a football guy growing up .
He played at Detroit Henry Ford and Eastern Michigan , where he was the 1999 defensive MVP , and also was elected to the school 's all-decade team .
He did n't force his three children -- Krista is a freshman at EMU and a standout volleyball player -- to play a particular sport .
" I told them all to find something that you feel passionate about and you do n't have to pick it early on , " he said .
" I told them to try different things .
" But I figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  It was the boys ' grandfather , Ira Blakely , who got them involved in baseball and saw they had the talent .
So the father began coaching them .
" He did n't know anything about it , " the younger Werner said , laughing .
" There would be drills like he would make us run , get a leaf and put it on a gate and practice throwing the ball at the gate .
"  To avoid having the boys with different practice times each day , their father wanted Werner to play up on Christian 's teams .
That meant he went directly to kids pitching , and Werner was terrified .
" I was scared to hit pitching , " he said .
" There would be plenty of times I 'd be in the box and I would be crying .
My dad would call time , and say , ' What are you scared of ? ' I told him , ' I do n't want the ball to hit me .
'  " My dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move .

Dozier , Detroit Free Press )  Edison 's Mark Brown has coached high-level summer teams for decades .
Blakely was 11 and a catcher when Brown saw him play .
" I just watched his workout , " he said .
" I saw his hands and his footwork and I knew this dude is too athletic to be behind the plate .
After practice I asked his dad if I could hit him some ground balls to see if he could play shortstop and he was a natural .
"  Soon Blakely was playing for Brown in the summer , but knew he needed better competition than he could find in Michigan .
He got involved with USA Baseball as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams in the country .
The summer after his freshman year , he received a scholarship offer from Alabama .
Central Michigan followed , and then every Division I team in the state .
Last summer he played for the East Coast Sox of Columbus , Mississippi , which annually has some of the top prospects on its roster .
" Did you ever hear of Bobby Witt Jr .
? " Blakely asked .
" He played for them and was the ( No .
2 ) pick in the draft last year .
And they picked me to replace Witt ! "  ' Jeter said he heard of me '  Blakely was one of 80 players to attend the month-long IMG Academy in Florida , where Jeter and Barry Larkin , another Hall of Famer , were honorary captains .
Jeter took an interest in Blakely .
" He said he heard of me , " he said .
" He said some people are comparing us because of size .
He said in terms of height , weight and projectability , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down-to-earth guy .
"  The two have more in common than that .
Each fall before the school year began , Jeter and his sister had to sign contracts with their parents , promising to maintain their grades or they would not be permitted to play sports .
" Who does that sound like , Christian ? " Blakely asked his brother .
" Between my freshman , sophomore year , I did n't get good enough grades , so my dad said he would n't pay for travel ball that year .
So I had to ask a coach if I could play , but I could n't pay .
" It was humbling , but I 'm OK .
"  Blakely -- who has a 3 .
grade-point average -- went to Chicago for the Under Armor All-America game last summer , and was in Jupiter , Florida , in October for the prestigious WWBA World Championships .

Dozier , Detroit Free Press )  " It 's the best tournament in the world go to , " he said .
" I had a really good Jupiter -- made really , really good plays , hit the ball really , really well and that kind of boosted my draft stock .
And I was seeing guys throwing 96 , 97 and I was hitting triples off them .
"  For now , Blakely is searching for places where he can work on his skills .
The Michigan High School Athletics Association has halted all sports activities during the coronavirus pandemic , including practices and strength and conditioning sessions , and no one is allowed to use school facilities .
" His work ethic is second to none , " Brown said .
" He 's the kind of kid that will practice with us and get our work in , but Werner is going to go home , have dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  The next level is n't that far away , whether it 's college or the pros , and that 's why Blakely is so eager to get back to school and on the diamond .
" You hate putting all these expectations on these kids , but he 's legit , " the scout said .
" He projects in the top three rounds .
"  Blakely just wants it to start as soon as possible so he can begin to figure out where he will be next season .
" I 'll put myself in a position where I can do either or , " he said .
" But I committed to Auburn for a reason .
I 'm really excited to get to Auburn .
Whatever happens , happens .
" Control what I can control is what I say .
