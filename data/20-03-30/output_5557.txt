The Agony of Caring for a Dying Parent During the Pandemic  ( Bloomberg Businessweek ) -- Every day now , I go to visit my father and mother in a care home in the English home counties , where they have retreated to what we all hope is a kind of safety from the Covid-19 coronavirus .
And every day , as I walk into the building , perform the three-stage hand-disinfection process , and have a temperature gun pressed to my forehead , I feel guilt : No one should be allowed in to visit , and yet I am glad they make an exception .
I have been isolating for weeks , my father is in the final stages of brain cancer , and I love him .
I do not want to miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never easy ; all adults know this .
But in the time of this coronavirus , it is hard to describe just how much more complicated and fearful that process has become .
Policy makers , as well as politicians and commentators brave or foolish enough to scream tactical advice from the sidelines -- whether to risk the economy by closing businesses , or build " herd immunity , " or isolate only the U .
's 1 .
million most vulnerable -- need to understand how this vicious circle works .
They need to understand because it dooms to reversal or irrelevance such responses as " America is n't built to be shut down " and " THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS ! " that U .
President Donald Trump has sent from his Twitter account .
So , too , the denials from U .
government officials that London might be locked down , like Paris and some other capitals on the continent , because the U .
-- " a land of liberty " as Prime Minister Boris Johnson put it -- is not that kind of country .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown of the capital , shortly after shuttering the schools it had said would stay open just a week before .
As for borders , the Trump administration shut them only after the virus had arrived and then was slow to test and track those arriving with the disease .
The only borders that matter now to my parents and millions like them around the globe are those between themselves and the rest of humanity .
Isolation is impossible when you need care .
I have been helping my mother and sister , a former nurse , to look after my Dad at home since February , when he received the news we hoped would never come : His cancer had returned and was no longer treatable .
Long before self-isolation became a thing in the U .
, we were self-isolating in their three bedroom apartment .
It has been brutally sad , at times also joyful .
When we wheeled my father to meals , the four of us retold family stories repeated , no matter how often , over the years and cried with laughter .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on together and wo n't make again .
" Where would you like to go today ? " she 'd ask .
Yellowstone was a favorite .
And each time my sister lifted him in or out of bed , using an old-school double " bear hug " maneuver , he 'd pat her back affectionately with his right arm wrapped around her .
Every morning while we tried to keep my father at home , we could hear the Macmillan nurses -- a very special group of people from a charity that gives palliative care to late stage cancer patients -- cackling behind the bedroom door as he jousted with them .
But even they , the nearest that someone as irreligious as myself can imagine to angels , posed a threat .
They could carry the virus to my parents , age 86 and 81 , without even being aware they had it .
Some had children in school , some had husbands and wives who worked and took public transport ; all of them had to eat and therefore , to shop .
So long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , and life went on more or less as usual , they had to push the same shopping cart handles and press the same buttons of the " pay and display " parking machines as everyone else .
The same was true of the National Health Service 's district nurses who came to visit , of my parents ' doctor , of their friends from the apartment complex , and of my sister and me and our spouses and children .
We began to isolate from our families and friends weeks ago .
Yet , as my father became more ill and needed more help , even the morning nurse visits , combined with the devotion of my sister and mother -- waking to help him as many as 16 times per night -- were not enough .
Forced to choose between shifts of agency nurses coming into the flat to care for him or having him go into a home , we asked my father what he 'd prefer .
As always , he went with what he thought was best for us : a home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorker marooned among Brits since 1968 , my Dad may have lost the use of his left side and other functions in recent weeks , but the ease , curiosity , and humor he 's always had with other people remain .
He wants to know where the home 's nurses and caregivers are from ; in most cases , he 's been there .
He ran cargo all his life , first on trucks through Europe to the former Soviet Union and Iran .
( He was in Tabriz when the revolution struck .
) Later , he built a small company that organized freight on passenger planes to all points , from Thailand to Cuba .
He contracted Russian aircraft with Ukrainian pilots to drop food aid in Africa .
His caregivers mostly have native English accents , but their origins are in Benin , Latvia , Spain , Zimbabwe , and pretty much everywhere else .
Working nonstop across 12-hour shifts , they are extraordinarily kind .
He invents nicknames for them , rather than use the ones on their badges .
One petite nurse is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  The home is beautiful and probably more locked-down in terms of hygiene than the rotations of agency nurses we would have had to rely on at home .
Even so , it poses the same threats .
There are about 30 patients , as well as 50 caregivers and nurses , plus cooks and other staff to look after them .
They all live out in the world , and all have to eat and shop , even in the age of online deliveries .
" Muscles " has five children .
My mother checked herself into the home , too , so she could be in the same room with my Dad at night , when he 's most anxious , to help him and hold his hand .
It was their 60th wedding anniversary last year .
" She pokes , " my father says .
The other night , she called me , distraught after watching a TV news item about a care home in the next county , where this coronavirus had ripped through the building and infected three quarters of residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise liners , " she said , worrying that we might have made the wrong choice and that she and my father could become trapped in a fatal petri dish of Covid-19 .
Her care home has since told its residents they are confined to their rooms , to prevent mingling in the common areas .
Of course , there 's a debate even among epidemiologists about just how different this coronavirus is from the flus that kill tens of thousands people every year .
Given that every country so far has imposed radical measures to slow the spread of the virus once hit , we may not know for years what happens if you do n't .
Yet the doctors who have struggled , and in some cases died caring for patients in China and Italy seem pretty convinced that Covid-19 is very different indeed .
For my parents and for thousands , if not millions , of others in our aging societies , there are no safe choices while the herd is getting immunity .
There is no way to separate the elderly and vulnerable from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for them .
The only way to stop them dying in numbers is to dramatically slow the spread of the virus through the population as a whole , a conclusion that some countries have come to sooner than others .
China , after initially doing everything possible wrong , halted the spread by cracking down decisively on movement and mingling .
South Korea also seems to have turned the tide through mass testing to track and block the spread of the disease .
Italy has discovered the cost of being behind the curve , of trying to balance human life against personal freedom and economic pain ; only now , after a nationwide lockdown made more devastating by its delay , has the death rate stopped accelerating .
The U .
and the U .
are catching up .
Whatever their leaders may have said before , as the death toll begins the same geometric climb seen elsewhere they have found that theirs , too , are the kinds of societies that are ready to curb personal liberties .
They , too , have started locking down life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it takes to get the contagion under control .
Because it 's that kind of disease .
