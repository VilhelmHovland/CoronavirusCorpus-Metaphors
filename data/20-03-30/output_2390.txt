Canada to cut number of troops in Ukraine due to COVID-19 pandemic  Chief of the Defence Staff Jonathan Vance delivers remarks at the Ottawa Conference on Security and Defence in Ottawa , on March 4 , 2020 .
THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang  OTTAWA -- The Canadian Armed Forces plans to withdraw the 200 troops it currently has in Ukraine and replace them with a skeleton force next month to hold the fort until the COVID-19 pandemic has passed .
That means the soldiers will be returning to Canada as scheduled , though there was no immediate word on what quarantine restrictions the returning troops will be under , including whether they will be allowed to stay in their homes or barracks .
The soldiers arrived in Ukraine in October and are the latest Canadian contingent to take part in what is now a five-year mission to train Ukrainian soldiers .
The training mission was launched in 2015 after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and started to support separatist forces in Ukraine 's eastern Donbass region in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and left tens of thousands more wounded or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent days over what to do with the mission , dubbed Operation Unifier , amid strict orders against non-essential travel and activities to protect the Armed Forces from COVID-19 .
" In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic situation both at home and abroad , and the suspension of non-critical activities on our deployed operations , the decision has been made to reduce the number of personnel departing in early April on Op Unifier , " Capt .
Alexia Croizer of the Canadian Joint Operations Command said in an email on Thursday .
" Where approximately 200 CAF members were scheduled to deploy , approximately 60 members will now relieve the current rotation of personnel expected back in Canada at the end of April following the completion of their six-month deployment .
"  With training efforts suspended due to COVID-19 , the replacement force is expected to largely hunker down to ride out the pandemic while maintaining the Canadian military 's presence in the country .
The other 140 military personnel who were scheduled to deploy to Ukraine will remain on high alert back home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
Commanders will reassess in June whether they should join their comrades or not .
" Every measure will be taken to ensure the health and safety of our deploying personnel to Ukraine , as we are currently doing so with our deployed ( Canadian Armed Forces ) members under Op Unifier , " Croizer added .
Defence chief Gen .
Jonathan Vance this month ordered a halt to all non-essential military movement and activities to protect the force from COVID-19 while those involved in the training mission -- like most Canadian troops deployed overseas -- are on lockdown due to the pandemic .
The military 's " operational pause " was expected to last only three weeks , but in a letter to military personnel last week , Vance said Forces members must " face the reality " that it may last longer to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and the respiratory illness it causes .
Ukrainian public health officials reported 156 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country as of Tuesday , with five deaths .
There were two confirmed cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian troops are based .
Andriy Shevchenko , the Ukrainian ambassador to Canada , emphasized the importance of the training mission in an interview earlier this week , noting the war in the Donbass region continues to rage nearly six years after it started .
Ukrainian and Canadian military officials are looking at ways to resume the training mission while preventing the virus from spreading , he added .
Concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 among military personnel were underscored this week when the U .
Navy reported the respiratory illness has infected members of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt .
The vessel was patrolling the Philippine and South China Seas but has since been ordered to Guam amid reports the illness was spreading throughout the ship .
