Beyond health and safety concerns , one of the biggest sources of anxiety for people right now is keeping themselves and their families fed .
While it 's easy to invest in a whole bunch of dried pasta and beans , buying vegetables , storing perishables , and planning meals can feel a bit confusing .
Luckily the editors of the Joy of Cooking are dispensing some truly helpful food tips on via their Twitter account .
Advertisement  So far they 've posted two fire threads -- one on perishables and one on meal planning .
The meal planning thread was particularly helpful to me , as I tend to shop several times a week for whatever I need for a day or two , rather than plan for an entire seven days of eating .
Rather than make one big batch of a single dish , the editors of Joy recommend what they call a " holistic approach to cooking " which is about " economizing time , effort , and money while eating a more varied diet .
" Instead of saddling yourself with endless servings of one thing -- which can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for one meal , using what you already have , and repurposing foods you 've already cooked .
" It is , as they explain , a continuum .
