Illustration : Pascal Campion  By  Paul Theroux  March 30 , 2020 3:58 pm ET  IN THESE ANXIOUS times , befuddled by uncertainty , we are told not to travel or we 'll get sick .
But travel has traditionally been associated with risk and the unknown , and often with illness ; yet the warnings are wickeder than that : These days , travel is emphatically linked to death .
There are healthy alternatives -- the car trip , the bike ride , the long walk -- but what if you heed the directive to stay put ? There is a whole shelf of books that ruminates on the value of being home .
Consider the compressed but highly original travel book , called " Voyage Autour de ma Chambre " ( " A Journey Round My Room " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house arrest in Turin in 1790 for 42 days .
In a deliberate attempt to stave off the boredom of his confinement , De Maistre describes his visits to his mantelpiece and his sofa , and his desk , and much else within his four walls .
A soldier and a landscape painter , he wrote ( with a wink ) of the " new mode of traveling I introduce to the world .
"  Emily Dickinson was housebound for much of her life and justified it by writing to a friend , " To shut our eyes is Travel .
" Henry David Thoreau rejoiced in his cabin on Walden Pond ( but his mother baked him pies and did his laundry ) .
The 12th-century Japanese aristocrat Kamo no Chomei rusticated himself to a tiny hut in the mountains alone , " a friend of the moon and the wind .
" He added in his chronicle of the experience , " The Ten Foot Square Hut and Tales of the Heike , " " My only luxury is a sound sleep and all I look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Sulking indoors for the duration of this crisis is an obnoxious thought .
"  In the Staying Home chapter in my " The Tao of Travel " ( 2011 ) I described these literary staycations , and some others .
Travelers maddened by the coronavirus warnings may find possible solutions in this anthology .
For most people , the advice -- amounting almost to a command -- to self-isolate means confinement ; for habitual travelers it is something like punishment .
But we often encounter a sort of confinement in travel , too : the delayed plane , the stranded bus , the washed-out road or derailed train , and for the wealthy there is splendid isolation in the gated resort or spa .
Now these experiences all involve occasions for infection .
After nine travel books involving trains and ships and kayaks and chicken buses , I decided that the ultimate freedom in travel lies in the road trip -- setting off in your own car .
For my book " Deep South " I drove from my home in New England and meandered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey I found so satisfying and enlightening that when the Mexican border became a contentious subject I took to the road again , traveling the length of the border and then across it to Mexico profundo , motoring the length of the country alone into the Chiapas of the Zapatistas .
It is possible to be self-isolated in your car journey , but this does not take into account the bacterial risks in restaurants , gas stations or motels .
Maybe the ideal would be to make the road trip in rural areas , with camping equipment and food , under the spell of Defoe 's " A Journal of the Plague Year .
" I often fantasize about driving north to Quebec , into Montreal and through my ancestral village of Yamaska , and onward past Val-d'Or and the forests and swamps , to pitch my tent on the shore of Hudson Bay , savoring the cold clean air the voyageurs inhaled .
Sulking indoors for the duration of this crisis is an obnoxious thought , and it calls up images of other plagues -- the atmosphere of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miasma at the end of Thomas Mann 's " Death in Venice , " and perhaps the most vivid and violent plague description of all , that recounted by Thucydides in his " History of the Peloponnesian War , " the fatalism , misery , lawlessness and fear of the plague in Athens .
" So great a plague and mortality of men was never remembered to have happened in any place before , " in David Grene 's translation .
" For at first neither were the physicians able to cure it through ignorance of what it was but died fastest themselves , as being the men that most approached the sick .
"  The best antidote to being housebound , the answer to the licensed scolders , is to take a long walk .
It was always Thoreau 's habit -- his essay " Walking " is inspirational .
Walking was William Wordsworth 's passion ( at age 70 he climbed Helvellyn , in the English Lake District ) .
Early in his life , the director Werner Herzog walked 500 miles from Munich to Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tourism is a mortal sin , " Herzog said later , " but walking on foot is a virtue .
"  Walking is n't challenged by the CDC or the government .
It is an expression of absolute freedom and it can be accomplished in a safe and solitary way , near home or in the solitude outside of town .
One of walking 's greatest benefits is that it allows us time to reflect -- on our lives , on our fate , on the state of the world , and figure things out .
Solivitur ambulando is the classical prescription , the noble motto of the pedestrian .
" It is solved by walking .
