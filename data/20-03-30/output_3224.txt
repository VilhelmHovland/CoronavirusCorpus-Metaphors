The Nigerian Union of Journalists ( NUJ ) , Oyo State council on Sunday appealed to the Federal Government of Nigeria , to with immediate effect , save the University College Hospital ( UCH ) , Ibadan by providing it with enough funding to cater for the ravaging Coronavirus also known as COVID-19 .
NUJ in a statement signed by its Chairman , Comrade Ademola Babalola and Secretary , Sola Oladapo , said that the demand became imperative due to a statement credited to the hospital Chief Medical Director ( CMD ) , Abiodun Otegbayo who recently solicited for funds for the hospital from prominent Nigerians to tackle the Coronavirus menace .
The union in the statement also frowned at recent developments at the foremost teaching hospital in Nigeria , with confirmed four cases among its board and management .
The hospital management also confirmed that the Provost , College of Medicine and his Deputy also tested positive .
The fourth is the chairman of the board who had allegedly tested positive for the virus .
The union in the statement wondered why due diligence was not done to ascertain the condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed concern on why the meeting had to hold despite the ongoing efforts to control COVID-19 spread in the state .
According to the NUJ , the CMD , despite his knowledge of his exposure to a suspected case still went ahead granting interviews to journalists without warning them of his vulnerability .
The union viewed this act " as irresponsible and avoidable .
"  NUJ , therefore , called on the Federal Government to stop paying lip services to the hospital .
It tasked the government to devise means of specially funding the UCH to prepare adequately for the pandemic .
" The reason to call for better funding of the UCH stemmed from the recent statement of the CMD , soliciting for funds from well-meaning Nigerians to help the hospital with consumables and other medical necessities to fight the virus .
" The Federal Government must act very fast before things snowball out of control " .
