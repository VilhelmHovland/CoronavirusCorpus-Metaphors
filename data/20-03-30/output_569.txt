( Emily Elconin , file photo via AP ) AP  LYNCHBURG , Virginia -- Jerry Falwell Jr .
is denying a report that about a dozen students at Liberty University have symptoms of the coronavirus , less than a week after they made a controversial return to the main campus .
The New York Times reported on Sunday that three students have been referred to nearby hospitals for testing .
Eight other students have been told to self-isolate on the campus .
Falwell told the Times that the university would be " notifying the community as deemed appropriate and required by law " about anyone from the school testing positive .
However , Scott Lamb , the school 's senior vice president of communications , told USA Today that the Times ' story was " false .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus has tested positive .
" Contrary to the Times ' reporting , Liberty is not aware of any students in its residence halls testing positive for COVID-19 or , in fact , being tested at all , much less any residence hall students having sufficient symptoms of COVID-19 prompting the need to get tested based on current CDC guidelines , " Liberty said in a statement to USA Today .
But Dr .
Thomas W .
Eppes Jr .
, the physician who runs Liberty 's student health service , told the Times of the nearly dozen students who are showing signs of being ill .
Falwell tells the Times that about 800 of the nearly 2,000 students who returned to campus last week had since left .
Falwell said last week that students who want to withdraw from classes for the semester would receive a $1,000 credit toward next year 's classes .
In an email to the Times , an unidentified student wrote " we need help to get home .
" City officials in Lynchburg have been highly critical of Falwell 's decision to allow students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless .
"  Nearly all colleges and universities in the nation have told students to stay home , including Ohio State , Kent State , the University of Akron , Cleveland State University and other Northeast Ohio schools .
Liberty University is one of the largest evangelical schools in the nation , normally with about 15,000 students taking classes on campus .
