Here are highlights from Friday 's Analyst Blog :  Major Banks Pause Job Cuts Amid Coronavirus Mayhem  Although banks across the globe are hit hard by coronavirus-related slowdown , they are trying to alleviate the hardships of employees .
Several global banks have paused job cuts and are reassuring the workforce privately or through public statements regarding the same .
Details  In a memo sent to all its employees , Morgan Stanley 's CEO , James Gorman , said " While long term we ca n't be sure how this will play out , we want to commit to you that there will not be a reduction in force at Morgan Stanley in 2020 .

Major foreign banks like HSBC Holdings , Credit Suisse Group AG and Lloyds Banking Group Plc are taking similar steps .

However , this time , no one has any idea how long the impact of coronavirus-related slowdown will continue .
Further , unlike 2008 financial crisis , banks are financially healthy with sufficient liquidity .
So , banks are of opinion that once the crisis is over , they will be able to bounce back faster and this will require enough staff members to continue providing banking services .
Moreover , a sudden spurt in business activities is expected once people go back to normal life after lockdowns are lifted and the banks want to be fully ready to meet clients ' demands .
Also , in case the pandemic results in staff shortage due to employees falling sick or choosing to stay at homes , then the banks should have enough backup workforces to continue normal business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central banks and local administrations in maintaining liquidity in the financial system , job cuts will make banks appear insensitive amid the current situation .
Banks are taking several measures like deferring loan repayments , delaying payment of interests and waiving late fees , with an aim of alleviating hardships of retail and small businesses .
Also , banks have suspended share repurchases and plan to use freed-up capital for lending activities .
They are even under pressure to slash dividend payouts , though such announcements have n't been made yet .
