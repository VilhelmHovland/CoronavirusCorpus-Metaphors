Ramifications of dissolving Parliament  30 Mar 2020 - hitsCtrl .
values .
The Centre for Policy Alternatives ( CPA ) has issued a brief guide highlighting legal concerns regarding the Government response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Sri Lanka .
Following is an edited version of the CPA statement : Actions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were made with Parliament being dissolved by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 2 , 2020 .
While acknowledging those in the frontlines working to contain the virus spread , the CPA aims to ensure the Government can deal with the pandemic efficiently , lawfully and constitutionally .
Parliament was dissolved on March 2 , 2020 , when there was no health emergency .
Calls were made to postpone elections , but to no avail .
Neither the Constitution nor the Parliamentary Elections Act prevents the President from withdrawing the gazette dissolving Parliament .
On March 19 , with nominations concluded , the Election Commission ( EC ) postponed elections .
Parliament now remains dissolved with uncertainty as to when elections will take place .
Despite the gazette summoning the new Parliament on May 14 , 2020 , no such assembly will exist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of citizens .
If the President had withdrawn the March 2 gazette , Parliament would continue till end August .
Article 148 gives Parliament full control over public finance .
This raises concerns on the President 's ability to make appropriations , and may give the Executive unfettered control over public finance , with no checks and balances .
It is therefore critical that Parliament is summoned to pass necessary appropriations .
Without a functioning Parliament , there is concern on how the unprecedented challenge of COVID-19 can be faced , with the need for new frameworks .
Not summoning Parliament prevents the Government from using existing mechanisms to face the present emergency .
The different arms of Government must function effectively to respond to the emergency , while respecting the Constitution and rule of law .
Inaction and/or unwillingness in this regard will have serious and long-term consequences .
Background  The President issued a gazette notification dissolving Parliament on March 2 , 2020 which stated :  i ) Parliament would be dissolved at midnight on March 2 , 2020 .
ii ) Parliamentary Elections would be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted from March 12-19 .
iv ) New Parliament would commence on May 14 , 2020 .
The President had from December 2019 pledged to dissolve Parliament when it completed four-and-a-half years .
When he dissolved Parliament , there were no COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka , despite a growing crisis in China , Europe , and East Asia .
The first confirmed local case was reported on March 11 , and by March 18 the number was 53 .
During this period , political parties and election monitors called for elections to be postponed until the threat had abated .
The Government declared holidays on March 16 , 17 and 19 .
EC members met health officials to discuss contingency measures .
After nominations , the EC informed that elections would be postponed .
Current position on elections  The EC issued a gazette announcing elections in all 22 electoral districts , as per section 24 ( 1 ) of the Parliamentary Elections Act .
However , a further EC gazette on March 21 said the poll could not be held as scheduled due to the COVID-19 outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 14 for the poll , to be notified in due course .
So Parliament remains dissolved with no exact date for elections .
While the nominations have ended , candidates ' names for each electoral district have not been gazetted .
Legal consequences of postponing polls  Article 70 ( 1 ) of the Constitution allows the President to dissolve Parliament after a lapse of four-and-a-half years .
If the President had not dissolved Parliament , it would have continued until September 1 , 2020 .
The EC postponed the poll under section 24(3) of the Parliamentary Elections Act .
Until the EC issued the postponement order , there was nothing in the Constitution or Elections Act preventing the President from withdrawing the March 2 gazette .
The President can not arbitrarily withdraw the gazette .
But in the present circumstances he would have been justified in doing so , and it is unlikely any accusation of arbitrariness would have been raised .
The withdrawal would have retracted the dissolution of Parliament .
But while the postponement of the elections amid COVID-19 is welcome , it raises some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to postpone the election does not impact campaigning .
This could have led to candidates campaigning and spreading COVID-19 .
The EC mitigated this by not issuing the gazette with candidates ' names and serial numbers .
Without the official serial number , a candidate can only engage in limited activities .
Even without ' curfew ' , the Police Ordinance and the Code of Criminal Procedure can prevent public campaigning and election meetings that could exacerbate the COVID-19 spread .
Dissolution of Parliament  The EC order postponing elections does not undo the President 's proclamation dissolving Parliament .
At present , Parliament remains dissolved as per Article 70 of the Constitution , with no date for elections or reconvening a newly-elected Parliament .
This raises several legal challenges .
1 ) Sovereignty of the People  Article 3 of the Constitution says the sovereignty of the people includes powers of the government , fundamental rights and the franchise .
Parliament , comprising the people 's elected representatives , exercises the people 's legislative power .
The Supreme Court ( SC ) has determined the failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fundamental rights .
While the EC had little choice in postponing the election , it has nonetheless curtailed citizens ' fundamental rights .
If the President had withdrawn the March 2 gazette dissolving Parliament , it would not have violated the people 's franchise , as Parliament could have continued till end August .
2 ) Public Finance  Article 148 of the Constitution gives Parliament full control over public finance , including control over Government income/revenue and expenditure .
The SC has determined it is mandatory for Parliament to retain full control of public finance .
These obligations also entail :  The SC has determined these controls act as a check on the Executive .
Parliament business is on public record .
Bills , Motions and Resolutions are also public .
Government and opposition members freely raise questions , make statements and debate .
Moving public finance outside this domain and giving the Executive unfettered control would not only be unconstitutional , but also unwise , and against the public interest .
There is one exception to this rule , contained in Article 150(3) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill for the financial year has passed into law , he may , unless Parliament shall have already made provision , authorize the issue from the Consolidated Fund and the expenditure of such sums as he may consider necessary for the public services until the expiry of a period of three months from the date on which the new Parliament is summoned to meet .
"  This provision relates to a specific situation , and applies only where :  ( i ) Parliament has not made provision for expenditure for the period after the dissolution and the commencement of a newly-elected Parliament .
( ii ) The President can make allocations from the Consolidated Fund , but only to the extent " necessary for public services " .
( iii ) The time period for this allocation is limited .
The new government did not present a budget .
Instead , Parliament passed a Vote on Account on October 23 , 2019 , covering the period from January 1 , 2020 to April 30 , 2020 .
On April 30 , appropriations made by Parliament come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150(3) can only be triggered after this .
As the March 2 gazette remains operational , the President can only make payments " necessary for public services " until August 14 , 2020 ( i .
3 months from when the new Parliament is summoned to meet ) .
So , not only must elections be held before that , Parliament must also pass an Appropriation Bill before August 14 .
With the COVID-19 pandemic , this seems unrealistic .
While what is " necessary for public services " is not defined , the Constitution contemplates only expenditures deemed essential for public services until full provisions are made through a budget approved by Parliament .
The government is further constrained by laws on the amount of local and foreign debt , which can only be changed by other Parliamentary Acts .
The Constitution has several mechanisms for the President to resolve this difficulty regarding finance .
The President can use Article 70(7) to summon Parliament citing the prevailing emergency .
Once Parliament is summoned , it can pass the appropriations needed to deal with the pandemic .
In the present context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds needed to deal with the pandemic .
The added advantage of Article 70(7) is that Parliament will stand dissolved upon the termination of the emergency , or upon the conclusion of elections .
This would further ensure that elections take place without delay .
3 ) Special Powers for Public Emergencies  Steps taken by the Government to prevent the COVID-19 spread in Sri Lanka include : Placing individuals in quarantine within their own homes and government-run facilities .
Requesting persons who have returned to Sri Lanka from certain countries to register with health officials , and tracing those not registered .
Declaring holidays to prevent mass gatherings .
Declaring curfew .
Setting up mechanisms to coordinate delivery of food and other essential items .
While some of these had a clear legal basis , others were opaque .
The Government can deal with the lack of legal basis in the short term , but the long-term consequences are problematic .
" Supreme Court ( SC ) has determined the failure to hold timely elections violates the franchise and the people 's fundamental rights "  COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , rights , governance and the economy .
The Government must set up accountable , transparent and effective administrative and decision-making structures .
It can not delay establishing such mechanisms until a new Parliament is elected .
The President should move to summon Parliament under Article 70(7) of the Constitution .
But the Government seems reluctant to summon parliament .
By not doing so , it is depriving itself the tools to more effectively deal with COVID-19 , including not using existing legislation to deal with emergencies .
These laws grant wide government authority and discretion in handling public emergencies .
But they require limited Parliamentary oversight after the President has declared a public emergency .
Parliament must be summoned to assist the Executive in discharging its functions in an emergency .
The SC has pointed out that giving open ended authority to the Executive to handle emergencies could lead to a misuse of power , and cause arbitrary , anti-constitutional acts .
Our legal system requires the different arms of Government to function and respond to the emergency in a manner that respects the Constitution and rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka extends Coronavirus curfews , work from home till Apr 03 , to bottle Covid-19 with count at 106  Friday March 27 , 2020 06:42:35  ECONOMYNEXT -- Sri Lanka extended a work from home period to April 03 , and has slapped indefinite Coronavirus curfews on three districts with authorities making a final effort to stop any remaining unidentified carriers infecting others .
The work from home period from March 30 to April 03 will apply to all State , semi-government and private sector entities except which are categorized as essential services .
" This period is not considered as public holidays .
Uninterrupted continuation of public services is the responsibility of the Government , " the Presidents office said .
" However , the objective of this measure is to prevent unnecessary gathering of people and pave the way for self-quarantine .
"  Since the Wave II surge of the epidemic began with infected returnees from countries other than China in March daily growth of confirmed patients had been in the single or low double digits .
On March 26 , the health ministry had confirmed four new cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 237 suspected patients are under observation .
Four Coronavirus patients have recovered so far , including a Wave I patient from China who was originally infected with the Wuhan virus in January 2020 .
There have been no deaths but two are in intensive care , the head of Sri Lanka 's health service Anil Jasinghe has said .
Sri Lanka has slapped indefinite curfews in Colombo , Kalutara and Gampaha , calling them high risk areas , while a curfew was also extended in Jaffna where an infected Swiss pastor conducted a service .
Out of patients indentified up to late afternoon Thursday Colombo had recorded 22 , Kalutara , 15 , Gampaha 10 and Puttalam 09 , Jasinghe said , prompting the areas to be designated high risk .
Health Workers Discriminated  " Today four people recovered from Coronavirus and left for home quarantine , " Health Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said in a daily recorded statement .
" That is something to be happy about .
The health workers , the nurses , doctors and minor workers deserve the honour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army commander .
" However we have heard that when they go home they face some discrimination in society "  They are a great strengthen to the people ; they need the honor of the people .
Wanniarachchi said Suwaseriya paramedic ambulance workers also performing a great service to the nation .
" They are bringing in Coronavirus patients , going to houses not caring whether people have Coronavirus or not , " she said .
Jasinghe said some health workers have been asked to leave their residences .
" They are not infected persons , they know how to protect themselves , " Jasinghe said .
Jasinghe had also sought police support to protect persons who are not wearing masks in public .
Members have been asked to stay away from each other maintaining at least a meter distance ( Britain 's National Health Service is advising 2 meters ) a the key preventive measure and washing hands frequently .
Wearing surgical masks incorrectly , moving them around with hands will transfer germs to the hands to the mouth and nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community transmission , the government would ask people to wear masks .
" Even some officials who do not know the correct position has been creating problems for the members of the public who do not wear masks , " Jasinghe said .
" This is also the advice of the World Health Organization .
The Lancet journal has also yesterday published a piece with a similar view .
"  Information Minister Bandula Gunewardene had said that Sri Lanka 's traders had imported extra food from India in March to cope with high demand in the April New Year season and there were extra stocks of food .
Health Minister Wanniarachchi said beneficiaries of Samurdhi income supplements will get a 10,000 rupee credit .
However day labourers earners who have been working hard and not depending on tax payer handouts have been badly hit with no income .
Television reports said Sri Lanka 's price controllers have disrupted the work of Dambulla economic trading centre , which works on commission like a stock excahne claiming that traders were pushing up prices .
Angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by force to 80 rupees a kilogram depriving farmers of incomes but the same goods were retailed at high prices elsewhere .
The Consumer Affairs Authority also caused a nation-wide shortage of tinned fish , by slapping a 100 rupee price control .
