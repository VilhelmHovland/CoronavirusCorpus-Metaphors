Coronavirus threat pushes businesses online  By Clare Nuttall in GlasgowMarch 30 , 2020  A growing number of companies across the Central and Southeast Europe regions are putting more of their business online -- whether it 's enabling their employees to work from home or ramping up online retail and other client-facing operations -- in an attempt to continue operating through the lockdowns imposed due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
Until now , while internet use and e-commerce have been growing in countries across the region , by and large it still lags behind Western Europe , though with notable exceptions such as Estonia , the initiator of the world 's first e-residency scheme .
A Eurostat survey from 2019 shows that in the 12 months running up to the survey 88% of respondents had used the internet , and 71% of those had bought or ordered goods or services for their own use online .
The number of online shoppers was particularly high among the 16-24 and 25-54 age groups at 78% and 76% respectively .
However , the figures vary widely between countries , with only around 30% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and up to 91% in the UK and 86% in Denmark .
The highest proportions of e-shoppers were all in West European countries ; among the EU members to the east , the highest proportions were found in Estonia and Czechia , both at over 70% .
Between 2014 and 2019 the largest increases in the share of online shoppers were recorded in Croatia , Czechia , Estonia , Hungary , Lithuania , Slovenia and a single West European country , Spain .
Coronavirus shopping bonanza  Panicked by the coronavirus pandemic , populations in numerous countries around the world -- especially those not entirely confident in their governments ' ability to ensure food supplies -- frantically started stockpiling groceries and hygienic products in March .
This , coupled with fears of the spread of the virus in crowded shops , led to an explosion in online retail in recent weeks .
In the Czech Republic , which has seen the region 's worst outbreak of the virus , the amounts being spent online were reportedly approaching the spend during Black Friday , as reported by Expats .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a potentially protracted period of lockdown by ordering sports equipment , bread machines and sewing machines .
But almost no one wanted to buy clothes or shoes .
There was a similar phenomenon in Croatia , the first country in the region to confirm a coronavirus case .
Between February 24 and March 15 , Croatians spent HRK300mn ( ? 40mn ) more on items such as food , drinks and personal hygiene products than usual , while online sales were up by over 50% , according to data from GfK quoted by state news agency Hina .
Specifically , Croatians stocked up on salt , frozen ready-to-eat meals , tinned meat and fish , wine and spirits , flour and yeast , toilet paper and soap .
Elsewhere in the region , pan-Baltic retailer Rimi was already planning to open its Estonian online store in May , but may bring the launch forward as an increasing number of people turn to online grocery purchases , the director of e-commerce at Rimi Estonia , Helen Lednei , told BNS .
" The circumstances have now forced us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lednei told the news service .
While food retailers remain open , most shopping centres as well as non-essential stores have now been closed in Estonia .
Similarly , while the business of Romanian food retailers is booming , many non-food retailers have suspended operations at their physical outlets and moved online .
Polish discount fashion and home decor retailer Pepco , Danish furniture and home decor retailer JYSK , German footwear retailer Deichmann , French sports retailer Decathlon and French DIY retailer Leroy Merlin are among those who announced on March 23 that their physical stores will be closed in the following weeks , bne IntelliNews ' correspondent in Bucharest reported .
At the same time , most of them invited their customers to use the online stores -- which is feasible for at least some of them .
However , the non-food retailers that do not have online outlets are likely to see a sharp plunge in sales .
Work from home is the new normal  In addition to online retail , social distancing is seen as the best way to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the coronavirus crisis has pushed companies online in a way they have not been forced to do before .
In a webinar on March 18 , Olga Pindyuk , a economist at the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies ( wiiw ) , commented : " to some extent digitalisation is happening by itself because employees are now working in home offices , " she said .
She also noted quite strong foundations for further digitalisation in the CESEE region .
" There is always a silver lining and the current coronavirus outbreak seems to provide a further push for digitalisation .
This may be one of the positives for our region .
"  Adapting quickly  Participants in a separate webinar organised by Romanian news site Romania Insider on March 27 took the view that the crisis had pushed companies into enabling their employees to work from home -- and in many cases this has been a success .
Monika Pal , HR manager at Porsche Engineering Romania , told the online forum that the company 's workforce had adapted " extremely quickly .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome each day .
"  Crina Ilie , people function manager at Genpact Europe , pointed out that as the firm is global it was able to learn from the experience of its Chinese offices , and therefore started early , for example putting hand sanitisers in its offices and restricting travel , before eventually moving on to full work from home for all its employees .
Not all businesses are able to take such a step : Ionut Popa , HR manager at Orkla Foods Romania , said tough decisions had to be made about who to send home to work and who to keep on site to ensure that the company 's production lines kept running .
" We had been discussing for a while to introduce work from home and how to do it .
Now we are forced to do it , and we have found all the procedures and the working routines to make it happen .
This is amazing -- sometimes you just do it , and things can be solved , " said Popa .
Another Romanian business that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The company allowed employees to take home any work equipment they needed as well as offering $250 to every employee to spend on electronics , furniture or subscriptions for phone or internet services , the company said on its Facebook page , where it also posted pictures of employees working on their laptops in their gardens .
With governments increasingly banning non-essential travel and heavily encouraging people to work from home , Romania is n't the only country where such changes are happening .
There are also reports from across the region of people buying new laptops and other equipment to set up their home offices .
There 's an app for that  In addition to allowing work from home , an increasing number of businesses are taking their client-facing operations online so they can continue to operate -- even if in a limited form -- throughout the crisis .
Romanian insurer City Insurance has introduced large-scale remote working , while also launching a new mobile app , CityinsClaimsAssist , for online settlement of automobile damage claims .
The benefit of the app is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct contact with other people , " the company said in a press release .
Also in the insurance sector , Slovenia 's Sava Re has closed all its branch offices but continues to operate " almost completely digital " , with its employees working from home and dealing with clients by phone and email , said Polona Pirs Zupancic , a member of the Sava Re management board , during a webinar organised by the Ljubljana Stock Exchange on March 23 .
Sava Re was already moving more of its operations online , and , Zupancic said , " These days we are again reevaluating the priorities with respect to the digital agenda and digital transformation because of this extraordinary pandemic .
