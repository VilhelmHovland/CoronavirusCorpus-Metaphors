The Frightening Implications for Liberty of the Shutdown -- An explanation of the Use of Law to Deprive us of Freedom of Movement and Assembly  Share with friends :  I thought I would write about the astonishing implications for the liberty of the events of the last few weeks .
With the exception of Silkie Carlo of Big Brother Watch , almost no significant public figure has raised any concerns about this , and I had been unsurprised to see our vast ' Human Rights ' industry ( concerned as it tends to be with the ' rights ' of criminals , etc ) unmoved by this huge assault on the fundamental freedoms , of movement and assembly , made by the Johnson government -- or shall we now call it a ' regime ' , since it has effectively got rid of Parliament -- not that Parliament minded much ? At least Oliver Cromwell needed to use the threat of force to send Parliament home .
This lot just went meekly away , having passed one of the worst Bills in modern history without a vote .
This has been typical of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberty .
None offered any opposition .
Parliament failed .
The media , with tiny exceptions , failed .
Public opinion failed .
The monarchy failed .
The legal profession failed .
Or did they .
As in the famous opening of the Asterix stories .
( The year is 50 BC .
Gaul is entirely occupied by the Romans .
Well , not entirely .
One small village of indomitable Gauls still holds out against the invaders .
we now turn to the one tiny pocket of resistance .
You probably wo n't have heard of it  But here it is .
No magic potion , alas .
But a proper independent legal mind .
' The drive behind the growing power of the state is not power-grabbing politicians , but popular demand .
As the technical and administrative capacities of the state expand , people demand more of it in their constant pursuit of security .
The state must if it can .
Sometimes the state must , even if it can not .
'  ' Things are different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public pressure for action at whatever cost pushes the measures beyond what they can realistically expect to achieve .
It may well push them beyond what is worth achieving if the price is the destruction of our personal liberty , livelihoods , and sociability .
There are dissenting voices , but not many and they are drowned out in a torrent of collective emotion and abuse .
'  ' This is a profound change in our political culture .
' The prime minister 's orders on Monday night are a remarkable example .
The Coronavirus Bill had only just been introduced into parliament .
It would , when passed , confer draconian powers on ministers to control the " gathering " of any two or more people anywhere and to restrict a person 's right to enter or leaving any " premises " , including that person 's home or car .
or tent .
However , in his press conference Boris Johnson purported to place most citizens under virtual house arrest through the terms of a press conference and a statement on the government website said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt valuable as " advice " , even " strong advice " .
But under our constitution neither has the slightest legal effect without statutory authority .
' At the time of writing ( 25/3/2020 ) , it is unclear what power the prime minister thought that he was exercising .
The relevant powers of the government are contained in the Public Health ( Control of Disease ) Act 1984 and the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 .
But it is doubtful whether either authorize the prime minister 's orders , which is presumably why the Coronavirus Bill has been introduced .
' The ordinary rule is that a person may not be detained or deprived of his liberty without specific statutory authority .
The 1984 act contains powers to restrict movement , but they are exercised by magistrates and apply only to particular people or groups who have been infected or whom they may have infected .
The Civil Contingencies Act confers a temporary power of legislation on ministers that are exercised in a national emergency , but no specific power to detain people at home .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders will probably have strong public support and people will be inclined to comply whether they are binding or not .
Yet we are entitled to wonder what kind of society we have become when an official can give orders and expect to be obeyed without any apparent legal basis , simply because it is necessary .
' There are wider problems with this .
Legislation couched in general language can be used for purposes far removed from the original intention .
The terrorism legislation , for example , has been used for a variety of other more questionable purposes , ranging from blocking the deposits of insolvent banks in the interests of creditors to manhandling peaceful demonstrators on the streets of London .
' Governments armed with vast powers are usually reluctant to part with them .
The wartime defense regulations , which required the population to " place themselves , their services and their property at the disposal of His Majesty " , had to be renewed annually , but were not allowed to expire until 1964 .
' Other wartime powers were expressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which it never did .
They continued to be used until the 1980s when the Scott report exposed this unsatisfactory corner of governmental practice .
' These are not just technicalities .
There is a difference between law and official instructions .
It is the difference between a democracy and a police state .
Liberty and the rule of law are surely worth something even in the face of a pandemic .
'  I thought readers might be interested in the exact legal basis for the restrictions under which they now live .
So I asked the government to explain them to me .
Below are the actual main rules ( the whole lot can be accessed through the link provided ) .
Lower down I have reproduced the sections of the Public Health ( Control of Disease ) Act of 1984 which forms the legal basis of what is going on or perhaps does not .
You may read the whole set of regulations signed by the Health Secretary , Matt Hancock , here : .
