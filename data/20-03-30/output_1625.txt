Wadjda , Haifaa Al-Mansour 's 2012 feature debut , was the first film made by a woman in Saudi Arabia .
After a couple of largely ignored English-language projects , Al-Mansour returns to telling the stories of life as a female in her native country , and she 's made a film that matches the simple power of Wadjda .
Where Wadjda concerned a young girl who wanted nothing more extravagant than a bicycle , The Perfect Candidate centres on a doctor , Maryam ( Mila Al-Zahrani ) , who would like the road to her hospital paved , so that patients can reach it easily .
What seems a modest request is made a near un-winnable battle because Maryam is a woman and being a woman in Saudi Arabia means having control over very little .
In the film 's opening shot , we see Maryam driving , a right Saudi women were only given in 2018 .
Maryam seizes any opportunity she is given .
She is intelligent and assertive , but to many men she 's a problem .
An elderly patient refuses to be treated by her , insisting that a male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so .
When Maryam tries to travel to a medical conference , in the hope of landing an important new job , she 's told her permit to travel has expired and she needs the permission of her father to renew it .
Her rush to try to get a new permit leads to a family friend , a government official , who is too busy to see anyone except candidates for the city council elections .
On a frustrated whim , Maryam signs up , becoming the first woman to run for election .
If elected , she will repair the road to the hospital .
Al-Mansour directs with a mix of anger , exasperation and optimism .
The men of the film are a mix of the infuriatingly arrogant ( even Maryam 's largely kind father is a hypocrite , disapproving of his daughter 's ' selfish ' choices while he swans around the country trying to fulfil his dream of becoming a musician ) and the modestly progressive .
Some cautiously applaud her candidacy , but only when nobody 's looking .
The women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While one of Maryam 's sisters is a gung-ho feminist who leads her campaign , her youngest sister , a teenager , is appalled at Maryam behaving so immodestly .
Al-Mansour shows a country that is changing but trying to move out of a mindset it 's held for countless years .
Al-Mansour 's direction is straightforward to a point that it would be uninteresting if her subject were not so vital ( perhaps why her English language films failed to excite ) , but her storytelling here is impassioned .
She presents absurdly trivial problems that become dramas due to her country 's gender politics , e .
a small technical hitch at a wedding is rendered impossible to fix because a man can not enter a room of women , until Maryam rolls her eyes and works out how to fix it herself .
Her point is that to treat everyone the same is easy , it just requires rational thought .
While Maryam 's ultimate goal is to become a powerful politician , her fight to be listened to and taken seriously is just as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saudi women heard , al-Mansour is , if not one of the most technically special , one of the most important film directors in the world right now .
