How we perceive close relationships with others determines our willingness to share food  LAWRENCE -- In the midst of a global pandemic , a lot of people rightly will be reluctant to offer food from their plate to another person , or accept such an offer due to the fear of contamination .
But for people with " attachment avoidance , " a psychological term for reluctance to form close personal relationships , this was true long before anybody had heard the term " COVID-19 .
"  " When we share food , it shows trust -- it shows we 're willing to give up some of our resources , and it shows we want to get close with someone , " said Omri Gillath , professor of psychology at the University of Kansas .
" Think about the psychological aspect of comfort food .
When people are feeling down , when they 're upset , when they 're stressed , food is a source of comfort .
We think in part this is because of the connection between food and love .
If you think about breastfeeding , babies are getting both the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love from their mom , this creates a strong connection between food and love .
"  Gillath is a co-author of a new paper , led by KU doctoral student Sabrina Gregersen , that examines the links between food-sharing and styles of attachment .
It was just published in the peer-reviewed journal Appetite .
" ' Attachment ' is a theory that explains how people bond to each other and how they regulate their emotions , " Gillath said .
" People have an attachment style based on early interactions with their primary caregivers -- parents usually .
The three main styles are secure , anxious and avoidant .
If you have parents that were supportive and sensitive and find a good balance between helping you on the one hand and providing autonomy on the other , you 're more likely to be secure .
If you had parents that were insensitive and intrusive and were n't consistent about the help they provided , you 're more likely to be anxious .
And then if you had parents that were cold and rejecting , you are more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people develop pretty early predict a lot of relational behaviors and outcomes .
"  To see how these attachment styles affected people 's food-sharing behaviors , the KU researchers conducted several studies .
In one study , participants answered a battery of questions , many of which touched on how food preferences might be tied to romantic or dating behavior for people with various attachment styles .
In a different study , participants were placed in a situation where they interacted with another person while one of them had a pack of fruit snacks .
" We brought people to the lab and had them fill out a few questionnaires , then we exposed them to either **27;2317;TOOLONG cues or control cues , " Gillath said .
" For example , we asked them to think about a secure relationship , which activated their security-related models .
Then we asked them to wait outside in a waiting area .
In both studies they happened to meet another ' participant ' in that area .
In one study , we gave the participant a bag of treats and wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other study , we gave our confederate , who was supposedly another participant , a bag of treats and they offered to share .
We wanted to see whether participants would accept the food offering .
Many participants were reluctant to take food or give it .
However , some people -- those who were exposed to security-related cues -- were more likely to share their treat with a stranger .
"  From the first study , the researchers found people high on attachment avoidance were less likely to share food or date a potential partner who had dissimilar food preferences .
In the second study , they found enhancing attachment security increased the tendency to offer one 's food to a fellow participant .
In the final study , the team found the tendency to accept food from a fellow participant was positively associated with attachment anxiety , but security priming did not affect this tendency .
Gillath said a better understanding of the links between attachment and food could potentially help inform efforts to extend help to people during the current coronavirus pandemic -- particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors wrote , " were less likely to engage in food sharing behaviors with current romantic partners and less likely to cook and eat meals with their partners .
"  " We could also use the findings to better understand people 's tendencies when it comes to prosocial behavior , " he said .
" Right now , with the coronavirus crisis , trust -- or the lack of -- is a major obstacle .
On the one hand , some people do n't have food , they do n't have a job , they do n't have the means to support themselves .
On the other hand , there are people who want to help others by giving them food or other resources but are afraid of the consequences .
Fear and confusion -- of contamination or starvation -- may lead people to hoard , preventing them from sharing resources -- not giving to those who need them , or buying too much and not leaving to people who also might need -- see the rush to buy toilet paper .
How can we fix that ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should ask , ' Are you guys willing to starve ( or not getting the right treatment because of your fears ) ? ' I 'm not saying we want to make people trust anyone and everyone ; however , we do want to reduce anxiety , increase security and facilitate food -- and resource sharing -- in a safe way .
"  According to Gillath , in a crisis situation sharing and accepting food and other resources could have psychological benefits beyond just making sure people have enough to eat .
" Not having food and feeling insecure about the whole situation is definitely going to increase mental health issues -- whereas having food and having people looking out for you can not only keep people from starving but also potentially help with their mental health and anxieties , " he said .
" It is in times like these when we need to find a way to come together , reduce anxiety and help each other out .
Making people feel secure can help with that .
