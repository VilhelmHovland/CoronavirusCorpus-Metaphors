With coronavirus scare and lockdown threatening employee job security across industries and particularly those of foreign workers abroad , an announcement by UAE 's Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation allowing private companies to change their contracts with employees could indicate layoffs and pay cuts for the migrant workforce .
Let 's gauge the impact of this move on foreign workers .
As the coronavirus pandemic hits global markets to drive economies into a state of recession , Nasser Thani Al Hamli , UAE 's Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation announced that private companies are now allowed to change their contracts with employees , only if both parties are in an agreement .
Furthermore , private companies can now temporarily or permanently lower their employees ' salaries , extend their paid or unpaid leave only after mutual consent .
However , employers will still have to provide for other dues of the workers to include accommodation and other rentals as long as foreign workers remain in the country .
In a recent development , the Gulf nation has rolled out a $34 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the pandemic .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and business operations disrupted in light of the current coronavirus outbreak that has infected 611 people so far and caused five fatalities .
How will this move impact foreign workers ?  As recently , the UAE imposed entry restrictions on its residents , who are currently outside the country from returning back for the next two weeks .
It also paused issuance of work permits and new visas on arrival .
Besides cancelling the Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia , closing malls , mosques and restaurants across the region , the nation has banned international travel of its citizens and ordered those returning back to the country to self-quarantine for the next two weeks .
Dubai-based Emirates has asked its pilots to take unpaid leave , while Qatar Airways has laid off 200 Filipino staffers .
Gulf nationReuters  The Gulf nation is heavily reliant on foreign workers in the nursing , construction and service industries .
But the coronavirus impact is costing private businesses to rethink their growth plans , for they are considering laying off staff , which will increase in global unemployment roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to data from the World Bank , the Saudi Arabia and the UAE are the world 's second and third-largest exporters of remittances after the US .
The Gulf region which is one of the largest contributors of remittance outflows is severely impacted by the global Covid-19 scare .
According to a FT report , " foreigners account for about a third of Saudi Arabia 's 30mn population and almost 80 per cent of the private sector workforce .
In the UAE , expatriates are estimated to account for about 80 per cent of the population .
" Also the ongoing oil price war between the Saudi Arabia and Russia has resulted in plummeting crude oil prices .
Uncertain times spell disaster for families of migrant workers  According to UAE 's Human Resource Ministry announcement today , businesses having excess employees than they actually need should post their requirement on the virtual job market , to facilitate hiring of these excess workers by other businesses .
Migrant workersReuters  The migrant workers have been living in cramped accommodation with inadequate sanitation facilities for long .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing is absolutely impossible living in such conditions .
Plus they do not enjoy access to the healthcare system of the nation .
Migrant workers in UAE and the Gulf region are now thriving in an environment of uncertainty , with employers mulling redundancies , pay cuts , and workers fearing deportation in light of the coronavirus containment measures implemented in the region .
Many migrant workers across the Gulf are also heavily disadvantaged by the labour governance system that gives excess control and power in the hands of the employers .
Most of the migrant workforce in the Gulf region are from developing nations of India , Philippines , Bangladesh , Pakistan , and Nepal .
Nearly 90 percent of Qatar 's population is expats .
While global markets continue to hold on to hopes of recovering from the Covid-19 crisis and reviving economies , we hope private employers in the UAE take proactive measures to ensure foreign workers are safe , secure and protected .
