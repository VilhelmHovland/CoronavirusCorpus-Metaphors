TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan 's Olympic delay has upended years of careful planning by organisers and spawned costly headaches for small businesses , hotels and even pro baseball teams , compounding a $12 billion price tag .

REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo  The Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021 last week as the coronavirus outbreak deepened , an unprecedented move in the 124-year history of the modern Olympics .
New dates have yet to be set , leaving sponsors and businesses uncertain and scrambling .
For Japan , a one-year postponement will likely cost 641 billion yen ( $6 billion ) , according to Katsuhiro Miyamoto , an emeritus professor of economics at Kansai University who studies the economic impact of the Olympics .
He reckons the bulk of that , 423 billion yen , will be from actual costs - things like venue maintenance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder coming from a broader blow to the economy .
That 's on top of the $12 billion Japan spent in the run-up .
The head of the International Olympics Committee has said the delay will mean additional costs for everyone .
For Grapestone Co Ltd , which sells banana-shaped sponge cakes filled with custard , the delay has been a disaster for the Olympic-themed " Tokyo Banana " confection it spent a year developing .
Grapestone 's sales had been falling since February , when the coronavirus started to hit tourism .
Now vendors are saying they do n't want cakes decorated with the 2020 Games logo .
" We 've never seen such a dramatic fall in sales , " said spokeswoman Yukiko Ohno , without detailing the decline .
" Since the Olympics were delayed , we think a lot fewer of our customers feel they have to have the cakes right now .
"  The company has cut back production at its plants in nearby Saitama .
It also makes cherry blossom- and panda-themed cakes , but Ohno said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give tourists a " taste of Japan " .
BIG SIGHT , BASEBALL  Japanese sponsors , who have paid a record $3 billion to be associated with the Games , have complained privately about the uncertainty of the delay .
Unlike global Olympic sponsors , most of the Japanese firms have signed up just for a year .
" We need to negotiate whether our current contract can be extended or needs to be re-signed with additional costs , " said a representative of one sponsor .
" It 's not even clear whether we can continue to use the rights or not .
"  Venues pose a particular problem for organisers .
Tokyo Big Sight , a colossal exhibition hall on the eastern side of the city , was booked as the Olympics media centre to hold thousands of journalists .
It 's unclear whether Big Sight , which is owned by the Tokyo government , will be available next year given that bookings are taken far in advance .
The venue has already entered into contracts for 50 bookings in the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said spokeswoman Mayumi Inoue .
She said it was n't possible to make room for the Olympics if other events were going on .
" It has to be one or the other .
"  Jingu Baseball Stadium , home to Tokyo Yakult Swallows professional team , was slated to be used to store equipment by organisers during the Olympics , a Swallows spokeswoman said .
The team had planned to play at the Tokyo Dome , home of crosstown rivals the Yomiuri Giants , between July and early September , but is now checking whether it still needs to , the spokeswoman said .
Another area team , the Yokohama DeNA Baystars , arranged to play its home games elsewhere - including in Niigata , some 350 km ( 215 miles ) away - because its ground was to be used for Olympics baseball .
Baystars spokesman Yasuhiro Kawamura said the team was working with the baseball association on its schedule .
Public broadcaster NHK and private broadcaster Fuji Television Network both said they cancelled programmes due to the postponement .

VILLAGE , HOTELS  The Olympic village , which is designed to house more than 10,000 athletes , could prove one of the biggest headaches .
It is due to be converted into luxury apartments , many of which are already sold .
Tenants are supposed to move in by 2023 .
One woman who bought a flat in the village with her husband said she was unsure about the move-in date .
" I still have n't figured out what 's going to happen , " she said .
" It would be troubling if the Olympic Village were used over an extended time period without our consent .
"  Sales of the flats and showroom tours have been suspended until further notice , Mitsui Fudosan Residential , which is leading the real estate project , said on Monday .
Around 4 .

Organisers say they have n't decided yet how to handle tickets , although Japanese media have reported the tickets would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisers have about 3,500 people on staff , with a number of those seconded from the government or sponsoring companies .
" Many of the temporary staff are wanting to get back to their own organisations so this will affect their motivation , " said one Olympics insider about the delay .
The postponement will heap more pain on hotels , which have been battered by coronavirus .

6 Min Read  A look at the day ahead from EMEA deputy markets editor Sujata Rao .
The views expressed are her own .
More than $10 trillion in stimulus -- fiscal , monetary and increasingly unorthodox -- is being deployed against the crisis , including 150 basis points in Fed rates cuts , repo operations , swaplines and short-term funding to ease strains in money markets .
Bob Michele at JPMorgan Asset Management describes it as " the greatest mobilisation of sweeping policy that any of us have ever witnessed .
"  But will it be enough ? Markets seem uncertain -- after Friday 's selloff , we had a shaky start in Asia and now Europe markets are up as are U .
equity futures .
A frisson of nervousness still runs through markets , however , with euro-dollar volatility climbing back to 10 .
after falling under 10% at the end of last week .
The dollar is up 0 .
this morning , having posted its biggest weekly fall last week since 2009 .
Currency swaps are calmer , but the FRA-OIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has widened to 120 basis points .
Will that market emerge as a point of stress ?  Oil prices reflect demand destruction being wrought by the virus ( along with Saudi determination to bring fellow producer Russia to heel ) -- Brent futures dropped to $23 .
, the lowest since November 2002 .
As a reference point , note that a price of around $45 is needed for even the most efficient oil producer nations to balance their budgets .
Asian shares fell too , with mainland Chinese markets shedding 1 .
even though the PBoC cut the 7-day reverse repo rate to 2 .
from 2 .
-- the biggest cut since 2015 .
The Monetary Authority of Singapore also lowered the midpoint of its currency band and reduced the slope to zero , implying a weaker exchange rate to help support export-driven growth .
The problem is that despite all the best laid plans of mice and men , things have a habit of going wrong .
The news on the virus front is n't great , with a U .
death toll increasing past 2,000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to claim the lives of the great and the good , with the CFO of financial firm Jefferies succumbing to it .
The virus is now tearing across other markets , including in the developing world , such as Turkey and Argentina .
And it wont be long before investors start counting the potential costs of all these rescue packages .
That is likely to spur more talk of adopting yield curve control to accommodate widening budget deficits and give governments more clarity over borrowing costs .
On currency markets , dollar has gained again and the euro 's $1 .
level may be tested to the downside by German preliminary inflation data , which should show a fall .
The pound is down 1% - Fitch cut UK ratings and a government expert said she expected some lockdown measures to last six months .
Emerging currencies remain under the cosh -- the lira is down 1% and the rand has lost 2% following Moody 's ( expected ) decision to strip South Africa of its last remaining investment- grade rating .
Local bond yields have surged 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat ; up to $11 billion may flee once the country is ejected from key global bond indexes .
For European equities , there is one certainty : a dividend winter looms .
The Bank for International Settlements has called for a global bank dividend ban and UniCredit became the first Italian bank to comply with the European Central Bank call to put dividend and buybacks on hold .
It was followed by Dutch lenders ING and ABN AMRO , which will suspend dividend payments until at least October .
One exception outside the EU is UBS , which maintained its 2019 dividend .
The pay-out freeze extends far and wide with the Sweden 's SSAB scrapping 2019 dividends , less than a week after the steelmaker halved its original payout proposal .
Meanwhile , headlines scream of mounting corporate losses -- Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told German TV channel ZDF his company was burning through $2 .

Nissan just announced that its global vehicles sales fell by 24 .
British fashion chain Next has cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , bowing to pressure from workers worried about their health .
More companies joined in to warn investors about the recession , with ABB saying all of its businesses would suffer in the first quarter .

Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals have expanded a clinical trial of their rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara as a coronavirus treatment to patients outside the United States .
