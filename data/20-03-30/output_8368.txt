Idaho governor signs into law anti-transgender legislation  Boise , Idaho -- Idaho Gov .
Brad Little on Monday signed into law two anti-transgender bills , making Idaho the first among states that introduced some 40 such bills this year to enact them .
The Republican governor approved legislation that prohibits transgender people from changing the sex listed on their birth certificates , and another that bans transgender girls and women from competing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignores a 2018 federal court ruling that a past law barring transgender people from making the birth certificate changes violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U .
Constitution .
The judge scrapped the ban and warned against new rules .
The Idaho attorney general 's office , which did n't appeal the ruling , said it could cost $1 million if the state had to defend the ban again and lost .
" There 's an injunction that already absolutely forbids this policy , and the government ca n't enforce this law without violating a court order , " said Peter Renn of Lambda Legal , the law firm that represented two transgender women whose lawsuit led to the court ruling .
" The ramifications of contempt ( of court ) are quite furious .
"  He said the court could impose fines and hold top officials at the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare responsible should the court order be violated .
Backers of the legislation said the federal court was wrong , and the law is needed so Idaho has accurate birth records .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all sports teams sponsored by public schools , colleges and universities .
A girls ' or women 's team will not be open to transgender students who identify as female .
Backers said the law was needed because transgender female athletes have physical advantages .
Opponents said it discriminated against transgender girls and women , and would subject athletes to invasive tests to prove their gender , likely causing some potential athletes to avoid sports .
Republican Rep .
Barbara Ehardt , who sponsored the sports ban , has consistently argued that allowing the practice would negate Title IX , the 1972 law barring sex discrimination in education and is credited with opening up athletic competition for girls and women .
She did n't return a call from The Associated Press on Monday .
Both the anti-transgender bills had overwhelming support among Republicans in the House and Senate in numbers great enough to override a veto .
Rather than wait out a potential veto , though , both chambers adjourned earlier this month because of coronavirus concerns and would have been powerless to override vetoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions of dozens of Idaho legislators who are so focused on pleasing their bigoted base instead of doing what is right , " said Mistie Tolman , Idaho director for Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii , adding the laws make Idaho one of the " cruelest states in the country .
"  Across the U .
, more than 40 bills were introduced this year targeting transgender youth .
About half , like one of the Idaho bills , sought to ban transgender girls from competing at various levels of girls ' sports .
Another large batch of bills sought to ban certain types of gender-transition medical treatment for minors .
None of these bills have been enacted , and most have died .
In some other states -- including Ohio , Alabama , Tennessee , Kansas , Louisiana , South Carolina , Missouri and Arizona -- bills of one or both categories remain technically alive , but most are considered unlikely to win final passage .
In some cases , the legislatures are in recess and future scheduling is in limbo because of the coronavirus outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school runners have filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from participating in girls ' sports .
On March 24 , the U .
Justice Department came out in support of the lawsuit , arguing that the state 's inclusive policy violates the federal Title IX law allowing girls equal educational and athletic opportunities .
