As the coronavirus pandemic continues to take over the world , the Summer fashion weeks in Paris , Milan and London have either been cancelled or postponed .
This comes as a direct result of the strict quarantine measures put in place due to COVID-19 , with no guaranteed end date in sight .
It was announced by the Board of Directors of the F ? d ? ration de la haute couture et de la Mode on Friday 27th March , that Paris Men 's Fashion Week ( June 23 to June 28 ) , and Haute Couture Week ( July 5 to July 9 ) , will no longer be going ahead .
This was a strong decision made to ensure the health and safety of the industry -- with the Federation actively working on possible alternatives for the time being .
The Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana also announced on Friday 27th March , that Milan Men 's Fashion Week ( June 19 -- June 23 ) will be postponed and will now be taking place during Milan Women 's Fashion Week in September .
The statement read " This decision was dictated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the COVID-19 pandemic .
We are however working on new digital formats and new ways of encounter , in order to create a new storytelling on the days originally scheduled for the Milan Men 's Fashion Week .
"  The British Fashion Council have also joined in cancelling London Men 's Fashion Week along with the CFDA postponing the New York Men 's shows in June .
The CFDA also adding they have decided to cancel NYFW Resort 2021 presentations and urging designers to " NOT to show their Resort Spring 2021 collections .
The CFDA and the Fashion Calendar will not be publishing a Resort Schedule .
"  These postpones and cancelations join the ever-extending list of fashion event closures including global Cruise shows , MBFWA 2020 and the Met Gala .
Brands will now have to look at new creative ways in the digital sphere to present collections and stories .
These changes may only be temporary for the industry , or perhaps permanent .
But with COVID-19 evolving rapidly every day by the hour , we may have to prepare and update ourselves for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
