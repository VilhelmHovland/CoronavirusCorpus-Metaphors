BAP tells banks to keep ' reasonable ' lending rates  Banks are called to keep the practice of a fair and appropriate lending rates to avoid overindebting borrowers while on COVID-19 lockdown .
Bankers Association of the Philippines ( BAP ) president Cezar P .
Consing yesterday said banks should maintain " reasonable lending rates " and to try to " keep such rates as close as possible to pre-ECQ ( enhanced community quarantine ) levels .
"  " As we move into week 3 of the ECQ , the impact of the crisis on the economy , including our corporate and consumer borrowers , is becoming more apparent , " said Consing who is also president and CEO of Bank of the Philippine Islands .
He is asking all banks , not just BAP members which are mostly big banks , to also make sure that digital channels are open and always accessible to homebound clients and also to " contribute to ( a ) stable and liquid financial markets .
"  Consing also reminded banks to ensure availability of cash in branches and in ATMs , as well as to " maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transactions that can not be performed digitally .
"  " Our country needs our very best efforts in these difficult times , " said Consing .
He also acknowledged that since the ECQ was imposed , BAP member banks have " taken extraordinary steps to continue to serve banking customers .
"  Similar to health workers , bank personnel also encountered difficulties getting to their place of work because of the ECQ barricades .
The BAP earlier appealed to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) to intervene because a lot of their employees and officers are unable to go to their branches .
Bank personnel are also subject to Inter Agency Task Force ( IATF ) ID certification but the BSP has made it easier to comply by allowing authorized banks to select a range of IATF ID serial numbers and simply print this along with the bank company ID .
Banks will only have to download the templates and print its own IDs with the IATF serial numbers plus the employee IDs .
The IATF ID is available for all BSP supervised financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , money exchange companies/remittance and transfer companies , electronic money-issuers , payment system operators , and pawnshops .
BSP Governor Benjamin E .
Diokno has asked the Philippine National Police and Local Government Units frontliners to ensure that the " public 's financial needs are met in these challenging times " by not preventing bank personnel from getting to their place of work .
Majority of the country 's big banks have limited branches opened during the ECQ and also ensured continued delivery of banking services particularly cash availability through ATMs and digital platforms .
The BSP 's latest surveillance report indicated that " banks remain generally open and functional " during the ECQ .
" There are adjustments as to shortened banking hours , temporary closure of branches and leaner staff in some banks .
But these are mainly precautionary mea ? sures to delay the spread of COVID-19 , " said the BSP .
But , the BSP said COVID- 19 is " a double-edged sword for banks .
"  " It poses straightforward questions such as whether to close branches because few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , for fear that shuttering sends the wrong message to the public .
But , the role of banking services in keeping public service and economic activity afloat is essential and critical particularly in an extreme situ ? ation like COVID-19 .
It is for this reason that the BSP has adopted measures to lessen the potential impact on the BSFIs through the grant of regulatory and rediscounting relief measures .
The BSP will monitor banks who will pursue such relief measures , " said the BSP .
After the BSP released a package of regulatory relief measures , banks in turn have also offered flexible arrangements to borrowers by extending loan payments and waiving fund transfer fees and charges .
The BSP noted that a lot of large lenders have announced they will extend the payment for its consumer loan services , including credit card payments and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises .
