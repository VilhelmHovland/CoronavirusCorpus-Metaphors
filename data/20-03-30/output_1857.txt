" Government appeals to businesses to honour welfare cheques "  In an effort to ensure that Barbados ' most vulnerable individuals and families are not left behind in their ability to cope with the restrictions that the fight to combat the spread of COVID-19 has imposed on the country , businesses are being asked to give special consideration to clients of the Welfare Department .
Government is asking banks , supermarkets and other commercial establishments to honour all Welfare Department cheques that are presented by its clients , even though they will be dated Friday , March 27 , 2020 .
These cheques would have been mailed to the recipients earlier this week , in accordance with the department 's usual schedule , but in light of the desire of these Barbadians to ensure their households are not further disadvantaged by the limitations COVID-19 has brought , Government is asking for this earlier than usual facilitation .
Clients of the Welfare Department are also reminded that cheques can also be cashed at post offices , which will also facilitate processing ahead of the March 27 date on them .
