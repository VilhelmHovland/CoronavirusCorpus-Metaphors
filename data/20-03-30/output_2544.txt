Bereaved Canadians struggle and adapt to grieve under COVID-19 measures  A funeral for Paula Lockhart was held in Kentville , N .
, last week , after the 55-year-old passed away following a long battle with cancer .
For Paula 's son Keith , it was n't the service he expected .
Most of his mother 's wide circle of friends , and some relatives living out of the country , were unable to attend due to restrictions on group gatherings , instead watching remotely by livestream .
The few dozen in attendance were seated six feet apart .
There were no hugs during or after the service .
It was difficult for Lockhart to see his grandmother seated across the room without a comforting hand within reach .
" It was good for her to be there , but it was hard to watch because no parent should outlive their child , " Lockhart said by phone from his home in Ottawa .
" It was kind of hard not to be able to comfort her during the service .
"  The global COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the grieving process for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also contending with travel restrictions , isolation and limits on gatherings keeping them apart from family and friends when they need them most .
A mid-March service at a St .
John 's , N .
, funeral home was later linked to more than half of the province 's known cases of COVID-19 , illustrating the ease in which the virus can spread in such settings .
But religious leaders , family members and funeral directors say it 's not easy to keep people separated when they are grieving .
Allan Cole , vice-president of the Funeral Service Association of Canada , said the pandemic has forced people to change the way they mourn .
" That 's a normal human comfort that all people experience , the comfort associated with a caring touch from loved ones .
It 's difficult to somehow encourage people not to think that way at this particular moment , " said Cole .
" Even though we 're there to support one another , we have to adhere to the guidance of health-care professionals that say , ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from a loved one , an email , anything that takes the place of that touch is really the best we can do for now .
"  Imam Hamid Slimi , who leads the Sayeda Khadija Centre in Mississauga , Ont .
, said he has not yet had to organize a funeral under the state of emergency , though any gatherings would be limited under Ontario 's measures .
If someone were to pass away from COVID-19 , Slimi said , ritual washing of the body would have to be suspended and the person would be buried as received from the hospital .
" This is very difficult for the families but we have no other choice , " Slimi said in an email .
Those running services in Canada have also been looking to the tough circumstances faced by mourners in other parts of the world hit hard by outbreaks .
In Bergamo , the site of hundreds of deaths at the centre of Italy 's outbreak , sobering images last week showed military vehicles transporting bodies of those who succumbed to COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they died in .
Bereavement workers have also been advocating for access to protective equipment .
Alan MacLeod Jr .
, director of Ettinger Funeral Home in Shubenacadie , N .
, said he 'd been struggling to place an order for gloves amid skyrocketing demand .
Ettinger said operators have been racing to keep up with changing regulations aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 .
" We 're trying to be prepared to make do to help people through their bereavement , " MacLeod said .
" This is unprecedented .
So we 're doing what we can .
"  Others have struggled with the painful experience of losing relatives while unable to travel across international borders .
Rabbi Hannah Dresner , who leads Or Shalom synagogue in Vancouver , saw both the limitations and possibilities offered by technology in such circumstances , after her husband Ross was forced to say goodbye to his Dallas-based sister over FaceTime .
The unpredictability of international travel meant he also had to deliver a eulogy through an iPad while the burial took place in Tulsa , Okla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the grave , an important element of the rituals around death in Judaism .
" That whole part of the process was extremely saddening and difficult and felt very , very isolating , " Dresner said from Vancouver .
But the isolation of the burial was reversed during a seven-day virtual shiva that Dresner arranged over Zoom , a teleconferencing app .
Around 60 people participated each night , sharing memories of Alice during pauses in the service .
" We felt our home to be filled with loved ones who could n't or might not ordinarily have been able to attend , " Dresner said .
