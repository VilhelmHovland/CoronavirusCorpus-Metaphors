Right now , all you ' ' e thinking about is the coronavirus .
Us too .
But , while the coronavirus will eventually go away , our desire to own a magnificent car never will !  Here are five reasons why we think the Volvo S90 is worth a second glance .
It looks so damned good  This is a car that is exceptionally easy on the eyes .
Volvo 's flagship model caught our eye straight away -- when we first saw it back in January 2016 ( it was revealed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Michigan ) .
We loved its sleek , understated exterior back then -- and we feel exactly the same way today .

It is safe  This seems somewhat obvious .
We are talking about a Volvo , after all -- and the company 's name is synonymous with safety .
But , living in South Africa , road safety is always top of mind .
And , with features such as City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even up to highway speeds ) , Pedestrian Detection ( a system that detects pedestrians and brakes the car when necessary ) , Cyclist Detection and Large Animal Detection ( the car brakes when it " sees " cyclists and animals ) , the S90 boasts safety par excellence .
It makes us feel better when we brave the roads .

The interior rocks  We do n't do clutter -- when it comes to cars or houses .
Let 's forget about the houses for the time being .
Cars with gazillions of buttons and controls just do n't do it for us .
Instead , we prefer a clean , elegant and minimalist interior -- one that looks luxurious but does the job perfectly .
That 's precisely what the S90 does ; we really enjoy its clean yet functional Scandinavian design .

The powertrain is great  There are four variants : the D4 and D5 Geartronic FWD models and the T5 and T6 Geartronic AWD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter have petrol motors under their hoods .
Personally , we particularly like the T6 -- because , with 235 kW on tap , it 's heaps of fun to drive .
Fuel consumption -- at 7 .
litres per 100km -- is n't too shabby either .
But , if you 're looking for ultra fuel economical , the D4 has to be your pick .
It slurps a mere 4 .
litres per 100km .

It has clean-air thinking  The S90 comes with a feature called CleanZone , which creates a healthier driving environment in the car .
It even has a sensor that monitors incoming air for noxious substances .
If the level of harmful substances detected is deemed too high , the S90 's air intake closes automatically .
