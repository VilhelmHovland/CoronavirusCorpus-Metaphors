Cebu Pacific feels pinch from Philippines quarantine  Cebu Pacific says the month-long " community quarantine " imposed on metropolitan Manila and the main Luzon island group recently will free up 90% of its total seat capacity , even as it maintains services from its hubs outside of Manila and the region .
The 90% capacity figure is based on the suspension of domestic flights departing Manila , and previously suspended services to China , Hong Kong , Macau and South Korea , says Cebu Pacific in a Philippines Stock Exchange disclosure .
During this period , the airline continues to operate flights from its other hubs that have not been affected by the quarantine order such as Cebu , and is maintaining connectivity " where operationally feasible " .
Cirium schedules data show that in February , domestic routes accounted for 83% of Cebu Pacific and subsidiary Cebgo 's seat capacity .
