The announcement was part of a $1 billion deal made with the US government to create the manufacturing capacity for 1 billion vaccine doses .

government will invest $1 billion to create enough manufacturing capacity to make more than 1 billion doses of a vaccine it is testing to stop the new coronavirus that has killed more than 35,000 people around the world .
As part of the arrangement , the U .
government will pay $421 million to support the company 's efforts to build new manufacturing capacity in the United States .
J&amp;J said it had selected its own lead vaccine candidate and would start human testing by September , with an eye on having it ready under an emergency use authorization in early 2021 , far quicker than the typical 18 month period that it takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
J&amp;J Chief Scientific Officer Dr .
Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now , even before it has a signal that its experimental vaccine candidate works .
The company will start making the vaccine at risk , without knowing for sure that it works .
" That is the only option for us to get it on time , " Stoffels said in a phone interview .
The company has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that can make up to 300 million doses of vaccine , Stoffels said , adding that " absolutely will not be sufficient for the world .
"  He said J&amp;J is starting to build a plant in the United States now so it can be ready to manufacture vaccines by the end of the year , when data from its clinical trials will show whether the vaccine works .
Nearly half of the $1 billion will come from the U .
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) , which is looking to expand on J&amp;J 's previous collaboration with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for manufacturing plants in other parts of Europe and Asia that are capable of making the type of vaccine the company is working on .
So far , J&amp;J has not given any doses of its vaccine to humans .
But Stoffels said the coronavirus vaccine will be based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine , which has been widely used in people , and the company believes it will prove safe .
Safety testing of vaccines is even more important than for treatments as they are given to healthy people to prevent infection .
That could be 1 billion people or more around the world .
In lab studies , the vaccine candidate has produced strong neutralizing antibodies to the virus - the type needed to make a successful vaccine .
J&amp;J will continue testing the vaccine in animal studies this summer and plans to start human trials in September .
The new coronavirus , which began in Wuhan , China , has infected people in most countries around the world .
The United States , with over 143,00 confirmed case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the most cases globally .
Moderna Inc this month began initial testing of it 's experimental coronavirus vaccine in healthy volunteers , making it the early front-runner in the race to develop a viable vaccine .
