To be sure , the decline in Trump 's standing has been small .
And there 's little reason to believe that the president 's latest polling slump will prove more durable than his previous ones .
Overall , the American people 's assessment of their president has been remarkably steady throughout the Trump era .
Odds are that the recent decline is a fleeting reaction to John McCain 's funeral , or ephemeral headlines about White House dysfunction , or else , just a bit of statistical noise .
But that still would n't be good news for Trump or his party .
The fact that the president 's approval rating has held steady ( which is to say , has held steadily low ) -- amid improving economic conditions -- suggests that the economy wo n't save the GOP this November , no matter how good the good times get .
The White House clearly hopes otherwise .
This week , the chair of Trump 's Council of Economic Advisers , Kevin Hassett , treated the press corps to a formal , chart-laden argument for why the current president deserves credit for the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hassett 's presentation was full of dubious premises , and misleading graphs .
Nevertheless , as Matt Yglesias notes , Trump does deserve a modicum of credit for the economy 's present state : By increasing spending while cutting taxes , the president enacted a fiscal stimulus , which likely boosted short-term growth and tightened labor markets .
And many voters appreciate this distinction .
A CNN/SSRS poll released Monday found that 69 percent of American voters think the economy is " good " -- but only 49 percent approve of the way Trump is managing the economy .
And even voters who believe the economy is doing well -- and credit Trump for that fact -- do n't necessarily support the president or his party .
Only 36 percent of the poll 's respondents approved of Trump 's overall job performance , down from 42 percent in August .
A seperate Washington Post-ABC News poll documents the same phenomenon : While most voters told that survey that the economy was doing well , nearly half of those who were upbeat about the economy still voiced opposition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratic Congress " as a check on Trump " -- or a Republican one that would " support Trump 's agenda " -- 60 percent of voters opted for the former .
None of this means that Trump is n't benefiting from the strength of today 's economy .
Considering that the president has always derived a portion of his support from voters who do not like him , personally , it 's all but certain that his approval rating would be much lower if unemployment were rising , and wages plunging .
But current polling does suggest that there are firm limits on how much support the GOP can derive from improving material conditions .
American voters simply hate Donald Trump more than they like the tightening labor market .
It 's not the economy , stupid .
