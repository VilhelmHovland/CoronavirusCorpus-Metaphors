Coronavirus Patient In Benue Protests Isolation  The index case of the novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) in Benue State , Susan Okpe has protested her isolation at a Benue State University Teaching Hospital ( BSUTH ) facility , alleging that she did not have the virus .
Okpe , who took to Facebook to express her displeasure , claiming she only had feverish conditions as a result of her long travel from the United Kingdom to Nigeria .
Governor Samuel Ortom , had last Saturday during a press conference in Makurdi , the Benue State capital , disclosed that a first case of the virus had been detected in the state , and gave her name as Suzan Okpe .
THE WHISTLER learnt the woman was in Benue for her mother 's funeral ceremony .
Part of her post reads :  Advertisement  Okpe 's Claims  " I would like the whole world to please , appeal to whoever is concerned to move me out of here , am not trying to gain cheap publicity as been trendy for days on social media .
" I have kept my cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooling throughout the night , no nurses or medical attention , my crime is that am a British who came into Nigeria particularly Benue State , felt feverish , took myself for check up because I have travelled longer than usual .
" After examinations I was told by the doctor , my temperature was high and I said keep me for observations as I did not experience any before I left London , passed from Lagos to Abuja my temperature was like any other passenger was being monitored by the authorities .
" Back to my self presentation and request for isolation which was done , I was told by the doctors that the standard procedure was to call for a test from the state ministry of health of which two gentle men came to do a throat and nose swoop .
After two days by now my temperature has normalised from 38:2 to 36:4 .

Only to be told by the doctor after asking why am still kept in the hospital , a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being done with my name that I have Covid-19 on air , on social media without my knowledge , I went mad as a human being and demanded to see the medical director who told me he was fighting for me how , why and for what and with who I do n't understand , still fuming the next thing was armed men , ambulance and a siege round the hospital for me to be removed for what I do n't know , as someone who knows the principles of the law weather it works in Nigeria or not I ca n't tell .
I said I was not moving without a reason ,  " I went down to speak with the deputy governor for thirty minutes and he assured me I was safe , will be cared for , though not sick with any symptoms , also that the following day the health commissioner and medical doctors from the state will come and see me I told him that if the state is insisting that am ill I should be taken to Abuja to be tested I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with human life and politics like this before , I want the world , Nigerians , Benue state to hear my side and verify am not a Covid-19 positive , " she said .
Benue Government Reacts :  But reacting to Okpe 's allegations , the Commissioner for Information in the state , Addingi Ngunan in an interview with THE WHISTLER on Monday , said Okpe 's claims were not true , as the government was not the one that conducted the test on her , but the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) .
" All what she is saying is not true .
We are not working here all by ourselves .
We are working in conjunction with the NCDC and they sent us someone from Abuja .
The test was conducted by them .
It was not us that did the test .
The test was conducted by NCDC and NCDC has sent another person who has come in here .
Because once a state tests positive which they have the records , they always come into the state to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to set up a testing centre , because she must have come in contact with a lot of people , she was coming for a burial .
" So she came straight into a meeting , so they have to track all those people , so as to ensure that the link is broken and every other person that is positive is not spreading it .
" Benue State government has no testing facility to just go and pick up anybody and say this person is positive .
No ! Every test is conducted by NCDC .
Once there is a case that is positive they move in and come into the state .
" So NCDC is the one who has the data of everybody who is positive .
On the claim that there was no medical personnel on ground at BSUTH to attend to her , the information commissioner said :  Advertisement  " With regards to her not been taken care of and all that , is not true .
The place where she is kept is one of the centres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a new disease .
There is no basic medicine or treatment per se that is given .
There is a protocol that NCDC has set up for treatment of those cases and everything that the hospital is doing is according to protocol .
" We will not do things by ourselves , we will do things by the way they gave us the books to do them .
And it 's not like they have to come and give you medicine morning , afternoon , evening .
They do n't do that , there are ways of managing that disease .
But more than that , this lady has been counselled .
Her family members , the deputy governor have come and spoken to her .
" And even right now , we 're just coming out of a meeting with NCDC officials from Abuja and the team that is managing her .
We have done everything by the books , for her .
And there are two consultants that are looking at her case ; reason been , it 's an index case .
she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her very well .
" Every other person she has come in contact with , we are just tracking to also test them .
On why the government had to reveal her identity , which is against medical ethics , the government spokesman said :  " I need to let you know that even in law , when it becomes a matter of life and death , ethics are for the doctors , the governor is not her doctor .
But the motive for disclosing her identity was not to stigmatise her .
Releasing her identity , was so for anyone who has come in contact with her , will please come out , because Nigeria does n't have a system whereby there is system where you can track anybody .
What if somebody comes up and say , me I know this person , in contact with the person that you can track .
" That meeting she went to , we 're trying to get the names of people we track , we 're not able up till now .
The driver that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us the name , she is not giving us up till now .
So how do we get this people .
So the reason why his excellency announced her name , was so that if you came in contact with a person like this , please come out so that we can test you , so that you wo n't distribute the whole thing in town .
" Right now , we should tracking over 100 people , she went straight into a meeting for the funeral of her mother .
Now all those people we have n't gotten all their names .
She came into a hospital that under normal circumstances , everybody that came into that hospital that day is at danger and further than that , her family members , the doctor that came in touch with her , lab consultants , all of these people we need to track them .
So if we did n't reveal her name , who will come out and say , oh I took so so person 's blood , specimen or whatever .
Of course there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name down .
No other motive for revealing her name other than that .
