The corridors of the hospital are filled with an ominous sense of apprehension .
The tables and chairs from the cafeteria are gone , and there are fewer visitors .
It looks different .
Feels different .
Entire departments have been rearranged and re-purposed - ready to accommodate a surge in patients .
And the staff - the doctors , nurses , orderlies , cleaners , support staff and admin - are all waiting .
They are watching the news roll in from Italy , Spain and the UK , and seeing the enormous pressure coronavirus is putting on those hospitals and their medical teams .
And they are waiting .
Three weeks ago , Jeremy Pallas - a nurse educator in the emergency department at John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle - was setting up a screening clinic for COVID-19 at the hospital 's main entrance .
The staff there had been " working furiously " to prepare for what might be ahead as confirmed cases of COVID-19 continued to climb in Australia .
" Being slightly behind some of the places that are being impacted by the virus - like Italy and the UK and a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us gives us a golden opportunity for preparation , " Mr Pallas said .
" We can see what 's happening around the world , and we know the different ways that this looks like it could go .
So there is just this feeling of waiting , and using the time we have left to prepare as much as we possibly can .
Lots of the wards are being prepared in different ways , being re-purposed to give us the best capacity we possibly can to accommodate the potential patients that will arrive with this disease .
" Mr Pallas said there were " a lot of different feelings " in the hospital .
" But among a lot of my colleagues there is this real sense that people are really linking arms together and getting ready for this challenge , " he said .
" It is bigger than the challenges we would normally face , but the preparation is the same , and the team work is the same , and the camaraderie is the same , and we will embrace this challenge in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some big days .
They shared the same anxieties and concerns about the virus as anyone , but they were used to working calmly under pressure .
The waiting was the worst part .
" In the ED , there is an almost ominous feeling , " he said .
" Everybody is waiting , and while we are waiting , we are listening to reports from our colleagues overseas .
" Once we start seeing patients , that is the thing that is much more familiar to us in the emergency department .
" We are used to seeing 250-plus patients a day .
At the moment we are seeing less , and I think that contributes to that feeling of waiting for something to happen .
" But the way we distract ourselves from the nerves is by busying ourselves with other things - like getting the place ready , and getting as much training in as we can .
" They were also planning how to welcome and accommodate more medical staff who would be working alongside them should COVID-19 escalate .
Mr Pallas said people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to anyone in the past few weeks who has n't been a bit panicked and anxious , " he said .
But through the screening clinic , the nurses had an opportunity to talk to people about their fears , and offer some reassurance .
His medical colleagues had all gone into these roles knowing they might face some big challenges .
" Every day we come to work knowing there is the potential that one disaster or another will occur , " he said .
" We know that , and we are ready to take it on everyday .
This is a challenge that will be ongoing for a long time .
Right now , for the next few months , it is our time to use our tools to make a difference .
But there are also people facing things everyday now that they never would have predicted before this .
" People whose jobs are n't there when they go to work in the morning .
People who ca n't take their kids to the park , or do the things they like to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it will be a hard time that we will get through together .
But in the scheme of things , it 's a challenge we will be prepared for , and it is our part to play in the community .
" Outside the hospital environment - in general practice - nurses , doctors , and support staff have been working hard to keep people out of the hospital , and stay safe themselves .
All staff were focused on trying to stay well .
" No one wants us to not get sick more than we do , " Mr Pallas laughed .
" We 've got the right personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , we have the right training , departments are being totally overhauled to ensure that not only our teams - but the patients that come through - are as safe as they can be .
" It is important for us to take every measure we can to ensure our staff do n't get sick .
Without them , the building does n't function the way it is intended to .
" But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most important message is that we are here with them , and this is a challenge we will all face together , and when you need us , we 'll be here .
" Elizabeth Grist had just come out of a meeting with a room full of Hunter nurses , and the executive director of clinical services in nursing and midwifery was in awe .
The nurses were upskilling .
They had worked in intensive care previously , but they wanted a " refresher " in case they were called on to help in a surge .
" But you know what , they are so calm , so professional , they are just wanting to protect their community and do their job , " Ms Grist said .
" The staff are amazing .
They really are .
I am humbled by them .
This is an unknown territory .
No one could have foreseen this , it just came out of the blue really , when it hit China .
It has been absolutely terrifying to see some of those scenes over in Italy and Spain .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't come to that here , but we have to prepare .
" Ms Grist is also the Health Services Functional Area commander who coordinates disasters .
" I never thought , in my lifetime , I would have to do one like this , " she said .
" I 've had lots of training over the years .
When it was SARS we had prepared , but it never got to this .
" Their team initially received criticism when they introduced reduced visiting hours at Hunter New England 's 39 hospitals .
But as cases of the disease progressed , and the public health messages became louder , there was less push back .
" There was some backlash initially , but I think people are starting to get it now - that our staff are our front line , and we need to protect them , " she said .
" If our staff get sick , who have we got to look after the community ? Women are still having babies , people are still having other health problems .
People are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why it is so important that our staff are protected and able to do their job .
" Both retired nurses and undergraduates had been putting their hands up to help in some way .
On Monday , they had advertised for undergraduate nurses and midwives to work alongside experienced staff .
By Thursday , they 'd had more than 230 applications .
" I have n't had the sense that people are running away from it , " Ms Grist said .
" But there is a real hope that we will flatten the curve , and that it wo n't hit us as hard .
" Ms Grist said it was a lot to ask of nurses , and other medical staff , to put themselves and their families at risk .
" They are worried about their families more than anything else , " she said .
" We are putting a lot of measures in place .
People are getting changed before they go .
And if they wear the right protective equipment , people should be fine .
" A lot of education has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use their personal protective equipment , and are looking after their own health .
" Ms Grist said these heroes were right on the frontline , putting themselves forward to deal with the most critical situations .
" They are prepared to face this challenge , they really are , " she said .
" It is a big thing .
But this is our job , and this is what we do .
" The message that has come through - loud and clear from them - is that they are here to look after their community as they always do .
" I think we are all scared - all the doctors , nurses , health professionals and people working in the hospital - we are all scared .
But we all know we have our job to do .
" I am in total admiration .
" Ms Grist wanted to thank all of the hospital staff .
Not just the nurses and doctors , but all of the allied health staff , the admin and support staff , the orderlies and cleaners .
All of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a nurse for 43 years , and I have never seen such a cohesive response to such a difficult situation , " she said .
" They are amazing people .
And we all need to thank them .

" Ms Grist said they had planned a big celebration for May 12 , in honour of the bicentenary of the birth of the founder of modern nursing , Florence Nightingale .
But that had been cancelled .
" This is what we have got instead , " she said .
