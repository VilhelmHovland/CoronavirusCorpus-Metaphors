Due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , automakers around the world have temporarily halted production .
Some have even started producing ventilators , respirators , and even face masks , instead of cars in order to help combat the disease .
As such , people all over the world are advised to stay at home and practice social distancing to prevent the disease from further spreading .
In order to promote keeping a distance away from each other , Audi and Volkswagen have temporarily changed their official logos .
Specifically , the two automakers have added some " distance " in their logos .
The updated Audi badge now features four rings separate from each other as opposed to the four connected rings we 've all come to know .
Meanwhile Volkswagen ( which recently updated its logo design ) put some space in between the letters " V " and " W " .
The two automakers have posted new " socially distant " logos on their respective websites and even social media accounts .
Volkswagen made a video with a caption that reads : " At Volkswagen , we traditionally stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are convinced that together we will find new ways and solutions that will enable us to overcome this crisis .
Right now it is particularly important that we follow the rules of conduct and hygiene with a lot of discipline .
Stay safe - keep social distance ! " Similarly , Audi went with a simpler video saying " Stay Home .
Keep Distance .
"  As mentioned above , the logos are only temporary during these times .
So do n't expect to see the spaced-out badges to appear on their vehicles anytime soon .
With the coronavirus continuing to spread across the world , we must all do our part to flatten the curve and prevent more from being infected .
Props to Volkswagen and Audi for joining in on the movement .
