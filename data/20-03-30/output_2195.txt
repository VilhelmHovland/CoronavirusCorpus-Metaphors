Actress Evangeline Lilly has apologized for insensitive comments she made about social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic earlier this month .
The former Lost star was caught taking her kids to a gym class last week and when she was asked why she was n't following government guidelines to stay indoors , she unleashed a rant about her personal freedom .
" Where we are right now feels a lot too close to Marshall Law ( sic ) for my comfort already , all in the name of a respiratory flu , " she said .
" It 's unnerving .
Let 's be vigilant right now .
And kind .
Watchful and gracious -- keeping a close eye on our leaders , making sure they do n't abuse this moment to steal away more freedoms and grab more power .
"  She was attacked by fans and critics alike and even her former Lost castmate Maggie Grace took aim and urged her to rethink her stance .
Lilly did just that and on Thursday she took to Instagram to offer up a sincere apology , explaining she made her comments on 16 March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am writing you from my home where I have been social distancing since Mar 18th -- when social distancing was instituted in the small community where I am currently living , " the actress writes .
" At the time of my Mar 16th post , the directives from the authorities here were that we not congregate in groups of more than 250ppl ( people ) and that we wash our hands regularly , which we were doing .
" Two days later , those directives changed and , despite my intense trepidation over the socioeconomic and political repercussions of this course of action , PLEASE KNOW I AM DOING MY PART TO FLATTEN THE CURVE , PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING AND STAYING HOME WITH MY FAMILY .
"  Lilly adds : " I want to offer my sincere and heartfelt apology for the insensitivity I showed in my previous post to the very real suffering and fear that has gripped the world through COVID19 .
Grandparents , parents , children , sisters and brothers are dying , the world is rallying to find a way to stop this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dismissive , arrogant and cryptic message .
" My direct and special apologies to those most affected by this pandemic .
I never meant to hurt you .
When I wrote that post 10 days ago , I thought I was infusing calm into the hysteria .
I can see now that I was projecting my own fears into an already fearful and traumatic situation .
" I am trying to follow responsible recommendations for how to help .
Like many of you , I fear for the political aftermath of this pandemic , and I am praying for us all .
I am heartened by the beauty and humanity I see so many people demonstrating toward one another in this vulnerable time .
When I was grappling with my own fears over social distancing , one kind , wise and gracious person said to me ' do it out of love , not fear ' and it helped me to realize my place in all of this .
" Sending love to all of you , even if you ca n't return it right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dae Kim , tested positive for the coronavirus after returning home to Hawaii from New York City .
He was released from quarantine earlier this week .
