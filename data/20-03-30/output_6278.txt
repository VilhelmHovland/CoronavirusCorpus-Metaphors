Many people were seen trying to walk on the railway track at Anand Vihar to go their home towns in Uttar Pradesh .
Since the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 to deal with the coronavirus epidemic , all business and economic activity has come to a virtual standstill , leaving migrant workers with no work .
Most of them are daily wage earners who live a hand to mouth existence in big cities , and can not afford to pay rent or buy food unless they earn .
" If police open the borders , we can walk all the way to Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh some 100 kilometers away .
Due to this lockdown , my work got affected .
From past one week , I have nothing to do .
I sell fruits , for which I have to go to Ghazipur mandi and police are not allowing us to go there .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for us to give rent and bear us daily expenses .
We can somehow manage these things in Moradabad , " Singh said .
On Saturday , thousands of daily wagers and labourers from Delhi , Haryana and even Punjab reached Anand Vihar , Ghazipur and Ghaziabad 's Lal Kuan areas after arduous treks on foot in a bid to ride buses to their respective native places .
According to police , around 10,000 to 15,000 people had assembled at Anand Vihar on Saturday .
Around 60 to 70 buses ferried as many passengers as they could .
Till midnight , around 500 more buses were supposed to reach Delhi and evacuate the migrant workers .
However , there is no clarity on how many were actually sent on the buses and how many were dispersed by police .
By Sunday morning , the area had been cleared and Delhi police said no transit is being allowed from Anand Vihar bus terminus .
Instead barricades were placed on all entry points into the terminus at a distance of about 500 meters .
Mohammad Anwar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he came to Delhi two weeks ago from Sitamarhi in Bihar and had no idea that the situation will turn like this .
" I am alone here in the national capital .
My parents live in Sitamarhi .
Police are not allowing us to catch a bus .
My health is not well and I ca n't walk to Sitamarhi .
I have no other option and will go back to my room in east Delhi 's Gandhi Nagar area , " Anwar said .
The distance between Delhi to Sitamarhi is 950 kilometers , which would take around four days to cover on foot .
The death toll from COVID-19 climbed to 25 and the total number of cases to 979 on Sunday .
" The situation for the daily labourers like us is becoming worse day by day as we have lost our source of income .
We do not have money for rent and food .
During the coronavirus , the government is asking people to maintain social distancing .
The situation in shelter homes is even more pathetic and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imran , 25 , a native of Azamgarh in U .
