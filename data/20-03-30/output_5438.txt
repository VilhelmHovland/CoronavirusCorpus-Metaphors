No Community Transmission of Coronavirus infection yet  Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal reiterated on Monday said that there has been no community transmission and instead of panicking , stressed on the need to create awareness about the respiratory ailment .
The ministry , however , in its Standard Operating Procedure issued on Sunday for transporting a COVID-19 case , had mentioned the current phase of the pandemic as " local transmission and limited community transmission " .
Mumbai : There has been no community transmission of Covid-19 virus infections in the country yet , the Union health ministry reiterated on Monday .
The clarification comes soon after it released on Sunday a document on standard operating procedures ( SOP ) for transporting a Covid-19 case , which described India as being currently in the phase of " local transmission " and " limited community transmission " .
However , Lav Agarwal , joint secretary in the health ministry , said the word " community " has been used in a " limited context " .
" Let me re-explain , we have to come out of this semantics .
we have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to highlight the action we are going to do on field .
Nowhere we have said that there is a community transmission .
We are still in a local transmission in this country , " he said on Monday .
Randeep Guleria , who is the director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences , has a different view .
Guleria , who is also the chairman of the high level expert committee formed by the Indian Council of Medical Research to review the testing strategy for Covid-19 cases , said that sporadic cases with no travel history have been seen in the country .
This shows there is community transmission of some degree , he said .
" Some degree of community transmission has been seen .
Aggressive testing measures are being taken at those places , " he said .
The health ministry 's SOP document for transporting a suspected or confirmed Covid-19 case states that " this SOP is applicable to the current phase of Covid-19 pandemic in India ( local transmission and limited community transmission ) .
"  Its SOP reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the outbreak up to this point .
During a media briefing on Saturday , the ICMR had refuted the possibility of community transmission at the moment .
India 's nodal health research body has so far maintained that the country is only facing local transmission of the virus as of now .
Raman R Gangakhedkar , head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR , said there was little evidence to suggest social transmission had begun in India .
" There is no reason to panic at the moment , " Gangakhedkar said , while announcing that the ICMR had now switched from random sample testing to testing of all patients with severe acute respiratory infections ( SARI ) .
" We have just started testing SARI cases .
There are some sporadic instances where cases have not revealed any history of exposure .
But the numbers are not so exponential that we conclude that the virus is spreading rapidly , " he said .
The ICMR had even urged the media to not overinterpret things .
" It is all dependent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal their history or not .
Some people did n't even reveal that they tested positive while others hid their travel history .
Till we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission , let us not overinterpret things , " Gangakhedkar added .
To be sure , earlier this month the ICMR had said that " community transmission " of the virus was " inevitable " , although it had not happened yet .
