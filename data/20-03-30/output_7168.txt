" Then you go and travel to where you need to work or provide your care services .
We 're asking that you wear PPE ( personal protective equiment ) for at least 14 days while you 're doing these services , and then upon completion , go back to your place of lodging and then you 'll be subjected to the self-quarantine , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members who fly to another island for a day or two will have to abide by the 14-day quarantine order as well .
