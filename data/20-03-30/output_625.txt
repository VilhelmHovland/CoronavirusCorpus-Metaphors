Thus , while the coronavirus hiatus has been inconvenient and boring and disruptive , guys are n't worrying about putting food on the table .
The guy currently in 150th place in the FedEx Cup standings , Austin Cook , has already made $279,342 this year .
The same can not be said of the Korn Ferry Tour , which is just one step below the big-boy circuit .
Only 64 players have made more than $17,000 .
A big reason why : The KFT had only completed six events and handed out under $4 million in prize money when the stoppage began , while the PGA Tour had completed 22 events and handed out over $160 million .
All this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players , particularly those who have n't gotten off to the best starts .
Mark Baldwin , currently 42nd on the money list with $25,049 , joined the Golf Digest Podcast this week to give some insight into the economics of the KFT , and how putting the season on hold is squeezing wallets .
" The costs are elevated ( in those first events ) , especially coming off Q-school , where you 're paying the significant entry fee of $5,000 , " Baldwin said ( 47:20 ) .
" Plus , if you 're going through pre-qualifying .
you have those four stages potentially of expenses on top of that .
" So a lot of people are putting Q-school , at the end of their seasons , on credit card .
So they 're playing on credit .
then the season starts up almost right away .
You have Christmas in between , which is just another thing to throw money at .
So by the time you get to the Bahamas , you could potentially be in a dire financial predicament .
