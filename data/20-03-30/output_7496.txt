Employees who are working on the longwall section of the mine will continue work this week , but after that only salaried staff will stay to maintain the mine , Kesterson says .
The mine has 750,000 tons of coal at its preparation plant and a small crew will load the coal on a weekly basis onto trains to fulfill orders , according to Buchanan #1 .
INMET Mining LLC -- which includes the Osaka , Pigeon Creek , North Fork and D-31 mines -- also announced Monday morning it would close due to concerns surrounding COVID-19 .
Osaka employs 60 people , Pigeon Creek employs 13 , North Fork employs 8 and D-31 employs 15 .
They , too will keep a few people on site to maintain the mine during the closure , Kesterson says .
The Polycor quarry , which does not produce coal , reported its closure on Monday to the DMME as well .
