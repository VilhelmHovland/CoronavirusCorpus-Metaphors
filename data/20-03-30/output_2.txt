Indubitably , this outbreak has brought untold hardship to the people of Ghana especially private sector businesses who are compelled to keep up with staff payrolls , utility cost and other statutory payments despite the fact that major revenue generation activities of these businesses are on a standstill .
This calls for innovative approaches by all stakeholders to alley the hardship experienced by these businesses and the citizenry at large .

It is also commendable how the Bank of Ghana has effectively facilitated the release of funds for payment to depositors of collapsed Microfinance , Microcredit and Savings and Loans companies .
In that same vein and as a matter of urgency , we request the Ministry of Finance to partner the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) to ensure the release of funds to pay customers of collapsed Investment Companies/Asset Managers registered and regulated under SEC whose monies are still locked up with these Investment Companies .
