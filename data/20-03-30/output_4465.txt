Naked Insurance reduces cost of CoverPause premiums during COVID-19  Naked Insurance , like many other local service providers , is tailoring its offerings to help customers during the national lockdown and effects of COVID-19 .
To that end the insurance firm has announced that it is reducing the cost of its CoverPause premiums for clients , planning to return them to normal from 1st July onwards , depending on the lockdown and status of COVID-19 in South Africa of course .
As such Naked Insurance clients who make use of the platform , can activate CoverPause if it has not been activated already , and expect to pay an estimated 10 percent of their normal premiums while this offer is being made available .
" This should help ease the financial burden for many of us while our cars are not being driven , " explained Naked in a press release sent to Hypertext .
" We can do this because our actuaries have been taking a close look at how the severe restrictions placed on mobility affect a car 's exposure to theft and Mother Nature .
They have concluded that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can significantly reduce premiums on CoverPause , " it adds .
Naked also points out that when clients are on CoverPause , their car will be fully covered for things that could go wrong while it is parked .
That said , there 's no cover if it 's being driven .
They add that if your accident cover is paused , you should not drive at all .
" If you need to drive to get supplies just pop back onto the app and unpause your cover for that day , " the firms advises .
As such , those wanting to take advantage of the offer , will need to keep a close eye on their app in order to qualify throughout the nine weeks it is being made available .
