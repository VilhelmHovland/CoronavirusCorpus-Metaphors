How Decades of Offshoring Led to a Mask Shortage in a Pandemic  The US Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 95 percent of surgical masks and 70 percent of tighter-fitting respirators , such as N95 masks , are made overseas .
: Paul Yeung/Bloomberg/Getty Images  If you can reach him , Gus Nasrallah , president and CEO of manufacturing equipment supplier Sharpertek in Pontiac , Michigan , can sell you a machine that cranks out the N95 face masks desperately needed by health workers treating Covid-19 patients .
It will cost you $250,000 or more -- but do n't expect it soon .
" We 're telling them six-month delivery .
"  Keith Hayward , managing director of specialty fabric maker Monadnock Nonwovens in Mount Pocono , Pennsylvania , is also deluged with phone calls .
Among other products , his company makes meltblown fabric that provides the ultrafine filtration in N95 masks .
He estimates Monadnock has been getting upwards of 200 calls a day .
" Demand is unprecedented , " he says .
Nasrallah and Hayward are in the middle of a logjam in America 's manufacturing capacity caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by decades of companies shrinking production on US soil and growing complex overseas supply chains , most notably in China .
China 's vast , cheap labor pool and canny government incentives have fostered an extensive ecosystem of manufacturers , suppliers , and workers that is the default place to make everything from disposable face masks to $1,000 smartphones .
American consumers have benefited as essentials such as kitchenware and more complex goods like TVs and computers have gotten cheaper .
Covid-19 has created a natural experiment in how well the US can manage when demand spikes and China 's rich overseas supply chains are choked or cut off .
In February , when the novel coronavirus felt like a faraway problem to most Americans , Apple warned investors that its revenues would take a hit because iPhone production was hampered by factory shutdowns in China .
The same month , Fiat Chrysler halted some production in Europe because Chinese parts were unavailable , and the US Food and Drug Administration began to investigate how a squeeze on Chinese exports of pharmaceutical feedstock might cause drug shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff treating Covid-19 patients are the most serious supply chain symptom of the coronavirus .
Some US hospitals are relying on the public to donate N95 masks , or face shields made by volunteers .
Although some companies that still make masks in the US , such as 3M and Prestige Ameritech are expanding capacity , they ca n't keep pace with pandemic-spurred demand .
Building out new production capacity in a country that spent decades economizing through offshoring is not easy .
Face masks are a low-value , easily shipped item well suited to offshoring in cheaper locales than America .
US Department of Health and Human Services figures say 95 percent of surgical masks and 70 percent of tighter-fitting respirators , such as N95 masks , are made overseas .
The materials used to make the masks are largely produced overseas , particularly in China , says Hayward , of Monadnock Nonwovens .
" It 's just so easy to buy products or material or machines from China , it 's like the easy button .
"  Gus Nasrallah , president and CEO , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks of concentrating production of US health workers ' protective gear in one country painfully clear .
The initial outbreak in Hubei province caused a surge in demand for masks inside China , and cut supplies when authorities shuttered factories to halt the virus ' spread .
Production of masks has now resumed and companies are expanding capacity , but not much of it has shown up outside China .
One ripple effect has been ringing phones at Monadnock Nonwovens .
The company has been swamped with inquiries including from manufacturers in the US , but mostly from elsewhere , such as Asia and South America , who are trying to expand their mask output , and sometimes scrambling to replace materials previously sourced from China .
Hayward says he 's hired more workers and adapted some equipment to produce face mask material , rather than other products , around the clock .
The material is made from fine strands of plastic on a machine about 40 feet long and 20 feet high that operates something like a paper mill , churning out nonwoven fabric with tight pores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw plastic have held up .
MSA , a big maker of industrial safety gear , stopped making N95 masks in Jacksonville , North Carolina , around 10 years ago .
Spokesperson Mark Deasy says the products were not a central part of its business and the company no longer has the equipment .
To help with Covid-19 , MSA is hiring more staff in Jacksonville to increase production of full-face respirators used in industry and by first responders .
They are not approved for use in health care , but the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have temporarily waived usual regulations .
President Trump said at a briefing last week that industrial conglomerate Honeywell was stepping up to make N95 masks .
Spokesperson Eric Krantz says the company is adapting part of a facility in Rhode Island that previously made safety glasses and goggles , but that it will take roughly a month to find and install machinery and raw materials .
Plus : What it means to " flatten the curve , " and everything else you need to know about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Michigan says sourcing face mask production equipment in the US is difficult because there has n't been much of a market for it lately .
" Someone used to buy one of these machines once in a blue moon , " he says .
Like face masks themselves , equipment to make them is cheaper in China .

His company specializes in engineering and building more customized machines for companies such as General Motors and GE .
More recently , Sharpertek 's engineers have been adapting a face mask machine to work with alternatives to the usual polypropylene material , which Nasrallah says has gone from around $2 to $70 a kilogram .
Willy Shih , a professor at Harvard Business School , says the coronavirus pandemic is an opportunity to rethink the received wisdom that offshoring is the best and only way to operate .
Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it comes after other major disruptions to overseas supply chains , such as Trump 's trade war , the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan , and Chinese quotas on exports of rare earths used in batteries and motors in 2010 .
" Maybe it 's time we start to ask about the need for diversity in supply chains , and discuss how we add resiliency , " Shih says .
Broadening capacity and increasing stockpiles of parts and materials would increase costs -- and prices for consumers -- but the pain inflicted by Covid-19 might convince corporate leaders to accept them .
Although a pandemic-prompted recession will make consumers and companies more price sensitive , the crisis may also give " Made in the USA " more marketing power , Shih says .
In the suddenly vital world of cheap , disposable face masks , the pandemic may prompt government support for more onshore production .
Montreal-based protective equipment maker Medicom produces face masks in China , Taiwan , France , and Augusta , Georgia .
The company 's chief operating officer , Guillaume Laverdure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to export controls or government directives on production .
Medicom already had agreements with some governments designed to protect stocks or local production , but interest in such arrangements has grown .
" There 's a strong appetite from some governments to make sure this kind of shortage does not happen again , " Laverdure says .
