The coronavirus has effectively shut down the sports world , decimated the economy , closed schools and public gatherings for months , and forced cities to lock down .
But the NFL is resolute in continuing with its major events this offseason ( while adhering to social distancing guidelines ) .
Free agency started March 18 as planned , and Thursday night commissioner Roger Goodell sent a memo to all 32 teams stating that the NFL Draft will not be pushed back , and will be held April 23-25 .
The NFL can always change course , but the decision to proceed with the original time frame was unanimous among the eight owners on the executive committee who made the decision , one of which is Robert Kraft .
Advertisement  It may seem a bit crass for the NFL to continue with business as usual during these tough times , but the reasoning outlined in Goodell 's memo does make plenty of sense :  ? The forecast for the crisis is highly uncertain , and there are no assurances that doing the draft later in 2020 will be any better .
? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no prospects or families will be invited to the draft ; all team facilities will be shut down , forcing teams to work remotely ; and it will basically be a TV-studio event .
? The NFL Draft gives people a positive distraction during these tough times .
" I have personally discussed this matter with many other owners , club executives , and coaches , and there is widespread support for the executive committee 's conclusion , " Goodell said in his memo .
In fact , the NFL is so determined to hold the event on its scheduled dates that speaking out against it will be costly for team employees ( not players ) .
In his memo , Goodell said he and the executive committee agreed unanimously that " public discussion of issues relating to the Draft serves no useful purpose and is grounds for disciplinary action .
"  Advertisement  This likely came in response to comments this past week from Saints general manager Mickey Loomis , who said on Peter King 's podcast that he and several GMs wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " This is not a fantasy draft that you can conduct with just a list of things on a piece of paper , " Loomis said .
" There 's a lot of work that goes into preparing and there 's a lot of work that is done during the draft that , listen , it 'll be very , very difficult to conduct that and do it in a way that you 're doing justice to the process .
"  John Elway also said last week that he would prefer the draft be pushed back , but he was n't as adamant about it as Loomis .
" We 'd rather have it backed up so we can get all our scouts and everybody in , but if it 's limited and we can stay there and they 're not going to move the draft , we 're in good shape , " Elway said on the Broncos website .
There 's no question that conducting the draft will present unique challenges .
The NFL shut down all pre-draft travel March 13 , which canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the team facilities .
And this past Wednesday the NFL officially shut down all 32 team facilities , other than for medical rehab situations .
Goodell wrote Thursday that teams should prepare to not conduct the draft at their team headquarters .
Advertisement  " All clubs should now be doing the necessary planning to conduct Draft operations in a location outside of your facility , with a limited number of people present , and with sufficient technology resources to allow you to communicate internally , with other clubs , and with Draft headquarters , " the memo said .
The cancellation of Pro Days , medical checks , and predraft visits could have a negative effect on players from small schools , those who were n't invited to the Combine , and those with questionable injuries .
Those players will have incomplete draft files , and filling in the gaps wo n't be easy .
" Last year , 33 non-Combine players were drafted .
I 'll be surprised if we have 15-plus this year , " tweeted Daniel Jeremiah of NFL Network .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  In fact , access to medical information is one area in which certain teams could have a significant advantage in the predraft process .
Even though all travel and team facilities have been shut down , a player can still conduct a physical at an outside medical facility in his hometown .
It means the Dolphins can still quietly conduct physicals and medical checks with the several dozen prospects living in South Florida , as long as it is not at the team facility .
Teams in Arizona , California , Texas , Florida , and New Orleans also have similar geographic advantages , whereas teams such as the Patriots , Bills , and Packers would have very few hometown prospects to check out .
This past week , the president of the NFL Physicians Society wrote to the NFL that the organization " has agreed to discontinue Combine rechecks , free agent physicals , and physicals for non-Combine players until the health crisis has passed .
"  Advertisement  But the NFL 's response to the NFL Physicians Society was clear that " clubs may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical exams conducted in the player 's home city or at another nearby location by a third-party doctor .
"  One league medical source said he expects some teams to take full advantage of their good geographic fortune and to quietly conduct medical checks .
" If the team called an agent and said we 're interested in your guy for the draft , can we have him see our doctor , I think those are going to happen , and they 'll fly under the radar , " the source said .
The NFL could have pushed back the draft to give teams some time to figure everything out .
Instead , Goodell and the owners ' executive committee gave a clear message : The show must go on .
KEEPING SCORE  Free agency a bit unbalanced  The Patriots signed Devin McCourty to a two-year deal on March 15 .
Jonathan Wiggs/Globe Staff  A few Patriots-related notes :  ? They have watched eight of their own free agents sign with other teams , including Tom Brady , Kyle Van Noy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete , the eight combined to sign for a maximum value of around $160 million , with $110 million guaranteed .
Take out Brady , and it 's $110 million and $60 million guaranteed for seven players .
On the flip side , the Patriots have added 14 players in free agency ( including two restricted free agents ) .
The 14 players signed for a total of $77 .
million , with $41 .
million guaranteed .
Devin McCourty and Joe Thuney account for the bulk of it , signing for $37 .
million , with $31 .
million of it guaranteed .
Nine of the Patriots ' 14 signings have $1 million or less of guaranteed money .
Advertisement  ? Not only are the Patriots holding back in free agency , they are not using their salary cap efficiently .
The Patriots are No .
3 in the NFL with more than $26 million in dead salary-cap space , according to OverTheCap .
, behind only the Panthers ( $36 .
million ) and Jaguars ( $33 .
million ) , teams seen as rebuilding from scratch .
? The decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 million of his $3 .
million salary fully guaranteed , and releasing him created less than $1 million of salary-cap space .
If Gostkowski signs with another team , the Patriots will get a salary-cap credit for whatever amount Gostkowski 's new team pays him , but that credit would n't come until 2021 .
This was about the Patriots wanting a new kicker .
? What do Brady and Jameis Winston have in common ? Both ended their 2019 seasons with a pick-6 -- Brady 's on an interception to Logan Ryan on his final pass of the playoff loss to the Titans , and Winston on an interception to the Falcons ' Deion Jones on the first play of overtime in Week 17 .
Jarrett Stidham was almost in that club , too -- his pick-6 to Jamal Adams in Week 3 was his second-to-last throw of the 2019 season .
Stidham had one more pass attempt , an incompletion in Week 5 .
? Brady threw a pick-6 in consecutive games to end last season -- victimized by Eric Rowe in Week 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
How rare was that ? Brady only has thrown 16 pick-6s in his career , over 11,614 pass attempts ( regular season and playoffs ) .
The 2001 and 2019 seasons were the only ones of Brady 's career in which he threw two pick-6s .
Winston , meanwhile , threw seven of them last year , and has 11 in his five-year career .
Gostkowski ranks among the best  Stephen Gostkowski was released by the Patriots on Wednesday after 14 seasons with the team .
Grossfeld/Globe Staff  He did n't have many iconic kicks like his predecessor , Adam Vinatieri , but Stephen Gostkowski leaves Foxborough after 14 seasons as one of the most successful kickers in NFL history .
Did you know :  ? Gostkowski is No .
4 in NFL history in field goal accuracy , connecting on 87 .
percent of his kicks .
He had been as high as No .

Gostkowski 's long of 62 is tied for eighth longest in NFL history .

Newton , Winston will have to wait  " Patience , " by Guns N ' Roses .
Or if they prefer a more modern song : " Patience " by Tame Impala .
Newton and Winston will be on rosters this fall .
But they may have to wait a long time to sign -- particularly Newton , who has suffered significant shoulder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NFL shutting down all travel and teams turning their focus to the draft , neither veteran quarterback should expect to sign soon .
The free agent market at all positions has slowed to a trickle , with teams only re-signing minimum-salary veterans by late this past week .
At this point , most teams want to see how the quarterback market shakes out in the draft before committing to another veteran .
The price tag should come down on both Newton and Winston after the draft , as well .
And especially with Newton , teams will want to give him a thorough medical check before committing a contract .
Those physicals may not be able to happen for several months .
Though no starting jobs may be available right away , there are still several decent options for both QBs .
The Jaguars , Chargers , and Patriots appear to have open competitions ( though do n't bet on the Patriots ) .
The Jets only have one backup , Mike White .
The Steelers probably want an upgrade from Mason Rudolph , Devlin Hodges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could use an upgrade behind Drew Lock .
The Seahawks ' only backup is Geno Smith .
The Cardinals have Brett Hundley and someone named Drew Anderson as Kyler Murray 's backups .
The Buccaneers need a third arm behind Tom Brady and Ryan Griffin .
And the Titans , Rams , Vikings , and Packers all look like they could use upgrades behind their starters .
But Winston and Newton will likely have to wait until after the draft , if not much longer , to find their new homes .
Stadium projects uninterrupted  Allegiant Stadium is still under construction during the coronavirus pandemic as the Raiders are set to begin their first season in Las Vegas in the fall .
Miller/Getty  The coronavirus has put much about the 2020 NFL season in flux , but for now it has n't affected the construction of football stadiums in Las Vegas and Los Angeles .
Casinos and most businesses have been closed in Nevada , but construction has been deemed an essential business , and progress on the Raiders ' $2 billion Allegiant Stadium has continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , per the Las Vegas Review-Journal , and this past week one worker tested positive for COVID-19 .
And in California , construction work has also been exempt from the state 's shelter-at-home orders , allowing work to continue on the $5 billion SoFi Stadium , the new home of the Rams and Chargers .
Both stadiums were planned to open for this season , and so far remain on track .
Extra points  Defensive lineman Michael Brockers and cornerback Darqueze Dennard were the first two casualties of the NFL 's modified free agency process , in which teams were forced to rely on third-party medical exams for some free agents .
Brockers agreed to a three-year , $30 million with the Ravens two weeks ago , but Baltimore backed out of the deal Friday because of concerns about an ankle injury .
The injury could n't have been too serious as Brockers quickly re-signed with the Rams , his former team ( but for less money than he was going to get in Baltimore ) .
And the Jaguars backed out of a three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a previous knee injury .
Temple-to-Carolina is the new Rutgers-to-Foxborough .
Four former Temple Owls have signed with the Panthers this offseason : receiver Robby Anderson , linebacker Tahir Whitehead , receiver Keith Kirkwood , and quarterback P .
Walker .
New Panthers coach Matt Rhule was the head coach at Temple from 2013-16 .
Brady will do just fine for himself the next two years , earning $50 million fully guaranteed from the Buccaneers .
But for Brady to achieve the maximum $59 million , he 'll just have to finish in the top five in almost every major quarterback statistic , and win two Super Bowls .
No problem .
Not surprised to see Peyton Manning take a pass on ESPN 's " Monday Night Football " again .
The money is great , but it 's a big commitment , and the travel for Monday night games can be a drag .
If he does ever decide to do it ( and here 's betting he would be fantastic -- even better than Tony Romo ) , Manning would probably want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
With Brady leaving the Patriots , it leaves Cardinals receiver Larry Fitzgerald , Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger , and Lions long snapper Don Muhlbach as the players with the longest tenure with one team .
Each joined their teams in 2004 and are going on their 17th consecutive seasons .
Fitzgerald technically has the longest tenure , because he was the No .
3 pick in 2004 , Roethlisberger was No .
11 , and Muhlbach went undrafted .
