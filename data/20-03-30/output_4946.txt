Virus exposes Xi 's feet of clay  ANI Updated : Mar 30 , 2020 13:06 IST  Hong Kong , Mar 30 ( ANI ) : The world is reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic , and few have been harder hit than the image of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) and Chairman Xi Jinping .
Such is the battering that China has been receiving , that the party propaganda machine has slammed into top gear to roll back the criticism .
For much of his presidency , it seemed Xi could do no wrong .
The party 's golden boy benefitted from a carefully concocted domestic and international propaganda campaign .
It seemed that China 's rise was inexorable , and master tactician Xi was allowed to sweep away past traditions and to grasp the reins of power for a lifetime .
Adam Ni , Director of the China Policy Centre , an independent non-profit research organization based in Canberra , spoke to ANI about how Xi has been impacted by China 's mishandling of the health crisis .
" Regarding Xi 's popularity amid COVID-19 , I think there are two sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the absence of Xi from the public limelight for days on end towards the early stages of this crisis has hit Xi 's popularity .
"  Ni added , " Xi 's political star has certainly been challenged over the past twelve months with challenges across a spectrum of issues , including a slowing economy , Hong Kong , cross-strait relations with Taiwan , US-China relations and China 's international reputation .
All in all , COVID-19 and these other challenges and blunders have made Xi vulnerable to criticism .
He is less politically unassailable than he was at the start of 2019 , for example .
"  Xi 's and the CCP 's peculiar feeling of vulnerability is underscored dramatically by the remorseless propaganda campaign that China is now waging .
In Mao Zedong 's time , this was called a " tongue war " but now much of it is being fought on Western online and media platforms .
Efforts by Chinese diplomats , ministers , department spokespersons and other lackeys to push " alternative truths " have reached unprecedented levels .
These figureheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nefarious messages , even though such platforms are banned within China .
Their singular purpose is to deflect blame for bungling the response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan .
China Neican , a weekly China information newsletter published weekly by Adam Ni and Yun Jiang , summarized : " The Chinese authorities ' first instinct was the suppression of information .
After realizing that paper can not stifle a fire , it then turned its propaganda effort to mobilization - how the government has acted decisively to build hospitals in record times and lockdown entire cities .
For two weeks , it allows some non-state-sanctioned information to flow .
The authorities then clamped down hard on information control again , with the emphasis being placed on telling positive stories .
So the heroic efforts of frontline workers were highlighted while the sufferings of the patients were downplayed .
"  Ni commented to ANI : " There was deep frustration and resentment at the Chineseauthorities ' early response to COVID-19 .
But I think the current extreme measures have wide public support because they are seen as effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own narrative about the virus , focusing in on its achievements while deflecting blame .
Chinese officials have even gone as far as to spread conspiracy theories about how the virus originated in the USA .
"  One example is Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lijian Zhao who tweeted a conspiracy theory that the virus came from a US military bio-lab .
WeChat articles alleging the virus had a US origin were also permitted to disseminate .
Summarizing the CCP 's propaganda efforts to shape the COVID-19 narrative , Ni shared with ANI : " In my mind , there are four key elements to its narrative efforts , essentially all for the purpose of bolstering the legitimacy of the party at a time of heightened uncertainty for the Chinese people .
"  The first point mentioned by the Australia-based academic is blame avoidance .
" The party has sought to deflect blame by scapegoating other expandable actors , such as local authorities .
It has also sought to minimize attention to its early missteps .
Some of China 's diplomats have even gone as far as supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Secondly , Ni mentioned the leveraging of nationalistic sentiment .
" Through the narratives about a ' People 's War ' against disease , and casting the crisis as a national struggle , the CCP is whipping up nationalism to bolster its legitimacy .
" The CCP thus enacted a new phase blaming " foreign hostile forces " , a typical ploy .
Third is highlighting the supposed superiority of China 's political and governance system .
" The Chinese state-party has focused heavily on shortcomings of the international response to the virus , especially in Europe and the USA .
In doing so , it is trying to convince the domestic public and the international community that China 's political and governance system has superior features .
"  Latterly , China has been highlighting its global support for countries like Italy with deliveries of medical supplies and health workers .
Beijing is busily posturing as a world leader in virus research and effective governance .
Ironically , the depths of its propaganda efforts demonstrate how unconfident the CCP is about its governance .
It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing Chinese communist is not a robust system .
These are not the actions of a strong party state , but one that fears opprobrium .
Finally , Ni listed censorship .
" The party is censoring dissenting views domestically in an effort to sway public opinion and control the narrative environment in China .
The success of this has been mixed as censors and netizens play an endless game of cat-and-mouse .
"  Many Chinese netizens went to great lengths despite censorship to spread the story of the crisis , illustrating that many Chinese do care for the truth rather than merely what supports the party apparatus .
One blogger called Fang Fangbravely said , " The government should end its arrogance and humbly express gratitude to its masters - the millions of people in Wuhan .
" China Neican commented , " Real change in China comes from the accumulation of billions of actions by normal people within the country itself , instead of rhetoric from the West .
"  Michael George DeSombre , US Ambassador to Thailand , wrote in a State Department op-ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crises .
A government 's duty is to save lives , not save face .
"  DeSombre catalogued errors by China , such as orders to deliberately destroy virus samples early on , and arresting people for sharing news of the outbreak online .
Furthermore , seven million people left Wuhan in January before travel restrictions were finally imposed .
Ni concluded , " In essence , the party wants to make the best out of a terrible situation and spin the story in favor of the party by deflecting blame , sowing doubts on its culpability , whipping up nationalism and highlighting the superiority of the Chinese party-state .
"  Throughout December and most of January , Xi wanted only to stifle news of the outbreak .
Thus , from 11-17 January , for example , an important pre-scheduled CCP meeting was held in Wuhan and , during that time , the provincial health commission oddly insisted there were no new virus cases .
Initially , Xi distanced himself from the crisis , because a degree of separatism would help disassociate him from any blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 March , although he sent Premier Li Keqiang in late January .
When he did eventually bother to turn up in the epicenter , it was treated by media as something of a victory tour .
Praising his paternal care , comments such as " his heart contains everyone " gushed forth .
However , Xi 's delayed visit contrasts with past leaders who were usually relatively swift to arrive on the scene after disaster struck .
The Wuhan party secretary general 's earlier comments that all should be " grateful " to Xi and the CCP grossly backfired , so instead Xi praised the heroism of Wuhan citizens .
An important subplot was the case of Wuhan doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang .
He warned of the novel widespread attention , on 3 January he was arrested by the police and forced to say he had made " false comments " .
The 34-year-old doctor died of COVID-19 on 7 February , bringing forth a gush of public anger that posed an immediate threat to the CCP 's image .
Chinese media were thus required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without casting aspersions on the government .
To assuage anger , Wuhan 's Public Security Bureau " solemnly apologized " for its mistake in admonishing Li .
After allowing an initial period to vent mourning over Li 's death , censorship clamped down again .
One thread in the unfolding narrative was that China had declared local victory over the virus , while other countries such as Italy were not coping nearly as well .
Another narrative is captured by the following excerpt : " Were it not for the unique institutional advantages of the Chinesesystem , the world might be battling a devastating pandemic .
" Indeed , mankind was told it should be " grateful " to China for " buying the world time " .
Unfortunately , because of ineptitude and ill-preparedness among many Western leaders , and the statements of sycophantic people like Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the Ethiopian Director-General of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , China 's narrative has been bolstered .
The immaturity of President Donald Trump 's in calling it the " China virus " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , Beijing is quick to play the racist card , with the CCP adept at conflating the Chinese people with the party even though they are in fact different entities .
WHO did not declare a pandemic until 11 March , after parroting dubious assurances from China that all was under control .
On 15 January , WHO infamously tweeted , " Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus .
"  Xi , by centralizing power upon his own shoulders as supreme leader , has increased his degree of risk .
With one crisis after another piling up on China 's doorstep , his aura has diminished .
This explains why the propaganda machine is pulling out all stops right now for face is of utmost importance to Asian culture in general , and for the ultra-sensitive CCP in particular .
Perhaps the most pertinent question to ask is how Xi 's image will be affected in the months and years ahead .
Ni predicted : " It 's unclear at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It depends on how the virus situation develops in China .
Despite that it has now come under control , I think this crisis has some way to go yet with deep implications for Chinese society and the relationship between the people and the party .
Most importantly , the party will likely arrive at the conclusion that , to prevent future such crisis , it needs more control over society .
"  This is a bleak prediction , although likely accurate .
Under Xi , China has become increasingly Orwellian with intrusive surveillance and digitization of personal data .
Religions - whether Buddhist , Christian , Falun Gong or Muslim - have all been targeted for stricter sanctions .
Indeed , more than a million Uighurs are currently locked up in concentration camps .
Regarding the latter , no information has trickled out over coronavirus outbreaks , but such overcrowded institutions represent a dangerous potential breeding ground .
China 's economy will have been severely impacted by COVID-19 .
This will have a knock-on effect on Xi 's blue-ribbon Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convince the world that the BRI will quickly get back on track .
The 2019 World Press Freedom Index awarded China 177th place out of 180 countries , eclipsed only by Eritrea , Turkmenistan and North Korea .
The country is an inveterate manipulator of the truth .
Whilst simultaneously kicking out reporters from several American newspapers , China stated , " We call on foreign media outlets and journalists to play a positive role in advancing the mutual understanding between China and the rest of the world .
"  Beijing is not interested in the truth , but only in promoting its own ideology where the CCP and Xi reign supreme .
It is therefore hypocritical of China to accuse the USA of " unwarranted restrictions " on Chinese state-owned media and " growing discrimination and politically motivated oppression " while it prosecutes a campaign of falsities to burnish its marred image .
