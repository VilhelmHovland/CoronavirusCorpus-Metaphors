As of 5 p .
Monday , state health officials had confirmed 264 COVID-19 cases in Delaware .
Of those cases , there are 156 in New Castle County , 27 in Kent County and 81 in Sussex County , according to the state 's website .
Seven people have died due to complications of the virus , many of whom were seniors with underlying health conditions .
State officials say 46 residents are hospitalized in Delaware , while 22 people have recovered from the illness .

About 17% of Delaware 's confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been hospitalized .
Carney said this is a result of the median age of people infected , which is skewing older .
The state , he said , is working with Bloom Energy to repurpose old ventilators that had " outlived their useful life .
" The ventilators have been sitting in a Delaware warehouse , the governor said .
Around the country , states such as New York and Washington are desperately trying to find ventilators to save the lives of the sickest .
The state of California has also repurposed its old ventilators .
" We 're guardedly optimistic that we will be able to do that , " Carney said .
" That would significantly increase the number of ventilators available to the hospitals .
"  In addition to setting up mobile units , the governor said Monday that officials are looking at vacant space at Nemours/A .

The Governor Bacon Health Center , which cares for the chronically ill , has already started to move some of its patients into other facilities to clear up space .
The state is also considering using vacant hotels .
These standalone facilities would n't be used for patients who are in need of critical care , Carney said .
The state 's sickest patients would still be treated in the hospitals .
Delaware has about 2,000 licensed hospital beds in its hospitals , Carney said .
Since Thursday , the state has confirmed 13 cases in two Delaware assisted-living nursing homes -- HarborChase in Talleyville and Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in Ogletown .
An 86-year-old man , who lived at Jeanne Jugan Residence , died due to complications with the coronavirus , officials announced Thursday .
Donna Winegar , executive director of Brandywine Living at Seaside Pointe , near Rehoboth Beach , said Monday that a resident in their 90s had died from complications of the coronavirus on Sunday .
The person was in hospice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other residents have been confirmed with the virus , and no staff members are self-isolating , she said .
Carney said during Monday 's Facebook Live that he has a " quite a bit of concern " that nursing homes and assisted living facilities have n't been doing enough to prepare for the coronavirus and protect patients and workers .
In states like Washington , nursing homes have become hot spots for the coronavirus .
Carney said the state is discussing what to do with individuals who have tested positive for coronavirus , are under quarantine and are still living in the facility .
" We have ratcheted up the advice and guidance that we 've given there , " Carney said .
Carney said on Monday that the state is on a " week-to-week basis " with the number of testing kits it has .
Last week , the state health department said it had run 639 tests and had collected 2,167 samples since March 26 .

( Photo : Jerry Habraken , Delaware News Journal )  The state 's ability to continue running its coronavirus testing facilities will depend on the demand the health systems are experiencing , he said , and whether they need health care workers now performing the tests to provide care instead .
Delaware must preserve a certain amount of testing kits for health care workers , first responders and law enforcement , Carney said .
" We want to continue testing to know when this thing has flattened out and peaked , so we can start transitioning back to people going back to work and getting our economy running again , " Carney said .
" We need data from which to base those decisions .
"  The lack of availability of reagents -- chemicals used to complete testing -- for the testing kits has been an issue for some Delaware hospitals , Carney said .
Because of this , the state has been working with local companies and the University of Delaware to develop its own reagents , which could be a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks since Delaware has confirmed its first case , the governor has placed a stay-at-home order and temporarily closed schools until May 15 .
On Sunday , he ordered out-of-state travelers coming to Delaware to quarantine for 14 days .
Carney did not offer any specifics on when schools might return to session .
But the said districts have been encouraged to focus on how they can provide online learning to students .
" It would be a very bad thing if our students lost a whole half a year , " Carney said .
In an amusing example of how staying at home has affected everyone , toward the end of the interview , Carney casually asked to pause a moment because his computer was about to lose power .
He asked his home IT staff -- his wife , Tracey Quillen Carney -- to bring him a charging cord .
