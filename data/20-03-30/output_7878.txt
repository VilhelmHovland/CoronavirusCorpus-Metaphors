Yesterday , we learned the upsetting news that the great singer-songwriter John Prine was in critical condition , being treated for COVID-19 .
Today , Prine 's wife Fiona -- who herself is recovering from coronavirus -- tweeted that Prine is " stable .
" She also thanked Prine 's fans and well-wishers for the public outpouring of love and wrote , " Sing his songs .
" A whole lot of people are doing exactly that .
Earlier today , we posted a video of Joan Baez playing " Hello In There , " a John Prine song that she first covered in 1975 .
Now another admirer of Prine has shared video of herself singing one of Prine 's songs .
Adrianne Lenker , leader of the great indie band Big Thief , has posted a home-recorded video of herself doing a solo-acoustic take on " Summer 's End , " a song from Prine 's most recent album The Tree Of Forgiveness .
That LP , released in 2018 , was Prine 's first in 13 years .
" Summer 's End " is a bittersweet song about love , and Prine has said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Lenker 's version of " Summer 's End " is soft and empathetic .
There 's part near the end where she just stops and lets out a deep sigh , and it 's like : Yes .
Exactly .
( I do n't know if Lenker recorded it before learning that Prine was recovering , but judging by that sigh , I 'm guessing no .
) Along with the video , Lenker wrote , " I 'm beyond grateful for the gift of his songs , sending love to his whole family .
" Watch the video below .
