Trump forces General Motors to produce ventilators  President Donald Trump issued an order last week that seeks to force General Motors ( GM ) to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients under the Defence Production Act .
Trump said negotiations with General Motors had been productive , but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course .
Trump , who had previously been reluctant to use the act to force businesses to contribute to the coronavirus fight , said GM was wasting time and that his actions will help ensure the quick production of ventilators that will save American lives .
The GM is among the farthest along of US companies trying to repurpose factories to build ventilators .
It is working with Ventec Life Systems , a small Seattle-area ventilator maker , to increase the company 's production and GM will use its auto electronics plant in Kokomo , Indiana to make the machines .
Experts say that no matter how many ventilators companies can crank out , it may not be enough to cover the entire need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now being hit hard with critical virus cases .
GM said it can build 10,000 ventilators per month starting in April with potential to make even more .
US hospitals now have about 65,000 ventilators fully capable of treating severe coronavirus patients .
They could cobble together about 170,000 , including some simpler versions that would not work in all cases , said Dr Lewis Rubinson , chief medical officer at Morristown Medical Center in New Jersey and lead author of a 2010 medical journal article on the matter .
Some 960,000 people in the US will need to be on ventilators at one point or another during the crisis , according to an estimate made in February by Dr James Lawler , an associate professor and infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center .
Rubinson said it is unlikely the US would need that many ventilators at the same time , estimating it will need more like 300,000 fairly quickly .
If social distancing works , people will get sick at different times , allowing hospitals to use ventilators on multiple patients .

Pneumonia can develop , along with a more severe and potentially deadly condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome , which can damage other organs .
After Trump invoked the act , GM said in a statement that it has been working around the clock for more than a week with Ventec and parts suppliers to build more ventilators .
The company said its commitment to build Ventecs ventilators has never wavered .
Trump said from the Oval Office last week that the government thought it had a deal for 40,000 ventilators but GM cut the number to 6,000 and talked about a higher price than previously discussed .
" We did not want to play games with them , " he said later that evening during his daily briefing , adding that GM now agrees with him and he may be able to end the enforcement of the act .
Trump also said he was not happy with GM for closing its factory in Lordstown , Ohio .
I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
Peter Navarro , White House trade adviser , said officials worked with more than 10 companies to get ventilators , including Ford and General Electric , and nearly all have been cooperative .
But the government had problems with GM and Ventec , he said .
" We can not afford to lose a single day , " he said .
GM asserts that it is offering resources to Ventec at cost .
Ventec , not GM , is talking with the government , and the only changes Ventec has made have been at the government 's request , said Chris Brooks , the company 's chief strategy officer .
GM would merely be a contract manufacturer for Ventec , he said .
Ventec ventilators , which are portable and can handle intensive care patients , cost about $18,000 each , Brooks said .
That 's much cheaper than the more sophisticated ventilators used by hospitals that can cost up to $50,000 , he said .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has made multiple requests for estimates of how many ventilators it can build at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Brooks .
That could slow Ventec 's efforts to ramp up production because it does not know how many breathing machines it must build , he said .
Trump invoked the Defence Production Act soon after a series of tweets last week attacking GM and CEO Mary Barra .
The president also cajoled Ford to build ventilators fast .
Ford responded that it is pulling out all the stops .
It was a dramatic shift in tone from the night before , when the president told Fox News that pleas by hospitals for more ventilators are exaggerated .
" I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they are going to be " , he said .
I do not believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators , " Trump continued .
" You know , you are going to major hospitals sometimes , they 'll have two ventilators .
And now , all of a sudden , they 're saying , can we order 30,000 ventilators ? "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invoked the act if the ventilators wo n't be needed , he said he thought there is a good chance there 'll be enough and that if there ends up being a surplus , the ventilators could be sent to other countries .
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has been pleading for 30,000 more ventilators to handle an expected surge in critical virus patients during the next three weeks .
US Representative Debbie Dingell , a Michigan Democrat , said her state is facing a critical need for ventilators .
Michigan has gone from three coronavirus deaths a week ago to a total of 92 on Friday ( 27 March ) .
" I think we need to let the scientists and the doctors tell us what we need and not people without medical degrees or the background , .
