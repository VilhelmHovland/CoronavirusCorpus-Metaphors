At times like these , old contacts of mine start to resurface , asking me what I think will happen next in markets .
If I could predict markets , I 'd have shorted the market in mid-Feb and I 'd be self-isolating on a brand new yacht right now .
However , I ca n't .
So , I 'm not .
The next best thing after clairvoyance , however , might be to keep an eye on what the debt markets are saying .
Just as they did leading into the GFC , they gave a good warning in January this year that equities were about to take a bath .
And right now , credit spreads are one such signal to keep an eye on .
This issue of spiking credit spreads - and what they mean - came up during a recent webinar presentation by Peter Rutter from Royal London Asset Management .
I sat in on the call and have summarised some of the key points for you below , including why we may be looking at ' an exceptional long-term opportunity ' , the stocks Peter is holding right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidate , so we can thrive when this has all passed .
Watch out for credit spreads  While Peter flagged a worrying jump in equity risk premia , the chart that really jumped out was the sharp jump in credit spreads .
This has bucked the steady trend lower over the last decade , to triple very quickly in recent weeks .
Source : Royal London Asset Management  Credit spreads show the difference between the yields in investment-grade credit and US treasuries , and so provide a proxy for the perceived risk of corporates defaulting .
This huge move takes them back to where they were back in 2011 , and are a warning of the big hole appearing where the economy used to be .
As Peter put it in his presentation , we are seeing :  " .
an incredibly dramatic increase in credit risk in bond markets , signalling the fears of bankruptcy for corporates .
That reflects the reaction to the COVID-19 virus which is causing a genuinely massive - and possibly the largest - cyclical slowdown that we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be talking 10-20% of GDP on a quarterly basis is imminent in some economies as a result of this " .
Peter talked through a few potential scenarios , including the low probability that the virus drags on for an extended period as infections repeat .
" The ' super-bear ' case is that we never really get immunity to the virus , like Herpes , Eppstein-Barr or HIV , and that it continues to impact people 's health " .
However , his base case for the moment was more manageable , in that we see a protracted slowdown for 3-4 months and then a gradual recovery after that as lockdowns cease .
Fixed interest dries up , while equities are super-volatile  Another interesting point he made was the difference between how asset classes are behaving in the current environment .
Fixed interest has seen very challenging market conditions in terms of liquidity , which he said were as bad , or arguably worse than anything seen since the GFC .
In contrast , equities remained highly liquid , even in small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high and dry during difficult times .
As a fund , Royal London runs A$60 billion of equities and they had not experienced any issues .
The big challenge for equities though had been the immense volatility , which has seen numerous headlines reading " Biggest one-day move since .
" in the last few weeks , with some mind-boggling jumps in both directions .
When a 3% move feels like a quiet day , you know things have been volatile .
Peter noted that the market structure is making this volatility worse :  " There is a huge amount of money run in equities from ETFs , leveraged ETFs , quant funds , and large asset allocators , but they have no framework to navigating this framework as there is no backtesting of COVID-19 , causing the most incredibly dramatic sector and market volatility " .
Exceptional long-term opportunity for investors  In terms of how Royal London is navigating this extremely challenging market , the theme running through the presentation was ' Survive , Consolidate , Thrive ' as he summarised in this slide .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity arising through the falls in equity markets , with him saying that :  " .
we do see the recent pullback as an exceptionally interesting long-term investment opportunity for investors " .
Part of the Royal London investment strategy is to allocate every company in the investment universe into one of five corporate Life Cycle categories thus :  Accelerating  Compounding  Fading  Maturity  Turnaround  Peter expanded on what each of these categories means in an interview I did with him last year , which you can read here .
In the webinar , he pointed out that , across the market , it has been the ' accelerating ' and ' compounding ' stocks that have delivered the best performance in the last few years .
He also included a slide that covered the stocks in the portfolio right now :  Interestingly , one of the companies above that Peter discussed , Progressive Corporation ( NYSE:PGR ) , which provides car insurance , is one of a very few companies to actually benefit from the fallout of COVID-19 .
With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car accidents , and therefore very few car insurance claims , which should support higher margins for Progressive !
