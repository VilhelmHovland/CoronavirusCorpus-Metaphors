Londoner launches collection of masks , other supplies for health workers  The fears of nurses at London Health Sciences Centre have prompted a Londoner to launch a campaign that in one day collected hundreds of surgical masks and a handful of N95 masks .
" I have a lot of friends who are nurses , and they 're all concerned .
They 're scared they 're going to die .
They 're scared they 're going to bring it home to their kids , " said Kimberley Vander Schelde , who has long experience with the health-care system as the mother of a child who had cancer .
She realized she had a few N95 masks and gloves in her home , partly because she paints signs and refinishes furniture as hobbies .
" I started to think about what we all might have in our homes -- the things you would have in your garage , when you 're redoing furniture , painting , that sort of thing , " Vander Schedle said .
" You know , you buy a pack of five masks to drywall , but you only use one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the word to Londoners who might have unused N95 masks in their house , or have the more common surgical masks .
Vander Schelde and staff at Assurance Home Health Care started collecting donations Monday , including 300 surgical masks and about 500 pairs of gloves from London Nails Club , Vander Schelde said .
She also has eight N95 masks and another 100 other surgical masks at home -- collected over the years from running retreats for mothers of children with cancer , from getting home care services for her own daughter and from collecting medical supplies for overseas missions .
Supplies can be dropped off at Assurance Home Health Care at 655 Wellington Rd .
at Wilkins Street , or donors can contact Vander Schelde and she will pick them up .
She 's offering her masks , gloves and booties -- also provided by the nail salon -- to anyone who can prove he or she is a health-care worker .
