This comes after proposed sites recommended by the City were rejected by the national government .
Mayco member for community and health services Zahid Badroodien said : " The City is undertaking to make available sites in all four geographical areas in the next week , where street people can be housed during the lockdown .
The search for temporary shelter is taking some time after initial sites , touted by the national government , were withdrawn .
We understand there has been immense interest in this particular issue , and we assure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces for our street people during this challenging time .
"  On Saturday , the City started moving homeless residents to a temporary shelter .
The parking lot adjacent to the City 's Culemborg Safe Space will be the first site to be utilised .
A tent was erected , along with sanitation facilities , as well as implementation of appropriate social distancing measures .
Work is also under way at the Paint City site in Bellville , while sites have also been identified in Somerset West , Muizenberg and Fish Hoek .
" The primary goal is to get people into shelters .
We got our first location in the City , the Culemborg site , which demonstrates the urgent need in the City .
We had a positive meeting with Minister of Public Works Patricia De Lille on where we are looking to shelter the homeless , " Badroodien said .
Mayor Dan Plato said : " We are still dealing with the issue of finding sites .
We are still looking at sites to unlock and I 'd like to also stress that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to assist the City .
Now , when we have this outbreak , they want to be assisted .
All spheres of government are involved .
"  Currently during the lockdown period the City 's social workers are not working in the field because of the health risk it poses to them .
Many shelters are full and can not accommodate any more homeless people .
CEO of CapeTown Central Improvement District ( CCID ) Tesso Evangelinos said : " We are aware of this .
Existing shelters for the homeless community in and around the city centre are full and can not accommodate any more street people .
Certain of these shelters are also in lockdown .
New temporary shelters to cope with housing downtown CapeTown 's homeless community -- which is the biggest in the Western Cape - in a safe environment during lockdown were identified by the City .
"  CCID social development manager Pat Eddy said : " As a community , they are very vulnerable to a pandemic like coronavirus , so it is paramount that temporary shelter space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community is scared as they are high-risk , " he said .
De Lille 's spokesperson , Zara Nicholson said : " Public works has only assisted to identify sites that we own as national public works and offers from the private sector and provincial governments .
