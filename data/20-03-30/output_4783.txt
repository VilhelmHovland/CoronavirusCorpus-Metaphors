Special Free Report  For a limited time , The Motley Fool Australia is giving away an urgent new investment report outlining our 5 favourite stocks for investors over 50 .
Each company boasts strong growth prospects over the next 3 to 5 years , and most importantly each pays a generous ( and fully franked ) dividend ! So if you 're looking to get your finances on track and you 're in or near retirement -- we 've got you covered !  Risks of a deep recession rising : here 's how to prepare your portfolio  The coronavirus curve may be showing encouraging early signs of flattening in Australia , but that 's unlikely to sway economists warning that we are in for a deep global recession .
The daily growth rate of infections slowed to around 15% from the 25% to 30% range in the previous week , according to the government 's latest figures .

The daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25% to 30% range in the previous week , according to the government 's latest figures .
But ASX investors should prepare for a second wave and I do n't necessarily mean of COVID-19 .
That remains to be seen as countries like China , which has largely overcome the pandemic , try to avoid another outbreak .
Second wave from the pandemic  What I think is almost guaranteed as a second-round impact is unemployment and loan defaults .
We 've already seen mass layoffs but the jobless rate is likely to get worst despite the government 's rumoured stimulus to pay a $1,500 wage subsidy every fortnight and a push to protect consumers and business from landlords and banks .
The problem is that household indebtedness is a global issue .
It is n't only Australians who have been using leverage to fund consumption .
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the recession is likely to take longer to overcome than the medical emergency .
Remember we had a falling standard of living issue due to the low wage-growth environment pre-coronavirus ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only magnify the issue and consumers will have little room to increase their spending in the recovery even with low interest rates .
Further , the uncoordinated global response to the catastrophe will leave economies recovering at different times .
This will also drag out the malaise .
Positioning your ASX portfolio  If you believe the economic doomsayers , you should be thinking about how best to position your ASX portfolio for the stronger and longer downturn .
To be sure , equities tend to perform poorly in a recession and there will be few places in the market to hide .
Also , investors will need to be especially alert to seemingly defensive shares that will turn out to be bear-traps .
Avoid the yield traps  One group of stocks that I think will outperform are those with a sustainable dividend yield of at least 5% .
You might think that it 's shooting fish in a barrel given that so many ASX stocks have fallen so hard , thus lifting their yields .
But many of these companies will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession -- this includes infrastructure stocks .
For instance , Transurban Group ( ASX : TCL ) looks vulnerable to me .
If the economy slows significantly , so will traffic on its toll roads .
If debt becomes an issue , that will pose an additional risk .
Let 's not also forget that management is in dispute with the Victorian government .
Also consider this , the stock 's FY19 yield sits at just under 5% , and during the GFC , management slashed the dividend to just 22 cents per share .
A better option in my view is Telstra Corporation Ltd ( ASX : TLS ) as its revenues are less impacted by economic activity given that our mobiles and internet are seen as basic necessities .
Good as gold  Another sector that will hold up well is n't known for dividends .
This is the gold sector as the precious metal has historically outperformed during times of economic stress .
The gold price is up by more than 7% this calendar year to US$1,630 an ounce , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new epicentre for the outbreak while Australia and China show that they can control the outbreak , the US dollar is likely to come under pressure .
A falling greenback will lift the price of gold .
The ASX gold producers I would be looking at are those with scale and little debt .
In that respect , stocks like Evolution Mining Ltd ( ASX : EVN ) look attractive .
