With most of the country on lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic , many people are turning to takeout and delivery food .
But how safe is it ?  Experts say the risk of contracting COVID-19 through hot or cold meals is extremely low .
They say there 's no evidence that the virus is transmitted by food or food packaging .
And even if the virus is ingested , the stomach would actually get rid of it .
" When you eat any kind of food , whether it be hot or cold , that food is going to go straight down into your stomach where there is a high acidity , low pH environment that will also inactivate the virus , " said Angela Rasmussen , PhD , a virologist at Columbia University .
" I think the highest risk moment in getting food delivered to you is actually the face-to-face interaction , if you have one with the delivery person , " said Dr .
Celine Gounder , clinical assistant professor at NYU Medical School .
For those who do order food , have the delivery person leave it outside at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food .
Remove the food from the packaging and leave the packaging outside or throw it away immediately .
Wipe the surfaces of the food containers , and lastly wash your hands .
