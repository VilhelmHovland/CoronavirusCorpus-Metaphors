" The Coronavirus took my father this morning , " Merrill writes .
" I was given 2 minutes to say my goodbyes before I was rushed out .
He seemed peaceful and as I left there was still a glimmer of hope that he would n't be a ticker on the right hand side of the CNN/Fox news screen .
I walked 50 blocks home still with hope in my heart .
The city that I knew was empty .
I felt I was the only person here and perhaps in many ways I was .
By the time I got in the doors to my apartment I received the news that he was gone .
"  Merrill , born Allan Preston Sachs , recorded the first version of " I Love Rock ' N ' Roll " with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stardom in Japan in the late ' 60s with bands like The Lead and Vodka Collins , and through his solo Atlantic Records album Alone In Tokyo .

The singer remembered him on social media Sunday .
" I 've just learned of the awful news that Alan Merrill has passed , " Jett writes .

I can still remember watching the Arrows on TV in London and being blown away by the song that screamed hit to me .
With deep gratitude and sadness wishing him a safe journey to the other side .
