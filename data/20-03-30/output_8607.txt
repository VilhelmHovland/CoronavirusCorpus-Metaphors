What If a COVID-19 Test Is Negative ?  In a physician WhatsApp group , a doctor posted he had fever of 101 ? F and muscle ache , gently confessing that it felt like his typical " man flu " which heals with rest and scotch .
Nevertheless , he worried that he had coronavirus .
When the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) for the virus on his nasal swab came back negative , he jubilantly announced his relief .
Like Twitter , in WhatsApp emotions quickly outstrip facts .
After he received a flurry of cheerful emojis , I ruined the party , advising that despite the negative test he assume he 's infected and quarantine for two weeks , with a bottle of scotch .
It 's conventional wisdom that the secret sauce to fighting the pandemic is testing for the virus .
To gauge the breadth of the response against the pandemic we must know who and how many are infected .
The depth of the response will be different if 25% of the population is infected than 1% .
Testing is the third way , rejecting the false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy is faith-based .
Our reliance on testing has clinical precedence -- scarcely any decision in medicine is made without laboratory tests or imaging .
Testing is as ingrained in medicine as the GPS is in driving .
We use it even when we know our way home .
But tests impose a question -- what 'll you do differently if the test is negative ?  That depends on the test 's performance and the consequences of being wrong .
Though coronavirus damages the lungs with reckless abandon , it 's oddly a shy virus .
In many patients , it takes three to four swabs to get a positive RT-PCR .
The Chinese ophthalmologist , Li Wenliang , who originally sounded the alarm about coronavirus , had several negative tests .
He died from the infection .
In one Chinese study , the sensitivity of RT-PCR -- that 's the proportion of the infected who test positive -- was around 70% .
To put this in perspective , 1000 people infected with coronavirus : 700 will test positive but 300 will test negative .
Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people may believe they 're not contagious because they got a clean chit and could infect others .
False negatives could undo the hard work of containment .
Imagine only 80% of a burning forest is doused because it 's mistakenly believed that 20% of the forest is n't burning because we ca n't see it burning .
It must be extinguished before it relights the whole forest , but to douse it you must know it 's burning -- a Catch-22 .
That " 20% of the forest " is a false negative -- it 's burning but you think it 's not burning .
Because coronavirus is n't planning to leave in a hurry and long-term lockdown has grave economic consequences , testing may enable precision quarantining of people , communities , and cities .
Rather than applying a one-size-fits-all lockdown on the whole nation , testing could tell us who can work and who should stay home .
Why should Austin , if it has a low prevalence of infection , shut shop just because of New York City 's high prevalence ?  Testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the asymptomatic people who drive the epidemic .
To emphasize -- asymptomatics are yet to have symptoms such as cough and fever .
They 're feeling well and do n't know they 've been colonized by the virus .
Theoretically , if we test en masse we can find asymptomatics .
If only those who test positive are quarantined , the rest can have some breathing space .
Will this approach work ?  RT-PCR 's sensitivity , which is low in early illness , is even lower in asymptomatics , likely because of lower viral load , which means even more false negatives .
The virus 's average incubation time of five days is enough time for false negative asymptomatics -- remember they resemble the uninfected -- to visit Disney World and infect another four .
Whether false negatives behave like tinder or a controllable fire will determine the testing strategy 's success .
The net contagiousness of false negatives depends how many there are , which depends on how many are infected .
To know how many are infected we need to test .
Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any person we must test widely -- another Catch-22 .
Maybe we need a bigger test .
Chest CT is an alternative .
It 's rapid -- takes less than an hour whereas RT-PCR can take over a day to report .
In one study CT had a sensitivity of 97% in symptomatic patients and was often positive before RT-PCR .
But there are caveats .
The real sensitivity of CT is likely much lower than 97% because the study has biases which inflate performance .
CT , like RT-PCR , has a low sensitivity in early illness and even lower sensitivity in asymptomatic carriers for the same reason -- lower viral load .
Furthermore , CT has to be disinfected to prevent spread , which limits its access for other patients .
Coronavirus 's signature on CT -- white patches in lungs , known as ground glass opacities -- does n't have the uniqueness of the Mark of Zorro , and looks like lung injury from other rogue actors , which means we can mistake other serious conditions for coronavirus .
Imagine hyenas in wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still use imaging despite its imperfections .
But , let 's ask : what would you do differently if the test is negative and you have mild symptoms of cough and fever ? Should you not self-isolate ? What if you 're falsely negative and still contagious ? If the advice dispensed whether the test is positive or negative is the same -- i .
quarantine for 2 weeks -- what 's the test 's value ?  Perhaps people will more likely comply with voluntary quarantine if they know they 're infected .
Information can nudge behavior .
But the logical corollary is that to comply with social distancing you need to be tested .
People flocking to CT scans to affirm they 're not infected could infect those hitherto uninfected .
A pandemic is no time to test nudge theories .
Does that mean testing has no value ? Testing is valuable in managing populations .
To individuals , the results must be framed wisely , such as by advising those who test positive to quarantine because " you 're infected " and those who test negative to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  Even when policy goals are uniform , messaging can be oppositional .
" Get yourself tested now " contradicts " you must hunker down now .
" When messages contradict , one must choose which message to amplify .
The calculus of testing can change with new tests such as antibodies .
The value of testing depends also on what isolation entails .
A couple of weeks watching Netflix on your couch is n't a big ask .
If quarantine means being detained in an isolation center fenced by barbed wires , the cost of frivolous quarantining is higher and testing becomes more valuable .
I knew the doctor with the negative RT-PCR well .
He 's heroically nonchalant about his wellbeing , an endearing quality that 's a liability in a contagion .
In no time he 'd be back in the hospital ; or helping his elderly parents with grocery .
Not all false negatives are equal .
False negative doctors could infect not just their patients but their colleagues , leaving fewer firefighters to fight fires .
It is better to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man flu .
All he has to do is hunker down , which is what we should all be doing as much as we can .
