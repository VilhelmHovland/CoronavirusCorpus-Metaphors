Respond Instead of React : Managing COVID-19 Anxiety  5 ways to keep anxiety from turning into panic .
As we face the coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic , it 's normal to feel anxious or even panicky .
However , if we allow anxious thoughts and feelings to start dictating our everyday actions , we can put ourselves into a state of ongoing panic* , where we :  Lose the ability to use our rational decision-making skills , because fight-or-flight instincts take over .
Narrow our focus to only the situation causing the panic , causing us to miss bigger picture perspectives that could be useful in managing the problem .
Increase our level of anxiety , because if we react as if our lives are in peril in this moment , we 'll receive an influx of stress chemicals to match that life-threatening situation .
The COVID-19 pandemic is activating the most primal of our survival instincts , which can create anxiety and even panic at times , even for those of us who treat anxiety disorders for a living ! However , borrowing from some cognitive-behavioral therapy tools for anxiety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions into responses , helping us and our loved ones cope well in this time of crisis .
Change your attitude about anxiety and stress  Recognize that you 're anxious because your body is trying to prepare you to deal with this crisis situation , and preparation is a good thing because it can make you more alert and ready to take appropriate action .
If you tell yourself that anxiety is bad , then your brain is going to dump more stress chemicals into your system to help you deal with this " bad " anxiety .
You 'll then end up more anxious , the opposite of what you wanted ! Instead , tell yourself that feeling anxious right now is normal , because it is , and that you can handle these feelings , because you can .
Watch Kelly McGonigal 's brilliant TED Talk " How to make stress your friend " for more about the paradoxical power of embracing stress and anxiety .
Slow down your actions  Rushing around just tells your brain that there 's some reason you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth tiger somewhere and you 're trying desperately to get away from it although you have no idea where it 's hiding ! Try physically slowing down : walk more slowly , type more slowly ( I 'm slowing my fingers down right now ) , talk more slowly , etc .
You 'll be surprised how slowing down your body can help you settle into the present instead of living in the scary world of " what ifs ? " Speaking of which .
Focus on the present  Currently I 'm slowly typing this blog post .
I can feel my fingers on the keys and hear the ambient hum from lights and appliances in the background .
There is nothing wrong in my present moment while I 'm sitting at my desk writing , i .
there 's not a crisis in front of me needing my urgent attention .
Yes , there 's a world crisis happening , but I 'm going to choose the times to work on managing my response to that issue and that 's not in this moment .
Right now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Make no mistake that I sometimes hear the voice of my anxiety screaming in the background while I 'm writing -- it likes to plead with me to drop everything and go to the grocery store because it heard there 's still a shortage of toilet paper .
This is my anxiety talking , not my OCD , but I 'm going to treat these anxious thoughts like I 've learned to treat my obsessive thoughts : I hear them , I put my shoulders back and ignore them , refocusing on the task at hand : writing .
What 's real for me is not the noise in my head , but the task I 've chosen to give my attention to in this moment .
If being in the present moment sounds challenging , meditation is a great way to cultivate this skill .
And there 's no time like the present to start , especially since so many of your regular activities are probably cancelled .

Watch for confirmation bias in news intake  When you 're anxious , you 're more likely to compulsively search the news for information that will help you feel more control .
Of course , that control is an illusion , but that does n't stop us from browsing ! Further , typically what we 're searching for is data that will support our current conclusion about how this pandemic is going to unfold .
If you look for data that this situation is headed in a catastrophic direction , you 'll find it .
If you look for data that we will get all this under control , you 'll find it .
This is confirmation bias in action .
A healthier way to manage news intake is to find a few sources you trust and check their coverage at a frequency that works for you while also trying to take in the whole story , not just details that confirm a particular viewpoint .
For instance , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the evening , my state 's department of public health website each evening , and an international newspaper a few times a week .
I may modify my news plan as the crisis continues ( I recently added the international newspaper to broaden my view ) , but I 'm sticking to my plan .
It allows me to stay up-to-date on the pandemic without focusing too much on any one particular part of the situation , which would only unnecessarily rev up my anxiety .
If you look for data to confirm your anxious thoughts , you 'll find it and make yourself more anxious without a comparable increase in actionable , useful information .
Consider borrowing my Rule #1  I do plan to go to the grocery store after I finish working later today , as there are some additional items I need , including toilet paper .
If the store is out of toilet paper , I might go to another store , or buy some tissues or disposable baby wipes or some other " this will do in a pinch " product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a plan , I 'll follow the plan , and if I run into obstacles along the way , I 'll figure it out .
When we hit an obstacle and react instead of respond , saying to ourselves some variation of , " This is terrible ! I ca n't figure this out , and I ca n't handle it ! " our anxiety can turn into panic and overwhelm our ability to function .
When something does n't go the way you 'd like , such as when you ca n't find toilet paper , and you judge it as " bad , " you put your fight-or-flight instincts in charge , causing all the issues I previously described .
But not being able to get toilet paper is not being able to get toilet paper .
It 's not good or bad , it just is .
Fortunately , we humans are resilient , creative creatures , and our competitive advantage in the world is that we can think and solve problems , including what to do without traditional toilet paper .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it out , remembering that I 'm going to allow bigger plans than my own unfold and that life has turned into more of a classroom than usual lately , and I 'm going to learn what I can .
We 'll do better in crisis situations if we can keep our wits about us .
In this COVID-19 pandemic , I 'm learning that the more I can turn my reactions into responses , the more effectively I 'll be able to cope with these uncertain times .
