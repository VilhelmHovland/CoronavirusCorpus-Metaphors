In French cities , the constant background noise of cars , trucks and passersby was abruptly replaced by silence two weeks ago when the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic .
This unusual silence was initially only interrupted by the distant din of sirens as health professionals raced to tend to the sick , but an altogether new sound has emerged : birdsong .
Could the confinement lead to a resurgence of wildlife activity ?  Blandine Doligez , a researcher from the Laboratory of Biometrics and Evolutionary Biology ( LBBE ) of the University of Lyon 1 , specialises in the study of birds .
She told Euronews this government-imposed lockdown is indeed conducive to animals changing their habits to venture out of " their usual bases " .
" Studies carried out in urban areas on bird populations have already highlighted the role of the level of disturbance , such as the intensity of human passage near nests , on different parameters of the reproduction , " she explained .
She noted for instance that birds in cities have been shown to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from humans is lower than on weekdays .
The presence of humans is not the only source of disturbance for birds , she stressed , " the same is also observed for sources of noises , chemical , light pollution " .
France is not the only European country currently on lockdown with most of the bloc 's 500 million citizens asked to stay at home , resulting in a drop of activity and the grounding of most flights .
This has led to a fall in greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction in atmospherical pollution .
' Landscape of fear '  The confinement has also had an impact on mammals , according to Jean-Michel Gaillard , director of research at the National Centre for Scientific Research ( CNRS ) .
" Quite simply because space usually occupied by humans and their activities has become vacant and it has become space available for animals who will integrate it into their environment , " he told Euronews .
" The presence of human activity is interpreted ( by animals ) as something negative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight distances or will even completely abandon areas they previously used .
" But as soon as there is a change in the so-called " landscape of fear " -- or the threats which can exist in any given place -- animals update their map of threats .
Most mammal species know how to adapt to these changes really well .
This is called plastic behaviour so when animals observe -- and this is very , very , fast -- that nobody is there , they will settle down , " he explained .
Not all animals have the same reflexes however and some remain very fearful for longer , Gaillard continued .
In the UK , where foxes are a regular sight in cities , they 've become even more prominent .
" Deers are the same .
They 're regular garden visitors , it 's not something new .
But since no one is occupying the space at the moment , they come much more frequently and in much greater number , " he pointed out .
However , this is unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return to the status quo .
" As soon as we return to normal , it is certain that we will very , very , very quickly go back to a the situation we knew before , " he said .
Missed opportunity  For researchers , the lockdown and the subsequent impact on wildlife behaviour is a catch-22 situation because as Doligez stressed " it represents an experience on an exceptional scale , unmatched to date , across an entire country or even a continent " that they can not study because they 're stuck at home .
" This would provide a wealth of particularly important and interesting information on the impact of human activity on wild bird populations in urban areas , " she said .
If the confinement lasts until May , researchers also wo n't ' be able to carry out their usual capture and tagging campaigns , Gaillard added .
" This period is certainly interesting in theory , but unfortunately , there will be no one to monitor it , " he lamented .
