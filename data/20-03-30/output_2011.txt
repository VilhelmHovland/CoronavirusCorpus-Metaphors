As citizens wait patiently at home for announcements on the country 's Covid-19 developments , here 's the latest .
According to a report by NST , prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin noted on Monday that there could be a possibility of extending the MCO ( Movement Control Order ) by another two weeks .
Besides that , he said that more economic stimulus would also be announced to cushion the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and weak oil prices .
In a press conference he noted that the National Security Council will meet on the 30th of March to decide on what the next steps will be , after the current halt of movement and business ends .
The government is also expected to unmask said stimulus package on the same day .
However , according to the thoughts of one epidemiologist Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud , with regards to an extension , Covid-19 's grip on M'sia will only be loosened if the MCO is enforced for at least 6 weeks .
" We need six weeks .
The 14-day MCO may be inadequate .
If it is successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still need to extend it as we want the numbers to come down to zero or a number that is small and manageable .
And that is not going to happen in two weeks , " he said in a report by Malay Mail .
He noted that a huge amount of untraced infection has yet to come from the Jamek Seri Petaling mosque gathering , the gathering at Makassar , in Sulawesi , Indonesia , the chariot festival in Teluk Bahang , Penang and the throngs of people that went back to their hometowns before the MCO was initiated .
The MCO was implemented on the 18th of March and runs till the 31st of March 2020 as a means to curb the the spread of Covid-19 throughout the nation .
As of today , the number of cases in M'sia stand at 1,518 with 14 deaths and 159 recovered .
The army was also deployed yesterday ( 22nd March ) , as a means to help PDRM further enforce the MCO on many stubborn Malaysians .
For the time being , there has yet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do at this point is wait , #stayathome and stay tuned to WOB for the latest Covid-19 updates ! .
