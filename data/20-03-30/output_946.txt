( Arkansas Democrat-Gazette/Thomas Metthe ) ( Thomas Metthe )  The third death of an Arkansan from the coronavirus was reported Thursday as the number of people testing positive in the state rose by 41 , to 349 .
Meanwhile , Gov .
Asa Hutchinson outlined a plan to spend $116 million in Medicaid funds to help doctors , hospitals , nursing homes and others respond to the growing number of Arkansans seeking care .
Among other initiatives , the plan includes $55 million that would be used to supplement the salaries of workers who care for the elderly and disabled in long-term-care facilities or provide home-based care .
In addition , more than $31 million would go to small hospitals and clinics to be used for capital improvements , such as establishing drive-thru testing sites .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was two weeks ago , " Hutchinson said .
" Hospitals , clinics , pharmacies , residential facilities have to re-engineer their practice patterns to protect the lives of their patients and their employees in new ways that are consistent with this public health emergency .
"  Arkansas Department of Health Secretary Nate Smith said the state 's most recent death from the virus was of a Central Arkansas resident .
He did not provide further details about the person .
Mark Palenske , pastor of Greers Ferry First Assembly of God , said the man was a retiree and one of dozens of members of the church who have been diagnosed with covid-19 .
Covid-19 is the disease caused by the coronavirus .
Palenske declined to name the man or provide his age , saying the decision to release those details would be up to the man 's family .
In a Facebook post Wednesday , Palenske noted that the number of people connected to the church who have tested positive for covid-19 stood at 37 .
He said there have been no new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas ' covid-19 cases by county  The number of cases increased by four , to 83 in Pulaski County ; by five , to 23 in Benton County ; by one , to 23 in Jefferson County ; by one , to 19 in Garland County ; by two , to 15 in Clark County ; by three , to 13 in Van Buren County ; and by two , to 12 in Washington County .
The cases also increased by at least two in White County , to six ; and by at least one in Lincoln County , to five .
Both counties were listed Wednesday as having one to four cases .
No new cases were reported in Crittenden County , where seven people have tested positive .
All of the other counties where people have tested positive were listed as having fewer than five cases .
NURSING HOMES  Smith said those who recently tested positive included a worker at Briarwood Nursing and Rehabilitation , a Little Rock nursing home where 37 residents and 10 staff members have tested positive since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of White Hall nursing home , which had its first reported case Wednesday , also tested positive , he said .
No new cases were reported at Apple Creek Health and Rehab in Centerton , where one patient has a confirmed diagnosis , or The Villages of General Baptist West in Pine Bluff , where two residents have been diagnosed .
Smith said 41 of the people with the virus in Arkansas are hospitalized , including 13 who were on ventilators .
A day earlier , the department had reported 12 hospitalized patients , including four who were on ventilators .
He said the increase stemmed from a shift to require hospitals to report information on covid-19 patients through an electronic system .
" Initially , because we had very few , we were actually having one of our nurses call the hospitals , call the patients to ascertain their status as they got additional information on how they were doing , " he said .
" That worked when we had smaller numbers .
"  As of Thursday afternoon , 14 of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and older ; and 213 were age 19-64 , Smith said .
The total number of cases reported on a state website was updated Thursday evening .
FORECAST NEEDS  A report , dated Wednesday , by the Arkansas Hospital Association estimated that 12,720 Arkansans will need hospital beds , including 2,760 in intensive care , at the peak of the pandemic in the state .
Even if hospitals decrease their occupancy rates by half to accommodate the expected influx of patients , the number of covid-19 patients needing hospital care will be more than double the number of available beds in most areas of the state , according to the study .
It estimated the number needing intensive care will be three to five times more than the number of such beds that are available .
Arkansas officials earlier estimated that 1,000 patients will need hospitalization at the peak of the pandemic .
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences spokesman Leslie Taylor said the university is reviewing the study .
" I 've spent a lot of time on modeling , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out where we 're going to go in the future , " Hutchinson said Thursday .
" The first thing you realize is there 's a lot of different models that are out there .
" We 're learning day by day more information .
We 're going to continue that effort , and when we have confidence on it we will act on it .
"  He said the 1,000-bed estimate assumes that the state will be effective in slowing the spread of the virus by reducing the opportunities for it to spread from person to person .
For instance , Hutchinson has closed public schools through at least April 17 and last week closed restaurant dining rooms , bars and fitness clubs until further notice .
ORDER ISSUED  Following through on a measure that he announced Wednesday , Hutchinson on Thursday issued an executive order prohibiting indoor social gatherings of more than 10 people .
The restriction includes club meetings , concerts and other activities but does not apply to businesses , places of worship or governing bodies such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are advised to limit person-to-person contact and maintain appropriate social distancing of at least six ( 6 ) feet to prevent the spread of the virus , " Hutchinson said in the order .
( The Legislature began meeting Thursday to act on a bill that would allow the governor to make use of a surplus to partly make up for a budget cut in the current fiscal year , which ends June 30 .
Members have taken steps to put distance between themselves , including representatives sitting far apart from one another in the 5,600-seat Jack Stephens Center at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock .
)  Violation of the governor 's order on meetings is a misdemeanor punishable by up to a month in jail or a fine of up to $500 .
Also on Thursday , the Health Department issued guidance recommending that travelers from a foreign country or from New York , which has the country 's largest outbreak , quarantine themselves for 14 days .
" If we do all the right things and we take the right protective measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're probably looking at 1,000 individuals hospitalized , " Hutchinson said .
" The key thing is that we do the right thing .
"  He added , " as it changes , if we see this increasing at a faster rate , we do n't see the public doing what they need to be doing , we can adjust accordingly .
"  The virus emerged late last year in Wuhan , China , and spreads through respiratory droplets emitted when people sneeze or cough .
Symptoms -- fever , cough and shortness of breath -- have been mild for many people .
Studies have indicated that the virus can live for days on surfaces .
The elderly and people with chronic health conditions are considered most at risk of severe illness , including pneumonia .
PLAN OUTLINED  Hutchinson said the state planned to submit an application Thursday for a waiver from federal Medicaid rules allowing it to implement the emergency coronavirus plan .
The state would make bonus payments of $250 a week to full-time nurses , nurse 's aides and other direct-care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to those who provide in-home services .
The bonuses would be $500 for workers in facilities with a diagnosed covid-19 patient .
According to the waiver application , the payments would last eight weeks , but the state could extend them in 30-day increments after giving notice to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
The state also would make extra payments of $500 a month to foster parents to help them care for the children while schools and many child care centers are closed .
Clinics and hospitals with 65 beds or fewer and clinics would be able to apply for funds for projects such as establishing a drive-thru testing site , reconfiguring patient intake areas , enhancing cleaning and sanitation , and purchasing equipment for telemedicine .
Those providers could also apply for funding for training , to extend hours or make other changes to their practices .
The state would also spend $5 million to help cities move homeless people out of shelters and into buildings such as apartments or hotels where the risk of transmitting the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible covid-19 cases and isolate those who become infected .
The state would also spend $3 million to help pay for equipment and staffing at nursing homes that have clusters of residents with covid-19 .
It would spend more than $1 .
million to cover coronavirus testing for the uninsured .
The state Department of Human Services said it will also apply for a separate waiver allowing it to reduce regulations for providers , including allowing rural hospitals to care for more patients .
Hutchinson said all but $25 million would come from the federal government .
The state 's share would come from its Medicaid trust fund , which comes from a tax on soft drinks and other sources , Human Services Department spokesman Amy Webb said .
Human Services Department Secretary Cindy Gillespie said the proposal focuses on helping smaller providers who need to make changes but do n't have " large capital assets " to draw from .
Independent practice physicians , for instance , " is a group whose world has changed a great deal , " she said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now because we have asked people to stay home unless they really need to go in , " she said .
On another front , UAMS Chancellor Cam Patterson said the state had made " a number of very large purchases " of protective medical gear that is expected to arrive this weekend .
That includes 3 million N95 respirator masks , 4 million surgical masks , 4 million disposable gowns , 2 .
million face shields and 7 million gloves .
That purchase comes on top of an order of 2 million units of protective gear that Hutchinson announced earlier and a shipment of equipment , including 27,800 respirator masks , that the state received this week from the U .
Department of Health and Human Services ' Strategic National Stockpile .
