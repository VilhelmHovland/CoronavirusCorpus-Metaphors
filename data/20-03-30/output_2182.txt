TORONTO , March 26 , 2020 /CNW/ - Ontario Power Generation ( OPG ) , along with its project partners and vendors , have now completed construction on Darlington Nuclear Generating Station 's Unit 2 reactor .
The unit will now begin the restart process before being connected to the electricity grid , subject to regulatory approvals from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and OPG 's ability to do so safely given the current COVID-19 crisis .
This marks a significant milestone on the Darlington Refurbishment Project , one of Canada 's largest clean energy projects that will extend the life of the station for an additional 30 years .
" On behalf of all OPG employees , project partners and vendors , I want to thank our refurbishment team on completing the final steps of construction on Unit 2 under unprecedented and extraordinary circumstances , " said Ken Hartwick , OPG 's President and CEO .
" The project team continued to work safely and diligently while managing changes required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic .

This includes protecting the wellbeing of workers and supporting public safety through physical distancing at work sites and prioritizing work to limit the number of people at OPG stations .
As part of these measures , OPG will continue operating the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station 's Unit 3 reactor , temporarily delaying the planned start of its refurbishment , which was scheduled to begin in May .
In the coming weeks , the Darlington Unit 3 project team will determine the best time to restart the project , ensuring the required critical resources and materials are available .
Critical initiatives , such as completion of Darlington 's Unit 2 refurbishment and preparations for the spring freshet , continue as planned .
In addition to powering the province , OPG also supplies one of the most valuable medical isotopes , Cobalt-60 .
Currently , almost half of the world 's Cobalt-60 is supplied by Ontario 's nuclear reactors to irradiate and sterilize about 40 per cent of the world 's single-use medical devices such as syringes , gloves , implants and surgical instruments .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union leadership for their patience , cooperation and dedication , " added Hartwick .
" Because of your efforts , our generating units are operating normally and frontline health-care workers across Ontario have access to sterilized devices and reliable electricity .
I also want to thank Ontarians for staying home and doing your part .
OPG will do our part , and together , we will power on .
"  OPG is the largest electricity generator in the province , providing almost half of the power Ontarians rely on every day .
It is also one of the most diverse generators in North America , with expertise in nuclear , hydroelectric , biomass , solar and natural gas technologies .
In keeping with advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Ontario Ministry of Health , OPG has taken a number of actions to ensure safe , reliable electricity generation while protecting the health of our employees and the public .
