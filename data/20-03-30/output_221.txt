Kevin Fiala arrived at Xcel Energy Center for morning skate on March 12 as one of the NHL 's hottest players .
He had 14 goals and 26 points over an 18-game stretch as the Wild worked itself into playoff contention .
Still , the 23-year-old winger had an inkling that night 's game against Vegas might not happen .
The NBA had just suspended its season after a player had tested positive for COVID-19 -- an illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was declared a pandemic earlier in the day .
Fiala hoped maybe the NHL could survive one more week .
But after taking one step into the Wild locker room , he was confronted with a much different reality .
That afternoon the NHL paused its season as much of the sports world shuttered amid an outbreak that was spanning the globe .
Players were instructed to self-quarantine and while the logistics were unclear , the hope was the league would restart at some point .
JERRY HOLT * **26;1203;TOOLONG  Kevin Fiala spent down time downtown with his girlfriend , Jessica Ljung .
Now his base is Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that potential remains vague .
Fiala had been hunkering down in Minneapolis with his girlfriend , Jessica Ljung , and their Pomeranian , Foxi , but with the NHL in a holding pattern , they decided to leave Thursday for Sweden , where Fiala spends his summers .
And despite all the uncertainty , the native of Switzerland is focused on getting back to work and resuming a prolific season that was abruptly halted .
" It does n't really matter how , just that we are in and we take it from there , " he said .
" I 'm still positive about that we are going to play this season , and I really , really hope so .
" So , that 's my thought right now .
I will be really sad if it 's done for the season , but I just try to think positively .
"  Heartbreak and disbelief  Fiala felt himself in a state of shock during the first few unmoored days .
He anticipated the break lasting maybe two weeks ; until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return .
But eventually his perspective changed .
" It was kind of a stupid thought by me to think that now when I think back , " Fiala said .
Right now , what 's been going on and everything , it seems like it 's going to be at least two more months .
"  As the sadness set in , he dwelled on the ramifications for the team .
The Wild was rolling , winning eight of 11 games and going 15-7-1 since mid-January to occupy the first wild-card berth in the Western Conference after its last game played .
It was only one point out of the second wild card when the shutdown extinguished the Wild 's momentum .
" We were so hot lately , " he said .
" If this would n't have happened , I think we would have a great chance to make the playoffs and to make an impact this year .
"  Since the Wild has already played 69 games , Fiala does n't think the team would need much time to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen any of his teammates during this layoff as of early last week , but the group stays in touch through text messaging and FaceTime .
Disbelief is still everyone 's reaction .
" It 's always bad timing for such a thing , " Fiala said .
" But the health is always in front , the No .
1 thing .
So , we understand that the league did the right thing .
"  Turning it around  In becoming a catalyst for the Wild 's second-half climb , Fiala also turned into the poster boy for what might have been .
Like the team , Fiala struggled to find his stride at the beginning of the season -- missing time because of injury and getting healthy-scratched twice .
Through his first eight games , he had only one point , and boasted just eight goals through December .
This slow start came on the heels of a 19-game debut with the Wild the previous season in which Fiala registered only three goals and four assists after a trade from the Nashville Predators .
By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last 18 games before the shutdown , he had the third-most points in the NHL .
His four-game winning goals ( including the first regular-season overtime winner of his career in his last appearance March 8 in Anaheim ) were tied for first .
" I was very confident , and the confidence did n't just disappear , " he said .
" It just took off .
But I got ta say that it was very helpful that the team was doing so good .
My teammates were so good , so it was easier on that way .
"  He had finally gotten comfortable after being acquired for Mikael Granlund at last season 's trade deadline , and then signing a two-year , $6 million contract before the season .
And clearly Fiala 's speed , skill and shot are a rare combination in the NHL , let alone on the Wild .
The team sat 13-1 when Fiala recorded multiple points in a game , which he did in a career-high five straight outings for the first time in franchise history .
His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's had in the NHL for a single season ; his 23 goals tied his career best .
" Especially after last year , a lot of up and downs , and to have this season what I had -- especially the last few months -- it 's been very , very enjoyable , " Fiala said .
" For sure never been that happy in my whole career .
Never been that confident about myself , either , so everything is on top -- or was on top -- before this happened .
"  Just the beginning  Before he headed overseas , Fiala spent his downtime on walks and working out by sprinting and jumping .
Aside from keeping tabs on the news , he was watching " Shark Tank " and playing cards and Monopoly .
" Kind of boring , I guess , " Fiala said .
" Like everybody else .
"  Initially , Fiala did n't go back to Europe as soon as NHLers were given the green light to travel because he was n't sure he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHL starts up , he is sure he 'd make it back in time .
Although Fiala 's family is in Switzerland , he left for his offseason base in Sweden to train .
In his mind , he 's still in-season and will follow NHL protocol when he arrives by staying inside even though Fiala said he has n't been sick .
And whenever it 's time to play again , Fiala is confident he will pick back up where he left off .
" I have no doubt about that , " he said .
" I had a great season two years ago , so last year was just a step back in my head .
It was just one bad season , if I can say that .
Now I can just kind of forget about that year .
" I know who I am , and I think this is who I am -- what I was the last few months here .
