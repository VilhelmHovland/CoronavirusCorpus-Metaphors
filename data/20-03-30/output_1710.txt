The West 's Pandemic of Fear  By Dominique Moisi  The COVID-19 pandemic is heightening an already existing culture of fear in the West and revealing deeper fractures , both within Europe and between Europe and the United States .
But future historians may regard the coronavirus crisis as a game-changing episode that arrested the West 's decline .
THE HAGUE , NETHERLANDS -- MARCH 25 : A police officer evacuates a shopper from The Hague market , one of the largest market in Europe , amid the worsening COVID-19 virus pandemic on March 25 , 2020 in The Hague , The Netherlands .
After a visit of the mayor Johan Remkes to the crowded market , security guards and police officers have guided people to the exit .
In latest measures to fight the Covid-19 pandemic , Dutch authorities issued a ban on all organised gatherings of more than three people until June 1 , 2020 .
Municipalities are given the ability to fine people who breach the measures , including citizens who do not respect the rule to keep one and a half metres from others .

But there is a fine line between a healthy return to the notion of a protective state and a dangerous evolution toward Big Brother -- whereby we end up abandoning our cherished freedoms for the sake of protecting our even more precious health .
More generally , fear is the opposite of hope .
In a world of hope , people think that tomorrow will be better than today .
But in a world of fear , they think it will be worse .
From this perspective , Asia today appears to be the continent of hope , while Europe and North America are the continents of fear .
Consider the sharply contrasting images now coming from Italy and China .
In Italy , the COVID-19 pandemic is causing seemingly endless suffering , to the extent that Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In China , on the other hand , the first days of spring have brought people back out onto the streets .
Although still wearing masks , they are enjoying the fresh air and the sun as if they had won the war against the virus .
It is best to be prudent , of course , because COVID-19 may return to Asia , or may not have disappeared entirely from the region .
But Asia today -- and in particular China , Taiwan , South Korea , Hong Kong , Singapore , and Japan -- is a source of hope , and a model of what the West could and should have done much earlier to check the virus 's spread .
China 's leaders have long claimed that their authoritarian , centralized political system is superior to Western liberal democracy .
And now , for the third time in little more than a decade , they are telling the West that our system really does not work .
Following the 2008 global financial crisis , China was swift to denounce the failures of Western-style capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referendum and the subsequent election of President Donald Trump in the United States reinforced China 's conviction that democracy worked equally badly .
Now , with the COVID-19 pandemic , the Chinese government is offering to help a beleaguered Europe , and in so doing boosting China 's soft power .
China is thus not only extending its global influence through trade and investment , but also extending its protection to a divided and confused Europe .
The pandemic is all the more destabilizing for the West because it is piling uncertainty on top of doubt .
COVID-19 is heightening an already existing culture of fear in the West and revealing deeper fractures , both within Europe and between Europe and the US .
While China sends medical experts , protective masks , and respirators to Italy and France , America is abruptly and unilaterally closing itself off to Europe , probably to compensate for Trump 's erratic and confused early denial of the danger .
Meanwhile , Europe has turned its back on Italy for the third time in just over a decade -- first during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , then with the migrant crisis that started in 2014 , and now by limiting exports of urgently needed medical goods .
What is Europe good for if it does not protect its citizens ? Indeed , Italy 's growing disillusion and distance from the European Union is probably much more serious for the future of the European project than the UK 's decision to leave .
As Europe betrays Italy and America betrays Europe , European and transatlantic solidarity increasingly look like relics of a near-forgotten past .
By contrast , Asian societies may be better prepared to fight pandemics , because they have found a better balance between the individual and the collective .
This is not a matter of political regimes .
After all , the Asian countries that so far have best managed the pandemic include democracies such as South Korea , Taiwan , and Japan , a country with democratic institutions and the rule of law ( Singapore ) , and a purely authoritarian state ( China ) .
Rather , the key difference is the spontaneous ( or in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian societies .
Wearing a protective mask is much more common in Asia than in the West , not only because masks are more readily available , but also because their wearers value consideration and respect for the health of others .
Democracy without a civic culture , a common phenomenon in the West , is a recipe for disaster in the event of a pandemic .
Yet , the COVID-19 crisis may eventually have a positive impact on Western democracies by reinforcing trust in experts , and exposing and disqualifying charlatans .
If widespread fear of the virus encourages responsible behavior and discredits populist voices , that would be good news for leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron and bad news for those like Trump .
The coronavirus pandemic continues to exact a terrible toll around the world .
But historians a century from now will likely regard it as a game-changing moment that not only confirmed Asia 's rise , but also , possibly , arrested the West 's decline .
