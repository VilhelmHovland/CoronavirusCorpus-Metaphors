It ' is in poor shape because of years of under-resourcing '  The UN is scrambling to avert a collapse of the Gaza Strip 's beleaguered health system should there be a serious coronavirus outbreak .
The densely populated and impoverished enclave 's healthcare system does " not have the capacity to deal with the large number of cases , " UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Palestinian Territories Jamie McGoldrick told The Jerusalem Post .
A sharp rise in those stricken by the disease " would lead to a breakdown of the health system itself , " he said .
The absence of enough ventilators is particularly worrisome .
There are only 60 ventilators in the Gaza Strip for all medical emergencies for the population of two million , McGoldrick said .
That means some already are in use for reasons not related to the coronavirus .
There is also a lack of testing kits , protective gear and intensive-care equipment for patients on ventilators .
" Everyone around the globe is chasing the same equipment , " he said .
The UN has set aside $34 million for Palestinians in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting now .
It is part of the UN 's $2 billion COVID-19 global humanitarian response plan .
But only some $5m .
has been raised for the Palestinians from donor countries , McGoldrick said .
Out of the $34m .
, some $14m .
will go directly to healthcare in Gaza , and $6m .
will go to healthcare in the West Bank and east Jerusalem .
" If we could get $11 million or $10 million , we could be in good shape , " he said , adding that the UN has turned to Arab countries , including Qatar and the Emirates .
Qatar has already given $2 .
to impoverished Gaza families .
The plan is meant to augment a larger Palestinian Authority program that it controls for the West Bank .
But in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip , the UN has taken a lead role .
THIS SITUATION is different than past healthcare emergencies in Gaza , where the Palestinians were at risk due to unique local situations , McGoldrick said .
" This is unlike another emergency , " he said .
" This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic demand and needs , and so we need a very strong case to be seen as an attractive proposition for donors .
"  " Everyone is desperate , " McGoldrick said .
" The people in Gaza are more desperate because of the situation there .
Gaza is very overcrowded .
The health system is in poor shape because of years of under-resourcing .
"  A coronavirus outbreak in Gaza would put stress on a system that was already overloaded from dealing with the high number of injuries from the weekly " Great March of Return " protests that were mostly halted by the end of 2019 , he said .
Thirteen-years of Israeli border restrictions and closures " has taken its toll on the economy and public services including health , " McGoldrick said .
" There is only so much you can stretch a system before it snaps , " he added .
There were nine coronavirus cases in Gaza and 97 in the West Bank at last count .
But testing has been limited primarily to those with symptoms who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions is that returning Palestinians could bring the virus with them .
In Gaza , it is possible to monitor the entry of Palestinians either from Egypt through the Rafah crossing or from Israel via the Erez crossing .
Those who arrive in Gaza are sent for 14 days to one of 22 local quarantine centers , some of which are set up in hotels or schools , McGoldrick said .
Some 1,800 people are in isolation , and those centers need assistance to provide bedding and food , he said .
Those entering the West Bank are also expected to be quarantined but not necessarily in isolation centers .
The PA has asked some 150,000 Palestinians working in Israel or the settlements to return home , but it is unclear how many people will do so , McGoldrick said .
" What we are trying to do is to raise awareness " of the danger , he said .
The more prepared Gaza is with the right equipment and funds for additional supplies , along with a pipeline by which they can be received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Jerusalem Post Customer Service Center can be contacted with any questions or requests : Telephone : *2421 * Extension 4 Jerusalem Post or 03-7619056 Fax : 03-5613699E-mail : subs@jpost .
