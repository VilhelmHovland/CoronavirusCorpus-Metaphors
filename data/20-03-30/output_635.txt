The coronavirus crisis has been a huge boon to Israel 's Netanyahu  The coronavirus crisis is an epic challenge for leaders globally as they scramble to manage the spread of disease and the cessation of economies .
But in Israel , for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at least , the arrival of this invisible enemy could n't be better timed .
On March 2 , Israel held elections for the third time in a year .
Although Netanyahu claimed victory , the right wing leader of the Likud party in fact fell short of having the votes he needed to lead a coalition in the parliament , which is the same problem that prompted the previous two elections in quick succession .
Israel 's president Reuven Rivlin pressed Netanyahu and his center-left rival Benny Gantz of the Blue-White party to work together to form a government .
All that happened about 10 days before Netanyahu was set to be tried on corruption charges .
But as luck would have it , on March 15 , right before the trial was to begin , the Israeli justice ministry declared that courts would be closed for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice ministry insisted the decision was apolitical and the prime minister 's trial was reset for May 24 .
Now , Netanyahu and Gantz are working together to the great chagrin of many centrists and left-leaning Israelis .
Previously , Gantz said he would n't form a unity government with a politician accused of corruption .
Netanyahu has been indicted on charges of bribery , fraud , and breach of trust -- charges he denies .
However , Gantz has since changed his mind , it seems .
Last week , he accepted the role of parliamentary speaker , explaining , " These are not not normal days and they call for special decisions .
Therefore , as I 've said , I intend to examine and advance , in any possible way , the creation of a national emergency government .
"  Gantz 's response to an evolving emergency situation seems reasonable enough , at first glance , given the country is in lockdown and dealing with a public health crisis .
The agreement between the Likud and Blue-White leaders appears to be that Netanyahu will serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 2021 , after which Gantz will take over his role while Netanyahu likely takes a ministerial post .
Sounds fine , right ?  Not quite .
In 1993 , the Israeli high court ruled that a criminal defendant can not serve as a minister in the Israeli parliament .
The prime minister must fire any minister who is accused of a crime .
However , the ruling did n't address the role of prime minister as defendant , which is why Netanyahu has been able to lead the nation despite being indicted .
Now , Netanyahu has enlisted his political rival , Gantz , to assist him in passing legislation enabling him to serve as a minister once he steps down from the top job .
Netanyahu 's political opponents have filed challenges to the prime minister 's ability to form a government based on that same ruling barring defendants from serving as minister and they are not eager to see Gantz , who had been an anti-corruption crusader , now aiding the accused Netanyahu in creating legislation tailored to his specific circumstances .
Netanyahu 's trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means he theoretically would not have been able to hold a ministerial post .
Yet , with Gantz 's help , he may well serve Israel while standing trial for allegedly swindling it ( Gantz 's team has refused to disclose details of their negotiations with Netanyahu ) .
While the situation in Israel is unique to some extent -- specifically the slew of elections in quick succession and the prime minister facing a criminal trial -- it 's fair to assume the political upheaval caused by the pandemic will extend far beyond its disputed borders .
Already , some US states have had to delay Democratic primaries in the presidential race , calling into question the fairness of potential results of a November election premised on abruptly halted campaigns .
There are even concerns that US president Donald Trump might try to use the coronavirus crisis as an excuse to delay the elations , although he does n't have the legal power to do such a thing even in a state of emergency .
Poland 's deputy science minister Wojciech Maksymowicz has just called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that proceeding apace during the pandemic is n't realistic .
Mksymowicz explained , " It 's nature that rules here .
"  That much is certainly true .
The world has been thrown into a state of chaos and the coronavirus will make it extremely difficult for activists , politicians , or voters to insist on politics as usual .
