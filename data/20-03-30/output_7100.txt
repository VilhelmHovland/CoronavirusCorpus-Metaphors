Edwards issued the following statement about President Trump 's commitment of 150 ventilators to Louisiana as it fights COVID-19 and works to surge its medical capacity so it can care for residents who are sick .
Louisiana estimates the New Orleans area will run out of ventilator capacity on April 5 , though this number changes as the state receives ventilators .
Prior to this announcement , Louisiana had received 292 ventilators from vendors , including 100 ventilators on Monday .
Edwards said :  " This morning , President Trump committed to me that he would make sure that Louisiana received ventilators .
He has just announced that we will get 150 ventilators , which will be the first we have received from the federal government 's Strategic National Stockpile , though I surely hope they will not be the last .
We do n't yet know when they will arrive in state or exactly what type of ventilators they are .
But I very much appreciate this support .
While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get in Louisiana helps us extend the timeframe that we can provide care to Louisianans who are ill , which is critical as we deal with the growing threat of COVID-19 in our state .
In total , Louisiana has ordered 14,000 ventilators , including 5,000 from the federal government 's strategic national stockpile .
Louisiana has the third highest number of cases per capita , and I will continue to fight to make sure our state 's needs are not lost in the national conversation .
