Federal government giving broadcasters $30 million relief from CRTC fees  OTTAWA -- The federal government says it will help broadcasters deal with the fallout from COVID-19 by waiving $30 million usually paid by the industry to support the operations of Canada 's telecommunications regulator .
As a result , the government will provide funding to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission so it wo n't request payment for Part I licence fees for the 2020-21 fiscal year .
The move helps more than 100 broadcasters that are facing significant declines in advertising revenue .
The department is examining other measures that can be implemented quickly to support the beneficiaries of all of its programs .
Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault says the task of broadcasters to inform Canadians about the novel coronavirus is made more difficult because of the significant drops in ad revenue .
Waiving the charges is a decision that could be made quickly while it works on more measures to support the industry .
" We will continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on all sectors , ensuring we remain well-positioned to respond to this rapidly changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
