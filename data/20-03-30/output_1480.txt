The medical , economic and social sectors were thoughtfully considered , and helpful and innovative plans were outlined to deal with each of them .
One area which has n't been addressed is the emotional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Singaporeans .
More citizens are worried about their jobs and their future .
There are a number of factors likely to affect the emotional state of individuals to varying degrees .
These include the quarantine and stay-home notice measures ' impact on the persons affected and the impact on families ; working from home , and how this affects family relationships ; imposed isolation 's impact on singles or single parents who no longer have the companionship of colleagues ; and restrictions on entertainment and ways to chill out .
There are no easy solutions , but perhaps a national hotline can be established , along the lines of SOS ( Samaritans of Singapore ) .
Volunteers , who could perhaps be paid honorariums , will , I believe , step forward .
I 'm sure many professional counsellors will step up .
Others may just have a strong interest to help .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equip themselves to respond to queries relating to Covid-19 .
This hotline can be called " I 'm Not Alone " .
Perhaps this important area can come under the Ministry of Social and Family Development or any other appropriate ministry , or even the Prime Minister 's Office .
