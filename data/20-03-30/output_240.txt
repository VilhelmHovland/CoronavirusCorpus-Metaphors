Coronavirus : No international acts coming to NZ for a year  New Zealand was the first country to be closed off to international touring acts due to coronavirus and will likely be the last to open up , says the president of the New Zealand Promoters ' Association Brent Eccles .
Even if artists were able to leave North America or Europe to tour , New Zealand would be unlikely to let them in , Eccles said .
" Or if we let them come in they 'd have to isolate for a couple of weeks , that 's not going to work .
"  " All of us are going , holy f .
, what 's going on here ? "  " We were the first to get closed down because we do n't have an audience and we 're probably going to be the last to open up so what does that look like ? And how are we going to survive ? "  Eccles was hopeful that acts like Lenny Kravitz , who had postponed , would eventually play New Zealand .
The Government banned gatherings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day it shut New Zealand 's borders to all but citizens and residents .
This put a stop to most performances by local artists nearly a week before the country went into level 4 lockdown .
Eccles said while promoters could start to set up shows by locals about a month after New Zealand came out of lockdown , international acts posed " a real worry " .
A significant factor would be whether Australia was open , since New Zealand was part of the Australasian touring market .
JARED NICOLL  Promoter Brent Eccles said the music industry would suffer .
There was bad news on that front from Michael Chugg , head of one of the region 's biggest promotion companies , Chugg Entertainment .
" I might be being pessimistic , but the way America and the UK are going .
if we clean up the virus here why would you then start letting people in to start it all over again ? " he said .
" We might not see any international acts in ( Australia ) for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomsday saying a year away ? It possibly is , but it 's not impossible .
"  In the meantime , there could be devastating effects for the industry , and some venues and promoters would n't survive .
A promoter would put about $150,000 into marketing an act at a major venue like Spark Arena , where Morissette and Kravitz were scheduled to play , Eccles said , " but that 's before your accommodation , before your travel , all that kind of stuff " .
Promoters would have lost " an eye-watering amount " on the cancelled and postponed shows .
Venues would suffer , too .
" Everybody I know pretty much has applied for that wage subsidy so that 's helping , but as far as venues are concerned they still have rent to pay , there 's still a bottom line they have to cover and one fears the smaller ones will have to close their doors .
"  That would be a " tragedy " for the local music industry , Eccles said , as the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get their music out there .
" That 's where your industry comes from , it comes from that grass roots .
It comes from those small venues , it comes from those small bands and artists .
"  Australian promoter Michael Chugg thought it could be a year before international acts returned to the region .
Local musicians were already feeling the pinch , with the New Zealand Music Commission saying that as of last week losses stood at nearly $8 million .
Even when venues reopened and tours restarted it would be difficult to quickly stage gigs on the same scale , Eccles added , as he was aware of many production companies - the ones that hire out equipment - that had let all of their staff go due to high overheads and a total lack of revenue in a part of the industry that usually turned over millions of dollars a week .
" When it does come back online , where 's the gear going to come from ? "  Eccles said he believed acts were genuine when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when we started postponing these shows the picture was n't really that clear and it 's still unfolding .
So we hope that the shows that have been postponed have been postponed far enough away to happen .
