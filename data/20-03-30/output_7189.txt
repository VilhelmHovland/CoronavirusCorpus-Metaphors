Tips From A Clinical Psychologist On Handling Stress During The Pandemic  10:32PM / Monday , March 30 , 2020  Working from home has never been more stressful , knowing the shelter-in-place order can go on indefinitely .
Communicating via Slack and Zoom meetings is the new normal , and this shift might be a source of anxiety for many .
For tips on overcoming the added stress resulting from the pandemic , I turned to Gary Foster , a clinical psychologist and the chief scientific officer at WW .
He explained that when people experience stress , they turn to skip their routine activities , which does n't facilitate healthy coping .
Research has shown that activity -- even moving for a few minutes a day -- can have significant health and wellness benefits .
In fact , regular physical activity , even moderate-intensity , can help improve immune function and is linked to a lower risk of upper respiratory infections .
So if you feel more stressed these days , the first thing to do is sticking to a physical routine .
Here are three ways you can maintain a regular level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schedule .
We 're currently experiencing a disruption in routine .
Set a schedule for yourself and keep to it .
Just like you would create an eating schedule , you should have a schedule to help you maintain your activity routine .
Avoid a threshold mentality .
At first , work on maintaining a baseline level of physical exercise .
The goal should n't be to do 30 pushups a day , but to do at least a couple pushups a day .
Remember that any and all movement is good and carries many health benefits .
