Recommend0  Concerned  Mar 19 , 2020 01:10pm  CAD is not the only parameter to judge the economy .
The reality is that our economy is on the verge if collapse and government has no clue how to control the situation .
The worst part is that someone is misguiding these naive politicians and power brokers that all is well and they are painting a fake picture of economy .

The fact is that reduction in CAD was most necessary with whatever means .
This reduction will itself help in increased industrial growth and production and finally exports .
Recommend0  imad  Mar 19 , 2020 07:21pm  correct me if i am wrong .
but is n't a decline from 9 billion to 2 .
billion more than a 300% decline and not 71% ?  Recommend0  asm123  Mar 19 , 2020 09:18pm  Real reason is because there is no growth in the country .
Nobody is importing materials to build or develop new products .
Exports are still lagging behind .

my view is corona will be controlled in all developed countries and country where literacy rate is high .
pakistan is the country where polio still active .
removal of corona from pakistan will take at least year now .
which will reduce exports to zero .
Recommend0  Imtiaz Ali Khan  Mar 20 , 2020 07:25am  Great Job ! Balance import and export and than raise exports ! Pakistan do n't need so many imports we have the young population and expertise both inside Pakistan and Pakistan diaspora abroad .
Lets get good trade surplus like in the 1960 's like Germany , Netherland , KSA , Norway etc .
,  Recommend0  Imtiaz Ali Khan  Mar 20 , 2020 07:25am  I was shocked to see India has the second largest trade deficit in the world .
WOW !  Recommend0  sixes  Mar 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting effort to revive the economy is truly exemplary and very much appreciated .
During the corrupt regime of Nawaz Sharif and party , debt was increasing and current account deficit was rocketing .
Kudos to the people under the leadership of PM Imran Khan for achieving these results and wish that we will be able to meet milestones in all other areas too .
It is high time to get rid of COVID -19 epidemic outbreak .
and wish that the government will take all punitive measures to control the disease .
