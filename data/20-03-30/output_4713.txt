As the rate of coronavirus infections rise in the US , some doctors are encouraging the 45 million Americans who wear contact lenses to put on their glasses instead .
In a statement put out by the American Academy of Ophthalmology , a medical association of 32,000 ophthalmologists , the group suggested contact lens wearers switch to glasses for a while , as the coronavirus can be contracted through the eyes , if you unwittingly have virus particles on your fingers .
These particles are more often inhaled through the mouth and nose , but they can also enter through the eyes , though the CDC says " this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads .
" Eyes , noses , and mouths all have mucosal membranes in places like the nose and throat , which provide a route for viruses to enter the body .
Once in the body , the virus begins replicating , until it ultimately floods the body with viral particles .
" Consider wearing glasses more often , especially if you tend to touch your eyes a lot when your contacts are in , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses for lenses can decrease irritation and force you to pause before touching your eye .
"  She added that glasses could provide an extra layer of protection against the virus .
An April 2019 study published in Contact Lens and Anterior Eye noted that proper hand washing hygiene was especially crucial for people who wore contact lenses .
According to the CDC , " wearing contact lenses can increase your chance of getting an eye infection -- especially if you do not care for them the right way .
"  The CDC recommends always washing your hands with soap and water before handling the lenses , keeping the lenses away from all water , which can let in germs , and properly cleaning the lenses .
And do n't neglect the contact lens case , which also requires cleaning .
Some experts believe the risk of getting COVID-19 by touching the eyes is low  " Can you end up with COVID-19 from the virus entering through the eye ? Theoretically , it 's possible , but we have no proof of that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ophthalmology , told CNN .
Three of the world 's most published researchers on eye health wrote in an advisory from the Centre for Ocular Research &amp; Education that contact lens wearing is safe , and encouraged people to disinfect their contact lenses .
" Despite myths and misinformation that have arisen over the past 48 hours , contact lens wear remains a safe and highly effective form of vision correction for millions of people worldwide , " they wrote .
But whether the organisation was for or against contact lens wear , they all agreed on some key guidelines people should take , like disinfecting glasses and contact lenses and avoiding eye rubbing .
On the heels of reports that 1% to 3% of people who had coronavirus also had conjunctivitis , or pink eye , many national eye doctor associations issued guidance telling eye doctors to reschedule all non-essential eye appointments , as it is impossible to socially distance while examining someone 's eyes .
" Already , a handful of our ophthalmologist colleagues have died from COVID-19 , " the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as physicians must respond to it and support our colleagues and our communities .
