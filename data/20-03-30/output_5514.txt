Need : Massive mobilisation of finances  Mamata Banerjee has rightly urged the Union government to raise the limit to borrowing set by the FRBM Act from the current 3 per cent to 5 per cent ( File photo )  In India , the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic will require , among many other things , a massive mobilization of financial resources .
The Union government can stretch its fiscal deficit to borrow more from the market , or from the Reserve Bank of India .
The latter essentially involves the printing of new money .
States , however , have much less room when it comes to mobilizing additional resources .
They are allowed to borrow 3 per cent of their state domestic product as per the limit set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act , 2003 .
The other major source of revenue for a state is its share of the goods and services tax .
The states require additional finances for two urgent reasons .
The first is to acquire more medical equipment for prevention , tests and treatment of potential and actual Covid-19 patients .
The second is for extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage earners or small traders who are left without any incomes .
They will need cash and food immediately .
The West Bengal chief minister , Mamata Banerjee , has rightly urged the Union government to raise the limit to borrowing set by the FRBM Act from the current 3 per cent to 5 per cent .
Based on the SDP of West Bengal in 2018-19 , the state was able to borrow Rs 44,100 crore in 2019-20 .
That fund has been exhausted .
This year , the GST collections have plummeted .
Hence resources that can be expected from tax revenue are going to shrink significantly .
The state government had set up a fund of Rs 200 crore to tackle the disease immediately .
But this corpus , too , has been exhausted .
Bengal was one of the earlier states that announced a specific and well-targeted package of cash transfers , subsidized food and special medical insurance .
The state government will need resources to deliver these vital supplies .
Health is usually the responsibility of the state , but with the Disaster Management Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots and take a lead in the battle against the disease .
However , the Centre has taken too long -- the finance minister unveiled a welfare package only yesterday -- to announce any form of relief for the economically needy .
It has not even announced the logistics of ensuring continuous supply of essentials during the unprecedented three-week lockdown .
The least Narendra Modi and his government can do is to allow states greater access to financial resources in their battle against the deadly virus .
The size of the fiscal deficit ought to be the last thing on Mr Modi 's mind at the moment .
