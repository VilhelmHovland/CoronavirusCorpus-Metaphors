CNBC 's Jim Cramer warned investors against believing that the bull market was back after Tuesday 's massive rally , saying that automated trading and short-covering were major reasons for the move .
" Just be cautious .
This was a one-day bull market .
You had stocks that moved so much they basically moved as if the second half of the year is going to be good .
I struggle to find out why the second half of the year should be good , " Cramer said .
Stocks roared back on Tuesday , with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining more than 2,000 points , or 11 .
, for its biggest percentage gain since 1933 .

And that was the real problem .
The market went up and there was demand for stocks , but there was n't demand for goods , " Cramer said .
" And I think that until we see demand for goods or see we actually some secular growth stories .
you realize that this was a gigantic short squeeze .
That does n't mean we ca n't continue , but there was a short squeeze today .
"  The coronavirus pandemic has fueled the fastest 30% decline on record in the U .
