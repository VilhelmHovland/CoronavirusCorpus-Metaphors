New Delhi : The Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) has recommended that healthcare workers and caregivers of confirmed COVID-19 patients , be prescribed hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) as a preventive against the disease , even as experts told IndiaSpend that the efficacy of this drug for preventing COVID-19 infections is unproven .
At the same time , hospitals are falling short of protective gear , such as masks and bodysuits which are known to be effective in keeping healthcare workers safe , according to experts .
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 28,000 lives globally and affected more than 620,000 , according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center ( 8 .
on March 28 ) .
In India , the disease has claimed 19 lives and infected at least 918 ( as of 5 .
, March 28 , 2020 ) , according to Coronavirus Monitor , a HealthCheck database .
At a press conference on March 27 , 2020 , almost two months since the first Indian COVID-19 case was reported in Kerala , the Indian government said that it has been difficult to make enough PPEs available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported , there were " some issues , some bottlenecks in terms of its availability " , said Lav Aggarwal , a senior bureaucrat in the union health ministry , at this press conference .
" There were issues with N95 masks too , because of the imported components .
Government is aware of the issue .
"  The government 's decision to distribute HCQ is a " politically expedient " one , lacking in evidence , said Yogesh Jain of the Jan Swasthya Sahyog , a non-profit hospital in Chhattisgarh .
Since the government has failed to prepare itself with adequate PPE , they are distributing a drug such as HCQ to appear as if they are protecting health workers , he said .
" Health workers are very scared right now , " said a member of the government-appointed task force for tackling COVID-19 , on the condition of anonymity .
" They needed to see the government is doing something for them .
They needed reassurance .
We understand the limitations of the French study .
Yes the evidence in favour of HCQ as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to do something to boost the morale of the health workers .
"  HCQ can not be a replacement for PPE  Although the ICMR 's recommendation cautioned that consuming HCQ should not give a sense of " false security " to health workers that they will be safe from infection , experts said that this is exactly the effect it will have .
" From this HCQ recommendation , it is clear the government is concerned about losing the medical task force , " said Satyanarayana Mysore , the head of the pulmonology and sleep medicine department at Manipal Hospital .
" But just because health workers take HCQ , it does not mean we can dispense with other precautions .
HCQ is not a substitute for the prevention offered by protective gear .
"  Lack of evidence  The ICMR 's advisory on HCQ does not present any evidence on the drug 's efficacy , especially as a preventive .
" Hydroxychloroquine is found to be effective against coronavirus , " based on lab studies , in-vivo studies and pre-clinical data , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it does not mention which are the academic studies that led them to this conclusion .
No minutes of the meetings when this decision was taken are available .
" I am curious as to what data ICMR is basing their recommendations on , " said Krutika Kuppalli , an infectious diseases physician and biosecurity fellow at the US-based Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security .
" As far as I am aware there are ongoing clinical trials but nothing that is conclusive at this point .
"  The ICMR should immediately publish the minutes of their deliberations so that we can see " how they arrived at their dosages , what were the other drugs individually , or in combination , which they may have considered " , said Soumyadeep Bhaumik , a Delhi-based physician and researcher with the The George Institute for Global Health .
" Please do not take this drug as a preventive measure , " said Delhi-based Shahid Jameel , a virologist and the chief executive officer of the India Alliance , a charity that funds biomedical research .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure-shot drug in this case .
"  India 's recommendation came just two days after US President Donald Trump endorsed the drug at a press briefing : " It may work .
It may not work .
I feel good about it .
That 's all it is .
Just a feeling , " he said .
" The evidence that HCQ can be used as a preventive drug against COVID-19 is only anecdotal , " said Anthony Fauci , one of the world 's leading immunologists , who is on the White House 's coronavirus task force , and was on the stage with Trump at that briefing .
HCQ is an old drug that has been used to treat malaria , rheumatic issues such as arthritis and diseases such as lupus for decades .
" What we do n't know is if you put it in the context of another disease , whether it is safe , " said Fauci at the press briefing .
Research on HCQ as a cure is scanty , inconclusive  Most of the evidence on HCQ as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The study has been criticised for its methodology and ethics , experts said .
There are several concerns about the study , said Kuppalli of the John Hopkins Center .
It had a very small sample size--20 patients--and did not clarify what existing diseases ( or ' comorbidities ' ) the patients had , which could have influenced outcomes , she explained .
There have been no follow-ups with the patients , so for example , we do not know if the disease recurred , she added .
" Given the limited data that has come out , it would be important to further evaluate the medication in a randomised clinical trial before making recommendations about use , " Kuppali suggested .
" We want to make sure that it is safe , there are no adverse effects and that it does in fact help with preventing and/or curing the virus .
"  Possibility of drug side-effects , resistance  As Fauci said , HCQ is a well known and widely used drug , for diseases other than COVID-19 .
However , it should be taken with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cardiac arrhythmia and retinal damage .
Although in India this drug is supposed to be sold only with a medical prescription , Jain says that in Chhattisgarh for example , his hospital has been finding it hard to get because people have started buying it out of panic .
He says this is because there is an " unscientific temper " in India and several drugs which require prescriptions are often sold over the counter anyway .
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are also anti-malarial drugs , and an overuse could lead to resistance , according to this World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
The government recommendation says that the drug should be only used by those it is prescribed to--asymptomatic health workers and those who have been in touch with a confirmed COVID-19 case .
They have also issued a notification saying that this drug is listed as a Schedule H1 drug , which means chemists need to keep records of who is buying it , for at least three years .
The trial comes at an urgent time : The lack of evidence notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of HCQ for COVID-19 treatment .
Jordan has , on March 23 , 2020 , allowed the use of this drug as well .
" The WHO 's SOLIDARITY trial is a very pragmatically designed one .
It is not difficult to be a part of it , " said Gagandeep Kang , executive director at Faridabad-based Translational Health Science and Technology Institute .
" If the Indian government really believes HCQ will work , then it should use it on infected patients as part of the trial .
I 'm a researcher and I believe in evidence .
Policy recommendations like this should n't be made without evidence .
"  As of this week , the Indian government has indicated that it might get involved in the WHO trial .
" We are also likely to start our participation soon in the SOLIDARITY trial by WHO , " said ICMR 's Raman Gangakhedkar at a press briefing on March 27 , 2020 .
" Earlier we did not do it because our numbers were small .
Our contribution would have looked miniscule .
