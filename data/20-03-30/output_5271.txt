Angie pleads with her to be quiet and calm .
The rest of the housemates are in the garden , wondering what on earth could be going on .
But Tiffany ca n't calm down .
Because , of course , Tiffany presumes " David " to be David Gest , the American producer , former spouse of Liza Minelli and fellow Big Brother contestant .
Tiffany 's reaction escalates , much to the confusion of Angie who ca n't understand why her news has provoked such a reaction .
Tiffany goes into the garden and tells the other housemates .
" David is dead .
"  They rush to the bedroom to find David Gest snuggled under the covers -- very much alive .
Tiffany 's anger and disbelief continues out in the garden , utterly incredulous as to why Angie would tell her that David had died .
Angie is inside .
Puzzled , she asks why Tiffany is so angry .
" What did I do ? "  To which former soap-star Daniella Westbrook replies : " You told her David was dead with cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No he 's in there asleep .
"  " No ! Not David .
My ex-husband .
"  This is then communicated to Tiffany , but she firmly believes that Angie had specifically mentioned " David Gest " when she broke the news ( she had n't ) .
The whole incident only lasts around five minutes , and is not only a breathtaking masterclass of reality TV editing , but an incredibly prescient example of how narcissism coupled with a lack of clarity inevitably leads to confusion and bedlam .
In our current state of isolation , we are seeing entire agency and client workforces relying on technology to get us through everything , from day-to-day meetings , presentations , pitches and catch-ups .
It 's been truly amazing to see everyone pulling together , but the recent struggles around COVID-19 messaging are a huge lesson for our industry .
" Practice social distancing " -- vague , conceptual , a brand new term .
" Stay home .
Shop once a week " -- clear , concise , a simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jargon has got to go .
The needless fluffery has got to go .
It 's time for reductive thinking across the board .
Patchy Zoom calls , decks prepared remotely via multiple authors , Slacks and emails galore .
There has never been a more important time for clear , concise messaging .
With the global and local situations in a constant state of flux , getting to the point has never been more valuable for all concerned .
Here here ! There are two problems I see : speaking in conceptual terms rather than plain language ( ala ' practice social distancing ' above ) because those making the announcements seem to think that the importance of the situation requires it ; and the use of industry specific jargon that 's not familiar to the public -- just this morning I heard a medical industry spokesperson talking about the potential shortage of ' PPE ' ( industry jargon for masks and other protection equipment , I think ) , and how the latest announcements will be managed through the ' PHN ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcements the benefit of the doubt , in both cases , it seems they are communicating the way they normally do , normally get away with , it 's habit .
They think they 're being clear because it 's clear to them .
I suppose it 's up to the comms experts they hire to help them change that .
