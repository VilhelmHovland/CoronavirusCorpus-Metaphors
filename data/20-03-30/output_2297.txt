The International Olympic Committee did the inevitable on Tuesday , postponing the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that were supposed to begin in late July until sometime beyond this year " but not later than summer 2021 .
"  Team Canada can take a measure of credit for providing the first boot in the pants of the IOC that brought about the delay , with their announcement on Sunday that they were out of a 2020 Olympics .
The change that they wrought has given a measure of certainty to athletes , sent an important message about putting public health ahead of personal and financial interests , and has likely saved some lives .
" It was n't safe , " to continue , said COC president Tricia Smith , simply , on Tuesday .
All of that deserves praise .
This was the right move , even if it took the IOC an appallingly long time to come to it .
The swells at the Swiss offices seemed like literally the last people on the planet to accept that barging ahead with preparations for a global sports gathering was a bad idea amid a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it was the right call , there 's no telling what it will mean for these Olympics and beyond .
It has been known for years that the Olympics became far too big for their own good .
Will the coronavirus , and this delay , begin to knock them back to a more reasonable size ?  At this point it is hoped that the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics will be a close facsimile of whatever they were going to be before COVID-10 knocked the world for a loop .
The IOC 's statement on Tuesday said it hoped the " Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present .
"  The flame , already in Japan for a torch relay that began awkwardly this month , will remain in that country .
The Games themselves will still be called Tokyo 2020 , even if they take place next year .
That has the benefit of nice symbolism , a reminder of what the world ( hopefully ) overcomes to get to the point of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste a whole bunch of t-shirts , plush toys and signage .

Hong/AP  The facilities are , obviously , all in place and will be a year from now .
This will not be without its challenges .
Ten of the 43 venues were intended to be temporary ; they will have to be maintained , while mostly unused , for an extra 12 months .
The athletes ' village , a cluster of new residential apartments that were to be converted into condominiums and sold after the Olympics , will now also be in limbo .
Other facilities like the press centre and certain venues that had non-sports functions -- some events were to be held in a converted convention centre -- will have to push back the bookings they were already taking for the months after the Games .
While these things are all manageable , especially in light of the sacrifices made in all sectors because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sums of money already spent on the Tokyo Olympics .
It was originally pitched as a US$7-billion event , and officially that number has already passed US$12-billion .
Audits , though , have suggested the true cost is beyond US$26-billion , and that the official tally is artificially low because it excludes big-ticket infrastructure costs .
This helps explain why the decision to postpone took so long : Japan is desperate to recoup some of that investment through the economic boom of the Games themselves .

On Monday the IOC announced that the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics Games would be postponed due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic .
Taguchi/USA TODAY  The question is whether future Olympic hosts will ever want to expose themselves to this kind of risk .
The next two summer cities , Paris and Los Angeles , are theoretically working with budgets closer to Tokyo 's original plan , and the IOC itself has pivoted to promoting the concept of " sustainable " Olympics that re-use existing facilities where possible .
But whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow past their cost estimates for every Olympics , something that is bound to happen as the IOC adds events to an ever-expanding footprint .
Keeping one infrastructure project on budget is tricky , doing it with 43 of them is a nightmare .
For Tokyo , the more pressing concern will be whether the anticipated economic spinoffs even come to pass .
The number of visitors in 2021 -- athletes , staff , tourists -- will almost have to be smaller than it would have been in 2020 , as everyone adjusts to new economic realities .
Broadcasters and sponsors , the IOC 's lifeblood , will be looking at their Olympic investments and wondering what to do about an exposure that has been put off into next year .

NNoriko Hayashi/Bloomberg  Consider Team Canada , which was out in front of all this , but has its own future to consider .
Will its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping-mall conglomerate , be willing to re-up the same level of support ? Will the government ?  COC chief executive David Shoemaker said on Tuesday that they received an " outpouring of support " from their marketing partners after their Sunday-night announcement , but these decisions will be played out country by country , each dealing with their own coronavirus fallout .
How many of them will send smaller Olympic delegations as priorities are reconsidered ? How many will have to approach their Tokyo plans with an eye to Beijing 2022 , now potentially happening just six months later ?  A global celebration in Tokyo in 2021 is a worthwhile goal .
And a big , flashy Olympics , same as it ever was , is a nice part of that idea .
Whether it is realistic is another matter .
