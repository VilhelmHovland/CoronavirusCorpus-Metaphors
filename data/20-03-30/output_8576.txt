The March 13 post featured a picture taken from behind the pitching rubber looking out over an empty Rhoads Stadium and came with the caption : " I 'm just going to sit here for awhile .
"  This weekend , Cornell joined many of her fellow Division I baseball and softball compatriots in posting short videos imploring the NCAA Division I Council to " vote yes " on the proposed legislation to grant eligibility relief to all spring sports student-athletes who saw their 2020 season cut short in mid-March due to the worldwide coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
" We all deserve a chance to play , we are united , " Cornell said in a short 15-second video posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be an organized effort .
Days earlier , Alabama senior slugger Bailey Hemphill sent her own message to the NCAA committee , imploring it to " vote yes " on the proposal to give " ALL student-athletes this year of eligibility back " and signed it : " Sincerely , a senior that would like to leave the game on her own terms .

" The Council 's decision gives individual schools the flexibility to make decisions at a campus level , " Penn athletic director and council chair M .
Grace Calhoun said in a statement released Monday night .
" The Board of Governors encouraged conferences and schools to take action in the best interest of student-athletes and their communities , and now schools have the opportunity to do that .
"  Winter sports like basketball , which had its season end in the middle of most conference tournaments , were excluded from the move as council members declined to extend eligibility for student-athletes in sports where most of their regular seasons were already completed .
The Division I Council is a 41-member panel made up of athletic directors , athletic administrators , senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is responsible for day-to-day decision-making across all Division I level .
In a joint statement released earlier Monday , Power 5 representatives of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee ( SAAC ) outlined three recommendations it 'd like to see addressed , including " immediate support for housing and food , " that all Division I athletes that did n't get to complete their seasons be granted " the opportunity to pursue an extra year of eligibility , " and all returning seniors should have their scholarships renewed and " those scholarships should not be counted towards financial aid limits .
"  That last recommendation came with the added request that " roster limits and competition fields should also be expanded to accommodate returning seniors and incoming freshmen .
"  Later Monday , the Division I Council announced it would only expand roster limitations for baseball , which restricts teams to just 35 playable members with only 27 allowed to receive some portion of the 11 .
total scholarships granted per season , explaining it 's the only spring sport with any such roster restrictions .
Alabama 's 2020 baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a waiver to return in 2021 , whereas Auburn 's 2020 roster had just five seniors .
One day after the NCAA canceled all remaining spring and winter championship events , including the men 's and women 's basketball tournaments , on March 12 , the Division I Council 's coordination committee announced it " agreed that eligibility relief is appropriate for all Division I student-athletes who participated in spring sports .
" There was no such declaration made regarding winter sports like basketball that had its postseason cut short .
There are still several complications that could impact how many actually take advantage of the added year of eligibility , including the reality that some seniors may have already lined up post-graduate employment opportunities outside their respective sport .
There is also the fact that granting schools carte blanche flexibility to divvy out financial aid to returning seniors -- and potentially providing a smaller percentage of partial scholarship aid than they were offered this past year -- would force those same student-athletes into some very difficult decisions about whether to return or not .
And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the money to both bring back its seniors as well as afford to bring in the incoming 2020-21 recruiting class , it would nevertheless require a considerable financial commitment by schools , many that might not have the flexibility to do that .
For reference , Alabama spent a little less than $18 .
million on athletic student aid in the 2018-19 fiscal year , including roughly $6 million on athletes who play spring sports -- baseball ( $737,859 ) , softball ( $653,416 ) , men 's and women 's golf ( $535,577 ) , rowing ( $1 .
