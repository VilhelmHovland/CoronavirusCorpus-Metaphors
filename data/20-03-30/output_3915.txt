By Wojciech Kosc in WarsawMarch 30 , 2020  Poland 's parliament passed the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) economic package , aimed at helping an economy about to enter its biggest crisis since the 1980s , on March 28 .
Poland is bracing for a sharp economic downturn in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak .
Most optimistic estimates predict growth of below 1 .
this year but the trend is for new outlooks to tilt towards zero growth or recession , as companies are expected to lay off thousands of people and consumer demand to slump .
The package , which the ruling Law and Justice ( PiS ) party dubbed an " anti-crisis shield " focuses on the protection of jobs , the security of the financial system , aid to the healthcare system that is under stress from dealing with the epidemic , supporting businesses , and maintaining public investment as a means to stimulate the economy .
The PiS government wants to help businesses by easing some of their commitments , such as payments to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The government will also cover 40% of salaries , although that will come at a cost to workers , whose work time will have to be cut 20% for employers to be eligible to file for help .
Only companies that suffered a 15% drop in turnover for two months can apply to the government for salary cover .

From the Left , trade unions , and workers ' organisations there came criticism that the package focused on business too much while not spending enough to secure people 's incomes .
The package also erodes labour laws by allowing employers to prolong working hours without increasing pay , they said .
