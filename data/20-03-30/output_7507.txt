The house 's guest designer concept will now debut in January 2021 , and " Chitose Abe and Jean Paul Gaultier are as committed to it as ever .
"  The world 's most labor-intensive and exclusive fashions seem to be going into an extended blackout period .
On Monday , the Jean Paul Gaultier house said it would postpone showing a couture collection designed by Sacai 's Chitose Abe -- the first in a series of guest talents -- to January 2021 .
The development seemed a fait accompli after the F ? d ? ration de la Haute Couture et de la Mode , French fashion 's governing body , canceled the upcoming couture week , originally scheduled for July 5 to 9 .
It 's only one of several fashion weeks -- including men 's weeks in four fashion capitals -- to be scuttled in the wake of the coronavirus crisis .
Balenciaga , which was slated to return to the couture calendar in July after a 52-year absence , has already indicated it would push its high-fashion launch to January .
Contacted by WWD on Monday , many brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define their plans in a very fluid situation .
At Valentino , creative director Pierpaolo Piccioli , his teams and the rest of the company " are conceiving different and concrete ideas for the presentation of the men 's and women 's pr ? t- ? -porter , and haute couture collections .
Considering the continuous change of scenario , due to COVID-19 pandemic , we believe it to be premature to officiate any action plan today , " a spokesman for the Rome-based house said .
" We are developing different action plans to face the current situation , especially following the government 's regulations that have led to the closure of the Italian productive sites .
Under this consideration , we are elaborating a new sales campaign calendar for the pre-collections and we are working on innovative and remote selling operations , continuing to pursue a seasonless disposition that has been cultivated over the last few years .
"  Related Gallery  Lanvin , whose chief executive officer Jean-Philippe Hecquet recently stepped down after 18 months in the role , had announced plans to focus its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " events rather than runway shows during men 's fashion week to showcase creative director Bruno Sialelli 's universe in a different light .
" For June , at this stage , everything is on standby .
We are waiting to see how the situation evolves before making decisions -- about whether it 's pertinent to organize an event so soon after such a period , and also whether our budgets permit it , " said a spokesman for the house .
" For the commercial part , we are thinking about alternatives that would allow us to present the collection remotely in the event that buyers are unable to make the trip , which will almost certainly be the case , " the spokesman added .
Gabriel de Linage , ceo of Azzaro , said the house would communicate about collection reveals " in due time .
"  " We are monitoring this unprecedented situation very closely , which is leading us more than ever to demonstrate tenfold creativity and flexibility .
It is an opportunity to think differently and to reinvent ourselves in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context , our priority is first and foremost the people affected and all those in the front line in this fight , " de Linage added .
" We have taken all measures internally to protect our staff at risk and maintain physical distance in our daily work .
"  Abe is already working on her next men 's Sacai collection , but the format of how it will be presented has yet to be decided , according to a company spokeswoman .
Her take on Gaultier 's couture was highly anticipated given her appeal among fashion and streetwear mavens , and the novelty of donning the couture cap for a one-off collection .
" Even though our new haute couture concept will see the light of day only in January 2021 , our teams , Chitose Abe and Jean Paul Gaultier are as committed to it as ever , " the house said in a statement .
" The COVID-19 pandemic has affected us like all the other couture houses , but we are confident that the success of Jean Paul Gaultier 's last couture collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Gaultier surprised the industry by revealing that his spring 2020 couture show would be his last , and decided to invite a designer each season to " interpret the codes of the house and give the vision of the haute couture .
