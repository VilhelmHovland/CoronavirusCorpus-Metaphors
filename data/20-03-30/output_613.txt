The prospect that a pair of malaria drugs will become go-to medications for treating COVID-19 before they 've been rigorously tested is prompting new safety warnings from heart specialists and other doctors .
President Trump has touted the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a potential " game changer " for patients sickened by the novel coronavirus .
Political activists are urging doctors to prescribe them , and federal officials have asked pharmaceutical manufacturers to make their stocks of these drugs available for immediate use .
But as the medications begin pouring into hospital pharmacies and physicians begin prescribing them , their potential side effects are raising alerts .

An article published this week in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings warns that both drugs could prompt dangerous and potentially deadly heart arrhythmias in the 3 million people worldwide who have a congenital cardiac condition -- called long QT syndrome -- that can cause the heart to beat erratically and lead to sudden death .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take medications that prolong the heart 's " QT interval , " the span of time it takes the heart 's electrical system to recharge between beats .
Those people -- including patients who take common antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs or any one of a wide range of antibiotics -- are probably also at risk of developing a dangerously irregular heartbeat if they take one of the malaria drugs without being closely monitored by a doctor , the article 's authors said .
Roughly 13% of Americans over the age of 12 take an antidepressant medication .
It 's not clear how many more Americans are " QT reactors " -- people whose hearts respond to certain drugs with electrical changes that could trigger arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death .
With potentially millions of patients taking chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine , the unexpected appearance of these side effects in even a small percentage of them could spell disaster , said Dr .
Michael J .
Ackerman , a geneticist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn .
, who co-authored the new report .

" We have the tools and we have the knowledge " to avoid sudden cardiac deaths among people treated with the malaria drugs , Ackerman said .
But the medical community will need to be made more aware of this side effect .
He added that if these drugs are to be used safely , doctors will need to screen their patients carefully and devise a plan to monitor their heart rhythms after they 're sent home with the drug .
President Trump , Elon Musk and other are spreading dangerous myths about coronavirus .
Meanwhile , a dispatch posted this week to MedPage Today , a blog and medical news service widely read by doctors , warned that chloroquine can cause hemolytic anemia if administered to people with a common genetic condition called G6PD deficiency .
Hemolytic anemia can lead to shortness of breath , rapid heartbeat , and in severe cases , kidney failure and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 , " wrote Dr .
Dan J .
Vick , a pathologist who teaches healthcare administration atCentral Michigan University .
Its use is specifically discouraged in patients with G6PD deficiency .
The problem : Many of those patients never know they have G6PD until a new drug or dietary quirk triggers a crisis that prompts red blood cells to break down faster than they can be made .
The disorder affects between 10% and 14% of African American men in the U .
, and is common in people from the Mediterranean region , Africa and Asia .
Nearly all patients with G6PD are male ( since it is linked to the X chromosome ) .

Two clinical trials in the United States aim to test whether hydroxycloroquine might prevent illness in U .

Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine failed to help patients infected with the dengue and chikungunya viruses , and it also failed to protect against the flu .
The Italian doctors who authored the review in the Journal of Critical Care added that " safety data and data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed .
"  Trump , however , has insisted there is " very strong evidence " to support his confidence in the malaria drugs as treatment for COVID-19 .
" I feel good about it , " he said last week .
" That 's all it is , just a feeling .
"  And in the past week , doctors have been barraged with messages urging them to " Tell Trump to CUT RED TAPE &amp; make hydroxychloroquine available to you and your patients , " according to media reports .
The campaign is reportedly the brainchild of the Job Creators Network Foundation , a conservative organization founded and funded by wealthy supporters of the president .
