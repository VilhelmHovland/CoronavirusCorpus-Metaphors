WASHINGTON -- In an administration that has seen no shortage of drama related to the White House chief of staff , President Trump 's fourth chief is arriving with relatively little fanfare : Mark Meadows , officially joins the White House Monday , with his resignation as a North Carolina congressman set to take effect at 5 p .
, an aide said .
Trump fired his first chief of staff , Reince Priebus , in a tweet while both men were aboard Air Force One .
His second chief , John Kelly , on his first day axed the contentious -- and short-lived -- White House communications director , Anthony Scaramucci .
Kelly 's own tenure was marked by constant reports on his imminent ouster , and in December 2018 Mr .
Trump abruptly announced his coming departure .
His third chief , Mick Mulvaney , was given only a temporary title -- acting chief of staff -- that he kept over the course of his 14-month tenure .
Meadows has been advising Mr .
Trump in the White House for about a month , and his official start arrives at a fraught point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on responding to the new coronavirus .
The U .
case count has now passed 143,000 -- the most of any country , according to Johns Hopkins University data .
That timing has made Mr .
Trump 's decision to switch the most high-level staff position in the West Wing -- again -- all the more unusual .
As his advisers have been scrambling to prepare for daily coronavirus briefings and grappling with whether to continue keeping the U .
economy effectively shut down , they have also had to deal with the prospect of a new boss and the exit of several top aides .

Meadows 's takeover of the job has been a long time coming .
His name has been floated for years as a top contender for the job , and six weeks before Mr .
Trump tweeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as the chief .
Since Mr .
Trump announced on March 6 that Mr .
Meadows would be taking over as chief of staff , the congressman has been attending senior staff meetings as part of a transition period with Mr .
Mulvaney , an aide said .
The two sat side by side in an Oval Office meeting on March 12 .
Messrs .
Mulvaney and Meadows grew close during their time in Congress , both members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus while representing neighboring states , but they have had little opportunity to transition in person in recent weeks .
Meadows was in a self-imposed quarantine earlier this month as a precaution after attending a political conference where he crossed paths with someone who tested positive for coronavirus .
He returned in mid-March , and he and Mr .
Mulvaney traded notes on the job , according to people familiar with the matter .
But Mr .
Mulvaney then retreated into quarantine after his niece fell ill .
She has since tested negative , according to people familiar with the matter .
Mulvaney briefly returned to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadows will bring with him a handful of advisers , replacing the group of aides who had served in the chief 's office under Mr .
Mulvaney .
Ben Williamson , Mr .
Meadows 's chief of staff and communications director on Capitol Hill , will join the West Wing as a senior adviser to the chief of staff , according to an aide .
John Fleming , former assistant secretary of commerce for economic development , will also serve as a senior adviser .
Cassidy Hutchinson , who previously served in the White House legislative affairs office , will be Mr .
Meadows 's executive assistant , and Eliza Thurston , former deputy director of scheduling in the vice president 's office , will serve as director of the office of the chief of staff .
Thurston previously served for years as Mr .
Meadows 's scheduler on Capitol Hill .
Meadows has been a longtime ally of the president on Capitol Hill , most recently when the congressman became part of Mr .
Trump 's de facto defense team during the impeachment investigation on Capitol Hill .
The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr .
Trump regularly sought out Mr .
Meadows ' guidance on the dynamics at work in Congress .
Meadows has an array of approaches to study as he begins his new job .
Kelly , as chief of staff , strove to tighten access to the president and bring order to the White House .
Mulvaney did the opposite , telling aides he was content to " let Trump be Trump .
" As a result , he garnered fewer enemies inside the White House for much of his tenure .
But he clashed with the White House Counsel 's Office during the impeachment process , aides said , and often appeared not to be involved in some major decisions .
By the end of his tenure , his relationship with Mr .
Trump appeared to be nonexistent .
But he also exited on a far less sour note than those before him .
He is the only former chief whom Mr .
Trump has granted another administration post -- U .
special envoy for Northern Ireland .
