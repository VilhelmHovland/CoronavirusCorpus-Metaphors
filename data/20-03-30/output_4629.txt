Bank of FIFA : FFA to seek financial relief from world governing body  Football Federation Australia has opened talks with FIFA over a possible bailout as the sport braces for another financial hit this week from broadcasters Fox Sports .
Chief executive James Johnson 's close links to FIFA president Gianni Infantino could come in handy , with federation sources indicating FFA has already begun lobbying the world governing body for emergency relief .
FIFA president Gianni Infantino has already flagged the opening of a " Global Football Assistance Fund " in response to the coronavirus pandemic .
According to FIFA 's last financial report in 2018 , the organisation has reserves of cash or other financial assets worth more than $5 .
billion .
Infantino indicated earlier this month that FIFA was considering opening an assistance fund for " members of the football community " who have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic .

FFA sources indicated the federation will argue it has a strong case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape and the challenges posed to football by competing codes - but with 210 other member nations also likely to seek handouts , there is no suggestion FIFA 's money can or will be a panacea for the local game .
The reality is FFA needs as much financial help as it can get from any possible source , with the severity of the threat posed by the COVID-19 crisis set to intensify in the coming days .
Fox Sports ' quarterly payment - believed to be approximately $12-14 million - is due to land in FFA 's coffers on Wednesday but key figures within the sport do not expect it will be forthcoming as a consequence of the A-League 's indefinite hiatus .
Typically , that money is carved up and forwarded to clubs on a monthly basis , which they then use to pay players and staff on the 15th of every month .
Loading  One club , Perth Glory , has already stood down players and staff without pay and most others are set to follow despite legal threats from union Professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss John Didulica spoke on Sunday to try and map out an amicable way forward .
O'Rourke and Glory chairman Tony Sage did not return calls from the Herald , but Didulica did not back down from his strident criticism of the club 's actions .
" The players understand acutely the impact of the pandemic and I am in ongoing contact with FFA about how the players can play their role in navigating the collective challenges we face - not only in April and May , but importantly for the seasons ahead , " Didulica said .
" Unilateral and opportunistic behaviour can only undermine the commitment to finding a collective solution that helps us all share the burden of managing this difficult period fairly .
"  Johnson , meanwhile , described the Glory situation as " divisive " at a time when he said Australian football needed to be united , and flagged the likelihood of FFA intervention if a resolution can not be struck .
" It 's pretty fresh .
Our role at FFA at the moment is about monitoring what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News .
" Both views are different and they do have competing interests .
If this issue were to escalate we would have to consider intervening at some point where we would listen to both sides and the sectional views that both sides have , and then we would have to take a decision that we believe is in the overall best interests of the game .
