UN adopts 4 resolutions , voting by email because of COVID-19  TANZANIA , Tanzania -- The U .
Security Council unanimously adopted four resolutions on Monday , with its 15 members voting by email for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic .
Members voted to keep troops in Sudan 's restive Darfur region until the end of May and maintain the U .
political mission in Somalia until June 30 .
They extended the mandate of the U .
panel of experts monitoring sanctions against North Korea until April 30 , 2021 , and they stressed the importance of supporting the U .
' s far-flung peacekeeping operations .

has its headquarters , exceedingly hard .
The last council meeting in the headquarters complex was on March 12 , when a resolution was adopted extending the mandate of the U .

A resolution sponsored by the United Kingdom and Germany extends the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force in Darfur known as UNAMID until May 31 when the council said it will decide on " the responsible draw-down and exit " of UNAMID .
The council said it also intends to establish " a follow-on presence to UNAMID " at the same time .
The Darfur conflict began in 2003 when ethnic Africans rebelled , accusing the Arab-dominated Sudanese government of discrimination .
The government in Khartoum was accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic Arab tribes and unleashing them on civilian populations -- a charge it denies .
In recent years , as the result of a successful government military campaign , the rebellion has been reduced to a single rebel faction .

It was established in 2007 and was one of the U .
' s most expensive operations , with a ceiling of 15,845 military personnel and 3,403 police in June 2016 .
In July 2018 , the Security Council voted to dramatically cut the force , with a target to end the mission on June 30 , 2020 , but the mass street protests by a pro-democracy movement which began in late 2018 and led to last year 's ouster of Al-Bashir and a military-civilian transitional government caused a delay .
As of January , UNAMID had over 4,300 military personnel , more than 2,100 international police , and about 1,500 civilian staff .
The resolution adopted Monday will maintain that force for two months .
A proposed U .
Security Council resolution obtained by AP earlier this month would replace UNAMID with a U .
political and peace-building mission whose primary aim would be to support Sudan 's fragile transition to democracy including in drafting a new constitution and preparing for elections .

China , which holds the rotating council presidency in March , sponsored a resolution adopted unanimously stressing " the crucial role " that U .
peacekeepers play " in achieving conditions for stability and a lasting peace , " and urging countries where they are deployed to ensure their freedom of movement .
peacekeeping currently has over 100,000 field personnel including military , police and civilians from over 120 countries deployed in 13 active missions across three continents .
The resolution expresses " grave concern about security threats and targeted attacks " against peacekeepers in many missions , condemns " in the strongest terms " all violence and killings of peacekeeping personnel , and calls for prompt investigation and prosecution of those responsible for attacks against them .
