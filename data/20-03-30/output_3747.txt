" While she worked night shifts , I wanted bedtime stories or someone to gossip to about my day at school .
" As a young adult , I realise now it was a sacrifice she was making as well , so that she could pursue the career of her dreams that encompassed every ounce of that motherly love and compassion .
" Nursing is not for the faint-hearted , quite literally because she 's lost count of the amount of times she 's been vomited on or how many catheters she 's had to put into the older generation .
" Through all of the abuse from patients ' relatives , the criticism over a lack of beds , the tears and the countless , unpaid overtime , her smile has never escaped her face , because at the core of my superhero mother is her desire to help others .
" She relishes her job , it 's her place of tranquillity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon is a new storm that grows stronger with each trip to the supermarket or quick visit to see a friend .
It clouds every source of light and hope in my mother 's heart -- she is terrified of what is coming .
" The lessons from Italy , Spain and China are clear .
This virus is no joke .
" It takes no prisoners and does not discriminate when it comes to age , gender or ethnicity .
Thousands of people are critically ill across the globe and the eye of the storm is now locked onto our ill-equipped National Health Service .

" In my mind , this is effectively a death sentence .
She could come out of this completely unaffected , she may have already had the virus or she could only suffer minor symptoms .
" Or , considering she will have daily contact with the virus over the course of twelve hour shifts , she may not be so fortunate and could become one of the thousands that desperately need ventilators .
" Yet , we are still seeing reports of police breaking up karaoke parties in Derbyshire , people playing Pok ? mon Go in Stevenage or mass groups congregating in local parks .
" People are complaining about having to work from home with their children , or a missed birthday party or wedding .

" If the situation escalates further and she is deemed at risk of spreading it to us , my mum will be quarantined in a hotel , miles from home , between shifts .
" And although she will be terrified , she , like thousands of other NHS staff across the country , will do what must be done to keep us safe .
" As our NHS workers kiss loved ones goodbye while they still can , we all need to do our bit while they are on the frontline .
" I 've read a lot in the media and seen posts shared on Facebook and Twitter , commending the bravery of our NHS .
And rightly so .
" But your words of support are empty and shallow if you refuse to play your part in helping to prevent the spread of this virus .

In these testing times , your support is more important than ever .
Thank you .
