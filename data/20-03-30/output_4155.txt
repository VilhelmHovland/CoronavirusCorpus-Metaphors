UN chief says initial coronavirus cases in Syria just ' tip of the iceberg '  The UN humanitarian chief has warned that the 10 cases of Covid-19 and one death confirmed in Syria are just " the tip of the iceberg " .
Mark Lowcock told the UN Security Council on Monday that " all efforts to prevent , detect and respond to Covid-19 are impeded by Syria 's fragile health system .
"  Only around half of the country 's hospitals and primary health care facilities were fully functional at the end of 2019 .

With the Syrian conflict entering its 10th year this month , Mr Lowcock said that over half the population has been forced to flee their homes .
