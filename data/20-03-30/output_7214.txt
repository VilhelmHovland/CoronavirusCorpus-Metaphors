, via Twitter ( @indianz )  On March 27 , chairman Cedric Cromwell of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts published a statement saying the federal government was taking action to disestablish their reservation .
" On the very day that the United States has reached a record 100,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and our Tribe is desperately struggling with responding to this devastating pandemic -- the Bureau of Indian Affairs informed me that the Secretary of the Interior has ordered that our reservation be disestablished and that our land be taken out of trust , " Cromwell wrote .
After questioning the reason for this move , Cromwell continued , " Regardless of the answer , we the People of the First Light have lived here since before there was a Secretary of the Interior since before there was a State of Massachusetts , since before the Pilgrims arrived 400 years ago .
"  To make sure people living on reservations get help , Ethel Branch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a GoFundMe page to help the most vulnerable with food donations .
As a result , The LA Times reported that hundreds of families have received baskets that include flour , beans , rice , Tylenol and other necessities .
" We have to all do our part , because who knows if the government support will do anything , " Branch told the Times .
The new $2 trillion COVID-19 Stimulus Bill includes $8 billion for Native American tribal governments and a $150 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund for all tribes .
Yet even with a pandemic in full swing and events being postponed en masse around the country , the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska confirmed Cromwell 's ire in a March 30 tweet from their national news outlet Indianz , that the U .
Supreme Court will still hear McGirt v .
Oklahoma on April 21 .
This case would decide whether much of the reservation land in Oklahoma indeed belongs to the Native Americans .
The US Supreme Court continues work on McGirt v Oklahoma , with argument in Indian law case still scheduled for April 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions .

If Cromwell and other tribal leaders have anything to say about it , the federal government is in for a fight .
" These are our lands , these are the lands of our ancestors , and these will be the lands of our grandchildren , " wrote Cromwell in his announcement .
" This Administration has come and it will go .
But we will be here , always .
And we will not rest until we are treated equally with other federally recognized tribes and the status of our reservation is confirmed .
