By Paul Kibuuka  As Tanzania 's government rolls out measures to halt spread of the coronavirus disease ( Covid-19 ) pandemic , multinational companies ( MNCs ) and international organisations ( IOs ) with operations in the country are also reviewing their processes for employee mobility , also known as global mobility .
Significant expansion of Covid-19 across borders prompted the public and private sectors in Tanzania , represented respectively by the Ministry for Health and TPSF , to hold discussions on urgent measures to fight coronavirus 's effects on business and industry .

The government is yet to announce any changes in current tax practices to adapt to the new , but impermanent , coronavirus situation .
In neighbouring Kenya , however , President Uhuru Kenyatta announced tax reliefs to ease the economic impact of the deadly virus ( Wafula , P .

Until Tanzania takes note of what Kenya has done , MNCs , IOs and employees should continue with the usual tax obligations so as to eschew potential penalties .

Philip Mpango will likely address the economic impact of Covid-19 in forthcoming 2020/21 National Budget by proposing measures designed to assist business survival and to spur the economy in the wake of the global outbreak of Covid-19 .
Such proposals would help small and medium-sized companies engaging in domestic or global business .
Many MNCs , IOs and other businesses operating in Tanzania are granting or have granted flexible work arrangements that give employees freedom over when and where they fulfil their job responsibilities .
This amplified flexibility can add to the complexity of tax risk management amid Covid-19 downturn .
Under section 66(4) ( b ) of the Tanzanian Income Tax Act , Cap 332 ( ' the ITA ' ) , " a corporation is a resident corporation for a year of income if at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the affairs of the corporation are exercised in the United Republic " .
Consequently , if employees perform their job responsibilities from Tanzania where a company is not " incorporated or formed " as contemplated under section 66(4) ( a ) of the ITA ) , the company is at risk of creating an unintended taxable presence in Tanzania .
In light of this , MNCs and other investors should review whether their international assignees , or expatriates , sent to work in Tanzania are creating corporate income tax ( CIT ) risks and , if that be the case , develop practical strategies for minimising the CIT risks .
This is even more critical because Tanzania has a small tax treaty network which may imply less generous relief , compared to countries with big treaty networks .
Aside from triggering CIT risks , relocating foreign employees to Tanzania may precipitate personal income tax ( PIT ) risks .
Expatriate employees or secondees need to make sense of the tax ramifications of their presence in Tanzania and , depending on their home countries , structure the employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double taxation agreement .
In efforts to manage global tax compliance and deal with tax risks , MNCs , IOs and other employers need to understand the payroll tax obligations for their Tanzania-bound expatriate employees .
Employers may also be required to contribute 10 percent of the cash emoluments to the National Social Security Fund ( NSSF ) ; an additional 5 percent is contributed by the employee .
Since impact of these liabilities will likely be high in the Covid-19 landscape , there is a need to understand and to effectively manage the tax implications of employee mobility for the foreseeable future .
Tax lawyers who know the importance of transferring employees internationally can play a critical role to play in helping in-house HR and tax teams to identify and deal with tax risks as MNCs and IOs optimise global operations .
