Manitoba 's chief public health officer steadfastly remained tightlipped about the circumstances of the province 's only COVID-19 death -- a woman the Free Press has learned had worked at a dental supply company -- as the number of confirmed and presumptive cases across the province jumped to 72 over the weekend .
Brent Roussin declined to say how the woman had contracted the virus when he announced her death on Friday .
Roussin was questioned again about the death on Sunday and refused to divulge information about the case .
The patient , Margaret Sader , worked at Sinclair Dental in Winnipeg , the Free Press has confirmed .
" Thank you for your condolences .
Due to privacy concerns as well as the family 's continued wishes for privacy , we will decline to comment further at this time , " said Victor Michaud , chief operating officer of Sinclair Dental , in a series of emails Sunday .
Family members did not respond to the Free Press ' requests for comment .
Members of the local dentistry community took to social media to mourn Sader 's death ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community " icon " who had an excellent memory for product codes and people 's orders .
Also on Sunday , a provincial spokesman said in a statement : " Public health has publicly disclosed that at the time the now-fatal case was identified , all cases were related to travel or contacts to known or suspected cases .
" Any information that would help the public assess its risk , or direct people to self-isolate or to be tested for COVID-19 , has been completed .
"  The province 's approach drew criticism from a Winnipeg ethics expert , who said in addition to providing as much information as possible about COVID-19 cases that could protect the public , health officials should also tell Manitobans how long social distancing and self-isolating will have to continue to beat back the virus .
Neil McArthur said it 's crucial the province disclose information such as events patients have attended -- even if that may override their privacy rights .
" What 's going to be important with this crisis is tracking any movements of individuals who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be balanced versus the public interest .
" -- Neil McArthur  " The last thing we want is the government to be perceived as hiding anything at this point , " said McArthur , director of the Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics at the University of Manitoba .
" What 's going to be important with this crisis is tracking any movements of individuals who have infected others .
That 's the place where privacy will have to be balanced versus the public interest .
"  The number of cases reported in the province increased by 33 over the weekend .
On Sunday , two people who tested positive for COVID-19 remained in hospital , with one of them in the intensive care unit .
All other patients are in self-isolation in their homes , said Roussin , adding that two of those who had been ill had recovered .
Roussin did not provide a worst-case scenario forecast when asked about whether Manitoba 's future could mirror that projected by Saskatchewan 's provincial health authority .

Roussin said the province will likely be able to provide an estimate in the coming weeks .
The province has escalated social distancing guidelines to veto gatherings of more than 10 people , starting today , after the number of COVID-19 cases identified in Manitoba nearly doubled over the weekend .
Public gatherings are now limited to no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor venues -- including at weddings , funerals and places of worship .
As of 12:01 a .
this morning , businesses are required to enforce a minimum separation of one to two metres between patrons while public transit users must be able to maintain that same distance from one another at bus stops .
In addition , a new community testing site has opened in Pine Falls at Powerview School .
" We are not helpless against this virus , " Roussin said Sunday .
" The social distancing strategies that we 've had in place for over two week now , that we continue to escalate , are our best ways to interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through those droplets and through close contact with other individuals .
"  The chief public health officer urged Manitobans to stay at home , and if required to leave the premises , maintain a two-metre distance apart from other people .
" The majority of Manitobans are taking this seriously , " he said , adding that people can drastically reduce transmission by staying at home .
He also reiterated the importance of handwashing and the province 's recommendations to avoid all non-essential travel , both international and domestic .
The online assessment tool for the virus has been viewed 330,000 times since it was made public on March 17 .
In the event the province needs more space for patients due to overwhelmed hospitals , Shared Health spokeswoman Lanette Siragusa said the province is looking at sites that could be turned into pop-up health centres .
Stay informed  " The majority of COVID-19 patients .

In the meantime , Manitobans are being asked to stay at home if possible -- and if interested , contact the U of M researchers leading a clinical trial to determine whether a common malaria medication can be used to prevent the spread of COVID-19 .
Manitobans who have tested positive or who live with people who have tested positive , as well as health care workers who have been exposed to patients with confirmed positive infection are eligible to participate .
Additional information about the trial , which involves hydroxychloroquine , can be found online ( www .
covid-19research .
" The university is hoping to get as many Manitobans as possible enrolled in the clinical trial as fast as possible , " Roussin said .
" If this study is proven successful , it could lead way to treatment options for Manitobans .
