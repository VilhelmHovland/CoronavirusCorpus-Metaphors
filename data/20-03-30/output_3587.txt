Extraordinary message in extraordinary timesPosted on March 27th , 2020  by A .
Abdul Aziz  Worldwide Head of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community addresses the worldwide Jama'at from his office , Tilfrod , Surrey , United Kingdom .
Today ( 27 March 2020 ) , during the Covid-19 pandemic , His Holiness Hazrat Mirza Masroor Ahmad ( Khalifatul Masih V , may Allah be his Helper ) , delivered a LIVE message for the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at .
Ahmadiyya Khalifa at the beginning of his address said that due to the Covid-19 pandemic , governments around the world , including the British government , have stopped all congregational prayers .
His Holiness pointed out that at present , the exact law is not clear .
There are various interpretations ; some say that a few close relatives and people can congregate , while others have differing opinions .
Nevertheless , in such conditions , until it is not made clear , we can not offer Jumuah ( Friday ) prayers .
For this reason , after consultation , he said that instead of delivering a Friday Sermon , he would deliver a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world to watch the Friday Sermon on MTA .
His Holiness said that if he had not addressed the Ahmadiiyya Muslim Community today , then they would have had a longing to watch the sermon and so , he thought it best to address the Community in one way or another .
His Holiness said , We can not , for a prolonged period , leave the Jumuah prayer , and my connection with the Community is also essential " .
After consultation , His Holiness explained , a solution to this will be found .
In the UK , people are allowed , individually , to pray at mosques while maintaining distance .
But congregational prayers are not allowed at mosques .
In this condition , Jama'at members should offer congregational prayers at homes and also offer Jumuah prayer with the family .
Extracts from Malfuzat , or Jamaat literature , or the writings of the Promised Messiahas , or extracts from Al Fazl or Al Hakam can be read and the khutba sermon can be given .
"  The Jumuah can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare their sermons " , their knowledge will increase .
Ahmadiyya Khalifa said , Al Hakam has started an initiative on how people are spending their time at home .
In those comments , most people are writing that they are increasing their knowledge by reading the Quran , hadith and writings of the Promised Messiah , peace be on him "  Ahmadiyya supreme Head explained that even in the wider world , people are commenting on how they are spending their time .
MTA ( Muslim TV Ahmadiyya International ) has lots of beneficial programmes , which should also be watched .
He emphasised that the governmental advice that is being spread should be followed .
Ahmadiyya Khalifa made it clear that prayers are key and through them , one can draw the grace of God .
This is what the Promised Messiah , peace be on him , continuously said , that the most important thing is that we seek God 's forgiveness , cleanse our hearts and remain engaged in good works " .
Where the question of not offering Jumuah prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sal ) -- ahadith that in some conditions , the Jumuah prayer become exempt in mosques .
His Holiness mentioned a hadith from Bukhari and Muslim in which Hazrat Ibn Abbasra , when it rained , told the muazins to say Sallu fi buyutikum " ( pray in your homes ) as opposed to Hayya alas-Salah " ( come to prayer ) and this is also what the Prophetof Islam ( PBUH ) practised when such conditions arose .
Further references from Islamic scholars of jurisprudence were presented by His Holiness to support this fact .
In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and instructions from the government , Ahmadiyya Khalifa said that in their homes , everyone should continue congregational prayers and offering Jumuah prayers .
Khalifa of Islam made it clear that from an Islamic perspective , narrations prove that during contagious pandemics , people should practise distancing and taking cautions .
Everyone should offer Jumuah prayers at home and His Holiness said that he would make arrangements for this as well .
Towards the end , His Holiness prayed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of this time in helping one another in the best possible manner .
All the crimes ( sins ) any two legged creature can any do anywhere under the sun : 1 killing 2 stealing 3 sexual misconduct 4 lying 5 drugs , alcohol abuse .
Buddhism 's Five Precepts are used as the penal code in every country under the sun to punish two legged creatures who break those Five Precepts ! Any honest man is going to agree ! Five Precepts is a guide for all the two legged creatures how to live their lives without harming the environment they live in and be mindful how to live in a society without being a nuisance and make your next life a better one .
Most people frown on The Buddha 's teachings since they have to make a bit of sacrifice to be a responsible person in a society .
Most of the two leggeds are selfish , greedy , ungrateful , crafty people we most agree .
Add to this there are a lot of greedy , unsympathetic political leaders who do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc .
Then is there any wonder , two leggeds are being punished for their crimes .
We all know ( honest people only ) , two legged creatures should n't be eating meat since our distant relative chimp is n't a meat eater .
What 's more if you look at your teeth and it tells you what sort of diet we should be eating ( it 's different from cat/dog/lion/tiger etc .
, is it not ? ) .
But people are hell bent on killing animals for food .
The earth 's size is a grain of sand in the vast vast vast vast universe ( The Buddha preached this , also NASA has corroborated this with their missions ) .
Within the last few decades world 's population has quadrupled from sparsely place to a bursting at the seams .
These new mouths need a lot of resources and they generate a lot of pollution too .
What 's more farmers take new techniques ( tricks ) to maximise their profits to feed this burgeoning population .
One such practice is to add antibiotics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the two legged creatures stomach saving a lot of money for the farmers .
Downside of this is , after eating these antibiotic-drugged meat two legged creatures become antibiotic resistant .
Then scientists have to find a fix to fix the two legged creatures ! What 's more livestock generate a lot of greenhouse gases and pollute the planet and jungles being cleared to rear them .
Livestocks too have diseases and they pass these to two legged creatures ( their revenge ) .
It 's a lose , lose situation for the planet .
Do the two legged give toss ? No chance in hell .
So the two legged reaps what they sow .
If the two legged creatures come out of this hole somehow , there will be another one even more dangerous waiting in the wings .
People used to worship trees , mountains , rivers , gods in the olden days in the absence of science .
Charles Darwin showed the world how the two legged creatures came to be being in his Theory of Evolution .
Then his book , The Tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures came to be being .
The Buddha explained , to be a two legged creature one has to spend millions of years in the animal kingdom ( similar to Darwin 's Theory of Evolution ) .
Buddhism disappeared from India since it did n't fit the society with caste system , animal sacrifice etc and they quickly reverted back to religions of conveniences which do n't regard sins as sins .
Then invading muslims destroyed whatever left of it .
That 's not all former Buddhist countries iran , afganisthan , pakisthan , bangladesh , malaysia and indonesia succumbed to musslims within a few hundred years of their arrivals .
Soon they outnumbered the natives and turned all of those countries to muslim countries .
What The Buddha preached to be true has been proved again and again by scientists and NASA .
While the mankind taking one step forward by sciences , they take two steps backward due to their selfishness , greed , dishonesty etc .
It 's same at individuals as well as countries .
Is there any wonder then two legged creatures facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a minute and think of changing their ways ? No chance in hell .
Covid19 giving them a stark warning ! Be prepared for even more dangerous things !  Leave a Reply  Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .
