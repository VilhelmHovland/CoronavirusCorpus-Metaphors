" The Danish way of doing things is working , " she said at a news conference on Monday .
Amid the coronavirus outbreak , Denmark was one of the first European countries to announce a full closure of public schools and institutions and to impose strict limits on social gatherings .
It was also one of the first nations to close its borders , which it did on March 14 .
As of Monday , Denmark had 2,555 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection and 77 deaths .
While the number of patients in intensive care continues to rise , infectious disease expert Kare Molbak says " infection pressure " -- the average number of people infected by each infected person -- is now half of what it was in mid-March .
" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but we can see that it is more under control than in other parts of Europe .
what has Denmark done differently ? Because we can see that there are lots of countries that have acted similarly .
but still have big problems .
My professional opinion is that what has been effective in Denmark is that we acted early .
"  Frederiksen also credits the willingness of Danes to unite in following the rules .
" Our joint efforts are absolutely crucial , " she said during her widely broadcast news conference .
In fact , Danes have been so good at self-isolating that doctors have experienced a drastic drop in calls .
It 's quiet to the point that the head of the Danish College of General Practitioners is now reminding people with ailments other than the coronavirus that they still can -- and should -- seek treatment .
While emphasizing the need for a " gradual " movement back to business , Frederiksen did not offer many details about how that might look .
She hinted at the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions on gatherings .
She also spoke directly to Denmark 's seniors , saying they would likely need to take precautions for a longer period of time .
" We are asking the weakest to be the strongest right now , " she said .
" And that is a tough request .
"  Despite the overall optimism of her message , Frederiksen admonished Danes not to take her word as a guarantee , emphasizing the need for continued restraint .
" If we can see that the numbers begin to rise drastically , if we can see that Danes begin to gather inside and outside -- not to keep their distance -- then we can not open Denmark again after Easter , " she warned .
" In fact , we can end in the opposite situation where we have to tighten the rules even more .
