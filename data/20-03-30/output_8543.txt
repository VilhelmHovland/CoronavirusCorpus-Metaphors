Dean Hettinger ( Photo : Tribune file photo )  Both have also said that employees have been instructed to talk with people at their homes if possible through a door or outside on the porch while practicing social distancing .
If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to revert to personal protective equipment ( PPE ) like gloves and masks .
Still , the goal is to respond to calls from the community as before .
However , extra precaution is needed as Hettinger and Shroyer said a case of COVID-19 could be devastating , given the small number of employees in each department .
Shroyer said they started keeping a crew and some equipment off station as an emergency backup .
EMS stations in Coshocton , Warsaw and West Lafayette have closed their doors to the public .
The sheriff 's office realizes they ca n't do that , but are being very cautious with anyone coming into the lobby .
As soon as someone walks in , they are greeted by a sign telling them not to go any farther until they 've had their temperature taken .
The sheriff 's office is still offering conceal-carry permits and background checks , but has limited hours and days .
Visitors are no longer allowed in the Coshocton Justice Center .
The dispatch center is on semi-lockdown , limiting who is coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ramped up in the office and cruisers .
" We 're trying to limit the flow of traffic in and out of our hallway , while doing that though , we want to provide the best services to the public we possibly can , " Hettinger said .
" We 're still handling calls .
We 're still arresting violators .
We 're still doing everything we were doing before .
"  Guidelines for the governor 's stay at home order that went into place midnight Tuesday has been one of " soft enforcement , " Hettinger said .
He said officers would not be going out of their way to stop vehicles or going into open businesses , but would have their eyes and ears open .
" If we see someone out of line or not following the order , we 're reminding them what the order is , " Hettinger said .
" Overall , folks have really been heeding the warnings and following the governor 's order to keep themselves and their workers safe .
"  Hettinger said with more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashes , has gone down .
Dispatch has been receiving calls relating to the stay at home order on what they can do and if they are in an essential business .
Any questions they ca n't answer is being forwarded to the Coshocton County Health Department .
The sheriff 's office has received donations of cleaning items and PPE .
Shroyer said EMS has received donations as well and an offer from a group to sew masks if given proper material .
It 's something Shroyer is exploring .
" I think everybody in the public safety and hospital field is scrambling and fighting over the same little pile of PPE , " Shroyer said .
" It 's just finding the PPE and medical supplies , because everyone is out to get the same stuff .
"  EMS is still responding to calls as normal , but is having dispatchers ask a few more questions to get a better sense of a person 's health and what their issue is before going out .
While the sheriff 's office is receiving questions on the stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about COVID-19 symptoms and people confused over what they should be looking for in themselves or others .
Shroyer said they have transported some possible coronavirus cases , but none have tested positive so far .
They have stripped down one ambulance to the bare essentials for such transports , to cut down on the possibility of contamination .
Ambulances are getting bumper to bumper cleanings every morning and night with a lighter scrub downs after every patient .
" We 're just going a little bit slower and asking all the proper questions , " Shroyer said .
" If we decide based on our assessment it 's a potential infected person , whether it 's the flu or coronavirus , we 're stopping and putting on full PPE so we 're protected .
We 're erring on the side of caution .
"  Being a first responder is stressful anytime , but Hettinger and Shroyer know their employees are certainly feeling the weight of the world on their shoulders right now .
Both said they 're preparing for the worst , while hoping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " It 's a little frustrating for us and for everybody .
Every day we learn more about the disease .
So , everyday you have to modify what you 're doing , " Shroyer said .
" It 's a scary situation .
We 've seen increased anxiety among the community and public safety people .
But , overall , I think people are handling it pretty well so far , at least in our area .
