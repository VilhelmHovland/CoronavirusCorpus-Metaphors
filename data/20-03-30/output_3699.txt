" We have seen another increase in the number of residents admitted to hospital as a result of the virus , with 14 currently hospitalised , three of these in intensive care , " a statement from the premier 's office reads .
" Today we have started providing sub-district information across the Western Cape , including in the City of Cape Town .
The stats show us that this virus is spreading , reaching communities across our province .
" Each and every one these cases , from Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain to Mossel Bay -- is of very serious concern for my government .
" Our response teams are treating the development of cases in our informal areas with the urgency and seriousness it deserves , following up with every contact and ensuring isolation .
" We appeal to the public to not stigmatise this virus -- no one is immune , and we ask for understanding and assistance to those in need of help .
Mostly , if we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .
" These stats again demonstrate why abiding by this lockdown is so essential .
If we are to #stopthespread , we must stay home , in our homes , and limit contact with other people .
"  " Coronavirus is very much here , and although we can not stop its spread entirely , we have a window of opportunity to slow it down , and we must embrace it .
" It is imperative that people everywhere -- across the length and breadth of our province -- obey the rules of the lockdown to prevent further spread in our communities .
" This virus will impact us all , but it will impact our most vulnerable -- the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions -- the hardest .
We must all play a role in halting its spread by staying in our homes .

Combined with regular hand washing , not touching your face , and sneezing or coughing into your arm or a tissue , this is the best line of defence we have against contracting the virus .
Remember , there is no cure .
"  Western Cape Health Minister Nomafrench Mbombo has reminded residents of the province that wearing a mask and gloves provides little defence against infection .
The minister has urged everyone to wash their hands frequently .
" Wearing a mask or gloves when going to the supermarket or pharmacy to buy essentials , is ineffective , unnecessary , and will not protect you from the coronavirus .
In fact , it spreads the virus faster because it makes you a carrier from one person to another , it also gives false security that you do n't need to wash or sanitise your hands , " Mbombo said .
She added : " Personal protective equipment ( PPE ) is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate people .
If you are not ill and not in close contact with someone who has coronavirus , you do not need to wear a mask or gloves .
These are only important if you are in direct contact with- or caring for a person who is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 , at home or in a health facility .
This is part of infection control .
"  Call to abide by lockdown regulations .
" We call on all residents to abide by the regulations put in place for the lockdown , " Mbombo reminded the people of the Western Cape .
" These rules are in place to ensure your safety and to stop the spread of the coronavirus .
We remind residents that police and law enforcement will continue to make arrests and issue fines for people acting in contravention of these rules .
" To report instances of the rule-breaking , residents must call 10111 or their local police or law enforcement .
"  Fake news  The premier 's office warned citizens against spreading fake news and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill in a form to leave their house to buy food or medicine .
" We note also the reported arrest of a Cape Town man for spreading fake news about the coronavirus , " an update from Winde reads .
" Fake news is deeply dangerous in a time like this , as it creates fear , panic and uncertainty .
Spreading of fake news is now an offence , and we call on people to only share content from trusted sources .
" A number of concerned residents have reached out to us to ask if they are required to fill out a form to leave the house to buy essential goods .
This form is fake -- members of the public do not need to fill out a form to go to the shops or get medicine .
