Egan : No job , rent is late ? Landlords say negotiate : relief in the time of COVIDBack to video  Some landlords are being generous , like the south-end Wingale Housing Co-op , which has given its 50 tenants two months of rent relief , or the Parc Beausoleil , in Lowertown , which cancelled April 's payment for its 56 members .
For bigger landlords , flexibility is the guiding principle .
The Eastern Ontario Landlord Organization , which has 40,000 rental homes under its umbrella , is urging both tenants and landlords to accommodate each other , according to personal circumstances .
Tenants with no interruption in income ( public servants , pensioners , for instance ) should pay the rent , say the EOLO , while those with a sudden loss need to catch some monetary relief from the landlord , at least for April .

( The EOLO is clearly saying that tenants and landlords with stable incomes should not treat the COVID-19 crisis as some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed tenants to reach out to their landlord , explain the situation , " pay what you can , " and apply for federal government income relief of roughly $2,000 a month .
" Everybody needs to play their part .
If you ca n't pay , fine .
We do n't expect you to pay .
But if you can pay , you need to pay , " said chair John Dickie , pointing out that proper building maintenance depends on an income stream .
Strapped landlords , meanwhile , should reach out for mortgage payment deferral or any other program being eyed by the three levels of government .
( Most of Canada 's big banks are offering mortgage deferral , not forgiveness .

" Everybody is feeling it , " said Adam Pearce , vice-president of Sleepwell , which manages about 1,700 housing units in Ottawa .
" We 're not coming in with an iron fist , " said Pearce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" If you ca n't pay your rent , we 're not breathing down your neck or not providing any relief at the same time .
It 's all about case-by-case .
"  While much sympathy has been expressed for tenants , he pointed out that small landlords can easily find themselves in a jam .
Like the owner of a triplex who might have retail on the ground floor and , suddenly , the tenants are out of work and the store is closed to daily business .
Yet the mortgage will still come due .

And , Dickie points out , small landlords may depend on outside jobs for income -- jobs that might be on hold with the COVID-19 pandemic .
So , the pinch can work both ways .
Minto , one of the city 's largest landlords with 5,200 units , announced Friday it is postponing rent increases that were scheduled for April , May and June .
It will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It is also encouraging tenants in hardship to speak to their property managers " who will work with them on a payment plan solution .
"  Commercial tenants , too , are feeling the crunch .
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business released a survey Monday that found a quarter of small businesses wo n't be able to pay their rent or mortage in April .

Among the hardest-hit sectors are hospitality ( 44 per cent ) , arts and recreation ( 40 per cent ) and personal services ( 32 per cent ) reporting high rates of distress for next month 's rent or mortgage payments .
And , as might be expected in such a fluid situation , there is confusion .
A tenant at Westgate Shopping Centre , for instance , was sent a memo from mall owner RioCan that said , although retail was down to a bare bones operation :  " Please be advised that despite only essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security will continue to be upheld and the terms of your lease unrelated to operating hours will remain in full force and effect .
"  Advertisement  Story continues below  This advertisement has not loaded yet , but your article continues below .
In other words , pay the piper .
Though it was sent March 25 , turns out this information was misleading .
RioCan , an investment trust with 220 properties and $15 billion in " enterprise value " across Canada , is actually giving independent tenants a break , as it clarified to this newspaper on Monday .
" In the immediate term , RioCan is offering those independent commercial tenants who have requested rent relief , an automatic 60-day , interest-free rent deferral , payable in the subsequent 12 months , " the company has announced , just as it warned its revenues might drop by 25 per cent .
