The New Zealand Taxpayers ' Union is joining calls for the Government to extend submission deadlines for Select Committees during the immediate fallout of the COVID-19 crisis .
New Zealand Taxpayers ' Union spokesman Louis Houlbrooke says , " Old political priorities need to be re-evaluated as New Zealanders scramble to deal with the implications of COVID-19 and the national lockdown .
"  " Four pieces of legislation -- including vaping regulations and the Screen Industry Workers Bill -- have submission deadlines this week .
"  " If an organisation or individual asks for an extension , the Speaker demands practical reasons they ca n't meet the deadline .
This makes a farce of democracy at a time when literally everyone is dealing with the effects of a global crisis .
"  " Individuals who would have otherwise made valuable submissions now find themselves with higher priorities .
And organisations with valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions while in lockdown -- not everyone has an MP 's home office set-up .
"  " We 're backing calls to defer select committee submission and reporting deadlines by at least four weeks , unless the legislation in question is relevant to the COVID-19 response or otherwise clearly time-sensitive .
