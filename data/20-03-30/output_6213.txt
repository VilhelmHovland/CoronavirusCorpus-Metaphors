As coronavirus delivers a body blow to the already weak Indian economy , former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan tells what the central bank can do to soften the impact .
Raghuram Rajan spoke exclusively to India Today News Director Rahul Kanwal about his understanding of the economic situation in a post-coronavirus world and how India can deal with the global pandemic .
Speaking about the role RBI can play at the moment , Raghuram Rajan said the need of the hour is to provide credit to ailing businesses .
However , the RBI is unable to rise to the occasion due to the existing lag in the Indian economy .
" We have a financial system that is impaired .
I have always maintained that we need to clean it up so that it can function as necessary .
The problem now is that the RBI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told India Today TV .
So what is the solution ? " The government has to offer partial guarantees to make sure banks keep lending to small and medium enterprises as well as large firms .
At the same time , we have to provide some incentives so that banks are willing to take the credit risk .
"  He had another advice for the RBI -- " At this point , the RBI should take a cue from central banks across the world who are contributing by easing liquidity .
Liquidity should not be a constraint .
But we need to think carefully as we have large NPAs , " he added .
Raghuram Rajan also advocated a temporary income transfer scheme to help the poor survive during the coronavirus pandemic .
He , however , clarified that now is not the time to think about a universal basic income program .
" Temporary income support as targetted as possible makes sense but beyond that , we do n't have the money for long-term schemes .
We need to prioritise , first money needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get money to those most affected .
Targetted income transfers for a couple of months make sense as it will provide relief to affected households .
Universal basic income means paying the households forever and we do n't have time and resources for that at the moment , " he said .
On being asked about the absence of the global supply of medical resources , the ex-RBI chief said that Centre will have to use all the tricks in the book to acquire what is available in the international market .
" In the immediate context , we need to find the necessary supply wherever we can find , even if we have to cajole or push .
Since every country is trying to do that , we need to use every way we can to apply pressure and bring-in all that we need , " Raghuram Rajan said , adding that beyond the current scenario , the crisis raises the question on if we are self-sufficient for critical resources .
" But that 's a medium-term issue , " he said .
