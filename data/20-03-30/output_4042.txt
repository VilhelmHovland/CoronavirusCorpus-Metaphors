Sainsbury 's has pledged to support its suppliers and partners with their cash flow as they look to navigate the coronavirus pandemic .
The move , which is designed to help businesses increase production volumes quickly to meet customer demand , sees Sainsbury 's commit to pay small suppliers immediately , benefiting 1,500 small businesses with under ? 100,000 of business with the supermarket .
Sainsbury 's is also making support available to suppliers who find themselves in distress as result of the ongoing uncertainty , and is extending its support to tenants and concession partners .
As a first step , the retailer is offering all tenants the opportunity to pay rent on a monthly basis as opposed to quarterly in advance .
It is anticipated that 250 tenants and concession partners will benefit from the new arrangements .
Paul Mills-Hicks , commercial director at Sainsbury 's , said : " We want to support our suppliers and partners because it is vital that we all help each other during this challenging time .
The businesses we work with are working flat out to supply us with product and going above and beyond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be working alongside them to feed the nation and we will do all we can to help .
"  Support from Morrisons  The move follows similar measures announced by Morrisons on 13 March .
Like Sainsbury 's it has switched to immediate payments for its smaller suppliers to help them during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic .
The retailer is temporarily reclassifying a smaller supplier from those with ? 100,000 of business-a-year with the company to those with ? 1 million of business .
This will mean an extra 1,000 small food businesses will qualify for the new payment terms .
The move will help businesses that provide up to ? 1m of turnover with Morrisons , including suppliers of local food and farmers that deal direct with Morrisons .
In total , Morrisons has around 3,000 small suppliers including 1,750 farmers that will benefit .
It is expected that Morrisons ' temporary payment terms will last until the end of May before being reviewed .
