Newsom on Wednesday evening said the state has asked the Department of Defense to deploy the Navy 's Mercy hospital ship and two mobile hospitals to California to help care for the expected surge in hospitalizations of residents stricken by the coronavirus .
He put the California National Guard on alert Tuesday .
The governor said the state is working to expand available hospital beds by roughly 20,000 , the number needed if more than half of Californians come down with the coronavirus .
Newsom 's order falls short of activating California 's National Guard force of roughly 22,000 , and he emphasized that the state often relies on the Guard 's assistance in times of disaster and crisis , especially in response to wildfires and earthquakes .
" That 's just one scenario plan .
There 's others that are more modest .
Some may , some cases may be more extreme , " Newsom said Wednesday evening during a Facebook Live broadcast .
" When you 're looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , you have to look at your existing surge capacity within the healthcare delivery system , and you have to look at procuring additional assets .
"  The state estimates that surge capacity in California 's existing hospital system could accommodate 10,000 patients .
If requests for the military medical assistance are granted , California should be close to reaching the 20,000-bed threshold , Newsom said .
Here 's a visual look at how life in Southern California has changed during the coronavirus crisis .
" We want to make sure people know that their security is top of mind , " he said during a Tuesday briefing on the state 's response to the outbreak .
Ronald Fong , president of the California Grocers Assn .
, said markets are struggling to restock shelves because so many customers are buying an overabundance of food and supplies .
He urged customers to return to their normal grocery shopping routine , saying there is no shortage of food or necessities such as toilet paper -- just an overwhelmed supply chain to the stores .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential service , " Fong said .
" Grocery stores are going to stay open .
But we can not keep up with a shopping pattern that customers have adopted by overbuying .
"  Newsom said National Guard troops would also assist local governments , but he did not offer specifics about their potential roles .
" The reality is cities can only do so much , and when you are not capable of doing a little bit more , and it becomes regionalized , that 's the appropriate role of the state of California , " Newsom said .
" We just want folks to know we 're leaning in a little bit more aggressively in that space as well .
"  Earlier this month , a California National Guard helicopter delivered supplies to the Grand Princess cruise ship when it was held off the San Francisco coast until some of the passengers and crew could be tested for the coronavirus .
The ship eventually docked in Oakland .

Schools  " While we are in very unique circumstances at this time , we are still providing education to our students , " State Supt .
of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said .
" School is not out , but we are finding a different way to deliver it .
"  Nearly all schools across the state have shut down , and many districts have announced weeks-long closures .
But Newsom on Tuesday evening said schools are likely to remain closed even longer -- perhaps for the remainder of the academic year , a disruption to the education of 6 .
million students .
Newsom stuck to that position in a Wednesday update , although state and local school officials stressed that no official directive has been issued .
But the quick-moving developments have sent volunteers and educators scrambling to establish online coursework , meals and other support services for their many students in need .
" This is already a painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake about it , it 's going to get worse before it gets better , " state Sen .
Bill Dodd ( D-Napa ) said at a news conference .
" But this is an opportunity to move in the right direction , to flatten the curve .
"  In Ventura County , health officials announced a shelter-in-place order Tuesday that applies only to older residents .
