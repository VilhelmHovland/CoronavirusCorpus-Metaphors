All-round approach vital to fight Covid-19  Published Mar 26 , 2020 , 10:36 pm IST  Updated Mar 26 , 2020 , 10:36 pm IST  By acting in unison , we can cut the chain of transmission and take the sting out of the disease  Firefighters spray disinfectant to contain the new coronavirus Covid-19 on a street in Guwahati on March 25 , 2020 .
( AP )  As the number of coronavirus ( also called Covid-19 ) cases rises in India , we 're conjuring up two very different scenarios : one in which India becomes the next epicentre of the outbreak with dreadful consequences of unimaginable proportion ; and the second in which India is successfully able to prevent any major outbreak and earn for itself big applause .
Which of two these scenarios will actually unfold depends on how swiftly the country -- which includes the government , the people and establishments -- is able to deal with the emerging situation .
Now that prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-week lockdown , there is a high chance that we may get away from Covid-19 relatively lightly .
Through this lockdown , the government hopes to achieve universal social distancing , which is seen as vital in cutting the chain of disease transmission .
This extreme decision does n't appear to be a knee-jerk reaction .
Sunday 's ' janata curfew ' seems to have been a prelude to preparing the public for the total lockdown , which was in the making as there were some hints to it in Modi 's first public address on the coronavirus Thursday evening .
The lockdown has brought the entire country to a complete standstill .
Except for the production , movement/distribution and sale of certain essential goods and services , there is a total ban on all other activities , including on the outdoor movement of people .
There are no national or international commercial flights , all passenger trains have halted , and passage of people through immigration checkposts has been discouraged .
The government has issued detailed guidelines on strict enforcement of the lockdown .
Exponential incidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at large but it 's well worth it .
Although the lockdown is for three weeks as of now , one does n't really know for how long it will need to last .
We are living in uncertain times .
The novel coronavirus disease has taken the world by storm .
Covid-19 is barely three months old and has already infected over 425,000 persons and caused over 19,000 deaths worldwide .
While the disease in China ( where it started ) , South Korea and Taiwan has crossed the peak , the infection elsewhere is yet to .
We do n't know where the situation may land us .
In the spread of this infection , one surprise element has been the relatively low number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in India thus far : India has reported 606 cases so far , including 13 deaths .
Even Iceland , with a population of only 370,000 , has reported a higher number of cases !  Experts are divided in their views .
Some attribute the low numbers in India to the early introduction of border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the imposition of quarantine rules , and active tracing of contacts .
Further , the alert and a responsive administration began imposing stricter measures as the situation started to unfold .
Different opinions  However , there are other experts who disagree .
They believe the actual number of cases is probably much higher than the reported numbers .
The low numbers reported by India may be the result of its testing protocol , which is limiting , and they believe that India will see a surge in cases over the next few days and weeks .
In their view , India should be testing many more cases and prepare for the worst .
Indeed , the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) , the apex official body involved in biomedical research in the country , has been revising its testing protocols based on the learning that is coming from within the country and other high-risk nations .
The ICMR has ramped up testing capacity by activating over 100 government laboratories with the combined capacity to conduct over 10,000 tests a day .
Additionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed a price ceiling for tests conducted in private labs .
Regardless of the difference of opinion , all experts agree on one thing : given India 's fragile healthcare system , disease prevention is its only weapon .
A delay in the onset of Covid-19 and its relatively slow progression in the country has given the administration a golden opportunity to not only ramp up its testing capacity but also prepare for any possible outbreak .
The administration has ramped up quarantine facilities and kept isolation wards ready , constituted rapid response teams , deputed additional secretaries/joint secretaries for a coordinated response at the state level , and has not shied away from partnering with the private sector in preparing for any eventuality .
As we 've not had any major outbreak so far , our level of preparedness has not been tested yet .
In Singapore and South Korea , swift public health and safety measures have helped in controlling the spread of this highly infectious disease .
In the Indian context , an effective lockdown along with a swift public health response should prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all levels has an important role to play , the role of the public in complying with the lockdown simply ca n't be overemphasised .
As with the public , so with business establishments .
They need to rise above their narrow commercial interests and try to help the country in this hour of need .
These are extraordinary times .
Now is the time to do charity and philanthropy .
And there are a number of ways to do it depending on their line of business .
Almost all experts agree that Covid-19 is yet to peak in India .
But no one is quite sure in what form or shape it will do so .
It all depends on how seriously we all take the lockdown .
By acting in unison , we can cut the chain of transmission and take the sting out of the disease .
Together , we can defeat Covid-19 , which we must .
But fighting Covid-19 is only one of the battles that lie ahead .
Shoring up the Indian economy , badly bruised by Covid-19 , is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably last much longer and require a far more concerted effort together with the rest of the world .
