When President Trump last week criticized General Motors Co .
' s effort to produce ventilators , GM executives were flabbergasted .
They felt the company was being unfairly targeted by the president , say people familiar with their thinking .
GM had begun collaborating with a ventilator company a couple of weeks earlier .
It had mobilized more than 1,000 employees and nearly 100 auto suppliers to start making the machines , which can be used to help patients with the disease caused by the new coronavirus .
" We wo n't let it deter us , " GM global manufacturing chief Gerald Johnson said in an interview over the weekend .
" Every ventilator is a life .
"  From GM 's account , the car maker has been hustling to do its part since mid-March .
Trump on Friday expressed frustration with the timeline , expecting the company and its ventilator partner , Ventec Life Systems , would be able to ramp up faster .

By daybreak , they were huddled in a conference room at Ventec , a small maker of ventilators whose entire operation is smaller than some GM car dealerships .
Ventec executives had turned over blueprints for the roughly 700 parts that go into its ventilator to the GM engineers , hoping to get their help scaling up production .
The GM contingent , which usually specializes in designing and sourcing parts for building vehicles , used their smartphones to take videos of the toaster-sized machines being built by hand .
A box of parts was overnighted to Michigan .
" The ramp-up schedule we 're committing to is faster than anything we 've ever done , " said Phil Kienle , GM 's head of manufacturing in North America , who was among the GM team that visited Ventec and described the effort in an interview Sunday .

Manufacturers from GM , Ford Motor Co .
and Tesla Inc .
to medical-device giants like Medtronic Inc .
and even British vacuum-maker Dyson are gearing up to boost production .
Governors and hospitals are pleading for more and warning of the need to ration the machines .
Ford said Monday it is working with General Electric Co .
to make 50,000 ventilators at one of the auto maker 's facilities in Michigan by early July .
Medtronic on Monday said it would publicly share the design specifications for a ventilator product to allow other companies to explore rapid production of the devices .
GM disclosed on March 20 that it was working with Ventec to expand ventilator production .
Ventec was taking the lead on discussions with the Trump administration , and three days later , submitted paperwork to supply the federal government with ventilators , people familiar with the matter said .
Ventec had provided a range of possibilities for monthly production of ventilators , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
Each scenario required a gradual increase for the GM operation to get up and running , they said .
The Trump administration was under the impression it could move to full production faster .
" They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators , ' very quickly ' , " Mr .
Trump said in a Twitter post Friday .
" Now they are saying it will only be 6000 , in late April .

The auto industry has been drafted to help during past national crises .
GM and Ford built trucks and aircraft for allied forces during World War II , part of a broader effort by American industry known as the " Arsenal of Democracy .
" Ford in the 1940s developed an " iron lung " to help polio patients .
There is little overlap between making cars -- a highly automated process involving fast-moving assembly lines and robotic welding machines , which plays out in vast factories , some the size of 100 football fields -- and the labor-intensive job of building ventilators , which are largely hand-built at small workstations .
But car companies are being called on to help because they typically work with thousands of parts suppliers -- many making components similar to those needed for a ventilator -- and are accustomed to manufacturing at a large scale .
At the same time , car makers have been in crisis mode themselves from the new coronavirus .

GM is scrambling to conserve cash , drawing down billions of dollars in credit lines and deferring 20% of pay for nearly 70,000 salaried workers globally .
But it did move forward on the ventilators , after Kenneth Chenault , a former American Express Co .
CEO helping to mobilize executives to fight the coronavirus outbreak , called GM 's CEO Mary Barra and suggested her team talk to Ventec .
GM CEO Mary Barra gave an executive 48 hours to figure out if its supply base could source every part to make ventilators .
Photo : Paul Sancya/Associated Press  An initial flurry of conference calls between GM and Ventec executives revealed the magnitude of the task : the companies envision expanding Ventec 's output more than twentyfold , eventually to more than 10,000 ventilators a month .
But the supply chain could never handle those volumes , the teams concluded , because ventilator suppliers are being flooded with requests to crank up production .
On March 20 , Ms .
Barra talked to Shilpan Amin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GM 's massive parts-purchasing arm .
Barra gave Mr .
Amin 48 hours to figure out if GM 's supply base could source every single part so that GM could set up its own factory to build them .

Amin 's people in Detroit .
Hundreds of GM purchasing managers were assigned to fan out across their suppliers contacts in search of recruits .
Around 10:30 p .
that night , Tracy Skupien , operations director for Detroit car-parts supplier Tompkins Products Inc .
, was at home when an urgent call from her contact at GM interrupted her glass of wine .
He was about to email her detailed blueprints and specifications for 40 metal ventilator parts .
" He needed to know which ones we thought we could start making within a week , " she said .
" I said , ' We 're on it .

By Saturday , inside a large conference room at GM 's engineering hub in suburban Detroit , ventilator parts were spread across tables for inspection .
Dozens of supplier representatives streamed through to get a closer look at the parts .
In between visits , cleaning crews descended on the room to disinfect the widgets and surfaces .
In recent days , workers at an idled GM facility in Kokomo , Ind .
, were ripping out carpet and knocking down walls to install large workstations where hundreds of union-represented factory workers will assemble ventilators .
The employees volunteered for the job even as other car factories remain shut down to prevent the spread of the virus .
" It was my choice to come in and work here , " said Brian Shirley , a millwright helping to install equipment at the factory .
" It 's a great opportunity to help the public .
