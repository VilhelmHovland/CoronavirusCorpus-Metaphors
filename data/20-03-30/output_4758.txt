On Tuesday , NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller urged foreign cruise ships lingering in Australian waters to return to their home ports immediately .
Mr Fuller said nine cruise ships were either docked in NSW or waiting off the coast .
Only three of them are registered to NSW addresses .
" There are thousands of people , potentially , in cruise ships off our coasts that are n't members of our state and if we take them in , then that could well flood our system unnecessarily , " Mr Fuller said on Tuesday .
" All the hard work we 've done could be over .
" We will continue to allow them to have fuel and food .
but it is time to go to your port of origin .
"  In Tasmania , Premier Peter Gutwein again implored people to follow strict social gathering guidelines and stay home .
" Social distancing and abiding by the rules will save your life , it will save your family 's life , it will save lives in our community , " he said .
" This is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that these are going to be tough and difficult times , " Mr Gutwein said on Tuesday .
" Most Tasmanians have put in place the measures that they need to and most are doing what they can in terms of social distancing and importantly in terms of self isolating .
" We 've had unfortunately our second death , there is a message in that for all of us : This virus is deadly .
This virus will kill you .
" Take the necessary steps that you can .
Utilise the rules to your advantage .
Social distancing and abiding by the rules will save your life , it will save your family 's life , it will save lives in our community , " he said , referring to strict two-person gatherings around Australia which came into effect from midnight on Monday .
