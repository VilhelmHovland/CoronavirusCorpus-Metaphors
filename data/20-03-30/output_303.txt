Just before the 2016 election , and then again after its results became clear , I did a series of Atlantic items on a challenge I thought the press was not prepared for .
The challenge was dealing with a major political figure -- Donald Trump -- who fit no previous pattern of how presidents or other major figures conceived of " truth " versus " lies .
"  All politicians , like all people , will lie about matters large and small .
But most politicians , like most people , usually lie for a reason .
They want to avoid blame or embarrassment .
They want someone to like or treat them better .
They want to paint themselves in a better light .
They 've talked themselves into " believing " a more comfortable version of perhaps-painful truths .
We all know examples from daily life .
In the life of public figures , it means things like : Richard Nixon lying about Watergate ( in hopes of not getting caught ) .
Bill Clinton lying about his affairs ( ditto ) .
Lyndon Johnson concealing what he knew about the worsening situation in Vietnam ( so as not to complicate his re-election chances ) .
FDR concealing his physical limitations ( so as not to have them complicate his political and policy goals ) .
So in dealing with the political universe as of the summer of 2015 -- the time when Donald Trump entered the presidential race -- the press could start by asking : What 's the reason a certain statement might be a lie ? What would a president -- a mayor , a senator -- have to gain by shading the truth ? The related assumption was that people would n't go to the trouble of crafting a lie without a reason to do so .
Lies are harder to remember than the truth ; they involve more work in getting people to back up your story ; they involve the risk that you 'll be caught .
What made Donald Trump different was not how much more frequently he lies -- though he does so at a prodigious rate .
( As Daniel Dale and the Washington Post'sfact-check team , among others , have tirelessly chronicled .
)  Rather the difference was that Trump so plainly recognized no distinction between true and false -- between what the " facts " showed and what he wanted them to be , between what he wanted people to think and what they could see for themselves .
Some public figures are unusually " willing " to lie ; Trump seemed not even to notice he was doing so .
The philosopher Harry Frankfurt 's famous book " On Bullshit " bears on this phenomenon -- people who just talk , in a slurry of " true " and " false , " with no concern or even awareness of the difference between the two .
Larger-than-life-sized oil painting of Trump at Mar-a-Lago , as I saw it when attending a foreign-policy conference there a dozen years ago .
( James Fallows )  In Trump 's case it became clear long ago that he lacked the mental filter that alerts most people to the boundary between true and false .
He would probably sail through any lie-detector test .
He does not care if his claim can be instantly disproved ( eg , his " landslide " victory , actually one of the narrowest in history ) .
He does not care if his lies contradict one another , as when he attributes the same " someone told me " story to different sources from one day to the next , or rolls out his ludicrous " Sir " anecdotes .
He does not care if a lie does him any good -- who believes , or cares , whether his uncle was " a great super genius " as a professor at MIT ? He does not care that the Adonis-like heroic portrait that has hung for years at Mar-a-Lago would be a source of mirth for most viewers .
" The news media are not built for someone like this , " I wrote two months before Trump was sworn in :  We have as president-elect a man whose nature as a liar is outside what our institutions are designed to deal with .
Donald Trump either can not tell the difference between truth and lies , or he knows the difference but does not care .
Our journalistic and political assumption is that each side to a debate will " try " to tell the truth -- and will count it as a setback if they 're caught making things up .
Until now the idea has been that if you can show a contrast between words and actions , claim and reality , it may not bring the politician down , but it will hurt .
For instance : Bill Clinton survived " I did not have sexual relations with that woman , " but he was damaged then , and lastingly , when the truth came out .
Knowledge of the risks of being caught has encouraged most politicians to minimize provable lies .
None of this works with Donald Trump .
He does n't care , and at least so far the institutional GOP has n't either .
1 ) Call out lies as lies , not " controversies .
" In covering Trump 's latest illegal-voting outburst that " millions of people " had snuck into the polling places and voted , presumably for Democrats , TheWashington Post and TheLA Times took the lead in clearly labeling the claim as false , rather than " controversial " or " unsubstantiated .
By contrast .
the NYT takes a more " objective " tone -- there 's " no evidence " for Trump 's claim , much as there was " no evidence " for his assertion that Ted Cruz 's dad played a part in the JFK assassination .
What 's the difference ? The NYT said that the claim had " no evidence .
" The Post said it was false .
The Times 's is more conventional -- but it is also " normalizing " in suggesting that Trump actually cared whether there was evidence for what he said .
I think the Post 's is closer to calling things what they are .
It 's nearly three-and-a-half years later .
Everything we saw about Trump on the campaign trail we have seen from him in the White House , including the limitless fantasy-lying .
I submit that these three-and-a-half years later , much of the press has still not rebuilt itself , to cope with a time or a person like this .
Or with a political party like the subservient Trump-era GOP .
To choose only a small subset of examples , from only the past three days ' worth of history , here are some illustrations .
These are words and deeds that , each on its own , would likely have been major black-mark news events in other eras .
Now they are just part of the daily onrush .
1 ) Us , and them .
Two days ago , on March 27 , Donald Trump signed in the Oval Office the most expensive spending bill in American history .
Getting it enacted required sustained , major efforts from Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic speaker of the House , and from Chuck Schumer , the Senate minority leader , who got every one of his fellow Democrats to vote for the bill .
After Lyndon Johnson relied on Republican support to get his civil-rights and Medicare legislation through the Congress , he made sure that the Republican leaders from the House and Senate were with him for the signing ceremonies , to receive some of the first pens he used .
( When Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in the Oval Office , he had only Democratic legislators around him -- but that was because of near-unanimous Republican opposition to the bill .
)  Structurally Trump 's situation this week was like LBJ 's : he was signing a bill the other party had played a crucial role in passing .
But when Trump signed the bill yesterday , not a single Democratic legislator was present .
Pelosi said she had not been invited .
Every other president has tried , at some point , to expand his support beyond those who originally voted for him ( which is why all others have at some point had popularity ratings of 60 percent or 70 percent ) .
Every other one has at some point tried to express the interests of the entire public , not just " the base .
" Trump has never done either -- and that failure is so baked-in that it barely registers now .
Obama used precious months in his first year trying to get GOP support for his medical plan ; he failed ; and a running press critique thereafter was that he should have been doing more to " reach out " to the other side .
( Recall the whole " Have a drink with Mitch McConnell " motif .
) I have n't seen any columns fretting about Trump 's failure to " reach out " to Pelosi or Schumer .
" That 's just Trump .
"  2 ) " If they do n't treat you right , I do n't call .
" In this past Friday 's version of his marathon TV sessions -- the supposed " health " briefings that have become daily hour-long substitutes for Trump 's campaign rallies -- Trump said that most of the governors now requesting federal aid were friendly to him .
But not all , and the ones who were n't " appreciative " had better watch their step .
You say the governors are not appreciate of what the federal government has done .
What more --  " A : breaking in : I think the governor of Washington Jay Inslee is a failed presidential candidate .
He leveled out at zero in the polls .
He 's constantly tripping and -- I guess ' complaining ' would be a nice way of saying it .
In Michigan , all she does is -- she has no idea what 's going on .
All she does is saying whining voice ' Oh , it 's the federal government 's fault .
'  " I want them to be appreciative .
We 've done a great job .
" Mike Pence , I do n't think he sleeps any more .
He calls all the governors .
I tell him -- I 'm a different kind of guy -- I tell him , Do n't call the governor of Washington .
You 're wasting your time with him .
" Do n't call the woman in Michigan .
" You know what I say , If they do n't treat you right , I do n't call .
"  What would have made news about this passage in any other era ?  First , the naked favor-trading : What Trump is saying about the states of Washington and Michigan is more or less what led the House to impeach him last year , regarding Ukraine .
That is : threatened use of federal power and favors , to reward political friends and punish political enemies -- and in this case for unconcealed , openly stated political reasons .
Second , the crassness and cruelty , to leaders coping with life-and-death emergencies in their home states .
" A failed presidential candidate .
" " She has no idea what 's doing on .
"  Third , the misogyny : Repeatedly avoiding the name of Gretchen Whitmer , elected last year as governor of Michigan , and calling her " the woman in Michigan .
" Check the C-SPAN video if you 're in doubt about the dismissive tone of these remarks , and recall Trump 's frequent references to " Crooked Hillary " and " Crazy Nancy Pelosi .
"  There was some brief press followup on all these points , but mainly it was again normalized as Trump being Trump .
3 ) Lies , lies , lies .
I 'll leave to the other chroniclers a complete list of the several dozen lies in Trump 's live-broadcast appearances in the past few days .
On Thursday , he went on at length about the bounty of tariff payments that the U .
was receiving " from China " -- which revealed either a black-is-white misunderstanding of how tariffs work , or a Harry Frankfurt-style indifference to the bullshit of what he was saying .
( None of the White House reporters challenged him about his tariff claim .
)  Here is just one consequential lie to stand for the rest : Trump repeatedly claims , and has done so every day this past week , that no one possibly could have seen this pandemic coming , and that everything was great until just a few weeks ago .
Of the countless reasons to know this is false , consider this Politico story on the detailed , 69-page playbook the National Security Council had prepared for coping with just this kind of emergency .
The exact timing , origin , and biology of this new disease of course came as surprises .
But the consequences and choices are ones any competent government would have foreseen .
Just a month before the 9/11 attacks , in which more than 3,000 people were killed , George W .
Bush received a memo famously titled , " Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U .
" Many years later , press analyses still pointed this out .
For years after the attack on a U .
consulate in Benghazi , in which four Americans died , congressional Republicans held several dozen hearings , to determine whether the Obama administration should have been more prepared .
In the past few days ' papers , I see no followup on this NSC report .
Press standards for covering Trump have already factored in , and thus implicitly forgiven , the corruption and incompetence .
4 ) Repeating the mistakes of 2015 .
Starting in the summer of 2015 , cable channels began running live Trump rallies , because they were so " interesting .
" People watched .
Ratings went up .
And by Election Day , Trump had received billions of dollars ' worth of free airtime .
One calculation of the value was $5 billion ; another , $2 billion .
In either case , a lot .
Without this coverage -- this decision by TV outlets , to improve their ratings by giving limitless free , live airtime to Trump -- he could never have become the Republican nominee , let alone the president .
Trump himself clearly views the " briefings " about the " virus " -- really , rallies about his greatness -- as this year 's substitute for the live rallies he can no longer hold .
But the cable and broadcast outlets , as if 2015 and 2016 had never occurred , are covering his daily briefings as they did the rallies of days gone by .
For more on why this is a mistake , please see this suggestion from Jay Rosen of PressThink , about how the media could shift to " emergency setting " , and this from the Washington Post 's Erik Wemple on the problem of nonstop live coverage of Trump telling lies .
The media were not built for someone like this .
That someone has not changed .
The media must change .
In the second of his two extended live-TV performances yesterday -- a White House coronavirus update , following a Fox News " virtual town hall " -- Donald Trump said that prospects in the effort to control the virus were improving .
As you can see starting at time 2:30 of this C-Span video , he said :  I 'm very proud to be your president , I can tell you that .
There 's tremendous hope as we look forward and see light at the end of the tunnel .
Most of today 's living Americans were born in 1980 or afterward .
( The median age in the U .
is now just over 38 .
) Most of them would not instantly recognize the phrase " light at the end of the tunnel , "  But Donald Trump was born in 1946 , and he would know this phrase .
During his teenaged years and his early 20s , when hundreds of thousands of his contemporaries were being drafted for service in Vietnam , and when more than 50,000 of them were killed , those words were among the most infamous parts of the American lexicon .
Like " it became necessary to destroy the town , in order to save it " -- a possibly apocryphal phrase attributed to a U .
military officer , about the scorched-earth policy -- " light at the end of the tunnel " came to symbolize the sustained folly of the war in general , and the illusion that success was near at hand .
The closest post-Vietnam examples would probably be early proclamations about the Iraq war : Dick Cheney 's pre-war assurance that " we will , in fact , be greeted as liberators , " and George W .
Bush 's triumphal appearance under a " Mission Accomplished " banner shortly after the fall of Baghdad .
Or , early in the disaster of Hurricane Katrina , " Brownie , you 're doing a heck of a job .
" Among pre-Vietnam examples , a counterpart might be Neville Chamberlain in 1938 , shaking hands with Adolf Hitler in Munich , and then returning home to declare that they had ensured " peace for our time .
"  Gen .
William C .
Westmoreland and a lawyer for CBS argued yesterday over one of the most memorable phrases of the Vietnam War , with the lawyer suggesting that the general had misled Washington into believing there was " light at the end of tunnel " in 1967 and the general saying he had not used that expression .
" I never had quite that degree of optimism , " General Westmoreland told the jury at his libel trial against CBS in Federal Court in Manhattan .
But the lawyer , David Boies , showed the witness a Nov .
26 , 1967 , cable he had sent during a visit to Washington to his deputy in Saigon , Gen .
Creighton W .
Abrams , in which the phrase " some light at the end of the tunnel " was bracketed in quotation marks .
People of my parents ' generation would hesitate or catch themselves before " peace for our time .
" News-conscious people of my children 's generation would recognize the freight that comes with saying " mission accomplished " or " heck of a job "  And people of Trump 's generation , and mine , would recognize that " light at the end of the tunnel " is not what you would say if you wanted to convey genuine confidence , any more than you would say , " I am not a crook " if you wanted to convey genuine innocence .
You can not have been alive in that time and not have absorbed this phrase .
The typically young members of a White House speechwriting staff -- the people who worked on the script from which Trump read yesterday -- would not know this phrase from their own experience .
But in normal White Houses , they would have looked these things up .
( When I worked , in my 20s , on a White House speechwriting staff , our " spare time " reading was from the volumes of past presidential addresses .
)  But Trump himself would have to have been familiar with this phrase .
So yesterday , as he saw the note cards , did he see the phrase -- and not remember it ? Did he remember , and not care ? I do n't know , and it does n't make a difference in his response to the current pandemic .
But it is one more illustration of things we have heard and seen , which we would never have seen before .
Two other for-the-record elements from Trump 's public performances yesterday .
With several of his scientific experts behind him , explained how much worse the 1918 flu pandemic was :  " That was a flu where if you got it , you had a 50/50 chance , or very close , of dying .
"  In fact , the mortality rate during that devastating worldwide illness was between 2 and 3 percent -- not around 50 percent , as Trump claimed .
Most of the experts around Trump knew better ; none of them said anything .
I ca n't quickly think of a case of another president making such a wildly inaccurate basic-fact claim , without a quick " For the record , the president meant to say .
" cleanup .
Three times yesterday , Trump said that his goal for " opening up the country " again was Easter Day .
During his Fox town hall : " I would love to have it open by Easter .
I will tell you that right now .
I would love to have that .
It 's such an important day for other reasons .
I 'll make it an important day for this too I would love to have the country opened up an rarin ' to go by Easter .
"  After the town hall , he said : " Easter 's a very special day for me .
And I see it in that timeline I am thinking about .
And I say , Would n't it be great to have all of the churches full .
"  And when answering press questions about " why Easter ? " later in the day : " It 's a beautiful day , a beautiful timeline .
"  This year 's Easter Day is April 12 , or 19 days after Trump 's announcement .
As of yesterday afternoon , while Trump was talking about the Easter " timeline , " the official confirmed-case count for the United States was nearing 47,000 , and the death toll was in the low 600s .
I 'll note in this space where the numbers stand 19 days from now .
Being president is even harder than it looks .
Success in the job requires a wider range of talents than any one human being has ever had : Private persuasive and horse-trading skills .
Public ability to inspire .
The analytical capacity to grasp decisions that lack any " good " answer .
The emotional capacity to read the moods and needs of the country , as those change .
Physical stamina .
Psychological balance .
A ruthless ability to judge character , especially among allies and staff members .
A similarly steely ability to block out bitter and hurtful criticism -- otherwise , you could n't function -- without becoming deaf to warnings of genuine problems .
And that 's just the start of the list .
As I noted in a piece about Barack Obama as he neared the end of his first term , these demands of office are so many , so different , and so complex that the question is not whether a given president will fail in office .
All of them will fall short in some parts of the job .
The relevant question is whether the areas of each president 's inevitable failures will matter more , or less , than those of his success .
John Dickerson went into the ramifications of " The Hardest Job in the World " in a big Atlantic story two years ago .
( Update : Dickerson did an eloquent brief segment on the requirements of presidential leadership-in-crisis , on Face the Nation yesterday .
)  Because this job is impossible , people who hold it go through a predictable change of attitude toward their living predecessors .
On arrival , new presidents usually think : Look at me ! I 've won the biggest prize in public life .
I do n't know why these other guys messed things up so badly .
Let me show them how it 's done !  The years go on ; the problems mount ; Congress is a headache ; the public ca n't be pleased .
Predictably , presidents develop " strange new respect " for the only other human beings who understand what they are going through .
Usually when running for the office , presidential candidates criticize those who came before -- directly , if mounting a challenge , or indirectly , in suggesting how much better things will be under new management .
But after a president has been roughed up for a while , he 's more careful in his criticism .
( Really , it 's hard to find on-the-record examples of many of the first 44 presidents criticizing their predecessors .
) Sometimes in public , more often in private , presidents go to those who have left office to ask : What do you think ? Or : Can you help us out ?  This reality was the premise of a question an hour into Donald Trump 's very long press appearance yesterday afternoon .
In the exchange -- which you can see starting at time 59:00 of this video -- a reporter asked Trump :  In previous crises like the tsunami , and Katrina , past presidents have called their predecessors and said , Hey I need you to step in , and do something like that .
Do you have any interest in reaching out to presidents Bush , Clinton , Obama , Carter --  Before he finished the question , Trump was talking over him to challenge the premise .
Trump answered :  Look .
I have the best people in the world .
I think we 're doing an extraordinary job .
If you look at the H1N1 under Obama , if you look at that whole -- that was a disaster , that was a tough period of time for our country .
You look at so many other things that were n't handled very well , whether it 's Katrina under GW Bush or something else .
Look , I respect everybody .
But I feel I have an incredible team and I think we 're doing an incredible job .
What this reveals about Donald Trump 's self-regard and Dunning-Krugerism is too obvious to need elaboration .
Also his intolerance for even imagined criticism , and his instinct to respond with an attack .
In this case , the question invited him to step into the long tradition of presidents facing crisis .
Instead he used it not only to elevate himself but also to diminish the others .
( " So many things that were n't handled very well .
" ) Others presidents likely thought such things to themselves , especially early in a term .
But they would not have said them -- on nationwide TV , during a crisis , when supposedly trying to inspire , unite , and heal .
Two other remarkable events of the day :  When told by a questioner that Mitt Romney had isolated himself ( presumably after meetings with his Senate colleague Rand Paul , who yesterday tested positive for the disease ) , Trump acted surprised .
" Romney 's in isolation ? " he asked .
When told it was true , he said , with obvious sarcasm , " Gee , that 's too bad .
" ( You can judge the tone for yourself , starting at time 43:40 of this clip .
)  Again , many public leaders might have thought this of their rivals .
No others would have said it out loud .
I mentioned earlier the extraordinary position of Anthony Fauci , during the pandemic .
He has a lifetime 's worth of credibility behind his words and advice .
But he is being made to stand almost every day , on live TV , behind a president saying things that Fauci then needs--tactfully -- to correct .
The Atlantic 's Peter Nicholas had an interview with Fauci yesterday morning , in which he said that the administration had not pressured him to be more visibly supportive -- " I 'm not sure why .
" Later in the day , Jon Cohen of Sciencepublished an interview unlike any I have read from a figure who was still serving within Trump 's orbit .
A sample :  Q : You 're standing there saying nobody should gather with more than 10 people and there are almost 10 people with you on the stage .
A : I know that .
I 'm trying my best .
I can not do the impossible .
Q : What about the travel restrictions ? .
It just does n't comport with facts .
A : I know , but what do you want me to do ? I mean , seriously Jon , let 's get real , what do you want me to do ?  What I want , as of today , March 23 , is for him to stay there , as long as he can .
These things were notable about yesterday 's installment of what has become the regular daily White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic :  That it happened at all .
Early last year , Donald Trump directed Sarah Huckabee Sanders , then his press secretary , to stop conducting daily press briefings , which had been routine for press secretaries for decades .
Sanders held her last briefing a little more than a year ago .
Her successor , Stephanie Grisham , has not held any at all .
Until this month , Trump himself had appeared at very few formal press conferences .
The last one I find a record of was in September , 2018 .
Instead Trump would talk at informal press scrums , usually while walking to or from a helicopter .
Now Trump is on TV , answering questions , day after day , including the weekends .
This brings us to .
That it was a virtual campaign rally , At two of the briefings this week , Trump had dropped his previous pooh-poohing of the virus threat , and his personal criticism of media figures and other politicians , and had instead struck a somber , " we 're in this together " tone .
As I noted here , this shift in tone was greeted by some in the press as a sign of Trump 's new statesmanship .
In the past two days , Trump has been back to the more accustomed tone of tweets and his rallies .
In those settings he has had two constant themes : that he is so great , and that his critics are such cheating losers , each point usually based on information that was false .
The tone , and the false data , returned yesterday .
Much of what Trump said was false : Most dramatically , his claim that the FDA had just approved use of an anti-malaria drug for treatment of COVID-19 , and that it would be a " game-changer .
" ( FDA officials immediately clarified that they had done no such thing .
)  Trump 's new fondness for these " briefings , " and their increasing conversion into Trump campaign rallies with scientists rather than local-government officials as the supporting cast , should cause cable-news producers to reflect on the path they are headed down .
In the year after Trump declared his candidacy in the summer of 2015 , cable channels ran so many of his " Lock her up ! " rallies live and at full length , that the coverage amounted to hugely valuable free campaign publicity .
One source calculated the free-airtime values as being worth several billion dollars .
From Trump 's point of view , it makes sense to turn these events into the unfiltered airtime he used to count on at mass rallies .
From the media 's point of view , it made sense to cover the first few of them live .
But given the rising falsehood quotient in what Trump says , and his determination to cut off or divert questioners who try to ask about these falsehoods , cable networks should stop airing these as live spectacles and instead report , afterwards , with clips of things Trump and others said , and whether they were true .
Their real reason for live coverage back during Trump 's rise was that ratings went up : People wanted to watch these spectacles .
Even if that 's still true , we certainly have learned that Trump will use most of his time to attack and lie , and that panelists ' corrections never catch up .
In time of crisis , cable-news channels are making the public less informed , and thus increasing public danger , by providing such a convenient platform for lies .
Also , as a practical matter , if the briefings were no longer covered live , Trump would lose interest in attending himself .
Then the scientists could come back on stage -- and eventually they could be covered live again .
That Trump edited the script .
As Jabin Botsford , a Washington Post photographer noted , Trump scratched out the word " corona " in his speaking script , and replaced it with " Chinese , " so that he would talk about the threat of " the Chinese virus .
" When he read most of the rest of the prepared text , Trump sounded as if he were seeing it for the first time .
This was a word he cared about .
That he ended with .
this question .
I lack the spirit to go into all of this now .
You can read the story here and here .
Again , nothing like it had ever happened at the White House before .
Update : As I write I see that Jay Rosen , at his Press Think blog , has come to the same conclusion about live event coverage .
His item covers many other steps in what he calls " emergency mode " handling of Trump , but on live events he says :  Switching to emergency mode means our coverage will look different and work in a different way , as we try to prevent the President from misinforming you through us .
We will not cover live any speech , rally , or press conference involving the president .
The risk of passing along bad information is too great .
Instead , we will attend carefully to what he says .
If we can independently verify any important news he announces we will bring that to you -- after the verification step .
I agree with that , and with Rosen 's conclusion , addressed to readers :  We feel we can not keep telling wild and " newsy " stories about the unreliable narrator who somehow became president .
Not with millions of lives at stake .
We have to exit from that system to keep faith with you , and with the reason we became journalists in the first place  This afternoon , at the now-daily press presentation about the virus and disease , Trump was asked why he used this term -- given the bitter public and governmental response it has evoked in China , and recent reports of racist anti-Chinese reactions inside the United States .
( For instance , the starting entry of a widely shared Twitter thread yesterday from Jiayang Fan , a writer for the New Yorker , is below .
)  At today 's conference , Cecilia Vega , of ABC , mentioned the possibility of racist backlash to " Chinese Virus .
" She directly asked Trump , " Why do you keep using this ? " ( You can see the exchange starting at time 1:44 of this video .
)  Trump snapped back with what amounted to two points : First , that he was just calling things by their real name , and second , that he was getting back at China for suggestions that the U .
was really to blame .
Why keep using the term ?  Because it comes from China .
That 's why .
It 's not racist at all .
I want to be accurate .
I have great love for all of the people from our country .
sic But as you know , China tried to say , that it was caused by American soldiers .
That ca n't happen .
It 's not going to happen .
As long as I 'm president .
My purpose for the moment is not to review the full history of pejorative names for diseases -- for instance , why syphilis was called " the French disease " by 16th-century Italians , to which the French responded by calling it " the Neapolitan disease .
" Nor about the acute sensitivity in China to being seen as a source of filth and disease -- something that would be an insult anywhere , but which in China comes with a distinct historical background that makes it particularly inflammatory .
( Rough parallel : Think of any familiar defamatory stereotype used against Africans , or Latin Americans , or Jews , or any other group .
Then think of a U .
president using that in tweets and statements .
) Nor about the point my colleague Graeme Wood astutely makes : that the real scandal is what the administration does ( and fails to do ) , more than what it says .
Nor the likelihood that the animal-human transfer that gave rise to this pandemic probably occurred in wild-animal markets in China .
( Evidence suggests that the transfer that gave rise to the H1N1 " Swine Flu " epidemic a dozen years ago took place somewhere in North America , but the disease was not generally known as " the American Flu " or " the Mexican disease .
" )  Rather it is to note this moment in the United States 's relationship with its most consequential foreign partner-and-competitor .
While the combined public-health and economic catastrophes of the moment are commanding attention , the China-U .
interaction may have moved in a distinctly darker direction .
Neither the United States nor China is big and dominant enough to force the other country -- also big , also dominant -- to do something its leadership or public genuinely does not want to do .
But both the United States and China play a large enough role in the other 's economic , strategic , environmental , cultural , and overall situation that each can make life significantly better , or worse for the other -- not to mention effects on the rest of the world .
The story of the past nearly five decades , starting in the Nixon-Mao era , is of U .
and Chinese public and private leaders generally looking for ways to work together as wary partners , more frequently than they looked for ways to confront each other as outright foes .
( I described this dynamic in an Atlantic article , " China 's Great Leap Backward , " four years ago .
) And the story of the past five years , as I described in that same article , is of sharper and sharper differences between the countries .
That was even before the trade-war confrontations of the past three years .
Now the leadership of each country is acting , in public , as if it has nothing to lose by insulting and provoking the other .
Witness the accusations from Chinese officials that the U .
may have intentionally engineered the virus and unleashed it on an unsuspecting Chinese public , or the public use of " Chinese Virus " by a president , in full awareness that it is a flash point on the other side , and the reported private use of " Kung-Flu " by a White House staffer .
Yesterday the Chinese government took a step that even the most grizzled China hands found shocking : It revoked the press credentials for U .
reporters from the three leading U .
newspapers -- the Washington Post , the New York Times , and the Wall Street Journal -- and began the process of expelling them from the country .
During the long ups and downs of U .
relations -- with the lows of Tiananmen Square in 1989 , the U .
bombing of a Chinese embassy in 1999 , the Chinese military jet that ran into a U .
Navy surveillance plane in 2001 , the recurring trade disputes , plus the assorted highs -- Chinese officials had never taken this step before .
As with most things in China , the logic of this move is probably mostly internal , as part of the ongoing years-long domestic crackdown underway in the time of Xi Jinping .
( Alex Dukalskis of The Wilson Center and University College Dublin laid out internal-Chinese dynamics in a tweet thread today .
) But it is a very significant escalation of the U .
showdown -- and one that , as best I can tell , went unmentioned by the U .
president yesterday , and today until the press-questioning part of his presentation today .
Late in the press conference , a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the Chinese move , and " what is your message to the Chinese about transparency .
" ( You can see it starting at time 2:08 here .
)  " I 'm not happy to see it , " Trump said , as if he were talking about the latest fall in the stock market , or problems for the cruise industry .
Then :  I have my disputes with all three of those media groups .
I think you know that very well .
But I do n't like seeing that at all .
I 'm not happy about it at all .
And then he moved on .
Just looking at the words , you might imagine it was a Voltaire-like " disagree with what you say , but will defend to the death your right to say it .
" But if you watch you 'll see that it came across as a minor issue -- an occasion for registering his unhappiness with these same three papers , and to shift to something more interesting .
I hope that this most consequential relationship for the U .
will not be another casualty of the pestilence .
But as I write , on March 18 , it appears to have taken an under-publicized turn for the worse .
During press questioning at the White House today , Donald Trump was asked whether his tone about the coronavirus challenge had suddenly changed .
For weeks , he 'd been mocking the virus threat -- at rallies , in tweets , and in press remarks .
But both yesterday and today , he 'd suddenly shifted to warning that the public-health and economic problems were real , and would remain so for a long time .
What changed ?  Trump denied there had been any shift in tone , and said ( as you can see here ) :  " I have always known .
This is a real pandemic .
I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic .
" I 've always viewed it as very serious .
"  This is a flat-out lie .
Setting the lead for many Republican politicians and for most coverage on Fox News , Trump had for many weeks pooh-poohed the idea that the virus should be taken seriously .
He has said it was " contained " and " under control " ( as McKay Coppins pointed out ) .
He has said " It 's going to disappear " and , " We have very little problem in this country " ( as David Leonhardt pointed out ) .
He said three weeks ago that the U .
had " 15 people , and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero , that 's a pretty good job we 've done .
" ( as the White House briefing transcript shows ) .
He tweeted just eight days ago that " The Fake News Media and their partner , the Democrat Party , is doing everything within its semi-considerable power ( it used to be greater ! ) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation " ( as The Hillpointed out ) .
From Twitter .
From growing global awareness of the disease in January , until his press conference yesterday , March 16 , Trump had consistently minimized the medical and economic danger .
He frequently likened the virus to the seasonal flu , and at a rally said that criticism of his administration 's virus responses was " a hoax " -- indeed , a continuation of the impeachment " hoax " by other means .
That Trump has shifted his tone so dramatically says something about the scale of the disease and its impacts .
I hope it says something positive about the upcoming federal commitments to join the effort against it , so far led by governors and mayors .
But that he believes he can baldly zap away all memory of his words and deeds and reinvent himself as the man saving his country from pandemic -- another Anthony Fauci , but with executive powers -- reveals something about Trump 's mind and character , and something about his assessment of public life .
About his mind it suggests : He lives in the moment , and whatever he wants to be true at this instant , is " true " for him , at least while he 's saying it .
About his assessment of others it indicates : He is betting he can get away with it .
At some level he must know that half the press is weary of writing the 900th story pointing out his falsehoods .
The other half is hungry for some way to show its " balance , " and to avoid using the plain word " lie .
" And meanwhile the constituency Trump said would stay with him if he " shot someone on Fifth Avenue " may still be aboard .
An assessment on CNN just after the press conference indicated the kind of response Trump might be betting on .
The estimable Dana Bash said of Trump 's comments , " He is being the kind of leader that people need , at least in tone , today and yesterday .
" We 'll see what the online stories tonight and the print headlines tomorrow morning say about Trump 's shift .
Will " today and yesterday " -- the subdued tone yesterday , the " I have always viewed it as very serious " Orwellian big-lie today -- enter public consciousness as the time when Trump " got serious " and " became a leader " ? Or as the time when he finally went too far with a blatant lie ?  As I write this , in real time , we ca n't be sure .
I have my own guess , which I hope proves wrong .
This afternoon , on the heels of a widely panned formal Oval Office address , Donald Trump assembled a group of scientific and corporate leaders to talk about dealing with the coronavirus .
You can watch the whole thing on the White House YouTube channel .
I suspect that we 'll see one line from this conference played frequently in the months ahead .
You can watch it starting at around 1:22:00 , when reporter Kristen Welker of NBC asks Trump whether he takes responsibility for the lag in making test kits available .
Trump 's reply :  No .
I do n't take responsibility at all .
Narrowly parsed , and in full context , Trump was referring only to the test kits -- and was continuing his ( fantasized ) complaint that rules left over from 2016 , under the Obama administration , are the real reason the U .
has been so slow to respond to this pandemic .
But filmable moments in politics are not always taken in full context , and at their most narrowly parsed logical reading :  All of these -- in full context , and most-sympathetically read -- had a meaning you could understand and perhaps defend .
None of that context or meaning survived , as those went from being phrases to weaponized symbols .
Will that happen to " I do n't take responsibility at all " ? We will soon see .
Other stage business points :  A series of CEOs came to the microphone to describe what their companies were doing to speed testing or help out in other ways .
Trump caught the first three or four of them unawares , by shaking their hands as they moved away from the lectern .
All seemed startled , as you can see in the video .
Then the other CEOs began to catch on , and a following group of them scuttled away from the microphone before Trump could grab them for a handshake , or held their own hands clenched together , in a protective prayer-style grasp .
Finally , ( at 1:06 in the video ) you can see Bruce Greenstein , of the LHC group , surprise Trump with an elbow-bump rather than a hand shake .
Trump himself seemed completely oblivious to the idea of social distancing .
It was also notable that one speaker after another touched and moved around the same microphone , and put his her hands on the sides of the same lectern .
I mentioned earlier today the uneasy and evolving position of Anthony Fauci , who has been the " voice of science " through this episode as he has during previous medical emergencies .
The uneasiness lies in the tension between his decades as a respected scientist , and his current role as a prominent member of Team Trump .
Can he retain his long reputation as a straight shooter ? While maintaining any influence with Trump ?  Make what you will of his body language through the events today .
( He is at far left in the picture below .
)  White House  Also today , I mentioned the inevitable-for-Trump , though **38;2020;TOOLONG , ritual of Trump subordinates limitlessly praising the goodness and wisdom of their leader .
It was striking to see all the CEOs skipping right past that formality .
But if you felt a phantom-limb twinge in the absence of these comments , all you had to do was wait for Mike Pence .
You can hear him starting at around 1:07 , with comments that began " This day should be an inspiration to every American " and built in earnestness from there .
There was much more from the question-and-answer session , but I do n't want to spoil the experience of discovery for anyone who has not seen it yet .
As of today , March 13 , 2020 -- three-plus years into the current administration , three months into public awareness of the coronavirus spread , seven-plus months until before the next election -- Anthony Fauci is playing a role in which no previous Trump-era figure has survived .
One other person has been in the spot Fauci now occupies .
That is , of course , James Mattis , the retired four-star Marine Corps general and former secretary of defense for Trump .
Former is the key word here , and the question is whether the change in circumstances between Mattis 's time and Fauci 's -- the public nature of this emergency , the greater proximity of upcoming elections , the apparent verdict from financial markets and both international and domestic leaders that Donald Trump is in deep over his head -- will give Fauci the greater leverage he needs , not just to stay at work but also to steer policy away from the abyss .
Why is Anthony Fauci now , even more than James Mattis before him , in a different position from any other publicly visible associate of Trump 's ?  Pre-Trump credibility , connections , and respect .
Fauci has been head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , at the National Institutes of Health , since Ronald Reagan 's first term , in 1984 .
( How can he have held the post so long ? Although nothing in his look or bearing would suggest it , Fauci is older than either Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden .
He recently turned 79 .
)  Through his long tenure at NIH , which spanned the early days of the HIV/AIDS devastation and later experience with the SARS and H1N1 epidemics , Fauci has become a very familiar " public face of science , " explaining at congressional hearings and in TV and radio interviews how Americans should think about the latest threat .
He has managed to stay apart from any era 's partisan-political death struggles .
He has received a raft of scientific and civic honors , from the Lasker Award for health leadership , to the Presidential Medal of Freedom , awarded by George W .
Bush .
Thus , in contrast to virtually all the other figures with whom Trump has surrounded himself , Fauci is by any objective standard the best person for the job -- and is universally seen as such .
This distinguishes him from people Trump has favored in his own coterie , from longtime consigliere Michael Cohen to longtime ally Roger Stone to longtime personal physician Harold Bornstein ; and from past and present members of his White House staff , like the departed Michael Flynn and the returned Hope Hicks and the sempiternal Jared Kushner ; and fish-out-of-water Cabinet appointees , like ( to pick one ) the neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development .
Put another way : Very plainly , Trump needs Fauci more than Fauci needs Trump .
This is not a position Donald Trump has ever felt comfortable in -- witness the denouement with Mattis .
The ability not to abase himself before Trump .
The first Cabinet meeting Donald Trump held , nearly three years ago , was unlike any other conducted in U .
history , and very much like subsequent public appearance of Trump in company with his appointees .
In that meeting , on June 12 , 2017 , as TV cameras were rolling , Trump went around the table and one-by-one had his appointees gush about how kind , wise , and far-sighted he was -- failing only to compliment him on his humility .
( Tina Nguyen described the meeting at the time in Vanity Fair .
) After praising himself , Trump called on others to praise him , starting with the reliable Mike Pence .
" It is the greatest privilege of my life to serve as the vice president to a president who is keeping his word to the American people , " Pence began .
All the others followed his example -- with the prominent exception of Mattis .
He spent his " praise " time instead complimenting the men and women in uniform he led .
No public event like that Cabinet meeting had happened before in the United States , simply because no other president has been as needy for in-public adulation as Trump is .
Of course most politicians and all presidents are needy ; you could not run for the presidency if you had a normal temperament .
( Background reading on this point , while you 're " socially isolating " : Robert Penn Warren 's All the King 's Men .
) Every political leader eats up the praise in private -- " Wonderful job today , Mr .
President -- you were really connecting ! " , not to mention Veep -- but all the rest of them have been savvy enough to know how tacky this looks in public .
The modern **31;2060;TOOLONG might have been Lyndon Johnson , with enough of the Sun King in his makeup to enjoy having people humble themselves before him .
But holding a public adulation-fest ? If George W .
Bush had heard , say , Karl Rove start in that way , he would likely have said , " OK , Turd Blossom , what are you angling for ? " Barack Obama -- or John F .
Kennedy , or Jimmy Carter -- would have arched an eyebrow as if to ask , " Hey , did you think you were still playing in the minors ? "  But what we saw in that Cabinet meeting , we have seen again and again from those around Trump .
The most humiliating recent examples come from the people in charge of the coronavirus response : Pence again ; Alex Azar , head of Health and Human Services ; Robert Redfield , head of the Centers for Disease Control ; and Seema Verma , in charge of Medicare and Medicaid .
The beginnings and endings of their public statements , and the answers to many questions , are larded with praise for Trump and his " decisive and visionary action .
" ( For the latest example , see Verma under questioning from Martha MacCallum of Fox News .
Verma repeatedly dodges MacCallum 's direct question about whether hospitals have enough ventilators and other supplies ( as Fred Barbash laid out in the Washington Post .
MacCallum makes one last try -- and Verma seeks refuge in saying , " And that 's why the president has taken such a bold and decisive action .
" That claim made no logical sense to MacCallum or the listeners , but it reflected the inescapable logic of what is expected from members of the Court of Trump .
)  There is one exception : Anthony Fauci .
He has occasionally said that he agrees with aspects of the administration 's or the president 's policies , but he has avoided the ritual self-abnegation .
Of course Fauci held his job long before Trump came to town , and is not part of the normal round of high-level appointments each new administration makes .
( To the best of my knowledge , though , directors of NIH institutes , like Fauci , serve " at the pleasure of the president " and so could be removed .
If I 'm wrong on that , will update .
Update : Several NIH veterans have written in to say that Fauci 's position is officially different from that of the NIH director , and is not directly a presidential-political appointment .
Recent history teaches that a vindictive president can make things difficult even for career civil servants .
But I am grateful for the clarification .
)  But Fauci 's polite but consistent reluctance to grovel can not have gone unnoticed by the audience-of-one for all the other appointees : Trump himself .
Daring to contradict Trump , in public .
This is a step beyond anything Mattis attempted .
Through the first two years of the administration , background-sourced stories and reports based on " those in a position to know the Secretary 's thinking " laid out the increasing distance between Mattis 's view of American interests and what Trump was saying and doing .
But there is no precedent , from Mattis or anyone else , for what we have seen these past few weeks from Fauci at the podium .
Is the coronavirus problem just going to go away ( as Trump had claimed ) ? No , from Fauci .
It is serious , and it is going to get worse .
Is the testing system " perfect " ( as Trump had claimed ) ? No , it is not working as it should .
Is the U .
once again the greatest of all nations in its response to the threat ? No , it is behind in crucial aspects , and has much to learn from others .
Fauci is saying all these things politely and respectfully .
As an experienced Washington operator he knows that there is no reason to begin an answer with , " The president is wrong .
" You just skip to the next sentence , " The reality is .
" But his meaning -- " the president is wrong " -- is unmistakable .
Anthony Fauci has earned the **26;2093;TOOLONG for his comments .
Donald Trump has earned the presumption that he is lying or confused .
A year ago that standoff -- the realities , versus Trump-world obeisance -- worked out against James Mattis .
Will the balance of forces be different for Fauci ? As of this writing , no one can know .
Four years ago , when Donald Trump was on his rise -- from apparent-joke candidate , to long-shot , to front-runner , to nominee , and on to electoral winner -- I wrote in this space a series of " Trump Time Capsules .
"  They started with #1 , back in May , 2016 , when a Paris-bound airliner plunged into the Mediterranean and Trump immediately declared that the cause must have been terrorism .
" What just happened ? " he shouted to a rally crowd before wreckage had even been found .
" A plane got blown out of the sky .
And if anybody thinks it was n't blown out of the sky , you 're 100 percent wrong , folks , OK ? You 're 100 percent wrong .
" ( Naturally , French authorities later determined that the crash arose from a mechanical problem .
)  Through all the posts , the idea was to record in real time what people knew about Donald Trump , about the country , and about the issues and stakes in the election , before any of us knew how the contest was going to turn out .
As I wrote in introducing the very first installment four years ago :  People will wonder about America in our time .
It can be engrossing to look back on dramatic , high-stakes periods in which people were not yet sure where things would lead , to see how they assessed the odds before knowing the outcome .
The last few months of the 1968 presidential campaign : would it be Humphrey , Nixon , or conceivably even George Wallace ? Or 1964 : was there a chance that Goldwater might win ? The impeachment countdown for Richard Nixon , in 1974 ? The Bush-Gore recount watch in 2000 ?  The Trump campaign this year will probably join that list .
The odds are still against his becoming president , but no one can be sure what the next five-plus months will bring .
Thus for time-capsule purposes , and not with the idea that this would change a single voter 's mind , I kick off what I intend as a regular feature .
Its purpose is to catalogue some of the things Donald Trump says and does that no real president would do .
- About the unfolding-by-the-minute consequences of the coronavirus pandemic .
- About the recent collapse of the stock markets , and the less immediately visible , but ultimately far more damaging , economic and social effects of the sudden simultaneous collapse of the travel and lodging industries , of the live-events and sports and conference and entertainment businesses , of restaurants and bars , of taxis and trains , of stores in college towns , and of the impact of all of this on the people who unload baggage from airliners or clean rooms for hotel guests or work as security guards at museums or sell jerseys at baseball games .
Such roles are not as resonant as " steelworkers " or " coal miners " in political or journalistic discourse , but these jobs collectively form a very large part of the economy , they 're very hard to do over the internet or " remotely , " and they 're being eliminated at a pace not seen in at least a dozen years , and probably since the 1930s .
We do n't know .
So behind our veil of ignorance about outcomes , this is another chronicle of what we knew and heard day by day , which I 'll intend to operate , as with the original series , through the upcoming election season .
Obviously I am skipping through what would be several decades ' worth of news in normal circumstances : impeachment , the Democratic primaries , the evisceration of legal norms , and so on down a long list .
Instead , for an arbitrary starting point , let 's begin with Trump 's Oval Office address last night on the virus threat .
I have experience with this rhetorical form : I wrote a number of such addresses long ago when Jimmy Carter was president , and I have studied dozens of them in the intervening years .
This latest Trump speech was uniquely incompetent and inappropriate , and it 's worth noting why , as American voters decide whether to retain him in office .
One audience that Trump himself takes seriously -- the world financial system -- obviously took a dim view of his statement , as markets around the world headed sharply downward practically as soon as he began to talk .
Of course , their view indirectly affects everyone else .
But from a political , rhetorical , and civic perspective , what was wrong with the speech ? While watching it , I was assessing the speech by two standards : What it showed about Trump and his styles of thought , and what it showed about presidents and their roles in similar moments of stress .
As for Trump himself , his public vocabulary is strikingly limited on a deployable-word-count basis : " Many people are saying , " " it 's the greatest ever , " " we have tremendous people , " " very good things are happening , " " there has never been anything like it , " and of course " sir .
"  Equally striking is the consistency , or narrowness , of the messages Trump delivers .
A huge proportion of his entire discourse can be boiled down to two themes :  I am so great , and am doing a better job than anyone else ever has .
( Biggest crowds , best economy , most loyal supporters , etc .
)  Other people are such cheaters -- and it is outrageous what they are trying to get away with .
( They 're sending rapists ; they 're behind on their NATO payments ; they 're ripping us off in trade ; etc .
)  I wo n't go through the whole classification of his discourse into these two categories , but nearly everything he said last night could be boiled down to one or the other of those themes .
I am so great and am doing the best possible job .
( " This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history .
Our team is the best anywhere in the world .
Because of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years , we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world , by far .
" )  Other people are mistreating us and are to blame .
( Repeated references to the " foreign virus , " banning entry from most foreign nationals who have recently been in Europe , etc .
)  Of course , every presidential address in every era has implicitly argued , I am doing a good job .
Whether the challenge they 're dealing with is the Great Depression or the 9/11 attacks , Pearl Harbor or the Cuban Missile Crisis , when describing the challenge and their intended response , all presidents are effectively saying : You can feel better about this emergency , because I have a plan .
But until Trump , other presidents have applied the " show , do n't tell " policy when it comes to their own competence .
They want to show they are acting the way the country would hope , so they do n't have to say it .
Trump says it himself .
He quotes other people saying it about him .
And he insists on hearing about his greatness from his retinue -- most recently in the fawning statements made by his own vice president and secretary of health and human services , who preface their updates about the virus with North Korean-style compliments for the leader 's far-sighted action .
Five years into Trump 's presence as a foreground political figure , many listeners are inured to the two unvarying notes in his presentations : that what is good has come from him , and what is bad has come from someone else .
But the prominence of these two notes in an Oval Office address was a reminder of how much we have learned to overlook .
This is not how presidents have ever talked before .
And what about the speech , just as a speech ? In my view it had three problems : how it was conceived ; how it was written ; and how it was delivered .
( Plus , a bonus fourth problem I 'll get to at the end .
)  How it was conceived : An Oval Office address is by definition about a big problem .
( Otherwise , why is a president imposing on our time this way ? ) And its purpose is to answer several explicit questions : Why did this happen ? How bad is it ? What are we going to do about it ? It also , always , must answer a deeper , broader , and more important question : Will we be OK ?  Abraham Lincoln 's First and Second Inaugural Addresses can be thought of as precursors to Oval Office addresses of the broadcast era , and as the ideal form of such speeches , answering all these questions .
( Why did this happen ? " In your hands , my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen , and not in mine , is the momentous issue of civil war .
You have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government , while I shall have the most solemn one to ' preserve , protect , and defend ' it .
" Will we be OK ? " With malice toward none ; with charity for all ; with firmness in the right , as God gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we are in .
" )  Again , that 's the ideal form , but it is one that other presidents have had in mind as the model to work toward .
These addresses have been about us , the American family , not about me , the leader .
But Trump has only the me note in his vocal and emotional range , except for them as the enemies .
He used the word us in the speech , but it was just a word .
Audiences swallow a lot of guff from politicians , entertainers , and other public figures .
But over time , the public can size up its most familiar performers and recognize which words ring true to them , and which they 're just reading from a script .
And this is entirely apart from the speech 's failure to address the major elephant-in-the-room questions reporters , governors , and public health officials had been asking .
Starting with , Why are we so far behind with tests ?  How it was delivered : Donald Trump is very effective and entertaining as an unscripted live performer , riffing and feeding off the energy of a crowd .
Why does he keep going to big rallies ? Partly because the crowds adore him there , and partly because this is what he 's genuinely good at .
His rallies -- part greatest-hits , part " you have to be there to believe it ! " surprises -- are great shows .
That 's how he commanded so much free airtime on cable TV through 2015 and early 2016 : it was the latest must-watch reality show .
But you ca n't do that in every speech .
And while Trump can still slip a little bit of his rally-meister style into an hour-long State of the Union address , it 's just impossible in 10 minutes behind the Resolute desk .
And thus he seemed robotic , even narcotized .
Presumably he had seen the text before he encountered it on the TelePrompter -- in normal circumstances , a president would have done practice run-throughs many times before the cameras came on .
But to judge from his delivery , he was trying to parse his way through sentences he had never seen before .
If this seems harsh , compare George W .
Bush 's Oval Office address after the 9/11 attacks , or Ronald Reagan 's in 1986 on defense spending and arms-limitation talks .
Bonus : Within an hour of Trump 's speech , other parts of the government were issuing " clarifications " about points he had misstated in his speech .
No , not all travel from Europe was suspended .
No , the European transit ban did not apply to cargo .
No , Americans coming back did n't need to be screened before reentry .
And no , on other points .
Had the need for immediate fact-checking arisen , with any previous Oval Office address ? Not that I am aware of .
Whatever political party holds the White House and whatever policies these speeches seek to advance , such addresses usually reflect the greatest level of attention to detail that a president 's team can apply .
Unfortunately , it probably did so in this case , too .
Twelve hours after Trump 's speech , Joe Biden gave an address that was " presidential , " by the standards listed above .
It expressed concern for those suffering in medical , financial , or emotional ways .
It laid out what was known and unknown about the challenge .
Implicitly , it argued : We will be OK .
What the contrast between the speeches means , politically or in terms of public health , we do n't know at this moment .
As of this installment , we know that Donald Trump faced a familiar test of presidential mettle , and badly failed .
The U .
may end up with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the industrialized world .
This is how it 's going to play out .
Three months ago , no one knew that SARS-CoV-2 existed .
Now the virus has spread to almost every country , infecting at least 446,000 people whom we know about , and many more whom we do not .
It has crashed economies and broken health-care systems , filled hospitals and emptied public spaces .
It has separated people from their workplaces and their friends .
It has disrupted modern society on a scale that most living people have never witnessed .
Soon , most everyone in the United States will know someone who has been infected .
Like World War II or the 9/11 attacks , this pandemic has already imprinted itself upon the nation 's psyche .
A global pandemic of this scale was inevitable .
In recent years , hundreds of health experts have written books , white papers , and op-eds warning of the possibility .
Bill Gates has been telling anyone who would listen , including the 18 million viewers of his TED Talk .
In 2018 , I wrote a story for The Atlantic arguing that America was not ready for the pandemic that would eventually come .
In October , the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security war-gamed what might happen if a new coronavirus swept the globe .
And then one did .
Hypotheticals became reality .
" What if ? " became " Now what ? "  Across the country , social distancing is morphing from a public-health to political act .
The consequences could be disastrous .
For Geoff Frost , the first sign of the coronavirus culture war came last weekend on the golf course .
His country club , located in an affluent suburb of Atlanta , had recently introduced a slew of new policies to encourage social distancing .
The communal water jugs were gone , the restaurant was closed , and golfers had been asked to limit themselves to one person per cart .
Frost , a 43-year-old Democrat , told me the club 's mix of younger liberals and older conservatives had always gotten along just fine -- but the guidelines were proving divisive .
At the driving range , while Frost and his like-minded friends slathered on hand sanitizer and kept six feet apart , the white-haired Republicans seemed to delight in breaking the new rules .
They made a show of shaking hands , and complained loudly about the " stupid hoax " being propagated by virus alarmists .
When their tee times were up , they piled defiantly into golf carts , shoulder to shoulder , and sped off toward the first hole .
The extent of Oscar Health 's work on coronavirus testing has n't been previously reported .
On March 13 , President Donald Trump promised Americans they would soon be able to access a new website that would ask them about their symptoms and direct them to nearby coronavirus testing sites .
He said Google was helping .
That was n't true .
But in the following days , Oscar Health -- a health-insurance company closely connected to Trump 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner -- developed a government website with the features the president had described .
A team of Oscar engineers , project managers , and executives spent about five days building a stand-alone website at the government 's request , an Oscar spokesperson told The Atlantic .
The company even dispatched two employees from New York to meet in person with federal officials in Washington , D .
, the spokesperson said .
Then the website was suddenly and mysteriously scrapped .
The coronavirus outbreak may last for a year or two , but some elements of pre-pandemic life will likely be won back in the meantime .
The new coronavirus has brought American life to a near standstill , closing businesses , canceling large gatherings , and keeping people at home .
All of those people must surely be wondering : When will things return to normal ?  The answer is simple , if not exactly satisfying : when enough of the population -- possibly 60 or 80 percent of people -- is resistant to COVID-19 to stifle the disease 's spread from person to person .
That is the end goal , although no one knows exactly how long it will take to get there .
There are two realistic paths to achieving this " population-level immunity .
" One is the development of a vaccine .
The other is for the disease to work its way through the population , surely killing many , but also leaving many others -- those who contract the disease and then recover -- immune .
" They 're just Teflon at that point , " meaning they ca n't get infected again and they wo n't pass on the disease , explains Andrew Noymer , a public-health professor at the UC Irvine .
Once enough people reach Teflon status -- though we do n't yet know if recovering from the disease confers any immunity at all , let alone lifelong immunity -- normalcy will be restored .
( It may also turn out to be the case that people who are immune to the disease can still pass it on under certain circumstances .
) *  China warned Italy .
Italy warned us .
We did n't listen .
Now the onus is on the rest of America to listen to New York .
In the emergency-department waiting room , 150 people worry about a fever .
Some just want a test , others badly need medical treatment .
Those not at the brink of death have to wait six , eight , 10 hours before they can see a doctor .
Those admitted to the hospital might wait a full day for a bed .
I am an emergency-medicine doctor who practices in both Manhattan and Queens ; at the moment , I 'm in Queens .
Normally , I love coming to work here , even though in the best of times , my co-residents and I take care of one of New York City 's most vulnerable , underinsured patient populations .
Many have underlying illnesses and a language barrier , and lack primary care .
Trump is utterly unsuited to deal with this crisis , either intellectually or temperamentally .
For his entire adult life , and for his entire presidency , Donald Trump has created his own alternate reality , complete with his own alternate set of facts .
He has shown himself to be erratic , impulsive , narcissistic , vindictive , cruel , mendacious , and devoid of empathy .
None of that is new .
But we 're now entering the most dangerous phase of the Trump presidency .
The pain and hardship that the United States is only beginning to experience stem from a crisis that the president is utterly unsuited to deal with , either intellectually or temperamentally .
When things were going relatively well , the nation could more easily absorb the costs of Trump 's psychological and moral distortions and disfigurements .
But those days are behind us .
The coronavirus pandemic has created the conditions that can catalyze a destructive set of responses from an individual with Trump 's characterological defects and disordered personality .
The major dividing line in effective crisis response will not place autocracies on one side and democracies on the other .
When the coronaviruspandemic now sweeping the world was localized in China in January , many people argued that China 's authoritarian system was blocking the flow of information about the seriousness of the situation .
The case of Li Wenliang , a physician who was punished for blowing the whistle early on and who subsequently died from the disease , was seen as emblematic of authoritarian dysfunction .
The situation now looks less rosy for democratic government .
Europe faces a larger disease burden than China , with Italy alone exceeding the number of deaths officially reported in China , despite having one-twentieth the population .
It turns out that the leaders of many democracies felt similar pressures to downplay the dangers of the epidemic , whether to avoid injuring the economy or to protect their personal interests .
This was true not just of Brazil 's Jair Bolsonaro or Mexico 's Lopez Obrador , but also of President Donald Trump , who until mid-March kept insisting that the U .
had the disease under control and that the epidemic would disappear shortly .
This explains why the U .
lost two months in preparing for the onslaught , creating persistent shortages of testing kits and medical supplies .
China , meanwhile , is reporting a leveling-off of new cases .
Chinese students in Britain have reportedly been astonished at the lax approach taken by Boris Johnson 's government .
It has taken a good deal longer than it should have , but Americans have now seen the con man behind the curtain .
When , in January 2016 , I wrote that despite being a lifelong Republican who worked in the previous three GOP administrations , I would never vote for Donald Trump , even though his administration would align much more with my policy views than a Hillary Clinton presidency would , a lot of my Republican friends were befuddled .
How could I not vote for a person who checked far more of my policy boxes than his opponent ?  What I explained then , and what I have said many times since , is that Trump is fundamentally unfit -- intellectually , morally , temperamentally , and psychologically -- for office .
For me , that is the paramount consideration in electing a president , in part because at some point it 's reasonable to expect that a president will face an unexpected crisis -- and at that point , the president 's judgment and discernment , his character and leadership ability , will really matter .
" The thought of simply breathing in and out without coughing and reuniting with my children .
is goal enough .
To -- literally -- live and let live will be enough .
"  I can pinpoint the exact moment I started feeling off .
My partner , Will , and I were on a bike ride on the afternoon of Wednesday , March 18 , to escape our apartment and get some exercise .
This was back when leaving a New York City apartment to get some exercise was still okay , or at least that 's what we 'd read , or at least that 's what we thought ? If the coronavirus pandemic has taught us anything , it 's that what is considered dogma today might change tomorrow .
Ten minutes into our bike ride , I was overcome by an intense fatigue .
" I think I have to go back , " I said .
Back home , I felt chilled .
Took my temperature : 99 .
I 'm normally 97 .
, but still , not a huge deal .
We 'd been so careful about wiping down doorknobs , washing our hands , and keeping everyone except for our family out of our apartment .
I 'd been ambiently worried enough that my 13-year-old son could be a silent carrier of the virus that I 'd yanked him out of his public middle school and off the crowded subways four days before Mayor Bill de Blasio pulled the plug -- ( far too belatedly , in my opinion ) .
I was getting over a urinary-tract infection , so my fever , I thought , must be from that .
By now , the global timeline of the coronavirus 's development has been well established : The first case reportedly appeared in mid-November ; in December , the Chinese government was still attributing hospitalizations to a peculiar form of pneumonia ; through January and February , the outbreak began spreading around the world ; and its epicenter is today firmly in Europe and the United States .
Throughout , another set of events were occurring here in India .
Late last year , Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Hindu-nationalist government introduced and passed a controversial new law , ostensibly in support of minorities in neighboring countries , that in fact openly discriminated against Muslims and undermined India 's secular foundations .
Then , early this year , protests over that new law snowballed into a pogrom in which dozens of people -- mostly Muslims -- have been killed .
The U .
may end up with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the industrialized world .
This is how it 's going to play out .
Three months ago , no one knew that SARS-CoV-2 existed .
Now the virus has spread to almost every country , infecting at least 446,000 people whom we know about , and many more whom we do not .
It has crashed economies and broken health-care systems , filled hospitals and emptied public spaces .
It has separated people from their workplaces and their friends .
It has disrupted modern society on a scale that most living people have never witnessed .
Soon , most everyone in the United States will know someone who has been infected .
Like World War II or the 9/11 attacks , this pandemic has already imprinted itself upon the nation 's psyche .
A global pandemic of this scale was inevitable .
In recent years , hundreds of health experts have written books , white papers , and op-eds warning of the possibility .
Bill Gates has been telling anyone who would listen , including the 18 million viewers of his TED Talk .
In 2018 , I wrote a story for The Atlantic arguing that America was not ready for the pandemic that would eventually come .
In October , the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security war-gamed what might happen if a new coronavirus swept the globe .
And then one did .
Hypotheticals became reality .
" What if ? " became " Now what ? "  Across the country , social distancing is morphing from a public-health to political act .
The consequences could be disastrous .
For Geoff Frost , the first sign of the coronavirus culture war came last weekend on the golf course .
His country club , located in an affluent suburb of Atlanta , had recently introduced a slew of new policies to encourage social distancing .
The communal water jugs were gone , the restaurant was closed , and golfers had been asked to limit themselves to one person per cart .
Frost , a 43-year-old Democrat , told me the club 's mix of younger liberals and older conservatives had always gotten along just fine -- but the guidelines were proving divisive .
At the driving range , while Frost and his like-minded friends slathered on hand sanitizer and kept six feet apart , the white-haired Republicans seemed to delight in breaking the new rules .
They made a show of shaking hands , and complained loudly about the " stupid hoax " being propagated by virus alarmists .
When their tee times were up , they piled defiantly into golf carts , shoulder to shoulder , and sped off toward the first hole .
The extent of Oscar Health 's work on coronavirus testing has n't been previously reported .
On March 13 , President Donald Trump promised Americans they would soon be able to access a new website that would ask them about their symptoms and direct them to nearby coronavirus testing sites .
He said Google was helping .
That was n't true .
But in the following days , Oscar Health -- a health-insurance company closely connected to Trump 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner -- developed a government website with the features the president had described .
A team of Oscar engineers , project managers , and executives spent about five days building a stand-alone website at the government 's request , an Oscar spokesperson told The Atlantic .
The company even dispatched two employees from New York to meet in person with federal officials in Washington , D .
, the spokesperson said .
Then the website was suddenly and mysteriously scrapped .
The coronavirus outbreak may last for a year or two , but some elements of pre-pandemic life will likely be won back in the meantime .
The new coronavirus has brought American life to a near standstill , closing businesses , canceling large gatherings , and keeping people at home .
All of those people must surely be wondering : When will things return to normal ?  The answer is simple , if not exactly satisfying : when enough of the population -- possibly 60 or 80 percent of people -- is resistant to COVID-19 to stifle the disease 's spread from person to person .
That is the end goal , although no one knows exactly how long it will take to get there .
There are two realistic paths to achieving this " population-level immunity .
" One is the development of a vaccine .
The other is for the disease to work its way through the population , surely killing many , but also leaving many others -- those who contract the disease and then recover -- immune .
" They 're just Teflon at that point , " meaning they ca n't get infected again and they wo n't pass on the disease , explains Andrew Noymer , a public-health professor at the UC Irvine .
Once enough people reach Teflon status -- though we do n't yet know if recovering from the disease confers any immunity at all , let alone lifelong immunity -- normalcy will be restored .
( It may also turn out to be the case that people who are immune to the disease can still pass it on under certain circumstances .
) *  China warned Italy .
Italy warned us .
We did n't listen .
Now the onus is on the rest of America to listen to New York .
In the emergency-department waiting room , 150 people worry about a fever .
Some just want a test , others badly need medical treatment .
Those not at the brink of death have to wait six , eight , 10 hours before they can see a doctor .
Those admitted to the hospital might wait a full day for a bed .
