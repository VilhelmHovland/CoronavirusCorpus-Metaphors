Six characteristics of businesses that will survive the COVID-19 pandemic  We are at the early stage of a health pandemic that is resulting in the biggest economic crisis of our lifetime putting extreme pressure on small and medium businesses .
Many businesses will not survive .
Those that do survive will see huge opportunities beyond the bridge to the other side .
There are six common characteristics of businesses that will survive .
Composed adaptive leadership  This crisis is a defining moment in our careers and lives .
How we lead our people matters now more than ever .
Composed , empathetic , informed and adaptive leadership will be required to navigate this volatile and unprecedented crisis .
Leaders need to demonstrate care and diligence , good faith , proper use of information and proper use of position in the best interests of the company ensuring solvency .
Low exposure to discretionary expenditure  Businesses who are exposed to travel , entertainment , hospitality and discretionary retail will find it difficult to survive post a government-directed hibernation .
Those with high exposure to everyday needs , home delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low reliance on people  Given social distancing guidelines , businesses that rely on people to deliver services in close proximity to customers such as taxi and ridesharing , hair and beauty and hospitality will find it difficult to survive .
Businesses that do not rely on people delivering services , such as online banking and e-commerce platforms are more likely to keep operating and generating cashflow .
Low fixed costs  Businesses that can quicklytransfer the majority of expenses to variable costs are more likely to survive .
Moving full-time labour to contract or casual labour and moving fixed rent to a percentage rent of sales , will move expenses to variable and allows businesses to compress costs in line with revenue declines .
Low debt and reliable debtors  Businesses with no or very low levels of debt , and with debtors who will reliably pay invoices when due , are more likely to survive .
While banks are likely to show some flexibility to viable businesses , you want to be able to suspend repayments and limit bad debts to preserve cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liquidity is king through this crisis .
Having cash reserves on your balance sheet will be essential in maximising the chance of survival .
This cash can be used to transfer costs from fixed to variable and support the business and stakeholders as revenues get disrupted .
Those businesses that survive will see less competition on the other side and new opportunities .
New business models will emerge , and we will create more adaptive businesses with more variable costs , lower debt , stronger balance sheets and with better risk management .
