Abortion Foes Use the Pandemic as an Excuse  Who would have thought COVID-19 would give anti-abortion forces the quick victory they could not win in the courts , in the legislative process , or through the deployment of screaming protesters outside clinics ? Claiming abortion is a nonessential service that can be postponed so that the clinics ' medical resources can be used to fight the coronavirus , officials in Texas , Ohio , and Louisiana have moved to severely restrict or cut off abortion services completely ; the governor of Mississippi announced his intention this week to do the same .
Opponents of women 's reproductive rights hope to achieve , with the stroke of a pen , their dream of making states abortion-free .
For patients at these clinics , the situation is terrifying .
" We have patients crying on the phone and staff crying with them , " Kathaleen Pittman , the director of Hope Medical Center in Shreveport , Louisiana , told me .
" This is hard .
So hard .
" The clinic is open but has postponed all of its appointments .
" We 're looking at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hand it to the anti-abortion movement for taking full advantage of the social and medical crisis into which the coronavirus has plunged the nation .
Chaos , as the scheming Littlefinger says in Game of Thrones , is a ladder .
If you ever thought opposition to abortion had anything to do with concern for women 's health , disabuse yourself of that notion right now .
The World Health Organization calls abortion " essential " to women 's rights and health .
Closer to home , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology , along with six other mainstream medical associations , issued a joint statement opposing the postponement or cancellation of abortion provision .
It declared :  Abortion is an essential component of comprehensive health care .
It is also a time-sensitive service for which a delay of several weeks , or in some cases days , may increase the risks or potentially make it completely inaccessible .
The consequences of being unable to obtain an abortion profoundly impact a person 's life , health , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women 's ability to have decent lives : to have children when they are ready and able to take care of them , to get an education , to avoid bad marriages and escape abusive partners , to work and support themselves , and to fulfill the many demands society makes on women , such as caring for the children they already have .
( Fifty-nine percent of women who have abortions , according to the Guttmacher Institute , are already mothers .
) Moreover , abortions ca n't be postponed indefinitely .
The longer a patient has to wait , the more likely she is to need a more complex -- and more expensive -- procedure .
And the more likely she is to come up against the legal time limit , which , thanks to abortion opponents , is already more restrictive in many states than is stipulated in Roe v .
Wade ( roughly the 26th week of pregnancy ) .
One should n't assume clinics that are shut down now will reopen when COVID-19 subsides .
A clinic is not a hamburger stand .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffers .
Many independent clinics are already under financial pressure , thanks partly to intentionally burdensome regulations and low insurance and Medicaid reimbursement rates .
" For independent clinics , reopening is a nightmare , " Pittman told me .
" If they ca n't afford to pay their staff while they 're closed , those people have to go elsewhere .
"  Of the more than 40 abortion clinics open in Texas in 2013 before the state legislature passed tough new restrictions , at least 18 never came back after the U .
Supreme Court struck down those regulations in 2016 .
As that statistic suggests , attacks on abortion rights and access coming from every side means that even when the anti-abortion activists lose , they often kinda sorta win .
In much of the country , abortion has been barely accessible for many years ; travel services such as Fund Texas Choice and the New York City -- based Brigid Alliance help bring patients to distant clinics .
Even in normal times , it 's an expensive process involving transportation , hotel stays , child care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing all of that when airlines and buses are on restricted schedules and many hotels and restaurants are closed or insufficiently sanitized .
Do you go halfway across the country in nitrile gloves and a face mask , subsisting on bologna sandwiches that you made at home ? And what about the small networks of local volunteers who offer practical help -- making arrangements , driving patients , hosting them in their homes , and so on ? Social distancing gets in the way of such kindnesses .
" We need to ensure the safety of the volunteers we 've been relying on , " Odile Schalit , the executive director of the Brigid Alliance , told me .
" We ca n't ask them to risk their safety or their families ' safety .
'  There are ways to ease the predicament of pregnant women seeking abortion in places where there are no clinics nearby .
Notwithstanding the deliberate campaign to focus attention on late-term abortions , most terminations take place early in pregnancy .
For those women , abortion pills -- the combination of misoprostol and mifepristone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author and activist Robin Marty recently noted in Time , doctors could prescribe the pills and monitor patient safety via telemedicine .
A 2019 study showed that telemedicine was as safe and effective as a regular medication abortion .
Unfortunately , the states that are shutting down clinics now are no friendlier to ending pregnancies via telemedicine than in clinics .
The process is banned in Texas and Louisiana , and earlier this month the Ohio state Senate voted to ban it there .
By the Guttmacher Institute 's count , telemedical abortion has been banned in 17 states , including some , such as West Virginia and the Dakotas , that have only a single clinic .
What will happen to women who ca n't travel ? Some will have babies , and some of those babies will have fatal fetal anomalies , the sort of tragic conditions that even some people opposed to abortion would make an exception for .
Some women will have severe health problems .
Abortion has become so politicized that Americans can forget that it 's sometime necessary to preserve women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die -- pregnancy and childbirth have risks , and those risks have been increasing in recent years .
Some , however , will turn to the internet or informal networks to obtain abortion pills on their own , either the two-pill regime or just misoprostol , which is a common ulcer drug available over the counter in Mexico .
Plenty of evidence indicates that women are already doing this , and have been for some time , in Poland and other countries where abortion is illegal .
It 's now a truism to say that the coronavirus will change our society in many ways long after the crisis has passed .
As far as abortion is concerned , the pessimist in me says that abortion-free states will be the new normal , as travel becomes an expensive , time-consuming option ever farther out of reach for ordinary women .
The optimist in me notes that terrible times often lead to innovation .
Maybe the new normal will be telemedical abortion and self-managed abortion .
If anti-abortion governors and legislators can make a ladder of chaos , maybe abortion-rights supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you think about this article .
