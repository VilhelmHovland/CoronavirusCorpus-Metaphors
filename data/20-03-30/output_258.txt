There 's no vaccine against distrust  An online form allowing the public to report lockdown breaches undermines the trust we have in each other - unhelpful in even the most benign of situations , and downright dangerous right now , writes Michael Macaulay .
On Sunday it was reported there is a high demand for New Zealand Police 's online form to report lockdown breaches .
This news should act as a red flag , signalling the potentially corrosive effects on public trust within Aotearoa that may occur in these troubled times .
Concerns have already been expressed that the online reporting system could lead to reduced public trust in the police themselves , especially within communities that have long felt a lower degree of trust to begin with .
But trust in our public institutions is one thing , of far greater concern is the levels of trust we have within our communities .
The new system potentially undermines the trust we have in each other , which is unhelpful in even the most benign of situations , but downright dangerous right now .
In 2016 , I created the New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies at Te Herenga Waka -- Victoria University of Wellington .
That survey is now into its fourth edition and has consistently showed Kiwis trust each other to do the right thing and to make informed choices .
These levels of trust remained very consistent between 2016 and 2019 , and our general levels of trust in people are broadly consistent with other sources of data such as Stats NZ 's General Social Survey .
Yet trust is a delicate thing .
It is both a relational and relative principle .
Trust is built through relationships between individuals and groups and it rises and falls depending on circumstances .
It is not static .
Everyone can understand this principle .
We have all , at some point , trusted the wrong person , the wrong group of people or the wrong judgement call , to our detriment .
I do n't doubt the online reporting system has been developed with the best of intentions .
But it could very likely harm our levels of trust .
The point here is not that it may encourage people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may not be justified .
By far the bigger concern is in encouraging people to doubt and question their neighbour .
It builds on the most negative emotions people are understandably feeling at the moment : sadness , despair , fear of an unknown and unknowable future .
Giving those emotions an outlet can facilitate greater divisions .
The Prime Minister herself acknowledged this last week , when she publicly requested people not to act as local enforcers .
Sadly , the new online reporting system allows people to do just that , with no small amount of impunity .
Nobody knows anything in terms of the future of Aotearoa or the world .
Although we will doubtless emerge into the sunlight at some point , we can not know when , nor what that new day will look like .
But we do know we will always need each other .
We are social animals , we have evolved to co-operate .
We ca n't do without a degree of trust and in this time of isolation , in which none of us can anticipate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to keep those bonds of trust as strong as possible ,  I am not attacking New Zealand Police for creating the online reporting system , nor am I attacking anybody for using it .
But we all need to be aware that if this is our first port of call it can destroy social bonds that may take a lot longer to rebuild than we think .
There is no vaccine against distrust .
Credible information is crucial in a crisis .
The pandemic is pushing us into an unknown and uncertain future .
As the crisis unfolds the need for accurate , balanced and thorough reporting will be vital .
