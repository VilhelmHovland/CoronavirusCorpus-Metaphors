South Wales Police hit out at MP Stephen Kinnock for visiting his father , former Labour leader Neil Kinnock , on his birthday ; while Derbyshire dyed the Blue Lagoon in Buxton black to deter groups of people from gathering at the beauty spot .

" Serious breaches should attract fines , but news reports of over-enforcement by police and public are deterring the timid from exercising even the limited freedoms they have .
"  The move by Cheshire to curtail " multiple people from the same household going to the shops for non-essential items " appears to be a misinterpretation of the law .
Overnight 6 people have been summonsed for offences relating to the new corona virus legislation to protect the public :  The lawyer who tweets as The Secret Barrister said : " There is nothing in the legislation that prohibits multiple people from the same household going to the shops .
Nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items ' .
" Such things may not be desirable , but they are not crimes .
This does the police no credit .
"  Jules Carey from Bindmans said the police need to make a " cultural shift " in using the new powers to protect public health rather than prevent disorder .
He told PA : " We are not taking about a public order emergency , we are talking about a public health crisis and these laws have been enacted to help protect society from illness .
" The credibility of officers and forces will quickly be called into question if they fail to understand what is required of them .
" What is required of them is the necessary and proportionate enforcement of the restrictions put in place to protect society ; what they must avoid is overlaying the current health crisis with an atmosphere of tyranny and a sense of dystopia by setting up roadblocks , flying drones and overzealous policing on the ground .
"  We have been patrolling areas across the county and where we have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the weekend , we have issued 123 fixed penalty notices as a result .
#Covid19 ( 2/6 )  Britain 's most senior police officer , Dame Cressida Dick , has told her force only to use the new powers , which allow them to fine or arrest those who break lockdown laws , as a last resort .
She told LBC : " We are all getting used to the new restrictions and I 've been very clear that in the first instance I want my officers to be engaging with people , talking to people , encouraging them to comply .
" Explaining , of course , if they do n't understand -- already we have had examples of people who simply had n't quite heard all the messages -- and , only as a very last resort with the current restrictions , using firm direction or even enforcement .
"  Guidance has been issued to the 43 police forces in England and Wales by the National Police Chiefs ' Council , but it has not yet been made public .
Gracie Bradley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public would be " undermined by harsh and heavy handed policing " .
She said : " Despite the broad scope of these powers , we 've seen various incidents of police going even further -- and beyond their lawful remit .
" This makes it impossible for people to know how to comply with these new rules , and challenge police when they overreach .
"  Lord Sumption told Radio Four 's World At One : " In some parts of the country the police have been trying to stop people from doing things like travelling to take exercise in the open country which are not contrary to the regulations simply because ministers have said that they would prefer us not to .
" The police have no power to enforce ministers ' preferences but only legal regulations which do n't go anything like as far as the Government 's guidance .
" I have to say that the behaviour of Derbyshire Police in trying to shame people in using their undoubted right to travel to take exercise in the country and wrecking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go there is frankly disgraceful .
"  He added : " Derbyshire Police have shamed our policing traditions .
"  The force 's Chief Constable Peter Goodman said the force took drone footage of Curbar Edge due to an " unprecedented " number of visitors .
He said : " The drone was in the air for a matter of minutes and captured images of individuals who were not identifiable .
" The primary role of my officers is the preservation of life .
In placing a short 90-second clip on the force 's social media accounts it reached an audience far wider than our self-same messages that had gone completely unreported by national media until that point .
" This weekend we saw a considerable reduction in numbers to the Peak District and I would like to send my thanks to everyone who thought twice about putting themselves , local residents and emergency services at risk as a result of making an unnecessary trip .
