Arizona schools will remain closed through the end of the school year , Governor Doug Ducey and state Schools Chief Kathy Hoffman announced Monday morning .
Though campuses are closed , the remote learning that is underway must continue , said Ducey 's spokesman Patrick Ptak .
The extension applies to Arizona district and charter schools , following updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an announcement from the White House extending physical distancing guidelines until April 30 .
" Today 's announcement is intended to give parents and educators as much certainty as possible so they can plan and make decisions .
While this is n't the outcome any of us wanted , we are grateful for the partnership of schools around the state , who have stepped up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the pair said in a news release .
" These efforts are crucial , and we recognize that schools are making every effort possible to continue providing instruction during closures .

Pima County Superintendent of Schools Dustin Williams says extending the closures , which began March 16 , was the right decision to keep statewide clarity and unification .
He said schools are already making huge steps in the switch to remote-based learning .
" We 're definitely saddened that the day-to-day interactions between students to students and community and school is gone , " he said .
" We look forward to closing out the year and progressing together with remote-based learning to the best of our ability .
During these unprecedented times , working together and being united is top priority .
"  On March 27 , Ducey signed legislation to support schools during closures , ensuring school letter grades are held harmless , suspending statewide testing requirements , ensuring school days are not extended into the summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of COVID-19 .
