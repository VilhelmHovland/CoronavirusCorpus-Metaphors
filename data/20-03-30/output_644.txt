Kathryn Brown : Reporting from home a sign of the times  After 20 years in journalism , I assumed I had done pretty much everything .
I 've witnessed firsthand wars and inaugurations and natural disasters and economic meltdowns .
Throughout it all , journalism has changed a great deal .
The advent of social media and camera phones has changed how we get and transmit information .
But never in a million years would I have dreamed what we are seeing now .
As grave concerns over coronavirus continue to spread around the globe and across the country , businesses are suddenly shifting their models to " work from home .
" As a journalist , that 's not an option for us .
We have studios and crews and expensive equipment designed for the sole purpose of " anchoring " a newscast from a central studio -- a place where there is stability .
At least , I never thought working from home would be an option .
But these are strange days , indeed .
I got the news this week from my news director that WRAL would like to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor from home , as WRAL continues to exercise and expand social distancing measures .
I 'd be lying if I said I did n't jump at the chance .
A zero-minute commute , the chance to see my kids whenever I want AND to do something really different and creative -- what could be better ?  After two days , I can tell you working from home is FAR from what I expected .
The challenges have been unexpected but interesting .
? Last night , I propped my iPhone up between a Minnie Mouse stuffed animal and prayed it would n't fall over while I did live shots at 10 and 11 p .
from my playroom .
During the story that aired , I raced into my living room to prop my phone up on some coasters , jumped in front of the camera and crossed my fingers it was n't pointing at the ceiling .
Editing video on my iPhone is a tedious process .
I worked constantly from noon until 11 p .
, stopping for a quick moment to shovel in some dinner and peck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue figuring out the new normal .
Today , WRAL Technical Project Coordinator Tony Gupton showed up at my house with a truckload of equipment , effectively turning my guest room into a mini-studio .
We hung an enormous banner designed by Visual Design Director Shan Zhong , connected routers to cameras to lights to cellphones to more routers .
We are working to figure out a way to make this as seamless as possible for viewers -- to continue providing the same steady , consistent , accurate product that our audience expects .
There will be bumps along the way .
I hope that does n't come in the form of one of my children bursting in with a skinned knee .
but these are different days .
I am hardly the only one experiencing the hiccup of a new work environment .
I can tell you I am trying to embrace the change as an opportunity to learn new things , to exercise new creativity , and to find compelling new ways to tell the stories that are important to our communities .
Look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for now , I 'll settle for a pretty darn impressive setup in my house that I never expected would have been possible , and pray for the day when this coronavirus nightmare is in the rearview mirror .
Stay safe and healthy , friends ! ? ? ? ? ? ? .
