According to projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington , Ohio 's coronavirus cases are expected to peak April 19 , with 3,900 hospital beds needed , 585 of them in the ICU , and 468 ventilators .
On Monday , Acton said she wanted hospitals to at least double capacity , in time for a peak in mid- to late-April , depending on how successful successful distancing is .
That includes increased staffing and equipment .
" Our forecast , our weather station gets a little better each time , " Acton said .
" It gets better with each day and more accurate .
We already see from the stories from the front line ; it 's a lot of work in ICUs and hospitals .
"  Acton said she believes the Washington model looks at peak capacity day-by day , but that coronavirus patients will have to remain in the hospital much longer than patients with other illnesses -- up to 20 days .
She said scientists will continue to collaborate , to work through their projections .
" You ca n't just look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're piling on top of each logarithmically , " she said Monday .
Terry O'Sullivan , associate director of the Center for Emergency Management and Homeland Security at the University of Akron , said he expects a lot of controversy in modeling the effect of the coronavirus , mostly because there are so many unknowns .
" A lot of this is guess work , " O'Sullivan said .
" In the modeling world they refer to it as garbage in , garbage out .
They are sophisticated models , but they are limited by the information and inability to fully anticipate the interaction of these variables .
We do n't know exactly who 's been infected .
"  " The main challenge of COVID-modeling at present are big uncertainties of its transmission ( rates , pathways ) , as well as recovery , pathogenicity ( fraction of " heavy infections " over " light/asymptomatic " ) , fatality , " Gurarie said in an email .
" It is believed , large pool of undetected ( asymptomatic ) hosts contributes to transmission , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Washington study does n't predict total cases , but says Ohio will peak at about 1,203 deaths total , with the model showing deaths could be between about 400 and 2,100 .
The study examines every state , based on confirmed COVID-19 deaths from the World Health Organization , local and national governments , as well as " COVID-19 utilization data from select locations .
" It estimates that approximately 81,000 people will die from the virus in the United States over the next four months -- less than the up to 200,000 warned by White House coronavirus coordinator Dr .
Deborah Birx on Monday .
The latest Ohio Department of Health projection of the coronavirus curve .
Ohio is one of nine states with hospitals that wo n't be overwhelmed , according to the projections , which are updated daily .
Michigan , which has had about three times more coronavirus cases than Ohio , is forecasted to need nearly triple the ICU beds than it has available .
The projection shows Michigan will have about 2,855 coronavirus deaths -- double Ohio 's .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is expected to peak 10 days before Ohio , in line with Acton 's predictions .
The state has a more steeper projected spike , with an expectation of more than 11,000 ICU beds needed and only 718 available .
" Our estimated trajectory of COVID-19 deaths assumes continued and uninterrupted vigilance by the general public , hospital and health workers , and government agencies , " Murray said .
" The trajectory of the pandemic will change -- and dramatically for the worse -- if people ease up on social distancing or relax with other precautions .
We encourage everyone to adhere to those precautions to help save lives .
"  Ohio State University said it will release more information on the methodology of its projections later this week .
