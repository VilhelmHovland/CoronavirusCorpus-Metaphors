Children 's Theatre part of effort to make face masks  EAU CLAIRE , Wis .
-- Local theater members have shifted their focus from creating costumes to making face masks in an effort to combat COVID-19 .
The grassroots work to create homemade masks is occurring across the country , and the Chippewa Valley citizens recently began helping by creating masks that follow guidelines from the U .
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
At the Eau Claire Children 's Theatre , four employees are coordinating their efforts to create face masks after encouragement from a health care worker who also helps out at the ECCT .
Ann Behrens , ECCT costume shop manager , called it an easy decision to help with a lifesaving measure .
A main CDC guideline involves using pieces of tightly woven , cotton-based fabric , and the theater is well-stocked with the requisite supplies .
Allie Kangas , ECCT costume designer , made a few masks on a recent Friday and is now working as the second part of the mask-making process .
" We 're providing our skills and talents to do something that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're experiencing , " Kangas told the Leader-Telegram .
Creating a face mask involves several steps and takes around 20 minutes to finish , according to ECCT employees .
It starts with intern Megan Murphy taking an 8-by-14-inch piece of cotton fabric and folding it in half while also stitching the edge closed .
She then gives it to Kangas , who irons the fabric flat , pleats it and pins it .
Kangas hands the material to either Behrens or costumer designer Jackson Berhow , who use sewing machines to stitch the edges together , add straps and bind the edge with bias tape to complete the mask .
None of them had created masks before , but it was a fairly easy process to learn after making one or two .
As of late morning on March 24 , they had made about 40 masks and had an additional 50 in production .
The completed masks were laid out on a table with a wide array of hues and patterns , including solid colors ; red white and blue ; a pink strawberry shortcake design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brown fabric .
The masks will be donated to the community at a Festival Foods drop location .
It is uncertain exactly who will use the masks , but they should eventually aid someone who needs them , be it a health care worker , patient or grocery store employee .
The homemade masks are more effective than a bandanna or scarf , which some locations might have to resort to because of the shortage of masks nationwide .
Many other people in the community are making face masks .
A Facebook group called Mask Beez originated the idea locally , and another group named Sew the Curve Flat is contributing similar efforts .
Anyone with sewing experience and a sewing machine can provide assistance and drop the masks off at a local Festival Foods .
It is not known how long the costume employees will be able to create the masks at the Children 's Theatre 's office and rehearsal space .
Wayne Marek , ECCT executive director , said core employees will remain in the building as a result of an order from Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The office is already essentially closed to the public , as the ECCT has postponed all performances until at least May .
Marek said there are four performances in different stages of production , and the people involved will try to progress without meeting in-person , but the uncertainty presents difficulties .
The effort to create homemade masks appears to be happening all over the nation .
Murphy has friends and family in Maryland and West Virginia who inquired about proper procedures to make masks .
Berhow hails from Washington state and said friends and relatives asked him about creating them .
" This has really become a nationwide project , " Berhow said .
For as long as they are able , the ECCT employees will do whatever they can to provide assistance .
" The world is so scary outside , it felt good to do something that was helpful , " Murphy said .

On March 31 , 2019 , after Hussle calmly told Holder he was gaining a reputation as a " snitch , " the 29-year-old Holder shot and killed the 33-year-old Hussle , according to police , prosecutors and witnesses .
