Copy/paste the article video embed link below :  In this special episode of Business Planet , we look at what measures have been put in place to support small and medium-sized enterprises .
There are 25 million SME 's in Europe .
They represent two-thirds of jobs in the bloc and are particularly impacted by the new Coronavirus crisis .
Alban Maggiar , the president of SME United , the European Federation of Craftsmen and SMEs , says that at both national and European level , exceptional measures were needed .
" This means that a certain number of rules that existed until now are no longer valid .
We can see for example this in the European rules on state aid .
"  " The states have the possibility to give grants or guaranteed loans in proportions that are considerably higher than those that existed before .
"  The floodgates have been opened and a number of tools will be used to help governments , companies and the jobs they have guaranteed up to now .
So , what are the European Tools that entrepreneurs can mobilize precisely ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to go to their financial institutions , to their banks and ask them - if they meet certain criteria - to grant them funds , loans and guarantees , which are in fact European loans , European funds , " says Maggiar .
How can goods continue to circulate within Europe ?  " It was the very principle of the single market .
The single market was borderless .
Everything circulated freely .
And now we 're re-creating the puzzle .
And I think it is crucial that we maintain this idea of the single market , at least for everything in the vital value chains at the moment , at least for certain sectors that are necessary to be able to fight usefully against this coronavirus .
"  Another effect of this crisis is that many small entrepreneurs are currently struggling to pay their bills .
" The Achilles ' heel of craftsmen and SMEs is cash flow , " says Maggiar  " Large companies must ensure that they do not build up cash reserves to the detriment of their sub-contractors and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain , it is the SMEs and craftsmen who will pay the price .
So please ! Play the game and pay your subcontractors and suppliers .
"  What is your message to entrepreneurs today , to allow the entire industry to survive ?  " I 'd say , you have to hold on and you have to stick together .
I think I think in something bad , there is good , I 'm convinced that in 95% of the cases , we find humanity in relationships that tended to be a little lost .
"  " And I hope that after all this concern for humanity will continue , but once again we must keep , and I insist , the big doers , the big decision-makers must honour the commitments they have made to the smaller ones .
