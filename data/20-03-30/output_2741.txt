Although every MLB club will lose the same number of games to the COVID-19 pandemic , a truncated 2020 season will affect each of them in different ways .
The effects we 'll see will vary across the sport depending on each team 's financial and competitive situation , or even the health of their players .
For example , small-market organizations like the Tampa Bay Rays or Oakland Athletics may feel more strain on their pocket books than usual .
Dominant outfits like the Los Angeles Dodgers will see their playoff and World Series odds tumble a bit as a small-sample season opens the door for more surprises .
Groups like the New York Yankees will have more time to get stars like Aaron Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes .
Similarly , the Toronto Blue Jays will have a shortened season impact them in a few ways that differ from their competition .
The issue of top prospect Nate Pearson 's workload , for instance , becomes more complicated depending on how many competitive innings he 's able to log .
The idea was for 2020 to be a buildup year so that he could really be unleashed in 2021 .
Depending on how severely the beginning of affiliated baseball is delayed , that may not be possible .
Because the Blue Jays are on the fringe of contention , they are one of the teams with the most radical shifts in their playoff odds in the event of a short season .
Dan Szymborski at FanGraphs calculated last Tuesday that the club would experience the fourth-biggest jump in their playoff odds in the majors if the seasons were cut from 162 to 81 games -- the most dire scenario he calculated .
To be clear , no one is trying to draw a positive from COVID-19 , but it 's worth acknowledging potential shifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's particular to the Blue Jays -- and other teams trying to ascend to true competitor status -- is the difficulty that an abbreviated season could present for the evaluation of their in-house talent .
While this team has their primary building blocks in the Vladimir Guerrero Jr .
, Bo Bichette , and Cavan Biggio trio , and has supplemented their rotation with veterans , there are still a number of players they are weighing as possible future pieces .
It 's particularly important to the club to know what they have in this group considering their top outfield prospects by MLB Pipeline -- Griffin Conine and Dasan Brown -- rank 14th and 16th in the team 's farm system .
Conine played with the Single-A Lansing Lugnuts last year and Brown is 18 with 63 pro plate appearances to his name .
Help is not on the way in the immediate term .
For Grichuk , the one member of the group the Blue Jays have committed to long term , it 's the glove that needs closer examination .
In order to maximize his $52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team has opted to set him up in centre field .

However , the 28-year-old has only topped 100 games at that position once ( back in 2016 ) and the metrics on him are all over the place .
UZR has him a career -1 .
run centre fielder and Statcast 's Out Above Average pegs him at exactly average since those numbers became available in 2016 .
Meanwhile DRS puts him at an impressive +13 runs .
Those numbers may be deceiving , though , because most of them come from when he was significantly younger .
Since 2015 , Grichuk 's sprint speed has dropped from 90th percentile to 76th percentile and he 's not going to find another gear as he approaches 30 .
Combine that with an Outfield Jump that has generally hovered around average ( but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reasons for pessimism .
Even a full season 's worth of defensive data and film probably would n't have been enough to determine his current true talent as a centre fielder , but in an incomplete season the Blue Jays may be left pondering his best position again next year .
Gurriel Jr .
might have the most trustworthy bat of the quartet , but like Grichuk , his defence needs more scrutiny .
The 26-year-old looked great at times in left field , but we just do n't know the totality of what he brings to that position after just 63 games out there .
His metrics ranged from -4 ( OAA ) to +0 .
( UZR ) with his DZR sitting at -2 .
The sample is too small to take all that much from those numbers , but they tell us that despite the highlight-reel plays he probably was n't a Gold Glove candidate out there .
This was supposed to be the season we learned more -- and we likely still will to some extent -- but the lack of full information will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurriel Jr .
' s ability to throw from the left side of the infield , there may still be a scenario wherein the Cuban import ends up at third as well .
His bat seems to play , but settling on the perfect position may take longer than anticipated .

On the offensive side , it 's Fisher and Hernandez who could benefit from the most thorough evaluation possible .
Fisher 's case is relatively simple .
He projects pretty well thanks to a strong triple-A track record , but he simply has n't gotten it done at the MLB-level .
He still could in 2020 , but it would be harder to trust in a smaller sample .
Grichuk 's 2018 season is instructive here .
From June 1 on he hit .

The assumption was that despite a difficult transition to the Blue Jays ( he 'd hit .

to that point ) he 'd found his groove .
It was that performance that guaranteed him a job in 2019 and played a huge role in earning a five-year extension just five games into that season .
We 're less than a year from that deal being signed and it already looks dubious because Grichuk had a subpar 2019 , and has n't appeared to progress .
Similarly , if Fisher were to excel over a shorter period of time , it might be tempting to assume he 'd arrived ( especially considering his athletic gifts ) and give him a 2021 job that he may have proven himself unfit for over the course of a full 2020 .
It could also happen the other way if he struggled this season , causing the Blue Jays to pull the plug a year too soon -- a concern the club has continued to struggle with in Hernandez 's case .
In 2019 , Hernandez had a second-half rally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the minors on June 5 , he re-ignited belief in his bat and earned the right to prove himself once again this year .
The problem is that the Blue Jays already know his bat can catch fire in relatively long spurts .
Last year 's strong finish came in 86 games and the year prior he had a sturdy first half , hitting .

line in 76 contests ( that was good for a 118 wRC+ in a less homer-happy season ) .
If he were to put up a similarly strong , but not truly elite , offensive performance in a shortened season it would be hard for the Blue Jays to say they 'd learned anything with much confidence .
As it stands , the Blue Jays have a pretty solid infield , a rotation filled with veterans and young depth and a bullpen ready to be reinforced when the team is making a push .
The biggest organizational question mark is the outfield , and question mark may be putting it gently .
This was the season the club was hoping to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compressed 2020 could make that task extremely difficult .
