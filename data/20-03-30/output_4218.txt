Linden workers refuse to start shift in row over Covid-19 control measures  As many as 60 workers are understood to have refused to start their shifts at the Linden Foods site in Dungannon this morning ( March 27 ) .
The workers demanded " immediate talks " with management said there was a " total absence " of social distancing measures on the boning line , in the canteen and at entry and exit points .
It follows similar staff action at Moy Park and ABP Lurgan over the last few days .
Walkout  Brian Hewitt , Unite regional officer for workers at Linden Foods in Dungannon , said he was contacted by workers after they walked out this morning .
" There have been ongoing issues between management and workers at Linden Foods in Dungannon over the issue of the absence of social distancing for workers on the boning line , in the canteen , changing areas and at entry and exit points , " he said .
" Workers have been reporting to Unite that those exhibiting symptoms are still allowed to work as are those with family members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category .
Everyone needs to take responsibility but the company 's actions are putting workers needlessly at further risk .
" Both inside and outside the company , Unite has been raising health and safety concerns over the last weeks and unfortunately these have been ignored by management .
" In desperation and fear for their health and well-being , this morning approximately 60 workers refused to enter the workplace and sought assurances from management that 2m spacing would be adopted throughout .
" Management are continuing to ignore the concerns of their workers -- they are putting the lives and well-being of their employees at risk -- their intransigence is entirely unacceptable .
" Linden Foods must engage with these workers and commit to providing comprehensive infection control measures to end this walkout , " Hewitt said .
Factories already maintain high hygiene standards  Meanwhile , an open letter to agri-food employees signed by Michael Bell executive director , Northern Ireland Food and Association ( NIFDA ) , highlighted that staff were already working in a " controlled hygienic environment " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective equipment and strict handwashing and hygiene protocols are already in place , and unnecessary -- staff are restricted from food production areas , " Bell wrote .
This is a good starting point , but as you will have seen , more can be and is being done .
Bell also praised staff for their hard work during a difficult time .
" We are very proud of our food and drink -- it is world-class , and we have many awards to prove it .
Demand for food from supermarkets has been increasing , as you will have seen and experienced , " he wrote .
" We have been stepping up to the plate to meet that demand .
Some of the increased demand is unfortunately due to stockpiling , and some is due to people having to eat at home all the time rather than in restaurants and cafes .
" All of us working within the entire food chain -- farmers , processors and retailers -- are doing our best to keep safe and keep going .
