She and several other Canadians have shared their stories with The Canadian Press in order to demystify the illness and to urge the public to respect physical distancing measures .
In the days following the onset of her symptoms , Fournier felt panic creeping in as she struggled to get through to anyone on Montreal 's hotlines , which constantly disconnected her .
Later , she had to fight to get tested since she had n't travelled recently and did n't know who infected her .
Since her test came back positive last Monday , Fournier has struggled with burning lung pain , a cough and fever , and " body aches and pains worse than any flu I 've ever had .
"  But even worse , she said , was the fear and isolation she felt after being left to fight a serious illness at home , with little advice beyond take Tylenol , rest and drink fluids and call 911 if she could n't breathe .
" It 's scary going through this by myself , " she said .
Kyla Lee , a 33-year-old lawyer from Vancouver , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad flu .
' Worse than any flu ' : Canadians describe how it feels to have COVID-19  Lee , who has no underlying health conditions , says she fell ill a few days after returning from a conference in Ohio and was diagnosed as a presumptive case by a doctor after she began experiencing a fever , fatigue and a deep cough .
The busy lawyer , who rarely pauses in her day and has never taken more than a day or two off for any illness , said that even nearly a week later , on her bad days she 's left gasping for breath on the edge of her bed after just a couple of phone calls .
" The breathing is the big difference , " she said in a phone interview last week .
" It 's like my lungs have sacks of rice around them , so when I take a deep breath I feel pressure .
"  Both Lee and Fournier decided to go public with their symptoms to show that even healthy young people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are worried about themselves or loved ones .
" It 's an incredibly alienating virus , " Fournier said .
" There 's shame associated with it , " she added .
" How many people did I infect ? Did I infect somebody ? Will I cause somebody to die ? "  At 61 years old , both Julien Bergeron and Manon Trudel are in an age demographic that is more prone to complications than either Lee or Fournier .
But the Montreal-area couple , who contracted COVID-19 aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February , say the mental aspect of the journey was far worse than the physical .
The couple had to endure weeks of confinement in their windowless room on the ship docked in Yokohama , with instructions constantly blaring on the loudspeaker and and endless stream of personnel knocking at the door .
Trudel , who has a background in workplace health and safety , knew the proper quarantine procedures were n't being followed , which added to the stress .
She began asking for protective gear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews from inside their room 's tiny bathroom to avoid the sounds of the couple fighting next door from filtering through the ship 's thin walls .
Bergeron was told he 'd tested positive on Feb .
18 , Trudel a few days later .
She had no symptoms , while he experienced lung pain and fatigue due to pneumonia but said it was no worse than his previous bouts .
The 22 days Bergeron spent in hospital were the longest the couple has spent apart in 25 years .
" It was very , very hard mentally , " Bergeron said .
Now that they 're home , the couple say they 're worried that Quebec does n't seem to be taking the virus as seriously as Japan , where they say those who tested postive were immediately put in hospitals or other facilities away from the public .
" Here , people are not hospitalized , not taken out of their living environment and it worries us enormously , " Trudel said .
" People should be in hospitals or hotels , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor store .
"  They say they 're still taking the risk seriously and are staying away from others as they return to life in Quebec .
