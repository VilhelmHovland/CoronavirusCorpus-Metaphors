COVID-19 : Escalate national resiliency now  There is urgent need to intensify public awareness preventive measures against the deadly viral disease .
By Oseloka H .
Obaz  It ought not to be a hard sale to convince anyone , that try as we may and have , Nigeria is well behind the emergency response curve required for tackling the Covid-19 pandemic .
Hence , now is the time to escalate the national resiliency level holistically , and in an unfettered manner .
Luckily , we have global response examples , best practices and lessons learned to borrow from , as well as mistakes that should be avoided entirely .
My assessment of this matter in non-partisan and purely from the policy and complex emergency response perspective .
First , I believe that those who are against shutting down non-essential public and academic institutions are wrong .
They are putting their economic considerations first .
We must be aware , that whatever economic of financial losses we incur nationally in our preventive efforts , will ultimately pale , when compared to eventual national losses , if we fail to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 expeditiously .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 36 cases of coronavirus in the country .
Covid-19 infections in Nigeria will extrapolate exponentially .
For now we seem comfortable in orchestrating containment .
The spread of infections will eventually rise because of indiscipline , our fluid form of urban and rural transportation , lack of societal control regimes and structures during emergencies , poverty , compelling need to fulfill sustenance and hierarchy of needs at any cost , poor national safety net , illiteracy and poor national orientation in compliance with public orders .
Furthermore , we seem to be allowing our success in managing the limited scope Ebola outbreak to induce a false sense of response capabilities .
The wide distrust gap that exist between the national population and the government is a critical factor .
If we must sell fear and use shock therapy to induce compliance with preventive measures , now is the time .
That may be the only way to guarantee the escalation of our national resiliency to the required level .
Federal and state cooperation will be imperative , beyond setting up the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national leaders must also lead by example ; first by personally exhibiting publicly , the value of social distancing .
That is not happening yet .
There are some other biting realities we must contend with .
What , for instance , is the acceptable national casualty and fatality threshold ? Will we accept hundreds , thousands or millions before the blame game starts ? For now , fate has been kind to us , but I suspect it wo n't be for long .
We , as a nation will eventually overcome the Covid-19 challenge , but the costs and fatality rates will only be mitigated , if we act proactively and expeditiously .
I have commented elsewhere on the prevailing challenges .
My point of view remains unapologetically consistent .
I 'm not into dooms day scenarios , but it 's better to be safe than sorry .
Bearing in mind that Nigerians including traders , fuel vendors , contractors , consultants and even healthcare providers tend to profiteer from crisis and emergency situations , the federal government must take the lead .
We must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
That order must also be enforced .
Various states might have some comparative response advantages in terms of finances and social and health structures ; but this is time to collaborate and not compete .
Decentralization will work best and help overcome the red tape and bottleneck approach , associated with all efforts , policies and finances coming out of Abuja .
So what to do ? The healthcare providers need more support .
But we must have structured and uniformed response units at the state level .
The reactive responses so far are grossly insufficient for the scope of impending complex emergency and crisis that could be cataclysmic for Nigeria .
At the state level , we must start setting up centralized and localized testing and holding spheres , as well as quarantine areas .
The National Emergency Management Agency ( NEMA ) and its state counterparts ( SEMAs ) , military and para-military agencies and all first responders should now be on " Code Yellow " operational mode across the nation .
Our national prevention advocacy is disjointed .
Television and Radio jingles and handbills in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there .
This explains the recent cases of chloroquine overdoses , by those self-medicating .
It also explains the lackadaisical response to social distancing .
We need to escalate public awareness preventive measures advocacy process .
Such campaign should be national in scope .
We must also marshal all available national financial resources required to tackle this pandemic .
Announced Federal Government response funding and Central Bank intervention support of N50 billion soft loans to small businesses are worthwhile .
Likewise the announced CBN increase in its intervention by another N100 billion in loans to support in 2020 the health authorities and ensure that laboratories , researchers and innovators work with global scientists to produce vaccines and test kits in Nigeria to prepare for any major crises ahead .
Yet , I have , even at the risk of sounding unrealistic advocated that FGN should as a matter of urgency release at the minimum , N74 billion directly to the 36 States , the FCT and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) .
I stand by that recommendation .
The resources recommended might seem outrageous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical national security matters .
I remain convinced that not responding robustly and expeditiously now , will ultimately cost Nigeria more , financially , materially , morally and certainly , in terms of human casualties .
Covid-19 challenge to Nigeria , will demand collective national leadership that is assertive and robust .
Nigerians need to see President Muhammadu Buhari and VP Osinbajo personally leading that campaign .
Presently Nigeria is on the lower rung of the COVID-19 spiraling totem pole .
The extrapolation and increase will definite come , if lessons from Iran , Spain , Italy and US are anything to go by .
Our demographic mosaic is much more diverse and equally much more susceptible .
Our local population will involuntarily shift from epicenters of infections , and in doing so abet the spread .
The crisis high-point will come if and when we are eventually required to lockdown cities , towns and communities .
We must , therefore , contemplate what our contingency sustenance plans will be for city and rural families in terms of healthcare , food , finances , if we arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including bureaucrats , policymakers and consultants , have exploited moments of dire national emergencies as means of getting rich quick .
It happened in Niger Delta and in the North East , and even the 2012 flood disaster .
Yet , we should not allow such experiences from stopping the federal government in releasing the funds required to combat this pandemic robustly .
States ca n't go it alone and should not pretend to be ready , when they know they are not .
We must escalate our national resiliency now .
We must seize the moment .
