See below for graphics of the newly posted COVID-19 numbers by the Virginia Department of Health .
So , at this point ( 3/28 ) , we 're at 739 total reported cases , 99 hospitalizations and 17 deaths from COVID-19 .
The number of reported cases went up 135 ( +22% ) in the latest statistics , which is a slightly slower rate of increase than the day before , when reported cases were up 144 ( +31% ) .
As for hospitalizations , they went up 16 ( +19% ) , from 83 to 99 , which is also a somewhat slower rate of increase than the previous day ( which was up 18 , or +28% ) .
Deaths went up 3 ( from 14 to 17 ) , compared to an increase of 1 ( from 13 to 14 ) the previous day .
So overall , not great news , but hopefully this curve will really start flattening out in coming days if we keep up the social distancing and other measures .
Also , of course , we need a LOT more testing capacity , PPE , etc .
