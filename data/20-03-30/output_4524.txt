Sky News spent a day in Alexandra , a particularly underprivileged area in Johannesburg .
We began the day outside the Freedom Supermarket , where a 500m queue began at the front door .
Across the road , a similarly lengthy line ended at a metal gate which stood in front of the local bank .
Police attempted to maintain order , but it was difficult to get such a large crowd to stand the required one metre apart from one another :  People need to eat .

At the time of writing , we have 1 280 confirmed cases .
In Alexandra , there 's limited access to preventative supplies like masks or hand sanitiser .
