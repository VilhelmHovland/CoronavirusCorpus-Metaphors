The videos , made in conjunction with scientists from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health , were filmed in the actors ' homes and directed by Steven Soderbergh and produced by screenwriter Scott Z Burns .
Advertisement  As reported in The Independent , the videos were written with the help of some of the scientific experts who also worked as advisors on Contagion such as Dr .
W Ian Lipkin who is leading research into new treatment and tests for coronavirus .
Damon and Winslet 's fellow Contagion co-stars Marion Cottilard , Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne have also filmed videos with each covering a different topic relating to COVID-19 such as the importance of hand washing , social distancing and listening to scientific experts .
In her video , Winslet says : " One of the most important things the experts taught me : wash your hands like your life depends on it because right now in particular , it just might .

That was a movie , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am immune to COVID-19 , and neither do you .
no matter how young you are , this is a new virus , it 's gon na take some time for our bodies and doctors to understand it , and to understand the best way to protect us .
"  He continues : " Social distancing means staying six feet away from another person .
It means not gathering in groups and it means staying home or sheltering in place if that 's what government officials are telling you to do .
" People can have COVID-19 and have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all , so even if you think you 're healthy or they 're healthy , do n't take that chance , it is not worth it .
"  Speaking to Slate about the rise in viewings of Contagion in the wake of the global pandemic , Burns was asked about the plot of his film " more or less coming true in real time .
"  He said : " It has been very strange to me , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will say to me , ' This is uncanny how similar it is .
' And I do n't find it to be that surprising , because the scientists I spoke to , and there were a lot of them , all said that this was a matter of when , not if .
" So , I guess my feeling as someone who believes in science is that when scientists tell us those things we would do well to listen .
