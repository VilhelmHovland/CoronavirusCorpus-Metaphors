"  Why ? Because only God knows when COVID-19 will disappear .
" Everyone recognizes that the public health conditions are highly uncertain , " Goodell wrote , " and there is no assurance that we can select a different date and be confident that conditions will be significantly more favourable than they are today .
"  Good point .
Almost two weeks ago , the NFL decided that the draft , which was slated to be a lavish event in Las Vegas , would be closed to the general public and shown only on TV .
Goodell 's most recent memo declared that prospects and their families will now not be present at the site of the draft .
Goodell said he has personally discussed the matter with owners , club executives and coaches , and that there is " widespread support " for the draft to proceed as scheduled .
He also said that the draft , which will be " conducted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a breath of fresh air when one is so desperately needed .
" I also believe that the draft can serve a very positive purpose for our clubs , our fans and the country at large , " Goodell stated .
Ai n't that a fact .
The NFL draft could be the only sports on TV we get for some time yet .
PLAYOFF EXPANSION VOTE  It could be easier to make it to the post-season from now on .

Under the proposal , seven teams from each conference would make the post-season , while the team with the best record would get the only first-round bye .
Three division winners from each conference would host three wild-card teams during the first weekend of the playoffs .

Hours later , the player 's agent told Ian Rapoport of NFL Media that Brockers will be returning to the Rams , with whom he had spent the first eight seasons of his career , on a three-year deal with a maximum value of $31 .

Proving he can take what he dishes out , Gurley is dishing out more .
" I 'm the same type of person like , when someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I ca n't get mad if somebody jokes on me , " he said .
" I joke on myself all the time .
If you knew me , you know that 's me .
And it 's all jokes .
It 's some truth to every little joke .
But I 'm having fun with it and that 's the only thing I can do , stuck in the house all day .
I know people are drinking and having fun , so I 'm going to have fun with y'all .
