Venture capital firm East Ventures says it is targeting to raise a total of Rp 10 billion ( $609,000 ) to produce 100,000 coronavirus test kits and finance a vaccine research project in Indonesia .
The early-stage investment firm says it will work with one of its portfolio companies , deep-tech startup Nusantics , on the initiative .
Nusantics is a member of the Technological Research and Innovation Task Force for COVID-19 under the Indonesia Technology Assessment and Application Agency ( BPPT ) .
The company is currently developing a test kit to detect COVID-19 , specifically designed for the Indonesian population .
It also plans to run a whole-genome sequencing to profile the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome .
