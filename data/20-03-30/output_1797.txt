Movement Control Order in Malaysia may affect worldwide condom supply  The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to grow , and the Movement Control Order imposed by Malaysian authorities in a bid to " flatten the curve " of the coronavirus has affected multiple industries around Malaysia .
Only essential service providers such as banks and healthcare centres are allowed to open , which has meant the temporary closure of companies and businesses around the country -- including those who produce condoms .
Karex is a Malaysian company that is the largest producer of condoms in the world , with 1 in 5 of all condoms in global circulation made by the manufacturer .
These condoms are then sold under other brands -- including Durex -- and distributed under certain healthcare and aid systems .
However , the MCO has resulted in the closure of manufacturing plants for more than a week , although Karex has been granted permission to begin production again -- albeit with only 50% of its workforce .
As such , the company warns that there is a shortage of 100 million condoms , and CEO Goh Miah Kiat explained to Reuters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " everywhere " .
Three of Karex 's factories have resumed operations since last Friday , although Goh warns that the producers will still struggle to meet the huge demand with just 50% of its workforce .
Who will be most affected ?  Karex also supplies condoms for humanitarian programs in Africa such as the UN Population Fund , which is reportedly the area of greatest concern .
While the shortage will certainly affect everyone , Goh says that the shortage will affect those who depends on these outreach programs in Africa the most ; shortages could run into the " months " , the CEO warns .
However , there are other major producers from other regions .
China , India , and Thailand are also major contributors of the world 's condom supply , although the outbreak is now spiking in India and Thailand -- China 's situation is stabilising .
Durex , meanwhile , has stated that the company is not experiencing any shortages for the moment , and encourages customers to make purchases online .
The necessity of condoms is even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning coming into focus for many in light of the recent situation .
" The good thing is that the demand for condoms is still very strong because like it or not , it 's still an essential to have .
Given that at this point in time people are probably not planning to have children .
It 's not the time , with so much uncertainty .
"  Despite the MCO prohibiting non-essential services providers from operating , companies that produce essential goods can apply for exemptions from the International Trade and Industry Ministry ( MITI ) in Malaysia .
However , with the world 's biggest producer operating at only half-mast , we could still see a huge shortage of condoms around the world -- there 's already a shortfall of 100 million of them .
