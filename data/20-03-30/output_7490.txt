Kena Betancur/Getty  " We 're busier here than we 've ever been , " says Ryan Campbell , co-founder of Desert Door Distillery in Driftwood , Texas .
But it 's not their well-regarded sotol from locally harvested desert plants that 's got them running flat out .
It 's blending their alcohol with glycerol and hydrogen peroxide in vats , then putting it in plastic bottles and giving it away .
" The liquor we use to make this is very expensive , " Campbell says .
Desert Door was among the first wave of hundreds of distillers who swiftly geared up to make hand sanitizer .
Being smaller often brings disadvantages in a crowded marketplace , but it does allow many to produce something new virtually overnight .
Sanitizer , as we all now know , is the Maginot Line against coronavirus .
A well-applied dose can help prevent transmission from person to person .
Soap and water does the same , but is less convenient for maintaining germ-free hands during the day .
So , it 's become an essential weapon for first responders , as well those working in hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery stores and factories providing other vital services .
