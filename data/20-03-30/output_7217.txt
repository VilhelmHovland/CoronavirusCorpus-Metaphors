The 48-year-old Uber driver and Subway worker from Delaware has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , which means contracting the coronavirus could be deadly for him .
He is in self-quarantine at his sister 's house in the West Bank , but his medication is running out -- with no way to get more -- and travel restrictions have blocked him from returning to the U .
With the help of U .
diplomatic officials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted permission to fly home later this week from Tel Aviv , Israel -- if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does n't lock down the country to contain the spread of the coronavirus .
In this March 12 , 2020 photo made available by Reem Mousa , Ismail Mousa and his daughter Anisa of Selbyville , Delaware , pose for a photograph while sightseeing near the Palestinian village of Qaryout in the West Bank .
Mousa and his daughter found themselves stranded and separated from each other after their travels plans and efforts to return home were thwarted because of the coronavirus pandemic .
( Photo : Reem Mousa , AP )  " If I get the virus , I will be gone , " Mousa said in a telephone interview from the small West Bank village of Qaryout .
The Palestinian Authority , which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank , has reported more than 100 cases of coronavirus .
Mousa , a U .
citizen and West Bank native who has lived in the United States for the past 22 years , traveled with Anisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Bank several days later .
They were supposed to stay until March 31 .
When the coronavirus crisis began to worsen midmonth , Mousa was able to secure earlier plane tickets back to Delaware .
But he was n't able to use them .
With little notice , the country of Jordan halted flights out of the Amman airport on March 17 and shuttered its crossings with the West Bank .
Mousa , who holds a Palestinian ID , is not allowed to fly out of Israel 's Ben-Gurion airport , which still has a handful of flights to the U .
each day .
And while he would have been allowed earlier to travel to Israel to get the medication he needs , that country has now also closed its crossings with the West Bank because of the virus .
Further complicating things , The Palestinian Authority halted movement between communities in the West Bank on the very day Anisa went to the city of Ramallah to stay with a cousin , the child of Mousa 's brother .
So the father and daughter have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to have trouble sleeping again , " Anisa wrote last Thursday to her mother , Michelle Mousa , who said she has been sick with worry at their home in the southern Delaware town of Selbyville .
" She really just wants to come home , " Michelle Mousa said .
Family members have been working with the U .
Embassy and the office of Delaware U .
Chris Coons to try to get permission for the father and daughter to fly home .
Initially , authorities said only Anisa could leave because she is not a Palestinian ID holder and is allowed to fly out of the airport in Israel .
After days of frantically seeking help from lawmakers and diplomatic officials , Michelle Mousa , 33 , received the news on Friday that both her husband and daughter had been granted permission to fly home from Tel Aviv this week .

( Reem Mousa via AP ) ( Photo : Reem Mousa , AP )  But there was still the possibility that Netanyahu could order a lockdown .
Israel has already imposed strict restrictions on movement to contain a rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak , but several flights to the U .
continue to operate .
" Tuesday is the absolute earliest that they could leave because of this travel permit , " Michelle Mousa said .
" So if this happens before then , that is really terrifying .
"  Ismail Mousa implored Israeli and Palestinian authorities to make an exception and let him get back to his home in Delaware , where he and his wife also have a 7-year-old son and 1-year-old daughter .
" It 's an emergency .
You know all my history , you know all my background checks and everything , " he said .
" I 'm just trying to get home safely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ismail Mousa said Monday that his wife was still booking his ticket and he hoped to be home by Wednesday or Thursday .
" I feel very happy .
I 'm so ready to come home , honestly .
My daughter is so excited , " he said .
" It was a bad situation when you are away from home and the kids .
