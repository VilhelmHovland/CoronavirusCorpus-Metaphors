-- The USDA Forest Service is pausing all spring prescribed fire efforts on national forest lands across the states of Oregon and Washington .
" We care deeply about our communities across the region and did n't want to risk introducing smoke from prescribed fire into communities that may be affected by COVID-19 , " said John Giller , Director of Fire and Aviation Management for the Pacific Northwest Region of the USDA Forest Service .
" With this pause , we can better protect those who may also be in higher-risk groups for COVID-19 , such as the elderly and those with underlying respiratory conditions .
"  While frequent , low-intensity fire is essential to the long-term health of many northwest forests and communities , employee and public safety remains the top priority .
The Forest Service Pacific Northwest Region contains 17 national forests , a national scenic area , a national grassland , and two national volcanic monuments , all within the states of Oregon and Washington .
