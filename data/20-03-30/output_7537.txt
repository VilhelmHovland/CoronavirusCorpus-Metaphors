She wanted to use her platform to help others .
Now she has found that organization .

This is an organization that runs events and concerts to promote human rights .
Punk Rock Saves Lives also helps with health concerns .
Right now one huge health concern is the fact that N95 masks and gloves are very hard to find .
Punk Rock Saves Lives is looking to donate as many of those items as they can to hospitals .

We can all help , but a lot of that includes doing our part with social distancing and discouraging any risky behavior until this coronavirus pandemic is under control .
