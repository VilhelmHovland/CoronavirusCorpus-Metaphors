More than 200 homeless people were moved to the YMCA in Orlando East on Friday night after the start of the national lockdown imposed by President Cyril Ramaphosa .
City of Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo announced that a group of homeless people were to be moved from Braamfontein to Orlando in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus .
However , residents of Orlando said the city failed to provide the new arrivals with basic necessities such as food and security .
Mduduzi Ngwenya said he was shocked on Saturday morning when a group of about five people went into his home and asked his family for food .
" They knocked on the door and told us they were hungry .
They asked for food and said they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They said they were not given any food since they arrived on Friday night .
It 's clear they were just dumped here without a plan .
"  He said he and his family were initially scared when the group entered their home .
" It 's concerning because the president said everyone must be home and that we should not be visiting each other .
"  As South Africa goes into a 21-day lockdown over the Covid-19 outbreak , many are concerned for dependants and society 's most vulnerable .
Social grant recipients can still collect their money and buy food , while shelters are being identified for the homeless .
Here 's all you need to know about how the lockdown will impact dependants &amp; society 's vulnerable .
Miriam Shabalala , another resident , said she was concerned by the lack of security at the facility .
" They were jumping over the walls , saying they were better off on the streets because at least they can find something to eat there .
But here , they said they were left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure they were taken care of .
" We have n't seen the army since the lockdown and we have n't seen a lot of police officers patrolling the area , so we do n't know what will happen if the homeless have the virus and are spreading it .
"  Mayoral spokesperson Mlimandlela Ndamase said the City would like to apologise to the community of Orlando East .
He said the number of homeless persons grew overnight as word spread they would be accommodating the homeless .
" As these growing numbers were not anticipated , this resulted in the shortage of food and other supplies .
" The city has moved the homeless on Saturday to various recreational centres .
