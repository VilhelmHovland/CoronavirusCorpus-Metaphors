5 more virus rapid test kits get FDA OK ; DOH eyes more labs  DESPITE the approval of five more rapid test kits for Covid-19 on Monday , an official of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) stressed the need for the Department of Health ( DOH ) to increase the number of capable laboratories accredited to perform the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) confirmatory tests .
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the rapid test kits will yield a faster result compared to PCR-based kits , but it is important that a trained health professional is available to evaluate and interpret the results .
" We have to be very cautious in using these rapid test kits because they measure antibodies and not the viral load itself .
The body takes time to develop antibodies and this might give a negative result for patients who have been infected but have not yet developed antibodies .
A positive result due to cross reaction with other bacteria or viruses is also possible , which is why a confirmatory PCR-based test is still required , " Domingo explained as he underscored the need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA remains steadfast in its obligation to protect the public .

As a safety precaution , the FDA shall require the product inserts or label of the rapid test kits to state the following : " This product is strictly for medical professional use only and not intended for personal use .
The administration of the test and interpretation of results should be done by a trained health professional .
Confirmatory testing is required .
