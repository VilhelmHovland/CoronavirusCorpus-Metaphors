TORONTO -- From anti-doping to coaching education to most recently the Canadian team 's bold move to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympics amid the COVID-19 pandemic , Canada has historically been a leader on the global sports landscape .
Gretchen Kerr believes Canada could lead the way in tackling abuse in sports -- but the University of Toronto kinesiology and physical education professor said the country has a long way to go .
" We 've done a thorough analysis of what other countries are doing , and each of the other countries has a piece of this puzzle , but nobody has all of it , " Kerr said .
" So coming up with such a model would put Canada back on the map as a leader in this area .
"  Canada has had numerous high-profile sexual harassment and abuse cases over the past 18 months , most recently that of longtime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime coaching ban Wednesday from Athletics Canada .
Kerr , who specializes in research in athlete maltreatment , co-authored a paper last month with fellow U of T professors Bruce Kidd and Peter Donnelly titled " Advancing Safe Sport in Canada : A Statement of Independence .
"  The central debate was around the complaint and investigative processes , which the three argue should be independent from sport organizations .
There has been a groundswell of vocal support from athletes and others in Canada 's sports community for an independent body to handle abuse complaints .
" I 've been arguing is that if we can set up an independent body for doping control , and an independent agency for dispute resolution , the very least we can do is set up an independent agency to ensure the safety of athletes , " Donnelly said .
Donnelly believes that sport organizations are concerned about the consequences of having a safe place to report complaints , that perhaps Canada has only seen the tip of the iceberg , and an independent place to report would lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out anyway in trickles , in drops and drabs , but I think they 're expecting it will be a flood , which is what the U .
has found , and that 's just for sexual abuse in the U .
, " he said .
" They 're overwhelmed at the moment , they ca n't keep up with the case loads .
" What we were guestimating , it would probably take 10 years to clear the deck and change the culture of sport , to get everybody onside with a new way of doing business .
"  Each national sport organization handles complaints differently , which present different degrees of conflict of interest , say Kerr and Donnelly .
Some NSOs , such as Athletics Canada in the Scott-Thomas case , use independent investigators .
But the triage -- determining whether an investigation is needed , etc .
-- is still done by the individual sport organizations .
" Keeping the foxes in charge of the hen houses , " Donnelly said .
Money is another huge concern .
Donnelly said a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are saying " we 're not equipped to do this , we ca n't afford to do this .
"  Kerr noted the cost of the Dave Brubaker case .
The former Canadian Olympic women 's gymnastics coach was found not guilty of two sex-related charges levelled by a former athlete .
" ( Gymnastics Canada ) spent a fortune on the Brubaker case , " Kerr said .
" Sports organizations are paying a fortune for independent investigators .
And you contrast that to having a centralized body of trained people who can deal with issues regardless of sport , regardless of geographical location across the country , it would be a far cheaper model .
"  Kerr , Kidd and Donnelly would like to see a single , independent body that would have trained people to triage , gather information and adjudicate in cases , maintain a national , publicly accessible database of those criminally convicted or suspended , and provide referrals to independent support for complainants and provide education on safe sport .
Track and field has been shaken by several recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university cross-country and track titles , was accused of inappropriate relationships with athletes .
And while none of those allegations have been proven in court , former middle-distance runner Megan Brown came forward in a Globe and Mail article last month alleging Scott-Thomas groomed her for a sexual relationship when she was 17 .
Last May , former Ottawa Lions coach Andy McInnis and board member Ken Porter received lifetime bans from Athletics Canada for allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct .
The allegations have not been proven in court .
McInnis , who coached Canada 's 4x100-metre relay team to gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics , won an appeal to the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada ( SDRCC ) , which ruled some bias among the commissioner 's office .
McInnis remains provisionally suspended while under investigation from a new commissioner .
Earlier this month , Sudbury , Ont .
, coach David Case was convicted of one count of sexual assault , one count of assault causing bodily harm , and one count of assault concerning a female athlete in the mid-1980s to early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his former athletes Celine Loyer were convicted of sexual assault by a different judge following another trial for an incident in 2011 .
While the sentencing of U .
gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar two years ago might have been a watershed moment for sexual harassment and assault in sport , Canada has had its share of high-profile cases .
Marcel Aubut resigned as Canadian Olympic Committee president in 2015 after an investigation over numerous sexual harassment complaints .
In June of 2019 , several former members of Canada 's ski team spoke publicly about the abuse suffered at the hands of former coach Bertrand Charest in the 1990s .
Charest was convicted last year of 37 offences of sexual assault and exploitation .
