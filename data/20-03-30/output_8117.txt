Photo : Amy Graff / SFGate  How a San Francisco restaurant reinvented itself to survive in the age of COVID-19  1 / 94  Back to Gallery  As COVID-19 began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash into building out a new room in his San Francisco restaurant , Prairie .
It featured private ticketed dinners with a new menu at each event .
But when the project was complete and he was hosting his first gatherings around a massive custom-made redwood table the last week in February , he quickly realized that if the virus took hold in San Francisco , this new concept would n't be appropriate .
" I was pretty sure this whole family-style thing with strangers was n't going to work , " Strong said .
" I thought if this comes here , I 'm not a big enough restaurant group to close and wait it out .
I 'm the sole owner-operator .
The obvious immediate thing was to do takeout and delivery .
"  Strong already knows the takeout business .
After leaving his post as executive chef of the Delfina Restaurant Group in 2017 , he started the city 's first delivery-only restaurant , Young Fava , running the business through apps and cooking in the Vietnamese pho eatery Turtle Tower .
The margins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city were forced to shutter , everyone would pivot to takeout and the market would become saturated .
The easy route would have been to count his losses and walk away from the year-old Mission District restaurant , letting all his employees and space go .
But Strong is n't the kind of guy to sit on the couch amid a global pandemic .
The longtime chef , who has worked in New York , Minnesota and San Francisco , was going to get food to the people .
When he saw the photos of empty grocery store shelves overseas , he knew what his calling would be .
" I thought maybe we can help people get their hands on all the stuff that 's going to be out in the grocery stores , like pasta , pasta sauces , beans , TP .
Even though we did n't use most of them in our actual restaurant , I started to research and make plans to bring in products .
From the start our M .
has been bulk goods , trying to price them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day San Francisco Mayor London Breed issued a shelter-in-place order calling on all restaurants to close except for takeout , Strong had already converted his restaurant into a general store .
" One thing being a small independent solo operation has taught me in a year is to take some punches , figure stuff out and make quick decisions on the fly , " he said .
On 19th Street near Mission , Prairie General Store is open Monday through Friday , 10 a .
to 7 p .
, and soon customers will be able to make reservations .
The tables where guests once dined now hold dozens of products : Spanish chorizo , bottles of puttanesca sauce , jars of lentil soup , Marcona almonds .
While this might sound like fancy fare , there are loads of basic staples : dry pastas , canned beans and stock .
" We 're trying to not be too gourmet , " he said .
" I do n't want to be a yuppie food boutique .
We 're selling Gold Medal cornbread mix .
I 'm from Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was growing up .
"  Eggs are sold by the flat , and loaves of Acme bread are delivered daily .
Fresh meats are available , from bacon to whole chickens , and there 's a big alcohol selection , including pre-made cocktails .
Perhaps , most importantly , the tables are stocked with toilet paper , wipes and gallon-size bottles of commercial sanitizer and hand soap .
Strong has also started selling meal kits , including the fixings for beef cheek papparadelle .
Prairie 's pastry chef Alison Sullivan has put together a " bake a rhubarb cream pie " kit and created a YouTube video to help you put it together at home .
" I have never done a grocery store before , " he said .
" I was calling my mom for help and she reminded me my great-grandparents in Dubuque , Iowa , opened a general store after the tail end of the depression .
"  Shopping at Prairie is offered in a space cleaned constantly with workers wearing gloves and masks .
Gloves are also provided for shoppers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's sanitized after each use .
" We offer our own quirky version of curbside pickup , which for us means pulling up at the side door on San Carlos , laying on the horn and telling us your name , and then we pop your order in your trunk .
"  While Strong was n't able to hold onto his entire staff , he has retained eight employees to run the operation .
He 's not sure yet how the financials will land , but right now he 's thankful to be open and getting people food .
" I sort of just ran with it , wanting to keep the lights on and keep some people working , " he said .
" I did n't put together a PnL for it .
I did n't do a sales projection for it .
I figured , people are going to need s -- .
I can get s -- .
I 'm just starting to wrap my head around it .
I figure if we can ride this thing out rather than completely boarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's time to drop it back into restaurant mode .
"  And surprisingly , there has been a silver lining in all of this .
" I 've been home having dinner with my girlfriend for an entire week every night and that never happened running restaurant , " he said .
" This is n't a bad way to go down in the apocalypse .
