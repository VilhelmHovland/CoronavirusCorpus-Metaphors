Love , loss and longing in times of coronavirus  A 25-year-old male client tells me : " I ca n't talk at home as the walls are too thin , so I have come to my building terrace .
I really need the session as I 'm feeling claustrophobic , anxious and ca n't tell this to anyone .
You know that over the last five years , my father and I have barely spoken to each other and now we are stuck in the same house with the lockdown happening .
To put it in a gentler way , let 's say we have tolerated each other 's presence .
I feel frustrated and I 'm sure he feels that too .
Earlier I would spend most days at work and only return home for dinner .
I miss my work ; it was my escape .
"  A 52-year-old woman tells me : " It 's been strange , the lockdown is changing our marriage .
Over last few years , we both were so busy and maybe caught up that we checked out of the relationship .
Now when he is helping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over small things , I feel we are falling in love all over again .
We were seeing old pictures when he held my hand and said , ' I 'm sorry for all those times I was not there .
' We both ended up crying .
He said we would go for couples ' therapy when all this ends .
You know this did n't make me as happy as I thought it should .
My worry is what will happen to us when the lockdown is over ? "  In the past couple of weeks , with the Covid-19 pandemic and now the lockdown relationships are changing all over the globe .
A pandemic of this magnitude has made us aware of our own mortality and that of others too , hence the anticipatory grief .
The nationwide lockdown has left people with an uncertainty , a feeling of being in a limbo .
Also cabin fever -- a feeling of agitation and sense of restlessness that comes with being stuck in a space .
What most people are experiencing is a feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would normalise seem elusive .
While there are financial losses , there is also loss of autonomy , personal space , our freedom , safety and even physical , social intimacy .
These are losses that are very hard to articulate , but deeply felt .
Dr Kenneth Doka , Professor of Gerontology at the College of New Rochelle Graduate School , coined the term ' Disenfranchised Grief ' .
He defined it as : " Grief that persons experience when they incur a loss that is not or can not be openly acknowledged , socially sanctioned or publicly mourned .
" I feel given the pandemic and the lockdown we all are struggling with it .
For years , having tea and reading the newspapers has been acentering ritual for me and the last few days with the papers not coming home , that 's a loss too .
Whether people articulate or not , there is a feeling that there is loss of time , loss of hope particularly in relation to the policymakers , healthcare systems and our larger world narrative .
These losses if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paranoia amongst other things .
Parents are deeply worried that children are missing their friends and struggling with nightmares where their sense of safety and security is threatened .
Most households have asked their staff to not come to work and as result there is a loss of liberties that one could take when it came to household work .
Couples are finding themselves at loggerheads when it comes to the so called gender roles .
While all literature is reminding people to enjoy time with their families , for those in physically abusive relationships/marriages , these 21 days are trauma with no way out .
People are feeling deeply lonely in their own homes .
All those questions about ' What 's the first thing you would do when this is over ' are a reflection of the longing that we all carry within us .
A longing to go back and hold hands with a romantic partner , a yearning for restaurant food and a sharp desire to be in an empty house when everyone has gone to work .
Like everyone else I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and time ? Would this forced pause change us forever ? It 's alright to not have the answers .
Give yourself the permission to feel the emotions and even accept that you feel a sense of loss .
There has never been a time before where we have needed this degree of self-compassion and mindfulness .
Maybe we all need to find new ways of finding hope , holding our own ground and even rediscovering mindfulness .
The next article explores this .
