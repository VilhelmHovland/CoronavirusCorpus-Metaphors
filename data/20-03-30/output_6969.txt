I have never been more moved by applause that was n't for me .
" There 's a darker side to this , too , he noted .
" Since the Big Apple 's the current epicenter of the COVID-19 epicenter , residents of other states are rallying together to support New Yorkers -- and rallying , I mean running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every American is grateful for all of our heroic medical workers , and we want to make sure that they get all the supplies they need , " Colbert said .

Catherine Garcia  Three-quarters of Americans have been urged or ordered to stay at home , to the extent possible , to stop the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus , and those measures appear to be working , The New York Times reports , citing data from internet-connected thermometer company Kinsa .
The thermometers and their app upload temperature readings to a centralized database , allowing Kinsa to track fevers across the country .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it modified its software to look for " atypical " COVID-19 fevers earlier in March .
Kinsa 's million-plus thermometers have been recording up to 162,000 readings from around the U .
each day since the coronavirus started spreading , the Times reports .
Only strict social-distancing measures -- closing bars and restaurants , asking people to shelter in place -- led to a significant drop in fever readings , while declaring a state of emergency or limiting the size of public gatherings had little effect .
Data from New York and Washington State 's health departments have buttressed Kinsa 's findings , showing drops in hospitalizations a few days after Kinsa spotted the falloff in fevers .
The Kinsa readings certainly look " like a way to prove that social distancing works , " Dr .
William Schaffner at Vanderbilt University tells the Times .
" But it does shows that it takes the most restrictive measures to make a real difference .
" Kinsa data appears to show that social distancing is also reducing transmission of the seasonal flu .

The New York Timesobtained an audio recording of the phone call , in which Montana Gov .
