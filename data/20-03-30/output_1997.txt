Singapore has reported a surge in infections to 844 as of Sunday .
It could take several years for the coronavirus to go around the world and run its course unless something happens to abort that process , says Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong , adding that the world will have to brace itself for a long battle ahead , the Straits Times reports .
In an interview on Sunday with CNN 's Fareed Zakaria , Lee said he hesitates to call Singapore a " success story " in containing the spread of the virus .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak , he said : " I hesitate to talk about success because we are right in the midst of a battle , which is intensifying .
"  He does not see the pandemic going away in a couple of months and expects it to spread to other parts of the world such as India , Africa , Southeast Asia and Latin America .
" By the time it goes around the world , and then finally runs its course , I think that is several years , unless something happens to abort that process .
"  A third patient has died in Singapore from complications due to coronavirus infection on Sunday , the Ministry of Health said .
The patient , a 70-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to affected countries and regions , died at 12:12pm , Channel News Asia reports .
Fareed also asked about the role of the United States in the pandemic , noting that President Donald Trump did not seem interested in taking the lead .
Lee said the world has greatly benefited from American leadership in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different mode , well , we will get by and I think other configurations will eventually work out , but it would be a loss .
"  America , he added , has the resources , the science , the influence , the soft power , and the track record of dealing with these problems convincingly and successfully .
" It is a pity not to put those resources to work now , to deal with this very grave challenge to mankind .
"  He also called upon the US and China - which have been pointing fingers at each other for the virus to work together to combat the pandemic .
" It is a most unfortunate situation to be in .
I mean , US-China relations have been complicated even before this .
But if we are going to deal with this virus , you have got to get all the countries to be working together , in particular , the US and China .
" Under the best of circumstances , it is going to be a very difficult challenge for mankind .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blaming one another for inventing the virus and letting it loose on the world , I do not think that that is going to help us solve the problem sooner .
"  China , where the virus originated , had been criticized for not being sufficiently transparent about the crisis during its early days .
Asked whether that had - as some critics charged - exacerbated the situation , Lee said : " I am sure that there were many aspects of the Chinese response to this outbreak which they will look back upon and believe that they should have done better .
" But I do not think overall that one can say this would not have happened if only the Chinese had done the right thing .
Because you look at the way the outbreak has continued to grow and spread in many countries , and they do not have the Chinese government and yet they have not found it easy to keep the outbreak under control in their country .
" I think that we are in a very difficult situation and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the best way to move forward and deal with a problem which we now have .
"  He said that Singapore took the virus very seriously from the beginning .
" We watched what was happening in Wuhan , in China .
We prepared our people .
In fact , we have been preparing for this since Sars , which was 17 years ago .
"  Asked if Singapore had been able to contain the virus because of its " paternalistic system , " Lee said that the Government had not exercised " extraordinary powers .
' '  Instead , he said , in the battle against the virus , trust and transparency are key .
" We put a lot of effort into explaining to the public what is happening , speaking to them and I have done it a few times directly on television , so people know that we are level and we tell it straight .
" We are transparent - if there is bad news , we tell you .
If there are things which need to be done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain that trust because if people do not trust you , even if you have the right measures , it is going to be very hard to get it implemented .
