The Government has declared mining and industries of chromite , coal , iron ore , manganese and some other minerals as essential , for which the production of all this continues in the district .
With the mining and industrial activities continuing involving thousands of workers , the workers are at a high risk of the disease .
Besides , the return of thousands of migrant workers to their villages is another great threat for the spread of the disease .
Earlier studies reveal that about two lakh labourers migrate outside the district for work and it is found many such migrant labourers are back following the nationwide lockdown .
But the exact statistics are unknown both to administration or other agencies .
Hence , health checkup and other remedial measures for these people are yet to be done .
By the time any patient is detected , infection would have spread to thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Absence of any transport system also makes the situation further grave for the patients to reach the hospitals except by ambulances .
The mining areas of Joda , Barbil and Champua are considered to be more sensitive .
According to the district health information centre , only 37 recent travellers have registered themselves through the toll-free No .
104 out of which 10 have completed their quarantine period and 27 are still under home quarantine .
Fortunately , none of them tested so far is corona positive .
