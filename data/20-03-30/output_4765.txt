The upside of the lockdown -- Europe shows off its cleaner air  Air pollution has fallen in urban areas across Europe during lockdowns to combat the coronavirus , dramatic satellite images show .
Average levels of noxious nitrogen dioxide fell in cities such as Brussels , Paris , Madrid , Milan and Frankfurt from March 5-25 ( compared with the same period in 2019 ) , according to Sentinel-5 satellite images released on Monday .
That coincides with lockdowns in many European countries that have curbed road transport -- the largest source of nitrogen oxides -- and slowed output at gas-emitting factories .
The new images , released by the European Space Agency and analysed by the non-profit European Public Health Alliance , show the changing density of nitrogen dioxide , which can cause respiratory problems and cancer , like heat maps .
Daily weather events can influence atmospheric pollution so the satellite pictures took a 20-day average and excluded readings where cloud cover reduced the quality of the data .
Data from the European Environment Agency showed a similar trend from March 16-22 .

However , the EPHA said people living in polluted cities might be more at risk from COVID-19 because prolonged exposure to bad air can weaken immune systems .
" That connection is very likely , " EPHA clean air policy manager Zoltan Massay-Kosubek said .
" But because the disease is new , it still has to be demonstrated .
"  Air pollution can cause or exacerbate lung cancer , pulmonary disease and strokes .
It 's not the first sign of reduced pollution amid coronavirus lockdowns .
Early in March , residents of Venice said the abrupt drop in tourist numbers because of Italy 's shutdown meant the city 's famous canals were cleaner than they had been for years .
China also recorded a drop in nitrogen dioxide pollution in cities in February , when the government imposed draconian lockdown measures to contain the raging coronavirus epidemic .

Countries that went into lockdown later -- such as Britain , which did so on March 23 -- are likely to enjoy a similar pollution reprieve in coming weeks , EPHA said .
