' How we 're coping with working and home schooling under the same roof '  With the Australian government 's guidelines tightening each day in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus , many mothers and fathers around the country are finding themselves juggling work and home-schooling under the same roof .
Claire ( surname withheld ) is a freelance journalist with three kids under the age of 10 .
She and her husband have been working from home together and home schooling their kids for the last two weeks .
" I went into lockdown with a certain kind of arrogance .
I 've worked from my home office for years so I 'm used to a pretty solitary lifestyle , but I guess I had n't really thought about how difficult it would become for me to do my job ( writing requires a quiet space and plenty of time for reflection ) once everybody else was under the same roof every day .
The first couple of days felt like a bit of a novelty , so we were n't at all stressed .
We were casual about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being done and we took time to enjoy lunch together in the garden .
But that all changed when set schoolwork began rolling in every day -- along with a pretty tight schedule of how each day should look .
I took one look at my long list of deadlines and felt my stress levels rising .
I could n't see how I could stay on top of my work , the schoolwork , the housework and still try to take time out for myself to try to decrease my anxiety .
My husband said we would do things 50/50 but his job is less flexible than mine , so of course this means I 'm doing the lion 's share and my resentment levels are building .

The schoolwork itself has been pretty easy to keep on top of , but I am concerned about how a lengthy period of isolation will affect the kids so I make sure I lock in daily zoom conversations with school friends and I push them out into the garden during recess and lunch to get some much-needed outdoor time .
Everything feels like it should all fit into one big jigsaw puzzle but I 'm missing half the pieces .
"  Tim O'Connell is co-parenting his two children , six and four , with his ex , while he works from home alongside his partner Rachael .
They 've been home schooling for the past week .
" It 's been a stressful start to the year for us .
The kids were evacuated to Christmas Island from Wuhan , where they were with their mother for Chinese New Year .
Because they started the school year quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social networking parents tend to rely on during difficult times .
We 're feeling it now .
When you 've got your kids away from their friends , you need to find ways to keep them socialised and we 're trying to navigate our way through that .
Our situation is quite a unique one .
The kids are being home schooled by their mum between Monday and Wednesday , and my partner Nat and I home school on Thursday and Friday .
We live in a block where Nat 's mother lives out the front and we 're out the back in a converted stable so we get quite a lot of support .
Both of us are in the tech industry , which is pretty much set up to work remotely and we work long hours in the beginning of the week to help us gear up for the second half .
Last week , we took turns so that one of us was with helping the kids while the other was in the home office next door .
That 's the way it has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this : you do n't get any work done when you 're at home with the kids .
" How do you make sure everyone 's mental health is on track and stays on track ? " ( iStock )  Some of the apps used to deliver the schoolwork could be better , but I believe the school is dealing with it as best as they can .
I 'm actually surprised by how much I 'm enjoying teaching the kids .
I 've got both of their Seasaw apps going , the printer at the table printing all of heir past activities , and there 's a real sense of satisfaction when it come to being involved in their education .
We follow the daily schedule set by the school .
At crunch and sip time , we 're having crunch and sip and during what would be their sports lesson , we 're doing physical activity in the backyard .
Having everyone know what 's expected of them every day helps alleviate some of the stress and uncertainty .
The hardest part about all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you make sure everyone 's mental health is on track and stays on track ? I know we 're lucky that we have two sets of parents to share the load and the kids are n't confined in the same space every day .
They move between two homes , they have two dogs and there 's a change of scene every week .
That said , it 's still something to be mindful of .
Obviously we need to do what we can so our kids do n't fall behind , but we also need to cut ourselves some slack as working parents and be realistic about the expectations we set ourselves .
We ca n't do it all .
"  Janelle* is in PR and has been at home with the children for the past week while her husband continues to work from the office .
One child is in year seven and the other is in year four .
" I had n't planned to go into lockdown so soon , but one of my children coughed at school and that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally , I had to move everything to my dining table but I do n't actually put any of my work on it until 3 .
when the ' school day ' is finished and I can turn my attention to my own job .
My husband is still working at the office and will continue to do so because his job is considered an essential service .
I 'm grateful one of us has a job we can count on but that does mean he has to be careful when he comes home .
He always goes and gets changed and washes before he gives us a hug and kiss ( we have to extra careful because I have an elderly father I need to be able to visit ) .
Of course , the fact that he 's continuing to work outside the family home means schooling our children falls to me and me alone .
" I 'm lucky if I can answer a single email before 3pm but I 'm learning to be flexible and go with the flow .

With her school , there 's a roll call where she has to declare herself present just before 9am , there 's a strict timetable and there 's a steady stream of work sent across by her teacher .
My son started high school earlier this year so that 's a little more complicated but he 's trying to get on top of his schedule .
The setup is n't brilliant ; we live in a tiny , two-bedroom apartment so we 're on top of each other all day long and our dining table works as the classroom , the home office and where we enjoy our meals so that can be a little tough .
I 'm lucky if I can answer a single email before 3pm but I 'm learning to be flexible and go with the flow .
Obviously the amount of work I 've got on has decreased and while that presents its own challenges , I really believe this has brought us closer together .
We 're part of a very large clog and everyone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than others , but I figure there 's no point feeling sorry for ourselves because there 's always someone else out there doing it much worse .
