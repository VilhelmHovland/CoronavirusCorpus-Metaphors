News from LDR Emergency measures have been put in place during the covid-19 Level 4 alert to keep the Wellington Regional Council able to make decisions .
The council 's Deputy Chair Adrienne Staples says the 13-person board has passed rules for emergency delegations during the heightened level of response to the virus .
The message to stay at home has applied to the regional authority 's representatives .
Staples , the former South Wairarapa Mayor , has taken similar moves to the district in removing a physical quorum for regional council committees for the duration of the Level 4 alert .
However due to statutory requirements , the regional council board and the Wellington Regional Strategy Committee can not be reduced .
Councillors can however meet remotely during the highest level alert .
This will remain until the alert returns to a lower level .
" When we go back to level 3 , we 've reduced our quorum for our committees , " she said .
" So we do n't need to have people going into a room and meeting physically unless they absolutely have to .
"  Staples said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to follow guidelines , but do not be scared .
" We need to be sensible and do what we told , but it 's really important we do n't wind ourselves into a knot over this .
I 'm hearing people say they 're scared to go out .
I know the risk is heightened but things have been put in place to help us get through this , so what I say is take it seriously , do as we 're told , but do n't wind yourself up .
The stress does n't help to keep us well .
It 's not helpful .
"  The regional council 's board next meets , remotely , on April 9 .
All other meetings have been cancelled .
The exception was a Wellington regional civil defence meeting , which happened remotely today .
