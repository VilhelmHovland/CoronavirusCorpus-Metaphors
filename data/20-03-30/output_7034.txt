Base Camp for Fly Fishing Travel , Gear , Trips , Reviews and News  Video : Going Green -- Green Drakes on the Metolius River from Todd Moen and Catch Magazine  Fly fishing a green drake hatch on the Metolius River in a great video from Todd Moen and Catch Magazine !  From Catch Magazine :  " Ten years ago I produced ' Going Green ' for Catch Magazine , July 2010 Issue #12 .
This was before aerial cameras , before social media .
Another world .
Now today we are all under the COVID-19 social distancing rules as of March 2020- a good time to add this film to the online community we 're all depending on during the crisis .
This blast from the past is a gift to honor the old films from the Catch Vault that have been sitting on old drives collecting dust .
' Going Green ' features a great trip I took ten years ago , accompanied by a few friends to create the 12th film for Catch Magazine http : //www .

We hit a local favorite , the Metolius River in Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal clear and has some of the most prolific hatches that fly anglers dream of .
It 's no easy day on the water though ; It 's match the hatch and hard wading .
If you get one or two fish you 've had a great day .
It 's for the beauty of the water and the environment that you go to the location .
if you get a few of these beautiful trout , that 's just the icing on the cake .
For this film , my buddy Eric Neufeld was the angler on camera , and we had some great help from our local fly shop owner , Jeff Perin from The Fly Fishers Place here in Sisters , Oregon .
This was Green Drake time , end of June and perfect to be on the water to capture these big bugs on film .
I also want to thank my wingman , Brian O'Keefe , for being our net wrangler to catch a few green drakes for the production .
I hope you enjoy " Going Green " during these strange days of 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please support those local shops like The Fly Fisher 's Place who are the blood line of or industry .

Stay safe and keep dreaming of the river .
