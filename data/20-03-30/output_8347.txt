Coronavirus : Ohio extends K-12 school closure until May , raising questions for students  Ohio Gov .
Mike DeWine said Monday that a statewide K-12 school closure , initially set to end April 3 , will be extended until May 1 .
DeWine initially ordered all schools to close to students and shift to distance learning beginning March 17 , shortly after the novel coronavirus began spreading in Ohio .
Distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources and the resources of their students , will continue at least through April .
" Is it possible that we will have to continue the way it is now , remotely , until the end of the school year ? Yes , it is , " DeWine said .
" That is certainly possible .
"  He added that the safety of students and their families is driving the closure decisions , as children , " like everyone else , can be a carrier .
"  But the decision still weighs heavily on students , their parents and their teachers , even if it was n't entirely unexpected .
Vaughn Robison , a senior at Turpin High School , said many of his friends are dejected about missing what would have been their final sports season .
Prom , set for late April , is likely another casualty of the extended closure .
Robison and others had also spent months organizing another dance , a " spring fling , " only to learn their efforts were made in vain .

Less apparent downsides trouble Robison , too .
For example , the " huge fashion guy " said last year he was snubbed from a section of the yearbook dedicated to fashion .
In the final weeks of school , he 'd been hoping to earn a spot on the page by flashing his brands .
Robison has joked with friends in recent days that school officials could read graduates ' names during a " huge livestream " graduation event .
Then maybe they 'll receive digital diplomas .
Though Ohio has n't yet canceled in-person K-12 classes for the rest of the school year , other states have done so .
Kansas , Virginia and Oklahoma were the first three states to shutter school buildings for the remainder of the academic year , according to Education Week , which is tracking school closure decisions in every state .

Cincinnati Enquirer  Despite the closures , advanced placement exams , which reward those who pass them with college credit , will still take place this spring .
The College Board , which administers the tests , announced it will shift to a shortened online testing format .
Amy Randolph , the principal of Oyler School within Cincinnati Public , said last week that an extended school cancelation will " definitely be a learning experience for all of us .
"  " I have to support what 's best for the community , " Randolph said .
But she is saddened for her students .
If the closure threatens graduation , officials will work to reschedule a ceremony , Randolph said .
" I think our district would do whatever it takes to graduate , " she said .
" I think there will still be a ceremony .
"  Yousuf Munir , a junior at Walnut Hills High School , said he 's most concerned for families who may struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for additional ways to " help people in this unprecedented time where everyone is just trying to figure stuff out .
"  He acknowledged he 'll also miss attending class in school and interacting with friends and teachers .
Lately he 's tried to keep in touch with friends through group calls , FaceTime and texting .
" I really hope all the kids who need school are going to be OK , " he said .
At CPS , about 15% of students do n't have a computer at home , and 10% are without home internet access , according to Census estimates .
That technology gap led the district to turn to paper packets to deliver work to students in the initial weeks of the closure .
DeWine addressed learning disparities on Monday , saying he 's heard concerns from some Ohio superintendents that " their particular students are going to be further behind .
And the reason is that not every school has the same ability to do distance learning .
" These are things that we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " DeWine added .
" How do we compensate these kids for that ? How do we give them that extra help ? "  CPS will launch a remote learning plan for all students later this week , according to Fran Russ , a district spokesperson .
" This plan includes materials to serve students who do not have access to technology or internet at home , " Russ wrote .
" The district is also exploring opportunities to broadcast academic lessons through cable partners to ensure that content gets to as many students as possible .
"  The CDC and a new study look at how long the coronavirus can live on surfaces .
USA TODAY  How do school closures help fight a virus ?  Short- to medium-term school closures have currently not been shown to affect the spread of COVID-19 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
But long-term closures of eight weeks or more may contribute to preventing the spread COVID-19 .
However , the CDC analyzed school closures in other countries , finding " those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had more success in reducing spread than those that did not ( like Singapore ) .
"  But even so , school closures should be considered as part of a larger prevention response in communities with cases of the novel coronavirus , the CDC says .
Other research , on the effect school closures have against the spread of other viruses , has shown more significant impacts .
A study in the Journal of the American Medical Association analyzed the effect of interventions such as closing schools on combating the 1918-1919 Influenza Pandemic .
The study found that school closures and public gathering bans implemented together was associated with a reduction in deaths during the pandemic , which killed at least 50 million people worldwide .
Those cities that implemented such interventions earlier had lower peak mortality rates and lower total deaths .
And school closures can reduce attack rates of a virus by up to 40% during a pandemic , according to a study in Nature magazine .
Nicholas Christakis , a social scientist and physician at Yale University , recently spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science Magazine .
He said reactive closures , or those undertaken when a student or staff member is sick , reduces the infection rate and delays the peak of an epidemic .
" When you postpone the peak , you also typically flatten the epidemic and space out your cases , " Christakis said .
" This has value .
It means that the incidence on any given day is lower , so we do n't overburden our health care system .
"  Proactive closures , or those implemented before a person is infected in a community , also have value , Christakis said , as they can halt interactions between adults and students , protecting communities from exposure .
