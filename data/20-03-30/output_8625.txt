Letter : Is the Border Wall Spreading the Coronavirus ?  To construct the Border Wall the contractors use subcontractors that they ship-in from out of state , such as Texas and California .
However , it is not just the workers being shuffled around the country to build the Border Wall , they are also bringing in their families to create make-shift RV parks and tent cities here in Southern Arizona , because they consider it safer than where they are coming from .
Then the workers and their families shop in our local stores and use other public facilities , are they spreading the virus to Southern Arizona ? The transporting of workers and their families to build the Border Wall should stop immediately , if not stop all construction of the Border Wall until this healthy crisis is over .
I feel this issue should be investigated and presented to the public .
