In the first week of February , the investment management company Invesco projected that by summer the U .
economy would n't merely have recovered from a coronavirus-induced slowdown , it would be growing even stronger than it was before this pesky virus reared its ugly head .
" We 're likely to return not just to normal but above normal because of the U .
trade deal , " Invesco 's chief global market strategist Kristina Hooper told Axios .
" We got this really nice boost of sentiment coming from that phase one deal , and literally within a few days of that , global media started reporting on coronavirus .
"  On March 13 -- two days after the World Health Organization officially declared the coronavirus a global pandemic -- JPMorgan projected that the U .
economy would shrink 2 percent in the first quarter and 3 percent in the second .
Goldman Sachs , meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent growth in the second three months of the year .
Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St .
Louis projected Monday that job losses from the coronavirus recession would reach 47 million and push America 's unemployment rate to 32 .
percent -- more than 7 points higher than its Great Depression -- era peak .
All three major U .
stock indexes closed up 3 percent that same day , while JPMorgan predicted the pandemic-induced market rout 's worst days were " probably " already over .
The St .
Louis Fed 's projection is just a rough estimate , and comes with significant caveats .
For one , the study was largely conducted before last week 's stimulus bill was passed , and thus , does not account for its effects .
The report also did not attempt to project the number of Americans who would stop seeking work out of discouragement , thereby technically dropping out of the labor force and disappearing from the headline unemployment number .
Still , there 's reason to think its catastrophic prediction is in the right ballpark .
Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , and economists expect that figure to come in above 2 .
million this week .
It 's perhaps conceivable that the Federal Reserve can keep corporate America so flush with cheap credit , the stock market could avoid hitting new lows for the year , even as unemployment in the U .
surges to " higher than the Great Depression " levels .
But given Wall Street 's unblemished record of wishful thinking so far this year , it 's hard not to suspect that most every part of our economic life is going to get worse before it gets better .
