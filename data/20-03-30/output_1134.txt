The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Online Marketplace Providers  COVID-19 and the responses of local , state , federal , and foreign governments have impacted , and will continue to impact , virtually every aspect of global commerce .
Companies ( marketplace providers ) that offer online marketplaces ( e .
, websites that allow users to offer , sell , and buy or rent items , services , property or events ) ( collectively online purchases ) face unique challenges , given that their users include both buyers and sellers .
In addition , multiple agreements and policies govern transactions made through these marketplaces , including separate agreements between the buyers and sellers themselves ( user agreements ) .
In this Alert , we examine some of these challenges and how provisions in the marketplace providers ' online marketplace agreements ( OMAs ) can directly affect their options to cope with circumstances like the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions in standard OMAs that marketplace providers should review to assess their options , as well as the issues they may present for marketplace providers seeking to react quickly , equitably and transparently in response to crises like the COVID-19 pandemic .
We also provide suggestions on changes that marketplace providers may want to make in their OMAs on a going-forward basis in order to provide more flexibility to respond to similar events in the future , while at the same time ensuring greater transparency for users of their marketplaces .
Certain provisions in the online marketplace agreements ( OMAs ) may provide online purchases are controlled solely by user agreements .
Since the marketplace provider is generally not a party to these user agreements , the marketplace provider may have little or no ability to control how individual buyers and sellers will resolve issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic .
However , the marketplace provider may have reserved the right to override , or at least influence , the terms of the user agreements , including how the pandemic and issuance of related local , state and federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through its marketplace .
Even if the marketplace provider has reserved some rights to influence existing user agreements impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or COVID-19 laws , most marketplace providers will need to consider the interests of participants in their two-sided marketplace .
Any responses will need to balance the interests of the buyers and sellers , which will often be conflicting .
Checklist for provisions that may impact a marketplace provider 's response to COVID-19  1 .
Is your OMA likely to be enforced in the event of a dispute ?  Since some members of the user community will likely be upset about whatever steps the marketplace provider may take in a situation like the one we currently face , the marketplace provider can expect the enforceability of its OMA to be challenged .
The marketplace provider should review the steps it has taken to maximize the enforceability of its OMA to understand the likelihood it will be enforced if challenged .
If the marketplace provider is using a browsewrap agreement ( an agreement on a website that informs the user that it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the website ) , the terms of the OMA , including key terms that may protect the marketplace provider from actions taken by its buyers or sellers related to the COVID-19 pandemic ( e .
, disclaimers of warranties , limitations of liability , arbitration agreements and cancellation/refund provisions ) may not be enforceable .
See our alert on creating enforceable online agreements .
Does your OMA clearly state that the marketplace provider is not a party to user agreements ?  A buyer or a seller who entered into user agreements prior to the date on which authorities took COVID-19 related actions may seek a way to avoid their obligations under these agreements .
As such , a clear contractual statement that the marketplace provider is not a party to the user agreements is an important element to protect a marketplace provider from a claim by the party seeking to enforce the user agreement .
Marketplace providers should check to see whether their OMA includes such a provision .
While this type of provision is intended to ensure the marketplace provider will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to COVID-19 events that are typically included in the OMA ( e .
, cancellation and force majeure ) do not apply either .
Consequently , these provisions will be addressed , if at all , in the user agreements that apply to the online purchases .
Does your OMA include a provision that allows you to override certain provisions in user agreements in exceptional circumstances ?  Because an OMA almost always includes a provision that the marketplace provider is not a party to the user agreements , the marketplace provider will not be able to make changes to existing user agreements related to the COVID-19 pandemic or COVID-19 laws unless it has reserved rights to do so elsewhere in the OMA ( an exceptional circumstances provision ) .
For example , the OMA may require sellers to agree to include certain flow-down terms in their user agreements .
These flow-down provisions might provide flexibility for the marketplace provider to address exceptional circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic .
Alternatively , the OMA might include a provision pursuant to which users agree to be bound by policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also permit the marketplace provider to make future changes to these policies without the users ' consent .
Does your OMA include a provision that allows you to intervene in disputes between users related to user agreements ?  Although OMAs often provide that the marketplace provider will not intervene in disputes between users , some OMAs allow the marketplace provider to intervene in its discretion to help facilitate in the resolution of disputes ( a dispute facilitation clause ) .
A dispute facilitation clause may be particularly helpful for a marketplace provider that did not include an exceptional circumstances provision in an OMA .
The marketplace provider may be able to use the dispute facilitation clause to encourage its users to reach reasonable compromises related to the handling of online purchases that are , or will be , affected by COVID-19 or COVID-19 laws .
For example , if buyers are claiming they should obtain a full refund as a result of COVID-19 laws that frustrate the purpose of their online agreements , but sellers are resisting a full refund that could leave them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provider may decide to intervene in these disputes and convince users that it is in their mutual best interests to agree to a partial refund or a credit against future bookings .
See our alert on guidance regarding the applicability of force majeure and related doctrines in response to COVID-19 .
In all cases , but especially where the marketplace provider determines it can not control if or how user agreements are affected by exceptional circumstances like COVID-19 , the marketplace provider should check if the OMA ( or any policies issued pursuant to the OMA ) warns users of the existence of insurance that may protect them if they cancel their online purchase due to a circumstance like COVID-19 .
If the marketplace provider has recommended a specific type of insurance policy , the marketplace provider should check to see whether the policy covers buyer 's cancellation of the online purchase for COVID-19 .
If the marketplace provider recommended that the buyer purchase insurance coverage , the marketplace provider should consider including a reminder of this recommendation in any COVID-19 announcements .
If your OMA includes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a failure by your sellers and/or buyers to perform their obligations under their user agreements due to COVID-19 .
Recognize , however , that the force majeure provision , if any , is likely to only cover a failure to perform obligations in the OMA and will not cover user agreements ( since the marketplace provider is not a party to the user agreements ) .
As a result , you may want to consult with your sellers to determine whether they have included , and intend to invoke , a force majeure provision in their user agreements .
If the seller has included a force majeure provision , it is likely that it only excuses the seller 's performance in the event of a force majeure .
If the provision also excuses buyer 's performance , the marketplace provider needs to determine whether the buyer will be able to assert the provision as the basis for cancellation of the online purchase .
Many typical force majeure provisions will include a provision that the force majeure will in no circumstances apply to a party 's failure to pay money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision will preclude the application of the frustration of purpose doctrine on the basis that the buyer has in this case assumed the risk of payment regardless of such events .
Check to see if your OMA includes a right for the marketplace provider to make changes to the agreement , and if so , what requirements are placed on the making of such future changes .
Although a party to a contract does not typically have the right to unilaterally modify the contract , online providers have attempted to change this result through the use of a future changes provision , and courts have generally upheld this type of provision provided it gives users some notice and an opportunity to opt-out of the revised agreement if the user does not agree with the changes .
If there is no future changes provision , check to see if there is a provision in the OMA that allows the marketplace provider to issue new or updated policies that will be binding on users .
If there is no future changes provision in the existing OMA , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OMA may not be enforceable , any changes you make to the OMA will need to be accepted by way of a new enforceable click-to-accept process .
Keep in mind that , even if your OMA includes a future changes provision , it is unlikely that a retroactive change will be enforced ( e .
, adding an exceptional circumstances provision that applies retroactively to user agreements that were concluded prior to the effective date of the modified OMA ) .
The marketplace provider should also consider the seller 's and buyer 's rights if the user agreements do not include a force majeure provision or include a force majeure that only excuses the seller 's performance .
In these cases , the buyer may be able to successfully assert the doctrine of frustration of purpose to cancel the online purchase .
The doctrine of frustration of purpose applies where an unforeseeable supervening event ( in this case , the COVID-19 pandemic or subsequently issued COVID-19 laws ) fundamentally changes the nature of a contract and makes one party 's performance worthless to the other .
Whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and statements that the marketplace provider places in the marketplace .
The doctrine of frustration of purpose focuses on " events which materially affect the consideration received by one party for his performance .
Both parties can perform , but as a result of unforeseeable events , performance by party X would no longer give party Y what induced him to make the bargain in the first place .
" 3 Note that where the event that frustrated a party 's purpose in entering into a contract was foreseeable at the time of contracting , the defense is not available .
It is also important to note some courts have held the doctrine of frustration of purpose can not be invoked if the parties to a contract have included a force majeure clause that covers the same ground .
Overall , it is also important to note the analysis may change depending on when the online purchases were made and what was known ( or foreseeable ) at that time .
For example , the decisions made regarding a trip purchased today to a country in lockdown may be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location .
When making decisions about how to enforce your terms or setting policy , it is important to keep the facts and circumstances in mind .
Suggestions for future changes  Depending on what you uncover when working through the checklist above , and on input from your existing user base , as well as further developments related to COVID-19 , marketplace providers may want to consider making some or all of the following future changes to their online agreements and user policies :  Modify your contract formation practices to maximize the chances that your OMA will be deemed enforceable in the event of a dispute .
If it is not clear that your existing OMA is enforceable , or your OMA does not include a future changes provision , require your existing users to click-through their acceptance of your revised OMA .
Consider requiring sellers to agree to minimum terms related to cancellations and refunds , including an exceptional circumstances provision that balances the needs of both sellers and buyers in situations where a supervening event has changed the nature of the contract and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other party .
The exceptional circumstance provision should consider whether and how to address the COVID-19 events and similar circumstances , such as shelter-in-place laws and/or advisories and recommended ( but not mandated ) travel restrictions .
Note that users will not be able to rely on the doctrine of frustration of purpose where the terms of the user agreement , the OMA or an associated policy clearly call out events like pandemics , quarantines and shelter-in-place orders , since such language is likely to be construed to show that these events were foreseeable .
Because 100% refunds will be difficult on the marketplace provider as well as sellers , the marketplace provider may want to provide for , or allow sellers to select from , a menu that includes options for remedies on cancellation ( including in the event of an exceptional circumstance ) .
For example , these options could include ( a ) less than a full refund ( e .
, it should address whether the marketplace provider is entitled to retain its fees for processing of the user agreement and some compensation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future online purchases with the same seller instead of a refund ; or ( c ) a partial refund plus a credit of the remaining amounts ( or some remaining amount ) against future online purchases with the same seller .
The marketplace provider should consider requiring sellers to include a bespoke force majeure provision in their user agreements that specifically deals with the effect of pandemics , quarantines , travel restrictions and similar events on the seller 's and buyer 's ability to cancel or postpone the online purchase .
If included , the provision should explicitly provide that it replaces any rights either party may have under the doctrine of frustration of purchase or the doctrine of impossibility .
Failure to include a force majeure provision is likely to result in the application of these two doctrines , which may lead to outcomes that the parties did not intend .
The marketplace provider may want to include an informal dispute resolution process within the cancellation policy and/or the exceptional circumstance provision .
The cancellation policy should consider and address , the impact of the doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determines that COVID-19 , or a similar circumstance , does not fall within the exceptional circumstances set forth in the cancellation policy .
Buyers should receive a conspicuous disclosure before entering into a user agreement if the marketplace provider and/or the sellers do not intend to provide a full refund in the event of a COVID-19 event or similar circumstance .
In addition , the marketplace provider should consider including a provision that the buyer bears the financial risk of cancellation in such circumstances and advising the buyer to purchase an insurance policy that covers cancellation of the online purchase .
