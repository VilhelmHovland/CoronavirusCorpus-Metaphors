Hospital ship  A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived Monday morning in New York City to help relieve the coronavirus crisis gripping the city 's hospitals .
The USNS Comfort , which was sent to New York City after 9/11 , will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while hospitals treat people with COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus .
Andrew Cuomo said the hospital ship will relieve stress on city hospitals as the massive vessel pulled into a cruise ship terminal off Manhattan .
In addition to the 1,000 beds , the Comfort has 12 operating rooms that could be up and running within 24 hours .
The ship 's arrival comes as New York state 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , less than a month after the first known infection in the state .
Most of those deaths have occurred in just the past few days .
New York City , the epicenter of the U .
outbreak , reported Sunday that its toll had risen to 776 .
The total number of statewide deaths is n't expected to be released until Monday , but with at least 250 additional deaths recorded outside the city as of Sunday morning , the state 's total fatalities was at least 1,026 .
Medical masks  De Blasio and others criticized Trump for suggesting with no clear evidence that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals .
At a Sunday briefing , the president told reporters they should be asking , " Where are the masks going ? Are they going out the back door ? "  Those remarks are " insulting " to hospital workers on the front lines of the city 's coronavirus crisis , de Blasio said Monday .
" It 's incredibly insensitive to people right now who are giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what the president is talking about .
"  Hospitals had warned staff early on during the outbreak to not take masks home with them , but no evidence has emerged of large-scale looting of supplies .
Kenneth Raske , president of the Greater New York Hospital Association , said in a statement that the workers " deserve better than their president suggesting that protective equipment is ' going out the back door ' of New York hospitals .
