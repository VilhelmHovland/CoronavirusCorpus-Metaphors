COVID-19 : Banks take a hit on their spreads , lowest since April 2019  KARACHI : Pakistan 's banking sector spread fell by 33 basis points on a month-on-month basis to 5 .
in February 2020 .
This is the lowest figure since April 2019 .
Bank spread refers to the difference between the interest rate that a bank charges a borrower , and the interest rate a bank pays a depositor .
The bank spread can be thought of as a percentage that shows how much money the bank earns compared to how much it can lend out .
Pakistan 's banking industry , particularly in the last year because of higher interest rates , has been characterized by high spreads and strong profitability .
But that is set to change due to the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis , according to Hamza Kamal , senior analyst , in a research report sent to clients by securities brokerage firm AKD Research on March 30 .
The industry has lost 32 .
since just February 26 , which is when the first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Pakistan , following rapid emergency rate cuts .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pakistan cut the policy rate by 75 basis points on March 17 , from 13 .
to 12 .
Then in an unprecedented move , the SBP cut the policy rate again just one week later on March 24 , by 150 basis points to 11pc .
The rapid reduction in the policy rate , along with the decision to narrow the floor rate from 150 basis points below the policy rate to 100 basis points ( so 10 percent ) , will negatively affect spreads .
According to Kamal , just the change in the floor rate , leads to a 30 basis point reduction in spreads across banks .
On the bright side , recent SBP decisions to help borrowers under COVID-19 may have some short term benefits for bank spreads .
In its relief package for borrowers announced on March 26 , the SBP also relaxed the regulatory criteria for restructuring of loans until March 31 , 2021 .
Loans that are rescheduled within 180 days from the due date of payment will not be treated as defaults .
This will help give some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short run , thereby helping with spreads .
Similarly , the SBP also reduced the capital conservation buffer ( CCB ) from the current 2 .
percent to 1 .
On a whole , this will allow banks to lend an additional amount of around Rs800 billion , an amount equivalent to about 10pc of their current outstanding loans .
Again , according to Kamal , this decision will help banks absorb risk .
