Many of us are too paranoid to visit the crowded hospitals or clinics to get ourselves tested for COVID-19 , but the good news is that there are " drive-thru " tests available in selected areas .
These existing drive-thru tests were only available upon appointment at selected hospitals including Pantai Cheras Hospital , Pantai Hospital Ipoh , as well as Pantai Hospital Penang .
Other than the convenience of these drive-thru services provided by the aforementioned hospitals , KPJ Damansara Specialist Hospital has announced that they are providing drive-thru testing that does not require appointments .
As reported on Free Malaysia Today , KPJ Damansara Specialist Hospital 's drive-thru test takes only approximately eight to ten minutes to test one person , and the results will be available within 24 hours .
The consultant emergency physician and head of the Accident and Emergency Services at KPJ Damansara , Dr Nur Abdul Karim , stated that the drive-thru test is to reduce contact with others , on top of making it convenient for everyone .
She also explained that by repeatedly testing everyone , it can speed up the detection of COVID-19 cases and help cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the drive-thru is to reduce contact with others and make it convenient for people to get tested .
We are following the South Korean model to test everyone .
Test , test , test -- and then test again .
By testing everyone , we can detect positive cases early and help minimise the spread of Covid-19 .
"  Dr Nur Abdul Karim added that the test utilised for drive-thru services is endorsed by the Ministry of Health as the " gold standard " .

"  Apparently , two stations are set up for the drive-thru services at KPJ Damansara .
The first station is set up for registration and payment , as well as temperature , oxygen and pulse readings .
The second station is assigned for the Covid-19 test which consists of nasopharyngeal ( nose ) and oropharyngeal ( throat ) swabs .
Consultation is also provided to the patients to attend to their queries .

Although the hospital planned to expand the drive-thru services , Dr Nur Abdul Karim mentioned that it may overburden the staff .
" We do n't want to overwork our staff and cause burnout .
We have to do proper documentation for every test and submit the paperwork to the district health office .
We also need to properly disinfect the testing stations -- and all that takes time .
"  She expressed her concern in regards to their lab capacity to support these tests .
So far , the hospital labs are functioning consistently as they have been able to release the test results within 24 hours .
We salute all medical personnel who work around the clock during this Covid-19 crisis .
We 're also grateful that they 're doing their best to provide convenience to the people who want to get themselves tested .
