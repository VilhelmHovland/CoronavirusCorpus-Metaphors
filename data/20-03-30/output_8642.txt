It 's an unprecedented time in college sports , as things have pretty much been shut down due to the COVID-19 outbreak .
The NCAA Tournament -- both men 's and women 's -- were canceled , and that 's a huge revenue hit for the NCAA .
Could we see some drastic measures being taken across Division I athletic departments ? Michael Smith of Sports Business Journal joined " The Paul Finebaum Show " on Monday and said he 's heard a source say some schools are considering cutting staff size and potentially even cutting sports : .
@smittySBJ tells @finebaum he talked to a source consulting with two athletic departments today .
" Both of those conversations include cutting staff and cutting sports .
I hope that 's not where we 're headed , but it very well could be .
"  More @SmittySBJ on the possibility of reducing the 14 sports required to be Division I .
" I ca n't help but wonder if this will be an opportunity for the NCAA to go : ' I wonder if 10 is the right number .
' "  There 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is still a concerning line of thought .
Hopefully , we can get past the COVID-19 outbreak and get back to normal , but this pandemic might put a bit of a halt on the outrageous spending some college athletic departments have enjoyed during the boom period .
