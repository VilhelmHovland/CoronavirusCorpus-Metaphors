Left-wing campuses Shapiro-less during virus  Young America 's Foundation says it has made the difficult decision to cancel all of its planned campus events through April because of the coronavirus epidemic .
YAF President Ron Robinson tells OneNewsNow that it was a difficult decision because college students are constantly being bombarded with leftist rhetoric and ideology , and YAF exists to provide a balanced option .
" We do n't cancel any Foundation event lightly .
Students really need an alternative , " he says .
" Young America 's Foundation 's programs are one of the few places they have .
"  YAF , however , is following President Trump 's lead by putting the wellbeing of participants in the events first .
That means that YAF 's most popular campus events , Ben Shapiro appearances , will likely be rescheduled for the fall of 2020 .
In the meantime , Robinson says student will be able to access past events online .
" Certainly , YouTube has a YAF channel that includes a lot of our strong programs , " he advises .
