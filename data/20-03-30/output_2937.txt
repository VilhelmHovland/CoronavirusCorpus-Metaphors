Engineers at Canada 's largest auto parts manufacturer are hoping a sanitization device they originally developed to eliminate odour and bacteria in hockey gear can be used by hospitals to kill the coronavirus on personal protective equipment .
Magna International Inc .
is ready to ramp up production of the sanitization devices if it can find a testing partner to prove they eliminate the virus that causes COVID-19 , John O'Hara , the company 's president of mechatronics , mirrors and lighting , said in an interview Thursday .
" We need to validate it to get it out there , " O'Hara said .
" ( The device ) could be a help for hospitals to clean PPE equipment , doctors ' shoes , briefcases , anything you just ca n't throw in a washing machine .
"  Magna has already shifted production to make masks instead of seating at facilities in Mexico and Europe , the company said Thursday .
But its $5-billion mechatronics division headquartered in Newmarket , Ont .
, also wanted to help .
It is one of thousands of manufacturers across Canada offering up its technology and production capabilities to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bain 's office has engaged with more than 2,000 companies since putting out a call last week for manufacturers to help make products for frontline medical workers , his office said in a statement .
Once Bains determines what companies can offer , Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada identify what they need before Public Services and Procurement Canada buys products .
Ottawa is expected to announce contracts for masks , ventilators , tests kits and other equipment as early as Friday , the Financial Post has learned .
Some companies have already taken action .
Hockey equipment maker Bauer Hockey on Wednesday also announced plans to make full-face , single-use visors for medical workers and first responders .
It received approval from the Quebec government at 2 a .
Thursday .
Bauer hopes to ramp up its daily output with the aim of producing 500,000 units , according to The Canadian Press .

" We wanted to do everything we can , " Scott Mitchell , the company 's director , new technology and innovation , said in an interview .
Mechatronics engineers typically build things that open and close , such as car doors or outside mirrors , and require complex moulding , stamping and electronics processes .
But several years ago Mitchell 's team created a device the size of a large beer cooler called the Puro , which uses ozone technology to disinfect and clean household items that do n't fit in a washing machine .
Once items are inside , users press a button to seal and lock the device for a 25- or 45-minute sanitization cycle .
While its intention was to get rid of rash-inducing bacteria often found in elbow pads , the device has potential medical applications for cleaning hospital gear so it can be reused instead of disposed .
Ozone has proven to kill viruses such as H1N1 Influenza in the past based on research from the University of British Columbia , Mitchell said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  But before Magna can deploy its 75 devices to hospitals and potentially produce hundreds more , it needs a medical partner to test whether they actually kill the coronavirus .
Magna is actively seeking partners .

Burston/Bloomberg files  If the device is successful , O'Hara said it would take six weeks for Magna to scale production to make 300 to 400 such devices per day .
They would cost less than $2,000 and potentially as little as $600 for more basic household use , he said .
Magna , which has 139 manufacturing facilities and 75,000 employees in North America alone , would send the 75 existing devices to the hospitals that need them most .
Meantime , Magna engineers have designed masks now being produced by the thousands at manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Europe to address shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic , the company said Thursday .
In Russia , Serbia and the Czech Republic , Magna 's seating facilities are making 51,000 masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 masks per day with the goal of hitting the same levels as Europe .
Magna has also secured 510,000 KN95 masks ( similar to N95 masks ) to donate to hospitals across North America .
Its powertrain team in China recently shipped 30,000 KN95 masks to Italy .
Magna is also in discussions with various automakers to provide parts for ventilators , face shields and more .
