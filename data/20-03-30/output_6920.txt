" It says living conditions at the detention center , which is privately owned and operated by the GEO Group , make social distancing impossible , since people live in dormitories that hold up to 100 detainees at a time and sleep in bunks separated by only a few feet .
They share sinks , toilets and showers , and eat in communal areas .

" One of the Plaintiffs had never even heard of the term before her attorney inquired into the conditions in Adelanto on March 29 , 2020 .

In the decision , federal district judge Terry J .
Hatter Jr .
said civil detainees " must be protected by the Government , " adding : " the Government can not deny the fact that the risk of infection in immigration detention facilities -- and jails -- is particularly high if an asymptomatic guard , or other employee , enters a facility .
"  Granting the temporary restraining order , Hatter said , is in the public 's interest , as an outbreak at the detention facility would endanger detainees and facility employees , as well as residents of San Bernardino County , the state and country .
" This is an unprecedented time in our nation 's history , filled with uncertainty , fear and anxiety , " Hatter wrote .
" But in the time of a crisis , our response to those at particularly high risk must be with compassion and not apathy .
The Government can not act with a callous disregard for the safety of our fellow human beings .
