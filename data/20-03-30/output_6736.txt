Do n't forget about the indigenous during this time  I have long been a critic of The Billings Gazette .
Their in-depth reporting and pictographic coverage of the COVID-19 issues has been exceptional especially for those of us that choose to stay home is per regards for ourselves and our neighbors .
Being homeless during the winter of 2012 I have grave concern for the welfare of the homeless Indians .
One Indian man soon to become my friend a Vietnam veteran , family man , with a truckload of PTSD , an alcoholic , a drug addict , protected me and probably saved my life .
He will always be in my heart .
At that time only one man with a van gave a damn about the homeless .
I am sure there were others .
To think that alcoholics and drug addicts can not at time make rational choices is foolhardy .
You have free articles remaining .
My friend got in a knife fight outside Lee 's Saloon , the cut so brutally long and deep it was terrifying ; however , he refused white man 's medical services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many homeless Indians will not seek white-man medical attention , be it culture or addiction or both .
Indians are so clannish , COVID-19 on the reservation would become a nightmare to contain .
