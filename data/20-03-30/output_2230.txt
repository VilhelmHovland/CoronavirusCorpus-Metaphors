Prince Albert Of Monaco has shut down rumours he gave Prince Charles the coronavirus at a Water Aid event earlier this month .
Both royals recently tested positive for COVID-19 and now it has been suggested Albert passed the potentially deadly virus to Charles in London .
" I was at a roundtable for his foundation , but we never shook hands , " Prince Albert tells RTL radio .
" I was at the other end of the table , way far away .
" We nodded hello to one another , so I do n't think I can really be accused of contaminating him .
There were a lot of other people around at the congress centre and I know he continued his schedule afterwards for a number of days .
"  Prince Albert , who became the first head of state to test positive for the coronavirus , insists he 's feeling much better and no longer has a fever .
" I cough a little still , " he adds .
" I hope it 's the end of the tunnel that I 'm starting to see .
