Limerick doctor says Ireland ' needs to go into lockdown as soon as possible '  Reporter :  Fintan Walsh , Health Correspondent  24 Mar 2020  Email :  **30;2127;TOOLONG  0  Dr Nicola Stapleton , GP in Limerick city  A LIMERICK doctor enduring the Covid-19 turmoil has called on the Government to " go into lockdown as soon as possible " to prevent more deaths in Ireland .
Dr Nicola Stapleton , a GP in the city centre , has said that each additional delay in introducing such measures " will lead to more deaths " .
There are now 1,125 cases in Ireland , following the largest surge of 215 cases since Sunday .
Six deaths have been recorded , half of whom having recorded underlying health problems .
At present , more than 1 .
billion people across the world are in lockdown -- a fifth of the world 's population .
A shock to the whole world , UK prime minister Boris performed a major u-turn in its Covid-19 strategy and called for a three-week lockdown across the country , including Northern Ireland .
Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , the Cabinet is expected to introduce new restrictions , including the closure of a range of non-essential businesses .
This could include restaurants , cafes , hairdressers , and many more .
This is not the same as a lockdown , which has been mooted by local politicians .
Dr Stapleton said that a lot of her patients are being referred for Covid-19 testing in the past two weeks .
And while are no really ill patients yet , " the people who are going to get quite sick tend to get sick around day 8 , which for a lot of my patients , will be next week " .
Speaking to the Leader this week , she said doctors have been working above capacity " and I can see that situation worsening very rapidly " .
One of the difficulties , she said , has been the sourcing of essential equipment .
" I managed to get masks for the surgery at our local co-op and a very kind dental colleague donated us some too .
We had been making up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HSE have sent us out some supplies as well , and are really working hard to get things sorted , " she said .
She said the " scariest thing " is that she continues to see groups of teenagers and adults hanging out which , she said , " is going to escalate this crisis " .
" It 's quite incredible that people are not listening to the public health and Government messages , which are very clear .
" I think Ireland needs to go into lockdown as soon as possible .
Looking at the current situation in Italy/Fance/Spain , we need to shut down all non essential services to try and reduce the spread of Covid 19 .
Each additional day 's delay will lead to more deaths and as a society we need to do as much as we can to try and reduce these numbers .
