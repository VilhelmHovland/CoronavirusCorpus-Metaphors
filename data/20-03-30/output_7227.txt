When Erica Roth got a tickle in her throat , she thought she was just hoarse from talking too much .
For privacy reasons , she did n't want to disclose where she works , but it 's a profession that has her on her feet talking for most of the day .
It 's also a job that puts her in close contact with dozens and dozens of people in a confined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March 18 , she knew it was n't just overworked vocal cords .
Her first move was a call to the Washoe County District Health Department .
" Because I had been in contact with so many people the last two days , " she said .
Roth soon learned what hundreds of sick people across Nevada have come to find out : there would be no coronavirus test for her .
For two weeks , Nevada has been scrambling -- along with the rest of the country -- to gather the necessary supplies to test sick people for coronavirus .
The cutthroat competition for tests is pitting states against each other as they vie for testing materials from both from the CDC and private suppliers .

But it 's not enough .
" We have asked for test kits over and over and over again , and we 've now been delivered the message that they are on indefinite backlog for the test kits and do n't expect any , " Nevada Gov .
Steve Sisolak said .
With the shortage of supplies , tests are being reserved for people with symptoms who need hospitalization , healthcare workers , first responders and people connected with a cluster in places such as schools or homeless shelters .
The result : Nevada has identified only a fraction of who is likely sick with the virus .
As of Sunday , 738 people in Nevada had tested positive for coronavirus , including 107 people in Washoe County .
One man had died of the infection .
The health district is fielding non-stop phone calls from sick people worried they have the virus .
Last week , call centers fielded between 250 and 400 calls a day , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrant a screening by the epidemiology staff .
" If you go and look at the numbers , you are seeing more positives in recent days , " said Dr .
Mark Pandori , director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory .
" We could very well be headed towards that steep curve .
"  But who is sick and what that could mean to Nevada 's medical system is a guess .
" You need to make that transition at some point from strictly testing certain people to starting to look more broadly because this thing is going to spread from cryptic cases you have n't identified , " Pandori said .

Andrew Gorzalski tests samples for COVID-19 at the Nevada State Health Laboratory in Reno on March 13 , 2020 .
( Photo : JASON BEAN/RGJ )  Testing requires multiple steps , including swabs to collect patients ' samples and fluid-filled test tubes for transport to a lab for testing .
Almost every lab is using a PCR -- polymerase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test takes a lot of hands-on work , different materials and several steps .
At the Nevada State Public Health Lab , the first step involves stripping down the sample to a set of chromosomes using chemicals and machines .
The genetic material that is left is replicated into thousands of copies .
The sample is put into a thermal cycler .
In nonscientific terms , Pandori compared it to a pressure cooker .
The sample is taken from cold to hot .
A positive test will emit a fluorescent-like glow only detectable by the machine .
Each step faces its own supply limitations , creating a patchwork of bottlenecks throughout the system .
In some parts of the state , health officials may find themselves with swabs , but not the chemicals to run the test .
Pandori said to think of the testing process like a brownie mix .
At any given time , Pandori might have plenty of the mix but not enough eggs or oil .
Labs are scrambling to find all the needed ingredients to complete the tests .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have enough swabs to collect specimens from the public .
In Southern Nevada , labs have struggled to find materials to run the tests once they have the swabs .
" You have all these tests , but you ca n't do it , " said Dr .
Ronald Knoblock , the part-time medical director of the Southern Nevada Public Health Lab in Las Vegas .
On Friday , three weeks into the crisis in Nevada , the southern lab announced it had just 119 test kits left .
In Northern Nevada , scientists at the state public lab have pieced together kits from a variety of sources and estimated it had 6,000 complete tests and thousands more of partial supplies .
But now with the supplies to complete the test , there are days that the health district only sends 70 specimens because it has a limited number of swabs .
" We are n't at our capacity now yet , " Pandori said .
" We can do more tests .
"  According to data from the Nevada Division of Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 tests a day , despite the capacity to run 400 .
In Southern Nevada , the lab is running about 60 tests a day .
" The test kits that we 're getting all over the state are coming from the private sector , " Sisolak said .
" We 're going out and buying them on the open market , trying to buy as many as we can .
"  Some are donated .
The Las Vegas Sands told the Reno Gazette Journal on Friday that it had donated 1,900 tests to Nevada -- transported on a private company plane from China .
Commercial labs , like Quest , Labcorp and CPL , are filling in the gap .
The private labs testing in Nevada have the capacity to test about 45,000 people a day .
But they are processing tests from across the nation .
The private labs are taking more than five days to get results back to patients , according to Reno doctors .
The state lab , by comparison , can turn out same-day results  Hospitals also are setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas is now testing patients who have been admitted and hopes to increase capacity to test others in the community .
Renown should have its testing capabilities up and running soon as well , Pandori said .
" Renown is coming online any day now , " Pandori said .
" We are helping them validate their testing .

Andrew Pasternak said his general medicine practice in Reno received a handful of specimen collecting kits from Labcorp two weeks ago .
They were gone in two days .
" At this point , " Pasternak said , " we 've kind of given up on testing .
"  His advice to patients now is to assume they have the virus and isolate .
" Everybody needs to stay home , " Pasternak said .
As far as treatment for those with mild to moderate symptoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19 and a positive test does not change the treatment for this virus , " said Dr .
Ihsan Azzam , Nevada 's chief medical officer .
" While more testing can provide us with more information , the key to our response continues to be social distancing and reminding all Nevadans to stay home and stay isolated when you are sick .

Reno Gazette Journal  The scarcity of testing , however , has dramatic ramifications both for public health and for individuals who are uncertain whether they 're carrying the virus .
Other countries , notably South Korea , successfully slowed the progression of the virus through widespread testing and isolation of the sick .
The strategy helped the country avoid the dramatic business shutdowns ordered in Nevada and other states .
" With limited testing we were not able to test early and identify cases quickly , " Azzam said .
" If we had that information , we could have isolated cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did not have information on where the virus was spreading in the community .
" As the number grows , it becomes more difficult to identify and track the spread .
"  The personal toll of living with COVID-19 symptoms is also great .
Roth , whose doctor told her she likely has the virus , worries about who she may have infected before she knew .
" If I was a vector , I came into contact with so many people , " Roth said .
" People should be made aware of that .
"  Ever since she awoke with the cough , Roth has been quarantined .
A Reno mom whose doctor told her she likely has the virus but that she could n't be tested has confined herself to her room so she does n't infect her husband and children .
She asked not to be identified because she does n't want to frighten the community around her .
