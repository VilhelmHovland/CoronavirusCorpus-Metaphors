Italy hopes virus is easing but fears new onslaught in south  FILE - In this Tuesday , March 17 , 2020 .
filer , relatives walk behind a hearse carrying a coffin inside the Monumentale cemetery , in Bergamo , the heart of the hardest-hit province in Italy 's hardest-hit region of Lombardy , Italy .
Italy is seeing a slight stabilizing in its confirmed coronavirus infections two weeks into the world 's most extreme nationwide shutdown , but the virus is taking its silent spread south after having ravaged the health care system in the north .
The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people , but for some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , File )  ROME -- Doctors and nurses in Italy 's overwhelmed northern hospitals have welcomed a slight stabilizing in the number of coronavirus infections but fear the virus is still silently spreading in the south two weeks into the West 's most extreme nationwide shutdown .
As the dead in Italy keep piling up , virologists warn that the actual number of Italy 's positive cases is up to five times as high as the official count of 80,539 .
That means infections will still climb even with Italians ordered to stay home for all but essential activity .
Italy , the epicenter of Europe 's pandemic , has by far the most virus deaths of any nation in the world , a grim tally of 8,165 .
On Friday , Italy is on track to surpass China in its infection count and have the most cases of any nation behind the U .
' ' It is something devastating , ' ' said the Rev .
Mario Carminati , who has turned over a church in the tiny Lombard town of Seriate to host coffins before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week , dozens were lined up in two neat rows down the central aisle , and were immediately replaced by new ones when they were taken away .
" At least the relatives and family know that someone is taking care of them , with a prayer and a benediction before they are taken away , ' ' he said .
Despite the toll , officials have also expressed cautious optimism that the exponential spread of the virus is starting to slow in the hard-hit north , thanks to two weeks of military-enforced stay-at-home orders .
For several days this week , new infections and deaths showed signs of slowing down , and emergency rooms were n't seeing the tsunami of sick that characterized the first weeks of the pandemic following Italy 's first positive test Feb .
" The numbers are still high , but for a few days now the numbers have stopped rising , thank God , " said Dr .
Luca Lorini , head of intensive care at the Pope John XXIII hospital in Bergamo , one of the hardest hit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hospital are infected , and Lorini said he has found himself treating colleagues , friends , children of friends and parents of friends in his overwhelmed 88-bed ICU that serves a city of 120,000 .
He marvels that he is still standing and wonders if maybe he was infected early on with slight symptoms and developed immunity .
Nationwide , at least 33 doctors have died and 6,414 medical personnel have tested positive  " We know it before we go into battle , and we accept it , " Lorini told The Associated Press .
Elsewhere in Bergamo , the Italian army 's Alpini mountaineering forces are building a field hospital to be staffed , in part , by some of the 150 medical personnel sent by Russia , one of only a handful of countries along with China and Cuba to respond to Italy 's urgent appeal for medical equipment , protective masks and personnel .
But the need is also growing in the south , where hospitals are even less prepared and equipped than the prosperous north .
" It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of the Campania region that includes Naples wrote to the central government , complaining that his urgent requests for ventilators had gone unheeded .
" There is a real chance of adding a tragedy of the south to the tragedy of the north .
"  Cateno De Luca , mayor of the Sicilian city of Messina , took the extraordinary step of recording a warning to residents in his nasal , gravelly voice for drones to play as they fly over the seaside city monitoring residents ' movements .
" Do n't go outside ! That is an order from Mayor De Luca ! " the drone blasts .
Italy 's high death toll and aggressive spread of the virus has led Italian epidemiologists to estimate that the true number of infected could be as high as 450,000 , and that under-testing is putting Italians at risk of further contagion .
Currently , Italy only tests people showing symptoms , because its labs can not process any more , and to date more than 360,000 tests have been performed .
Virologist Dr .
Andrea Crisanti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consultant for the Veneto regional government , points to the only controlled epidemiological study done in the outbreak , in the tiny Veneto town of Vo'Euganeo , as evidence that Italy 's true numbers of infection are much higher -- and that the risk of not testing more widely is enormous .
Italy recorded its first death in Vo , and the town was locked down Feb .
22 and the entire population of 3,300 tested .
According to the study , 3% of Vo 's residents were infected , but between 50%-75% of them were asymptomatic .
But because all positive cases were identified , isolated and quarantined , regardless of whether they were symptomatic , Vo has seen its new infections crumble .
" This tiny town has taught us a lot , " Crisanti told state-run RAI radio .
Crisanti said the Vo study showed that even asymptomatic people transmit the virus , since the few new infections registered between tests were within households of asymptomatic people .
The only way to stop the spread , he told RAI , is more testing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on the Vo results , Veneto Gov .
Luca Zaia is planning to vastly ramp up testing across the region , aiming to reach 20,000 tests a day and hand out protective masks to each family .
Already , Veneto has tested nearly 80,000 people , and compared to hard-hit Lombardy next door , has a comparatively low mortality rate with 287 dead and 6,935 positive cases .
The government on March 10 imposed a nationwide lockdown after an initial quarantine of a dozen small towns in Lombardy and Veneto failed to stop the spread of the virus .
On Thursday , Italy idled all non-essential production and industry , the most widespread manufacturing shutdown in the world .
The industrial lobby Confindustria has estimated it could cost 70 billion-to-100 billion euros ( $77 billion-$110 billion ) of national wealth a month if 70% of companies are closed .
Two weeks in , the measures appear to be having their effect on the virus , slowing new infections and relieving pressure on the health system .
By Thursday , more than 10,000 of Italy 's 80,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with a fever , and after nearly a week in an air-pressurized helmet pumping oxygen into his virus-ravaged lungs , Fausto Russo is now breathing on his own and hopes to go home as early as Sunday from the Santa Maria Goretti hospital in Latina , near Rome .
" It 's a horrible sensation , not being able to breathe , " said Russo , a 38-year-old fitness trainer .
" Imagine putting your head under water .
"  Lorini , the doctor , knows well the toll that the virus takes on both patients and hospital staff .
When he goes home each night , a five-minute walk from the hospital , he allows himself a few minutes to listen to music and " unplug " from the intensity of the ICU ward .
His current favourite song is Bruce Springstein 's " Secret Garden .
" He smiles as he thinks about the lyrics .
" You 've gone a million miles/ How far 'd you get/ To that place where/ You ca n't remember/ And you ca n't forget .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will give you a sense of tenderness .

" It just goes to show how many people are out there working ( in Montreal hospitals ) doing this heroic front-line work and looking for any gestures of kindness and generosity .
We think it 's fantastic ( that the Petrys did this ) .
We think it 's such a representation of Montreal love and support and unity and community .
"  Petry wrote on Instagram : " Julie and I are constantly thinking of all those on the front lines helping take care of others during this unthinkable time all over the world , but especially back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us &amp; our kids over the years we ca n't help but have those doctors , nurses and staff members on our hearts during this unfathomable time .
"  Wolfe and her sister Rebecca , who own Mandys together , have been going themselves to Montreal-area hospitals every Monday , Wednesday and Friday over the past couple of weeks to deliver free salads to staff .
( This is not tied to the Petrys ' donation .
)  " We 're giving them away , " Wolfe said .
" We 'd go every day if we could afford to .
But I think everyone is operating at a loss right now .
I think the opportunity to be able to feed people who are working overtime , who are exhausted and stressed and worried , to be able to offer them some kind of kindness and nutrition ( is great ) .
We 're saying : ' We love you , we thank you for everything you 're doing .
' It 's a small small token , but it makes us feel like we 're part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal women separately called up Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce and made $500 orders of burgers and side orders , which were delivered to staff at Montreal hospitals .
On Thursday , Rina Fisher had $500 worth of burgers delivered to the people working in the intensive-care unit of the Jewish General Hospital , one of the busiest ICUs in the province for COVID-19 patients .
Fisher 's daughter , Jackie , was a patient in that ICU in the weeks leading up to her death from cancer five years ago .
" I 'm sure that ( the hospital staff ) do n't have too much time on their hands to look after themselves , " Fisher said .
" It 's also in honour of Jackie .
"  On Friday , Kimmy Chedel followed suit and had $500 worth of Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce hamburgers and side orders delivered to emergency-room staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital at the McGill University Health Centre Glen site .
" I do n't know what else to do , " Chedel said .
" I 'm here in Montreal and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical field and I feel helpless .
So I felt at least we can come together as a community and send them food , maybe on a regular basis .
"  Andrew Ambas , manager of the N .
location of Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce , was the one who delivered the two orders to the Jewish General and Royal Victoria hospitals .
" I got to see the situation first-hand at both hospitals and see how happy people were with this generosity , " Ambas said .
