' I need people to make sure I 'm OK ' : Emily Writes on how teens are coping with lockdown  Emily Writes talks to teenagers about how the level four restrictions are affecting them , and asks how they can be better supported .
There are unfortunately so many terrible stereotypes about teenagers , but Gen Z might just be our most resilient generation yet .
Struggling through feelings of helplessness around climate change , they started a movement to make governments around the world hear their voices .
In the face of leaders and old men laughing at them , mocking them , verbal and even physical abuse -- they kept fighting .
Louisa Woods is a high school teacher and counsellor .
In short -- she knows teenagers .
Anyone who knows teenagers or has a teenager knew the lockdown would be difficult .
I wanted to find out how this generation of activists and hopeful young people was coping with the level four restrictions so I asked Woods to help circulate a survey .
These are , in their own words , how teenagers around New Zealand are feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're anonymous because people are n't always kind to teens and we wanted them to be able to speak freely .
" It 's extremely surreal .
I never would have thought I would have to experience isolation .
I 'm glad that the reason for the lockdown is not war , but it still is scary , as I fear for my elderly relatives .
I think it was absolutely the correct thing to do , and I 'm not only saying that because we do n't have to go to school .
I think if we all were to actually stay home and abide by the rules , we would all be OK .
"  " I think that Jacinda Ardern had no choice but to put the country in lockdown .
She is an amazing woman , leading the country through such hard times such as Covid-19 , Christchurch shootings , and she even had a child .
I would prefer to be at home and keeping the community safe instead of at school with the potential of an outbreak .
"  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world but I also think that this isolation is a good time to manage my priorities and my own learning .
"  " I think it 's a really interesting time and I 'm just really feeling a mix of anxiety and an odd calm .
I do n't really think my feelings know what they 're doing .
Which can be tough , but that 's OK , I think in the future it 'll be cool to tell my kids that I lived through this when they might study it in school .
"  More than 100 teenagers responded to the survey .
They all knew very well why the lockdown was happening and were overwhelmingly in support .
They seemed to have faith in our government .
I asked Woods if having faith in leaders might be a new thing for this generation , who have felt so let down in the past .
" I think many more young people of this generation are politically and socially aware than in the past , and I also think they can see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Woods says .
" There have always been young people with strong opinions and who have ideas about how they want the world to be , but I wonder if this generation feels more empowered to act on those ideas .
They can see people of different ages , genders , sexualities and ethnicities in parliament , and you can be who you can see , right ? I think they do have faith in this government , and in particular Jacinda Ardern -- who was mentioned time and time again in the survey -- because they can see those people working for them .
Perhaps previously teens felt politics was somewhat irrelevant -- not so any more .
"  Overwhelmingly , teenagers in New Zealand missed their friends .
Over and over again they said the hardest thing was the severing of their face-to-face connections with those who understand them best -- their peers .
" Feelings of connectedness and belonging are supportive of good mental health for all of us , and for many teens the most important connections are to their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better understood by their peers than by their family , and for many it is their friends they are most likely to go to for support .
While young people are used to connecting a lot over social media , the isolation period is bringing home to them just how important it is to connect with people in real life .
Maybe that 's a good thing going forward , but that lack of one-on-one is going to be a real challenge over the isolation period .
"  Other teenagers were facing a much bigger challenge than missing friends .
Seeing parents under enormous stress because they 'd lost their income was weighing heavily on the minds of some kids .
Fighting and instability in the home had some teenagers hiding in their rooms .
The impact of teenagers spending a month away from school -- a place that might be their only safe space -- should be a concern to the whole country .
Teens talked about how they felt scared , imprisoned , lonely , and even how they just craved a hug from somebody .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's physical and emotional safety at this time .
Many families are going to be under additional stress at the moment and for some that 's a recipe for disaster .
There are some homes that are unsafe for children and young people at the best of times , and isolation is going to add to their feelings of helplessness and aloneness .
The negative impact on mental health is a real worry too .
Schools and support agencies will be reaching out to these families and young people as much as they can , but I 'm worried it wo n't be enough .
"  When asked how parents and caregivers can support them , it will come as no surprise to parents of teens that those surveyed said they need more food .
Surprisingly , though , many teens said they wanted their parents to talk to them more .
More talking with each other .
Because sometimes it can be a bit silent compared to school .
I need space .
I still need love , and help , but I also need my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Understand when I get sad .
I need people to make sure I 'm OK .
Play board games with me without fighting .
Hugs and reassurance .
Include me in conversations .
I think it would be nice if my family just spent a little more time with each of us .
Do n't get me wrong , I really appreciate everything my parents do for us , I really do .
Inform me of the facts .
Ask me if I 'm OK .

They 're not children or adults , but an in between .
That can be hard for parents to navigate .
Give them space , but not too much .
Woods agreed .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the same things all of us want -- love , connection , understanding , someone to listen to them without judgement -- the sorts of things that make us feel valued and respected for who we are .
It 's a fine balance working out how to let teens maintain their boundaries while also providing adequate support , but it 's really important that parents make themselves available to their teens , and listen to what they need .
"  Mike Munnelly , chief executive of Barnardos NZ , said its support line 0800 WHATSUP for children and teenagers has seen a surge in calls from distressed young people since lockdown began .
" Over the past few weeks we 've had a significant increase in both phone calls and online chats with children and teenagers in Aotearoa , who need the help of our specialised child and youth counsellors at this difficult time .
Over the past week alone , our call volumes have doubled .
It 's of utmost importance that tamariki and rangatahi in Aotearoa have support channels that they can go to for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're here to listen about anything at all .
"  Young people are n't just feeling anxious about the lockdown , Munnelly said .
" As well as worries about Covid-19 , it 's also important to remember that children and teenagers are continuing to need support on other issues in their lives during this time .
The problems children and young people were calling the helpline about before Covid-19 , like bullying , family problems , relationship issues and mental health struggles , do n't stop during this time .
No problem is too big or too small for our counsellors to listen and provide support on .
"  " We know the need for children and teenagers to have a safe place to talk will continue to be significant over the coming months , as they , like all of us in Aotearoa , continue to feel and experience the ongoing impacts of this pandemic .
0800 WHATSUP will be a crucial and trusted place for tamariki and rangatahi to keep being able to reach out to and know they 'll get the kind , caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final survey question was about hopes for the future .
I was unsurprised that teenagers ' hopes were for their families and the world -- rather than for themselves .
The idea that teenagers are selfish or unthinking or self-absorbed is debunked time and time again but it prevails nonetheless .
It seems like a sad self-fulfilling prophecy that some teens end up acting out due to the relentless expectation by adults ( who should know better ) that they will .
I felt buoyed reading their responses :  " I hope that once we can go back , everyone will be really supportive of one another , helping them get back on their feet after the long period of isolation .
"  " I hope that for the rest of the year people maintain the kind mindsets that many have gained in this period and that people continue to check in on friends , families and neighbours .
Even after the virus has been contained .
"  They 're a generation of hope -- we must make sure we can see their hope and not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as $1 to help us continue our work and cover the stories that matter .
