Two weeks before Spokane went on lockdown , the news was the disease would n't come here .
The Spokane Daily Chronicle told its readers " there is no reason to be greatly alarmed " because the " imported type " of viral infection was " not available " here .
The city 's public health officer offered soothing words .
" If Spokane people will sneeze in their handkerchiefs and turn their heads the ' other ' way when they cough , there is but a remote chance that the city will be attacked , " he told the paper .
They were wrong .
The virus arrived , and the city 's theaters , schools , churches , dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed .
Events like funerals and weddings were canceled .
The year was 1918 -- the last time a pandemic reached Spokane .
A century has passed , and Spokane and the world are once again contending with quarantine and the powerful role public health officials can play in times of outbreak .
It 's a frightening time , with a sedate city anxiously waiting to see how bad it gets .
But some look back to see a way forward .
" My reaction about learning about the disease today , about COVID-19 , my first reaction as a historian was to try to give it context , " said Logan Camporeale , a local historian .
" Based on the newspaper record , what we did in 1918 , in October 1918 , is much of what we 're doing in March of 2020 .
"  Dr .
Bob Lutz , the health officer for the Spokane Regional Health District , agreed that 1918 is a good analogy to now .
" I think there are a lot of comparisons to 1918 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here before , yeah , we 've been here before -- a century ago , but not in the recent past .
Not in the past anyone here can remember .
"  The inability to recall how bad things got here has led people to dismiss the threat , Lutz said .
" I think that we have , as a society , become so independent that when I tell you that I require you to do this , there 's a lot of , ' Well do n't tell me , I do n't believe it , ' " he said .
That , in turn , has led to a demand to be tested -- despite a shortage of tests .
For a county with 500,000 people , the health district initially had 1,000 swab kits for testing , though the number of kits is growing by the day .
All of that has combined to make people scared -- and wary of Lutz 's pronouncements on social distancing .
" For us , it sounds sort of strange , sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to believe that it really is here , for people to really understand the magnitude of what it is and what it could be , " he said .
That brings up another difference between 1918 and 2020 .
" Back then , you did not have testing .
Now you have testing , " Lutz said .
" Back then you -- essentially based upon a constellation of symptoms -- you said this person had the flu and you treated them accordingly .
Now we have a constellation of symptoms , which is consistent with COVID-19 , and we have a test for COVID-19 , but we do n't have the testing materials to provide the evidence .
"  In other words , people do n't believe the outbreak is here until there is a test confirming it 's here .
And if they do n't believe it 's here , they wo n't follow Lutz 's recommendations for social distancing .

" To some degree , until people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back against a lot of the social distancing recommendations that we are providing , " Lutz said .
As testing proved on March 14 that the novel coronavirus had arrived in Spokane , Lutz urged people to take it seriously .
" We 've not had anything of this complexity and severity for a century , " he said .
The 1918-19 influenza pandemic infected 500 million people worldwide , and killed between 17 million and 100 million people -- upwards of 5% of the human population .
It did n't spare the U .
, where more than 500,000 people died .
Joseph Waring , a medical historian in South Carolina , called it " the greatest medical holocaust in history .
" And Isaac Starr , in the Annals of Internal Medicine , ranked it as " one of the three most destructive human epidemics " along with the Justinian plague in the year 541 and the Black Death in the mid-1300s .
At the same time , the world was seeing the end of what would later be called World War I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The so-called " War to End All Wars " would result in the deaths of 9 million combatants and 7 million civilians , making it the third deadliest war ever , behind World War II and the Mongol conquests of the 13th century .
It 's no coincidence the war and influenza pandemic struck at the same time .
Though the war began in Europe in 1914 , the U .
did n't join the Allies until 1917 .
The draft was extended , and the Army went from having tens of thousands of troops to millions .
While theories compete about the flu 's source , there is no argument it was ravaging the soldiers in Europe in 1917 , where the newly expanded American Army was headed .
During their tours , men from around the world , including Americans , lived in tight , squalid conditions that " favored the transmission of influenza .
Men moved between camps frequently and went overseas and back , facilitating the transmission of the disease over even wider areas , " wrote Keirsten Snover in her 2008 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spanish Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919 : The Spokane Experience .
"  " Because of the war , what might have been a limited epidemic quickly became a pandemic , with troops spreading infection all over the globe , " Snover wrote .
' Fear of influenza and morbid dread of the disease '  Dr .
John Anderson was strolling down Riverside Avenue in downtown Spokane when a man spit on the sidewalk in front of him -- a common , if foul , occurrence .
It was also an arrestable offense , as the man would soon find out .
The year was 1918 , and Spokane was under something like martial law -- but instead of the military giving orders , it was the public health authority .
The man was n't arrested .
Instead , Anderson ordered him to wipe his own spittle off the sidewalk , which he did , with Anderson watching .
The date was Oct .
8 , and Anderson could be forgiven for his extreme reaction .
He and 17 Spokane physicians had just met to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state commissioner of health , urging them to ban public gatherings .
Anderson and the doctors agreed .
At midnight that day , Oct .
8 , all theaters , schools , churches , dance halls and every other place where people gathered were ordered closed , as were events like funerals and weddings .
When Anderson ordered the closure of most Spokane public places , there were few who protested , even if most people did n't believe or understand the danger of influenza .
The city streets were " as sparsely filled as in a blizzard , " The Spokesman-Review reported .
The first day of those quiet streets -- Oct .
9 , 1918 -- Spokane had its first reported flu death .
In an article titled " Epidemic grows , girl succumbs , " the Spokesman reported the death of Vera Wood , 17 , the daughter of " pioneers of the Sprague region " who lived near the old Spokane University in Spokane Valley .
She was " stricken last Saturday , " and contracted the flu from her brother , Vernon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He recovered , she did n't .
It was later reported James Alphea Howe was the first 1918 influenza death .
When he died on Oct .
5 , 1918 , it was first thought the 79-year-old had succumbed to pneumonia , but later ascribed to influenza .
The cases piled up .
By Oct .
10 , 1918 , there were 220 reported cases of influenza in Spokane , and Anderson ordered all doctors in the city to file daily reports with him .
The city 's hospitals were at capacity and Anderson saw the situation deteriorating .
Anderson and the local Red Cross formulated a plan to transform one of the city 's hotels into a hospital .
Near the corner of Lincoln Street and First Avenue , the Lion Hotel was perfect .
It had big and small rooms , and was centrally located near Deaconess Hospital .
On Oct .
16 , the city seized the Lion Hotel to convert for people " with severe cases or those who were homeless , " according to the newspaper .
The owners objected , and the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" We do n't care a rap what the owners of the building think about it or about us , " Anderson said .
" We do n't propose to haggle with them over it .
This is a very serious emergency and if the owners of the Lion Hotel think they can put a dollar in one side of the scale and a human life in the other and get away with it they are very , very badly mistaken .
"  It was just the beginning of Anderson 's increasingly belligerent tone against people who disagreed with his measures to combat the flu .
The number of reported cases was growing by 75 each day , and the total stood at 815 when the Lion became an influenza ward .
Two days later , on Oct .
18 , a total of 15 people had died from the flu , and Anderson put Spokane under an even stricter quarantine : gatherings in private clubs were now banned , and passengers on the city 's streetcars were no longer allowed to stand in the aisle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  On Oct .
23 -- just two weeks after the city 's first death -- the city had its worst day yet , with 300 new cases reported .
Anderson was furious , blaming lax adherence to his measures , and promised to squelch such activities .
" It has been brought to my attention that some people have disobeyed the order by giving private social affairs at their homes , " he said .
" Upon the first information I have that such a thing is being planned , we will appear on the scene and arrest the ringleaders without respect to their prominence or social standing .
"  Four days later , Anderson was " shocked " to see 1,500 people gather at the Great Northern Depot , site of the clocktower in Riverfront Park , to see young men go off to war .
He banned public send-offs of the troops then and there .
" There is a difference between wholesome fear of influenza and morbid dread of the disease , " Anderson told the Chronicle .
" Spokane people , for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he could n't get them to fear the disease , he would rule the city with an iron , health-minded fist .
He considered shutting the entire city down , except grocery stores and restaurants , but backed off without explanation .
Instead , he outlawed Halloween masks , and ordered police to stop masked trick-or-treaters .
' Small plants called germs '  As a doctor , Anderson was well-versed in his day 's theories of sickness and health .
But he , like everyone else in 1918 , did n't know that influenza was a virus , a fact only revealed in 1933 when the human influenza virus was first isolated from a pig .
Since its identity as a virus was n't yet known , there was no flu vaccine , and one would not be widely available until 1945 .
But Anderson knew about germ theory , and he was happy to explain it to those who balked at his strict measures .
" Spanish influenza is caused by very small plants called germs that come from the mouth or nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chronicle .
" The person gets the germ into his body by breathing into the nose or mouth the drops or spray that have been sneezed or coughed out into the air by a person sick with influenza or else he gets the germs into his body by putting into his mouth something soiled by the spit of a sick person .
"  In a full-page ad in the Spokesman , the city 's health department told people , " Do n't Be Alarmed -- Be Careful ! " The ad advised people to go to bed if they were feeling sick , keep the windows open , take laxatives and consume milk , eggs and broth every four hours .
Nurses were told to wear a mask and wash their hands frequently .
Workers were urged to avoid streetcars , walk to work and " eat good , clean food .
"  Nowadays , the explanation and remedies seem less than satisfactory , and we have a more nuanced understanding of viruses .
In short , a virus is so small and simple it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and only once it has infected a life form does it replicate .
The only identifiable function of a virus is to reproduce , and it will reproduce until the cell it has invaded bursts , sending its millions of duplicates out to invade more cells .
The 1918 influenza virus went by a few names back then : influenza , the Spanish flu , la grippe , the grip .
Now , we know it as H1N1 , which describes the type of proteins that make up the virus , as well as its shape .
It 's also called swine flu .
While it was the last pandemic to swiftly hit the U .
, the world has dealt with other types of infectious diseases in recent years .
SARS , or severe acute respiratory syndrome , infected more than 8,000 people in 29 countries in 2002 and 2003 , but only eight cases were confirmed in the U .
, according to the U .
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
In 2012 , MERS , the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only two in the U .
When a strain of H1N1 caused a pandemic in 2009 , upwards of 575,000 people died worldwide , including 12,400 in the U .
This virus still circulates the globe , but a vaccine for it has been produced .
When H1N1 struck in 1918 , it decimated the usual victims -- the very young and the very old .
But it was unusually fatal for healthy adults as well .
In his book " The Great Influenza , " John Barry writes that the immune systems of healthy adults " mounted massive responses to the virus .
That immune response filled the lungs with fluid and debris , making it impossible for the exchange of oxygen to take place .
"  Instead of saving them , the immune systems drowned their masters .
Despite his odd description of the germ plants , Anderson showed he and other medical professionals knew how the virus was spread : through the air and by an exchange of fluids between the healthy and the infected .
War is over  As November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things were n't looking good in Spokane .
It had n't even been a month since the first H1N1 death , and the city had tallied 4,000 flu cases and more than 100 dead .
There were n't enough doctors and nurses to staff the city 's many sick wards .
Anderson told the Chronicle the " situation is grave .
really serious , more serious than the general public seems to realize .
"  On Nov .
4 , the state health board issued a new order : Everyone had to wear a mask while out in public , including at stores and restaurants .
The masks had to be a certain size -- 5 by 6 inches -- with six layers of sewn-and-bound gauze .
Two days later , the local Red Cross sold the masks at City Hall .
Two types of masks were priced at 5 or 10 cents and all 500 sold out in a half-hour .
Hundreds of people were turned away .
The Red Cross hastily made 4,000 more masks , but they hung loosely on the face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800 masks were sold in the first half-hour .
The paper tallied the dead at 117 .
" Stay home all you can .
Order your merchandise over the telephone .
Do n't forget to keep your windows open both night and day and keep in the fresh air as much as possible and comply with all rules and regulations , " Anderson said .
He was ignored .
With the end of war , celebrations broke out around Spokane on Nov .
11 , Armistice Day , including a parade on Riverside Avenue .
Thousands of motorists and marchers created a " bedlam of sound " with horns , klaxons , tin cans , streetcar whistles and gongs .
The parade , which started at 1 p .
, continued deep into the night .
Public parties lasted throughout the day .
More than 4,500 Spokane men had gone to war , and more than 200 had died in the fight .
Anderson , fighting to prevent more death , knew he could n't stop the celebration , but lamented that the " merrymakers as a rule disregarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  The same day , the state health commissioner lifted the mask rule , and news of his ruling reached Spokane that evening and " immediately circulated among a population already in the midst of celebrating the end to the war , " according to the Influenza Encyclopedia , a website with an account of the illness in the city based on newspaper reports of the time .
Anderson , buoyed by peace , said he thought all the restrictions could be lifted soon .
With Anderson -- and therefore probably most of the city -- believing the flu was on its way out , the Spokesman wrote a fawning profile of the health officer , saying " it is probably fair to say that he has earned the respect and admiration of his fellow citizens in a way no other public official of Spokane has approached .
"  Anderson used logic to convince his fellow citizens , the profile said .
Failing that , he wielded power .
In the profile , Anderson likens his fight against the flu to the war won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of a general to finally vanquish his " invisible enemy .
"  " It is just as necessary to concentrate responsibility and authority in one man here as on the battlefield .
Perhaps more so , for the soldier fights a visible foe while the health authorities and the physician are combating an invisible enemy .
All we see is results of the foe 's strength , " he said .
" It is prompt action which saves the day , and we know it as never before after this epidemic .
"  Discretion and authority  Lutz , current health officer for the Spokane Regional Health District , retains the same authority .
According to state law , a health officer , at " his or her sole discretion , " can " issue an emergency detention order causing a person or group of persons to be immediately detained for purposes of isolation or quarantine .
"  More than a year ago , when Lutz was interviewed about the centenary of the 1918 flu , he talked of his authority .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concern , health officers at the state and local level have a lot of authority , " he said then .
" Isolation and quarantine are elements that are within our purview .
They 're not done lightly .
Our authority during times of emergency are pretty significant .
"  At the time , Lutz questioned the effectiveness of social isolation and banning public gatherings .
Keeping the sick away from the healthy is important , but the ethics of such a public health decision would also have ramifications .
" They call it social distancing , and it makes a lot of sense , but the science and research has n't borne it out to be effective , " he said .
" If I isolate someone , because he or she has TB ( tuberculosis ) , from work , it definitely affects the individual .
But I have to look at it from a public health standpoint .
It 's population first , it 's the individual second .
"  Lutz noted that keeping people from school , church or other social gatherings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with the snap of his fingers .
" It would definitely be much more of a conversation than it was 100 years ago , " he said .
Now Lutz is dealing with the thing he had only theorized about before .
Schools are closed .
Restaurants are closed .
Playgrounds are closed .
He and other health officials are pleading with people to stay away from each other .
" Given that 80% of individuals are going to have minimal symptoms or be asymptomatic , we 're going to get to a point where you more than likely have COVID-like illness , " Lutz said last week .
" What I need you to do is stay at home , self-isolate , monitor your symptoms , stay put for ' X ' amount of time and do that .
People who have contact with you essentially need to quarantine themselves as well .
"  Vaccines , good hand-washing and the sophisticated surveillance network we have to help identify a virus 's source and path through the population all mean we have new ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lutz sounds a lot more like Anderson in the midst of this outbreak than he suggested he would a year ago .
" We 're planning right now eight , 12 , 16 weeks of this type of mitigating work , " Lutz said last week about social distancing and other measures .
" If we 're successful in flattening that curve early , like they saw in South Korea , then again it may be a span of six , eight weeks .
"  Lutz worries we wo n't be successful .
" It was really disconcerting to hear somebody at the national level say we are sort of where Italy was two weeks ago , because Italy has had a 4% mortality rate , " he said .
" I hope we do n't go that route .
But I think people need to take this seriously .
"  Theaters revolt  As December 1918 began , nothing changed .
Every day , 200 cases of the flu were reported .
Still , Anderson believed the flu was waning , lifted some restrictions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of closure .
Theaters were allowed to open , but with strict temperature and humidity controls .
At a time before radio and television , the bored people of Spokane rejoiced .
Social life would begin again , just in time for the holidays .
It did n't last .
The flu roared , and the city counted 231 dead .
Anderson blamed the war celebrations and recent Thanksgiving gatherings .
" Keep away from crowds , " he said .
" Influenza is a crowd disease .
The present increase should convince the most skeptical that the gatherings of the Thanksgiving week have been dangerous .
"  On Dec .
3 , 300 new influenza cases were reported and again the city 's schools were ordered shut .
Anderson again recommended a full ban on public gatherings , causing a " near-riot " at a city board of health meeting on Dec .
" Hooting , hissing and cat-calling came from the back of the room , and one man had to be cautioned by police Sgt .
Daniel to keep quiet or leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a would-be mob , Anderson and the board compromised : Churches would be allowed one service each week , but with no singing because it " acts as a releaser of germs during the singing , nearly the same as during coughing , and that would be dangerous .
" Theaters could remain open , but would have to " close between the hours of 5 and 7 p .
, to air out the theater building .
"  That day , there were 342 new cases of the flu and eight deaths .
Despite the death and disease , business owners were tired of the forced closures , and people were too .
The Empress Theater , at Riverside and Browne Street , violated the quarantine .
Two health inspectors went to the theater and found " 84 people standing in the lobby , in direct violation of the quarantine order , " Anderson said .
There also were children under 12 in attendance and the gallery was overcrowded .
When the health inspectors ordered the lobby cleared , " management paid no heed .
"  If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest the manager , the ticket seller , the doorkeeper and every other employee .
Later that week , with deaths tallied at 374 , the owner of the Hippodrome on Howard Street said he was closing the theater for good and blamed the financial losses stemming from the quarantine .
The next day , Dec .
17 , a coalition of theater owners said they had collected several thousand signatures asking for the end of the ban on public gatherings .
" Those petitions will have as much effect on me as water on a duck 's back , " Anderson said .
" The people circulating and signing the petitions might just as well save their ink .
"  He said the partial ban would go on until January and suggested the businesspeople were putting profits ahead of the public good .
" A dollar is good , but it is no good to a dead man , " he said .
Around this time , Anderson outlawed Christmas and New Year 's celebrations .
Forget all about the flu  Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over .
On Dec .
30 , Anderson announced all restrictions would be lifted at noon New Year 's Day , and schools would reopen Jan .
Even Anderson 's rhetoric shifted .
" Forget all about the ' flu .
' Dismiss it from your mind , " Anderson said , according to the Jan .
4 , 1919 , paper .
" I believe everybody would be better off if they would just forget all about the ' flu .
' I do n't mean by this that people should mingle with persons who have the disease , but I do mean that people should get away from the idea that if they have a little pain or ache they should think it is the influenza .
Just quit thinking about it as much as possible .
This is my suggestion .
"  On Jan .
13 , Anderson closed the Lion Hotel hospital , which " truly signaled the end of Spokane 's epidemic , " according to the Influenza Encyclopedia .
Over 89 days , the hospital had treated 617 people and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's course through Spokane , some 17,000 Spokanites got the flu , and 1,045 died .
The severity of the disease in Spokane led to a higher death rate than in Seattle .
And its three " peaks " -- two in October and one in December -- were more than the typical American city , which saw just two .
The number of cases and deaths would grow outside of this October-to-February window , but Anderson would n't stay in Spokane to see it all the way through .
Deaths would continue to mount after February 1919 , but at a slower rate .
On April 18 , Anderson was given a farewell reception by the employees of the city health office and members of the Rivercrest Contagion Hospital , according to the May 10 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
He was retiring as the city 's health officer after eight years and had been named the state commissioner of health .
' I wanted to feel better '  Camporeale , the historian , is tracking the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  It 's a way to make sense of such uncommon times , he said .
" I wanted to feel better about the decisions that were being made .
For me , I feel better about the decisions that Gov .
Inslee 's making and that Dr .
Lutz is making because we 've made these decisions before and they seemed to have had some impacts , " he said .
" The stakes are incredibly high .
The stakes were high then .
We should do our best to listen to the experts , even if they 're a little bit flying by the seat of their pants .
"  But on his site , Camporeale links Oct .
7 , 1918 to March 14 , 2020 -- the first day confirmed cases appeared in Spokane for the two diseases .
It took three months for the 1918 flu to abate .
It 's been 15 days since COVID-19 was confirmed to be in Spokane .
With cases increasing every day , no one knows how long Spokane will be under quarantine this century .
