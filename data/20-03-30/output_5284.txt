The news comes as Australian scientists announced they had developed a free diagnostic tool that trained doctors to spot COVID-19 in CT scans of patients ' lungs .
University of Sydney professor Patrick Brennan , chief executive of the company behind the solution , told The Sydney Morning Herald current testing only showed whether patients had COVID-19 , whereas the new tool revealed the severity of the infection , information that had the potential to save thousands of lives .
Australia recorded another two COVID-19 deaths to bring the country 's total to 16 , with a total of 3966 confirmed cases .

" Australia has reached a critical point in its fight against coronavirus , with the next few days set to determine whether the health system can cope , or the infection rate explodes beyond capacity .
Leaders , officials and external advisers working on the entwined strategies to manage both the dire health emergency and the tanking economy agree the explosion can be prevented only if Australians immediately distance themselves from one another .
"  " So the Nationals find themselves in a curious situation .
Two of the party 's most talented politicians -- Joyce the former leader , and Canavan the rising star -- languish on the back bench , freelancing on air and taking pot shots at the government .
The situation is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent two sides of a smouldering argument over the future of the party , and nobody knows how it will resolve .
"  " Morrison 's response to this crisis is piecemeal and shambolic .
His press conference on Tuesday night was the sort of policy improvisation that could have started with the words ' Yes , and .
' Two weeks ago he was going to the football .
The prime minister is balancing the health of the public against the health of the economy , and doing neither very well .
Each is hurting the other .
What is needed in both areas is large-scale and decisive action .

"  " More than 1800 Australians are stranded at sea on cruise ships as countries close their borders to slow the spread of COVID-19 .
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is monitoring around 18 cruise ships located across the globe .
A spokesman for the department would not say when those stuck on the ships could expect to come home , but said communication lines were open .
"  " Coronavirus quarantine has led to an interesting trend in fashion : sales for tops are up , and sales for pants are down .
Millions of workers , typically bound to business or business-casual attire in the office , are now free to lounge around their homes in hoodies and sweatpants .
But tops still play an important role as many employees will get semi-dressed for video conference calls .

" We were in a position where we had to move quickly .
We were literally building venues .
We needed to minimise the fallout .
"  Peter Doherty What is clearly different with this outbreak is that SARS-CoV-2 is completely new to us .
Unlike with flu viruses , to which we all have some prior immunity , the world is experiencing a ' virgin soil ' pandemic , where everyone is both susceptible and a potential transmitter .
This does n't mean it 's unstoppable , though .
Paul Bongiorno If anything crystallises the brutal impact of the coronavirus crisis in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country this week .
The lines began forming the day after the prime minister announced that vast sectors of the economy were to be shut down , with income support for those affected .
Here was the intersection of life or death measures , crashing the livelihoods of millions and again exposing a government response that was poorly thought through and executed .
Richard Ackland One savvy business sage who this week was in Gadfly 's ear thinks the fast-failing enterprises in the United States might see Bone Spurs Trump become the first president in office to go bankrupt .
The value of his gilded city towers and hotels is crashing with each passing moment and given they are leveraged to buggery with either Deutsche Bank or the Russian mafia , the whole rickety edifice will soon be underwater .
Perhaps the government simply can not visualise it .
It is possible they are unable to fathom what is happening , to appreciate its size .
Morrison 's response to this crisis is piecemeal and shambolic .
His press conference on Tuesday night was the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , and .

Mike Seccombe As well as trying to contain the catastrophic outbreak of Covid-19 , health authorities , governments and social media platforms must also try to combat the rampant spread of misinformation about the virus .
Peter Craven HBO 's The Plot Against America , based on the Philip Roth novel , brings together Winona Ryder and John Turturro in a reimagining of America 's World War II history .
Now the slickly produced series is more pertinent to current times than the creators could ever have imagined .
