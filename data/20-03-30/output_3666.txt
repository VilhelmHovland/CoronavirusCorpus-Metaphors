With the subsequent deployment of the SANDF , we will be increasing visibility and conduct integrated foot patrols , roadblocks , vehicle checkpoints as of 23h59 on Thursday evening 26 March 2020 .

This will ensure that the movement of people and vehicles is kept to the minimum , with the exception of the transportation of essential good and/or services which include fire and medical emergency services .
At these roadblocks particularly on provincial and national roads , motorists , especially essential service workers that cross provincial borders , will be subjected to screening by officials from the Department of Health .
In terms of the new regulations that have just been gazetted , Police will be responsible to ensure the restriction of movement of persons and goods .
Therefore , there shall be , absolutely no gatherings other than for a funeral , where the number of mourners will be restricted to 50 .
Still on funerals , we need to emphasise that even night vigils will be prohibited .
Last weekend with the previous COVID-19 Disaster Management Regulations , we were inundated with requests for clarity and a lot of other questions around the selling and consumption of liquor .
This time around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly prohibited .
This is applicable to also those supermarkets with liquor licences .
No liquor will be sold anywhere by anyone during the 21-day period of the lockdown .
Equally , the movement of liquor between any two points is also strictly prohibited as per the COVID-19 Disaster Management Regulations .
The President in declaring the lockdown , made exception to essential goods and services .
A detailed list clarifying what these are , is attached as one of the Annexures in the Regulations .
Only those goods and services that appear on these Annexures will be allowed .
Anything outside of these lists will not be entertained .
Therefore , anyone found to be in contravention of the Regulations , shall be found guilty and on conviction , will be liable to a fine , or imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months , or both .

Ladies and gentlemen , the simplest and best way to combat the spread of the Corona Virus , is to adhere to the call by the President and STAY HOME .
The only time you should be outside of your home should be to acquire essential services such as medical attention , food , or other goods and services as listed in the Annexure to the Regulations .

Let us unite against the virus .
Remember , our aim is to arrest the virus not to arrest people .
