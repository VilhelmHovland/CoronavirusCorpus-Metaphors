NARA , Japan ( AP ) -- Cherry blossoms are in season and the ancient Japanese capital of Nara , with its majestic Todaiji " Big Buddha " temple and its herds of deer , would normally be packed .
This year , it 's almost deserted , as are most other tourist attractions in Japan as foreign visitors stay away and locals heed warnings to stay home to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus .
The tourism industry , heavily reliant on foreign travelers , has taken a beating since Beijing banned group tours in late January .
But there 's a silver lining for some Japanese living in popular locations like Kyoto who were getting fed up with the crowds and disruptions from legions of visitors .
Tadayuki Takiguchi 's souvenir shop was the only one open on a recent weekday on a street near Nara 's famous deer park , where tourists usually stop to take photos and feed the animals .
" Sometimes I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've never seen anything like this .
"  Nara was among the first Japanese towns to be hit by the virus outbreak when a local bus driver tested positive for the virus in late January after carrying tourists from Wuhan , the epicenter of the pandemic .
Around the same time , China 's government banned group tours and sales of overseas travel packages .
Chinese tourists quickly disappeared , followed by visitors from the U .
and Europe , Takiguchi said .
These days , most shops do n't bother to open , some perhaps wary of customers who might spread the virus .
As of Sunday , Japan had reported more than 2,400 confirmed cases of the virus , including 712 infected while being quarantined on a cruise ship .
Authorities have ordered some school closures and advised people in areas such as Tokyo , where the number of cases is growing quickly , to try to stay home .
Widening travel restrictions and closures of most tourism and entertainment venues have gutted the tourism industry in many parts of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers , Takiguchi says his business is " doomed .
"  But some see a bright side to the unusual quiet in places that in the past few years have been inundated with visitors .
In nearby Kyoto , officials and residents are considering how to make tourism more sustainable .
" I feel Kyoto 's ' wabi-sabi ' atmosphere is back , " said freelance tour guide Takakazu Machi , referring to traditional aesthetic sensibilities of simplicity and beauty evoked in the world of Haiku .
Machi , left with no income during what should be the peak sakura season , is driving a cab to make ends meet .
Artist Kinji Nakamura , 76 , who lives near the scenic Togetsu bridge in Kyoto 's verdant Arashiyama district , had grown weary of the traffic jams and nuisance caused by some tourists , who have for example have had to be warned against climbing inside ancient , fragile cherry trees to take selfies .
" Tourists were overflowing , and this is about right , " Nakamura said .
