Published : Mar 29 , 2020 , 8:35 am IST  Updated : Mar 29 , 2020 , 8:35 am IST  The Odisha CM would have some valuable insights on how to plan for a disaster  Migrant workers line up outside the Anand Vihar bus terminal in New Delhi to leave for their villages in the wake of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown announced by prime minister Narendra Modi .
On March 28 , tens of thousands of migrant workers fought and shoved their way onto buses organised by Uttar Pradesh to go to their home towns .
( AFP )  As the nation grapples with the terrible problem of migrant workers walking from Delhi to villages in UP or Bihar , not to mention workers from Telangana packed like sardines in container trucks , one harks back to the extraordinary measures taken by Odisha , one of the poorest states in the country , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It was a textbook case of how the might of the state can be used to mitigate the suffering of common people : The state government built storm shelters , sent over 2 million text messages , used over 40,000 voluntary workers , public address systems , the police , public transport to warn people to move quickly to the shelters as a cyclone with windspeeds of 175-185 kmph was going to hit the coast .
And it worked ! The evacuation was meticulously planned and the government , which had learnt hard lessons from past tragedies , moved a million people to safety with great speed .
Contrast that with what the central government has done : the coronavirus lockdown was announced -- rather dramatically , without taking stock of the scale of human suffering it would cause to the poor and marginalised -- to begin at the stroke of midnight on March 23 .
How could a small and poor state manage to evacuate a million to safety with less than 20 deaths whereas the prime minister of the nation with all the resources of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuate a similar number of migrant workers to safety before the lockdown was announced ? What is the lesson there ?  Does he care ?  As India watches thousands of migrants walking back home without food , water and money , the only conclusion anyone can come to is that the prime minister cares little about the people he governs .
What prevented him from calling in the army and ordering the use of their transport to take the migrants back home ? Even the ' corona package ' of Rs 1 .
lakh crore was announced after the lockdown and not before .
He also found time to call a video-conference meeting of SAARC nations to fight the virus and even announced a corpus fund to this end .
It is only now , after the migrant labour crisis , that the Union home secretary has written to all the states and union territories to take immediate steps to provide adequate support , including food and shelter , to migrant agricultural labour , industrial and other unorganised sector workers during the 21-day national lockdown .
One may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done .
The strategy of isolation and social distancing to contain the coronavirus outbreak has been completely knocked off course .
Perhaps the prime minister should have consulted the able chief minister of Odisha , who came in for praise from the UN for his government 's efforts to prevent loss of lives and prevent human suffering .
The Odisha government had drafted lists of vulnerable people , employed hundreds of power boats , and truckloads of food and bottled water was delivered to the shelters .
That is how a caring government responds to an emergency .
The central government does not have to look abroad for an example to follow , it exists right here within our shores .
