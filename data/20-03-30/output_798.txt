As someone who has experienced the horrific conditions of jail , it 's appalling to see certain politicians in Albany continue to push for rollbacks to New York 's bail reform law during a public health crisis .
Amending the law to put more people in jail would spell disaster .

If you have n't spent time behind bars , it 's impossible to imagine what life there is like .
Jails are cruel and horrendous places that are uniquely ill-prepared to deal with something as serious as the coronavirus .
All the normal basic health resources people take for granted in their daily lives become luxuries , including access to showers , food , medication , soap and water .
They can be denied for no good reason and are often doled out at the discretion of guards , who base their decisions on secret patronage systems they have established .
One time I caught a foot fungus in the shower .
The cream they gave me was totally ineffective , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 10 years later .
Even when there was a serious medical crisis , jails have slow and inadequate responses .
When I sought help after breaking my ankle in two places , it took three hours to get me to an outside hospital .
This is the typical response that I came to expect .
There is no sense of urgency because to the officers and staff , you do n't matter .
You are considered less than human .
Now imagine what will happen when a highly contagious virus starts spreading .
These facilities are extremely overcrowded and it 's impossible to do any kind of social distancing or regular handwashing .
People are packed together all throughout the day .
The Daily News Flash Newsletter  When I was first incarcerated , I was held on $75,000 bail and suffering from substance use and mental health issues .
What I needed was medical care , not a jail bed .
I was never given the support and resources that would actually help me address what I was going through .

Their issues remain or worsen , and the cycle of poverty continues .

They are at the mercy of the political calculations from the governor and other legislative leaders , who are letting fearmongering from law enforcement drive their decision making .
It does not have to be this way .
This is ultimately about political will and courage to stand up for what is right .
