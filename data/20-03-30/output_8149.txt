We need your help .
The coronavirus crisis in Portland is a major threat to the Mercury 's ability to keep the city informed .
We pride ourselves on having navigated many storms in the world of independent local media , but this time is different .
90% of our revenue -- from advertising , ticketing fees , and our own events -- is directly tied to people getting together in groups .
The coronavirus situation has virtually eliminated this income all at once .
At a time when the city needs local coverage more than ever , we 're asking for your help to support continued coverage or everything happening in Portland .
You can make one-time or recurring donations .
We ca n't say enough how much we appreciate your support .
Thank you .
What Are We Supposed To Do Now ?  The thing about boredom and time on one 's hand in this day , aside from The Virus , but also with the Virus abound , is that the average AMERICAN will spend that time on Facebook or some other social media site .
Forget books , and writing .
art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and being entertained .
Oh no you did n't , forget chores and cleaning too .
could be argued for those who work , and clearly those that do n't because in the latter nothing has changed for those routines .
Have we , the average person , lost any values of expanding our minds , learning something new , or doing something without the internet ? Do n't bring up the subject of " getting stoned " and playing video games .
Or the person , bored , that has absolutely nothing else to do but will go to the grocery store because that was their social activity although there is a isolation lock down and deadly virus running rampant .
We are so needy constantly needing some form of entertainment because that is what we have become .
