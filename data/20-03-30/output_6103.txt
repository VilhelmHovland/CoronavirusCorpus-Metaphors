Mindanao food supply  Provincial governors in Mindanao have agreed to make an inventory of existing food stocks and identify production areas where supplies can be sourced , the Mindanao Development Authority ( MinDA ) said .
The MinDA said engaging the governors is part of the Self-Sustaining Food Security Strategy ( SSFSS ) , a MinDA program to link the provincial governments with one another to ensure stable food supply for their constituents .
MinDA crafted the SSFSS earlier this week in the face of the threat that uncoordinated food supply distribution in Mindanao could create artificial shortages .
The SSFSS aims to ensure that the local government units ( LGUs ) were able to quantify their current food supply inventory of basic food commodities like rice , eggs , poultry , meat and fruits like banana and identify individuals or groups which could undertake sustained food production .
The SSFSS would identify neighboring LGUs which would have excess production of any food commodity .
This would enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to establish a symbiotic food supply relationship and establish a marketing and distribution system .
In a Facebook post on Thursday , MinDA Chairman Emmanuel F .

North Cotabato Governor Nancy Catamco informed MinDA she was ready to implement the SSFSS in her province which she said would include the distribution of upland rice seeds to complement production in lowland areas .
MinDA said that under SSFSS , the provincial government would also distribute vegetable seeds and backyard chicken breeders to encourage farmers to produce more food .
The LGUs would buy the farmers chicken , hog , egg and vegetable products for distribution to residents as food assistance .
" We do n't know how long the problem would last that is why we have to be prepared , " Catamco said .
