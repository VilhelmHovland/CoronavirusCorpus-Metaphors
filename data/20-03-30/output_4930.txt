Stimulus billions ca n't buy hospitals out of shortage crisis  The billions of tax dollars headed for hospitals and states as part of the USD 2 .
trillion coronavirus response bill wo n't fix the problem facing doctors and nurses : a critical shortage of protective gowns , gloves and masks .
The problem is n't a lack of money , experts say .
It 's that there 's not enough of those supplies available to buy .
What 's more , the crisis has revealed a fragmented procurement system now descending into chaos just as demand soars , The Associated Press has found .
Hospitals , state governments and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are left bidding against each other and driving up prices .
For more than a week , governors have pushed back against administration assurances that supplies are available now , bitterly complaining to President Donald Trump that there 's no coordination .
" It 's pretty much every state for itself , " said Virginia 's secretary of finance , Aubrey Layne , who is deeply involved with his state 's effort to buy medical supplies .
Masks that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quoted as high as USD 9 , he said , and suppliers make clear that there are " plenty of people out here " looking to buy , even at the high prices .
" There is a lot of opportunism going on , " Layne said .
Doctors and nurses in hot spots like New York and New Orleans are caring for feverish , wheezing COVID-19 patients without adequate masks , gloves or gowns .
Can the USD 100 billion carved out for hospitals in the stimulus package solve that ? " It is not about throwing money at this problem , " said Lisa Ellram , a professor of supply chain management at Miami University of Ohio .
Just like consumers who today wander past empty shelves in the toilet paper aisle , state governments and hospitals are finding their suppliers ' warehouses are bare .
The AP reported last week that imports of critical medical supplies were plummeting due to factory closures in China , where manufacturers had been required to sell all or part of their goods internally rather than export to other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps through the world , shuttering potential backup factories from one country to the next .
Many manufacturers have been ordered to shut down or limit production throughout Southeast Asia and Latin America , including in India and Mexico .
In Malaysia , where 75 percent of the world 's medical gloves are made , AP found factories were shut down and only allowed to reopen with half staff , who are now locked in hostels at their workplaces .
Shipments of medical gloves are down 23 per cent so far this month compared with 2019 , and medical gown imports are down 64 per cent for the same period , according to trade data compiled by Panjiva and ImportGenius , services that track imports and exports .
No medical-grade N95 masks , made almost entirely in China , have arrived at US ports so far this month .
An Oregon Nurses Association member who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for her job said she 's allowed one N95 mask a day to protect against tiny particulates .
" Wearing the same mask from patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are we taking care of them or putting them at greater risk ? " she said .
A colleague has already tested positive for COVID-19 , she said .
Her own test was lost so she 's being retested .
But she continues to work treating patients even though she has minor symptoms .
For most people , the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .
Six weeks ago , the Center for Global Development warned that the U .
should get ready to rapidly scale-up medical supply manufacturing .
Minnesota 's 3M Co .
was already ramping up , but only in the past week have many others followed .
A frenzied push to increase domestic production is too little and too late , said Prashant Yadav , a visiting fellow at the center .
Trump on Friday announced that he was using his power under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventilators -- work that had already been underway , AP reported .
Yadav said that in addition to more supplies , states and hospitals need a better way to allocate medical supplies to the places they 're needed most .
" The real challenge is not having a clear dashboard-like function that can help match demand and supply .
Just infusing more cash does n't create that , " he said Friday .
Before the crisis , hospitals typically bought masks , gloves and other equipment through independent purchasers that bargain with suppliers to keep costs down .
But those groups have n't been able to fill orders .
Soumi Saha , director of advocacy at Premier , which purchases equipment for roughly 4,000 hospitals , said 56 per cent of hospitals did n't receive their orders for N95 masks in February .
She said traditional wholesale markets are depleted and hospitals are turning to the gray market , rife with scams and counterfeit products .
In a 72-hour period last week , Premier fielded more than 130 requests from hospitals to evaluate unregulated suppliers , none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term solutions are patchwork .
We need to start implementing longer term solutions now or I do n't know how much longer the Band Aid can hold on , .
" she said .
The new nonprofit Project N95 , launched by tech entrepreneurs , former government officials and supply chain experts , is one of many new impromptu clearinghouses for medical equipment trying to solve the crisis .
