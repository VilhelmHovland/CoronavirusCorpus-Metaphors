Rent notices being posted in rental buildings by landords and property managers are warning tenants they must pay their rents by April 1 or face consequences .
Ontario politicians and legal experts , however , are telling tenants if they ca n't pay for the short term due to hardship due to the pandemic , they can not be evicted .
Network  The query is no April Fool 's joke for an untold number of tenants across Quinte struggling with temporary layoffs , self-isolation and mounting bills amid the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic .
Landlords , meanwhile , are worried a scourge of imminent rent defaults will dent their cash flows needed to pay mortgages , electric bills , and property taxes on their multi-residential buildings .
Steve Clark , Ontario 's Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing , said everyone needs to work together to get through this pandemic .
" I know people are anxious , wondering how they will pay their April rent in just a few days , and landlords are wondering how they will keep the lights on if rents are n't paid , " Clark told Postmedia .
Noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings weighing evictions , Clark urged tenants to pay rent to the best of their abilities but said if they ca n't , they will be protected for now .
Clark said , " I want to be very clear -- you can not be forced to leave your home if you can not pay your rent on April 1 .
Period .
" Today , I 'm calling on landlords to be as flexible as possible when it comes to collecting rent , starting with April , at a time when many people are struggling .
The same goes for any planned rent increases landlords are contemplating , whether already approved by the Landlord and Tenant Board or not , " Clark said .
It appears some landlords did n't get the Queen 's Park memo .
Blunt notices have gone up across Belleville rental buildings advising tenants they still must cough up their monthly rent April 1 or else .
Since late last week , The Intelligencer witnessed at least three such notices in different apartment buildings .
Take one such notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renter who was recently laid off and ca n't start a new job until stay-at-home measures now in place are lifted .
Jamie Boomhour , 36 , said property management firm Royal/Kente Property Management posted a notice in his building informing tenants : " Rent is not being forgiven because of COVID-19 .
"  Boomhour said the tone " from that note looks like they 're trying to bully everyone here .
They put it up when Premier Doug Ford made his announcement tenants would be protected against evictions .
"  He said he and wife , Lisa , who is a working nurse , will pay their rent -- no problem -- but he is worried for others .
" A good landlord will understand the situation and give tenants a little wiggle room , " Boomhour said .
" Some tenants are worried once this is over , they property managers will issue eviction notices for those who are in arrears .
"  Rob Gentile , president of the Quinte Region Landlords ' Association , said like tenants , landlords are also feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working to find solutions .
The association has 220 landlord members in the area .
" Small landlords across Ontario rely on their rents to pay their bills , the largest ones being mortgages , taxes , and utilities .
While some landlords , but not all , may be granted deferrals on some bills , they will still have to be paid in the end .
So it is not realistic for rents to simply be waived without government financial assistance .
"  " We encourage all landlords and tenants to work cooperatively with each other .
Tenants who are facing financial struggles because of COVID-19 should pay what they can and work out a payment plan with their landlords to catch up on missed rent .
We urge landlords to be empathetic with tenants , and to the extent that they can afford it , be flexible on dealing with late and missed rent , " Gentile told The Intelligencer .
" Some tenants groups are advocating not paying their rent because housing is an essential service .
But I do n't hear them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In both cases , that 's called theft .
"  " There is a campaign underfoot by tenants advocacy groups to encourage tenants to break the law and deliberately withhold rent payments because they know evictions are not allowed right now .
That will spell big trouble .
Without a functioning justice system to turn to for help , we fear some desperate small landlords facing bankruptcy will take matters into their own hands and evict non-paying tenants any way they can , " Gentile said .
Samantha Hayward , staff lawyer at Community Legal and Advocacy Centre in Belleville , said tenants who can should meet their tenancy obligations to pay their rent April 1 but if they are in a financial bind due to the pandemic and ca n't honour their rent cheques , tenants can not be evicted for now .
" These are difficult times for tenants and we are awaiting a response from the provincial government on measures to protect tenants who can not pay their rent in these difficult times .
As it stands , rent is still due on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Community resources may be available to support tenants who are unable to pay their rent .
For tenants who ca n't pay their rent on April 1 , there is no immediate risk of eviction .
The law remains that a landlord can only end a tenancy with a valid eviction order from the Landlord and Tenant Board .
Most evictions are currently on hold across Ontario , " Hayward said .
" The Landlord and Tenant Board has adjourned the majority of eviction hearings and the Court Enforcement Office , the only body that can enforce an eviction and change the locks , will not be taking action on current eviction orders until further notice .
"  Hayward suggested tenants can " contact the legal clinic directly by phone or email for specific legal advice about their situation and appropriate referrals .
