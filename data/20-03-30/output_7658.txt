The idea , which was raised in a road map on combating coronavirus authored by his former Food and Drug Administration head , Dr .
Scott Gottlieb , runs counter to the current government directive that masks are n't necessary for most people .
Trump said that could potentially change , but only for a short period .
" I saw his suggestion on that .
We will take a look at it , " the President said during his daily news briefing , saying he had n't discussed the idea yet with his task force .
A source close to the coronavirus task force said the idea of asking Americans to wear masks for a period of time during the pandemic is likely to be under " serious discussion .
"  The source said part of the issue with the recommendation is the current supply of masks would not meet the ongoing demand .
Then , of course , there is the issue of medical professionals who still lack critical personal protective equipment due to supply shortages .
Trump said that if he does offer that recommendation , it would be for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We want our country back , " the President said during the Rose Garden briefing .
" We are not going to be wearing masks forever , but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear .
I could see something like that happening for a period of time .
