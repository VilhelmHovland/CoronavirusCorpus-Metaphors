The other side of Adeosun  Little wonder Nigerians were utterly shocked when it came to the public domain that the Minister of Finance , Kemi Adeosun had tendered her resignation letter .
Never has it been on record , that a serving Minister resigned because of falsified National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC ) exemption certificate .
I am not here to analyze or justify whether her National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC ) exemption certificate was fake , forged or not genuine .
The drama continues to unfold in this political season .
The political space is so tensed that the heat emanating is pushing people around .
How many African leaders today are willing to resign when there are issues that are obviously threatening their seat ? It is at that point they decide to stay glued to their seats and focus on how to scheme and retain their positions .
Historically , from 1999 till date , there are people who have had allegations of falsified documents and they have decided to sit tight and till date nothing has been done .
For those requesting Adeosun 's prosecution , the trusted associates who issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her .
How many women do we have at the helms of affairs ? How many women do we have left as Ministers ? One resigned to pursue further career in the international space .
Adeosun , I must say , resigned honorably , she is a force to be reckoned with .
She has proven her competence and capacity beyond reasonable doubt .
Her accent , her beauty , her modest dressing proves it all , if you doubt her credibility , then do n't take a back seat instead go and be the minister of finance rather than being an onlooker or spectator from a distance judging issues .
It will forever be on record that she was one-time Minister of Finance who made impact during her brief stay .
She was instrumental to the establishment of the Efficiency Unit ( E-Unit ) initiative , Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme ( VAIDS ) , Presidential Initiative on Continuous Audit ( PICA ) , Treasury Single Account ( TSA ) , development of whistle blower policy , capital budget releases among others .
Women are better managers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy any position and perform tremendously well .
The economy of Nigeria is of paramount importance .
Let the game of power tussle begin as we look forward to who takes charge of Nigeria 's finance sector .
