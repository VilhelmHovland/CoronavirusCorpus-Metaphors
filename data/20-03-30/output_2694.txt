WASHINGTON - As President Donald Trump slowly comes to grips with his country 's grim prognosis for COVID-19 , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau conceded Monday he 's taking a measure of comfort from early signs that the caseload in Canada is on a different trajectory than the United States .
Trudeau said he 's proud that Canadians appear to be taking seriously the importance of staying home and keeping their distance from others -- the one measure public health officials say is paramount to slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus .
And while the success or failure of those efforts wo n't become clear for at least another week , Trudeau said , there 's little doubt that Canada is doing better than its southern neighbour at limiting the scope of the illness .
" I think I would say we 're not necessarily on the same trajectory , " Trudeau said in French during the daily fresh-air briefing outside his Rideau Cottage residence .
" We were quicker to get the screening done , and I think we have had more success in getting people to self-isolate .
"  The U .
, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were more than 156,000 cases by midday , nearly 13,000 more than the day before , and the number of deaths was hurtling towards 3,000 .
A shortage of beds , ventilators and masks had hospitals in hard-hit New York City operating well past the breaking point , using refrigerator trucks as makeshift morgues .
The USNS Comfort , a hospital ship , docked at Manhattan 's Pier 90 to help with the overflow .
Alarming spikes in the caseloads in New Jersey , Florida , Pennsylvania and Louisiana had officials in those states bracing for the worst , well aware they might be ill-equipped to handle it .
In New Orleans , home to America 's worst per-capita COVID-19 death rate , the mayor said she 'd have cancelled Mardi Gras last month if only the federal government had warned her .
Anthony Fauci , the lead voice of medical reason on the White House coronavirus task force , has warned the U .
death toll could land between 100,000 and 200,000 -- and that 's after Trump abandoned his " aspirational " target of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures until the end of the month instead .
" By very vigorously following these guidelines , we could save one million American lives , " Trump said Monday during a Rose Garden news conference as he spelled out the need to keep the country shuttered for another month .
" This is our shared patriotic duty ; challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days .
We 're sort of putting it all on the line , this 30 days .
"  To the horror of public health experts , Trump had been musing about a celebratory Easter long weekend marked by packed churches , open shops and an accelerated return to American normalcy , insisting he did n't want the " cure " to be worse than the " problem .
" But early indications from Washington state , which reported the first known U .
case , suggest the social-distancing strategy is having an impact .
A joint online survey released Monday by polling firm Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies suggested , among other things , a difference in attitudes between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb the spread of the virus .
Only 86 per cent of 1,004 U .
respondents said they were keeping the requisite two-metre distance between themselves and others , compared with 95 per cent of the 1,590 Canadians surveyed , while 85 per cent of the American survey group said they had stopped going out for necessities -- nine percentage points less than their northern neighbours .
And while 86 per cent of the Canadians polled said they had asked friends and family to keep their social distance , only 72 per cent of the U .
respondents could say the same .
" Everything depends on the choices that people have made and continue to make , " Trudeau said .
" I 'm very proud of the way that Canadians have rallied and continue to abide by the guidelines .
I think they understand that we all have an opportunity to have a direct impact on Canada 's ability to come out of this .
"  When confronted with the failings of the American response , Trump frequently claims that things would have been far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late January on travellers from China , where the outbreak originated .
Most major airlines by that point had already suspended flights to China .
Canada , however , did n't take significant steps to restrict international travellers until mid-March .
On Monday , Trudeau -- asked whether that should have happened earlier -- seemed to acknowledge that with the benefit of hindsight , more could have been done .
" We 're obviously not , in an unprecedented situation , always going to get things perfectly right , " he said .
" We 're going to continue to be committed to doing the right things as best as we can and figuring out what works , what does n't work , and moving forward in a way that is both nimble and focused on helping Canadians , insomuch as a government can be nimble and agile .
"  Canada and the U .
agreed to close their shared border to non-essential travel two weeks ago while still allowing two-way trade , supply lines and commercial interests to continue , including workers who live in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also banned foreign nationals from China , Iran and parts of Europe .
Given U .
social-distancing restrictions will remain in place through April , those existing travel bans would likely be extended as well , Trump said -- " maybe even toughened up a little bit .
