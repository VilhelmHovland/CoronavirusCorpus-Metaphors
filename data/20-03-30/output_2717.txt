Self-isolation causes increase of danger for women during pandemic  During practices of social distancing and isolation , women with abusive partners are at a greater risk of harm .
As social supports reduce services the world can close in on a woman who lives in an abusive home , creating another barrier to escape their abuser .
File photo  Social distancing and self-isolation remain top priorities and act as safety measures during the outbreak of COVID-19 .
Yet , the safety of women and children in vulnerable states in a community also needs to be of concern .
There is a connection between the pandemic of COVID-19 and the safety of women living in or trying to leave abusive relationships or living situations .
Women with abusive partners are at a greater risk of harm as the government has mandated the closure of schools , community centres , libraries , community programming and other municipal facilities or services with the aim to slow the spread of the virus .
As strategies that support good infection control increase by staying at home from work or staying away from public spaces , the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce services the world can close in on a woman who lives in an abusive home , creating another barrier to escape their abuser .
By the recommendations made by health officials individuals have been encouraged to work from home or distance themselves socially , which can often play into the hands of abusers in the way of socially isolating a partner or spouse .
As abuse is often about control and power , if survivors are forced to live in close proximity with their abuser , an abuser may use any measure to control their victim .
According to the Huron Women 's Shelter Executive Director Corey Allison , social distancing and isolation during this pandemic period is impossible in a shelter setting .
A 10-bed shelter with 13 women and children currently residing there , it remains impossible to maintain safe social distancing in a communal kitchen , living room and dining room .
It is also challenging to ask the women , especially those with children , to stay in their small rooms without a TV or access to food during this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelter is exploring alternative housing options that are safe but will also be more supportive of self-isolation and social distancing .
" Our organization has been and will continue to be available to women and families within our community , " explains Allison .
Shelter staff is working with community partners to continue to provide services through modified means , to ensure women and families have access to support , services and advocacy .
" We recognize that due to the current situation , gender-based violence will increase , therefore , we are collaborating with community partners to raise awareness of this issue , " Allison says .
In addition to housing vulnerable women and children , the shelter offers services that extend beyond shelter .
Risk assessments , safety planning , advocacy and system navigation are critical services done as well .
The ability to connect and build a foundation of trust is critical to comprehensive risk assessment and while these services can be delivered virtually , Allison says it adds an element of difficulty .
" Coupled with the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delivering services virtually actually increases risk , " adds Allison .
" We are getting incredibly creative and meeting women in the park or though new email addresses that allow her to communicate .
"  Victim Services Huron County Executive Director Deborah Logue further explains that remote support is a challenge as it offers limited privacy if they do not live alone .
" Many of our conversations are of a sensitive nature and should not be overheard by children or a spouse , " explains Logue .
" Our biggest worry is that people are at home with no escape from a hostile situation and do not know who to reach out to .
"  Developing additional social media and community-based campaigns to educate the community to the greater risks of gender-based violence , the shelter and its community partners are facilitating access to available local supports .
Implementing public health directives by offering services through virtual means , the shelter can provide tips around how to safely help a woman .
" For high-risk situations we continue to provide individualized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allison says .
" Women and families seeking admission to the shelter are screened for both domestic violence and COVID-related concerns .
"  Self-isolating facilities are available to families deemed high risk , and for others who have more resources , the shelter offers safety plans and helps the families navigate the systems .
Allison reiterates that an important aspect the community should realize is that as normal life activities are disrupted as they are with this pandemic , women will be forced to spend time in the same space of their abuser .
" As fears mount and tensions rise , abusive situations may arise more easily and the reality is that home is not a safe space for some people , " Allison adds .
" The shelter believes it is crucial that we inform the public of this potential escalation in gender-based violence .
"  Staff at Victim Services Huron County conducts regular phone check-ins to see how clients are managing mental and physical health during the pandemic .
Additionally , some financial support has been offered by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all pull together during this difficult time in different ways , " explains Logue .
" With limited options for someone to report abuse , we are relying on neighbours , friends and family to help keep an eye out and ensure resources are being shared .
"  The situation of children living in abusive households is also a concern for services such as the Huron Shelter , Victim Services and Rural Response for Healthy Children ( RRHC ) .
According to Selena Hazlitt , Executive Director of RRHC some of the concerns staff are hearing about include the fear of the unknown -- how long public health practices will be in place -- the availability of food and supplies and household financial concerns .
Resources and supports will continue to be available for women and children 's physical safety through partnerships with Huron OPP , Victim Services and the Huron Shelter .
RRHC makes referrals to these organizations when appropriate .
" RRHC is concerned about the well being of children and youth .
Students are no longer at school where they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As many homes no longer have landline telephones , access to devices to connect with services such as Kids Help Line may be restricted at home .
" Children and youth are being asked to stay home and socially distance from friends and trusted adults , " furthers Hazlitt .
" Children and youth may also be experiencing even more shifts in their routines when custody situations exist between parents .
"  Hazlitt encourages individuals to check in with friends , neighbours and family members and to ask to speak to a child directly .
" The public needs to have an understanding that for some women , children and youth , it simply is not safe to be in their homes , " explains Hazlitt .
Due to social distancing and the closure of public facilities such as parks , libraries and schools , there is n't a safe space for children to ask out trusted adults for help .
In addition to reaching out to neighbours and friends over the phone and speaking with children , Hazlitt adds : " Believe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flags for abuse and neglect .
When children and youth ask for help , please respond .
Assure them you have heard them and you are finding help .
"  RRHC along with their community partners , Victim Services and the Huron Women 's Shelter , continually promote the need for the community to access valid information sources related to COVID-19 .
This includes Huron Perth Public Health ( HPPH ) , the Public Health Agency of Canada and local family health teams .
All services are still offering phone support at the very least , and individuals are encouraged to call services they feel would be the best fit .
Hazlitt encourages those suspicious of abuse and neglect to call 1-519-524-7356 or 1-800-265-5198 to report to Children 's Aid Society .
