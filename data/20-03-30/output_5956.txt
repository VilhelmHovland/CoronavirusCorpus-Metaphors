From the editor 's desk : Pandemic pandemonium  Editor 's letter from the April 2020 edition of the magazine .
The coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic has come as a catastrophe for the global economy .
As I write this , news reports , quoting economists from various global banks , suggest that India could see a contraction in its gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the first quarter of FY21 , its first in two decades .
Others , like Moody 's Analytics , are calling it an economic tsunami .
Whichever analysis one goes by , one thing is certain : The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown all calculations , all estimates of growth across countries , totally off gear .
As countries across the globe grapple with the enormity of the disease and the destruction it causes in its wake -- lakhs infected and many thousands dead across the world -- even the mightiest nations are witnessing scenes like never before .
The U .
, the U .
, and the rest of Europe are coming to terms with the fact that this pandemic will test them to the hilt .
China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal ever so slowly , but the fear of a dreaded " second wave " is all too real .
Amidst all this , India has declared a 21-day lockdown , beginning midnight of March 25 , to reduce the spread of the virus as the Narendra Modi government pulls out all stops to try and minimise the impact of this devastating pandemic on 1 .
billion Indians .
Given the numbers of the poor and the underprivileged in India , the government knows only too well that nothing short of extreme measures will work in these terrifying times .
However , the government has a twopronged battle to fight .
On the one hand , it has to ensure that its rickety public healthcare system partners effectively with the private sector to minimise the numbers of the infected and , consequently , the fatalities .
On the other hand , it must ensure the lockdown does not cause devastation for the crores of underprivileged , among them daily wage earners , small business owners , small farmers and many , many others .
On March 26 , 36 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced a 1 .
crore package of measures to support 800 million poor and needy over the next three months .
The RBI followed this up with a big rate cut .
These could be the first of more measures as the government tries to assess the overall impact of the pandemic on the economy , and the disruption it is likely to cause .
Currently , all bets are off about the extent of damage the economy will suffer .

For now , as the world battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home .
