In a bid to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the India economy , RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday announced a 75 bps cut in repo rate to 4 .
Taking cognizance of the lockdown due to corona virus ( COVID19 ) , the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) on Friday reduced its repo rate ( short-term lending ) by 75 basis points ( bps ) to 4 .
in its last monetary policy review for 2019-2020 .
The RBI also permitted financial institutions to allow a three-month moratorium on monthly installments on all term loans .
In a video address Shaktikanta Das , governor of RBI says , " All commercial banks , including regional rural banks , small finance banks and local area banks , co-operative banks , all-India financial Institutions , and non-banking finance companies ( NBFCs ) , including housing finance companies and micro-finance institutions are being permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect of all term loans outstanding between 1 March 2020 to 31 May 2020 .
The repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor , will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period .
Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period .
"  Installments include payments falling due from 1st March to 31 May 2020 , such as principal and/or interest components ; bullet repayments ; equated monthly instalments ( EMIs ) and credit card dues , RBI says , adding , accordingly , the repayment schedule and all subsequent due dates , as also the tenor for such loans , may be shifted across the board by three months .
RBI also decided to defer interest on working capital facilities provided by lenders .

According to the RBI governor , the moratorium and deferment is being provided specifically to enable the borrowers to tide over the economic fallout from COVID-19 .
" However , the same will not be treated as change in terms and conditions of loan agreements due to financial difficulty of the borrowers and , consequently , will not result in asset classification downgrade .
The lending institutions may accordingly put in place a board approved policy in this regard , " he added .
In addition , the rescheduling of payments will not qualify as a default for supervisory reporting and reporting to credit information companies ( CICs ) by the lending institutions .
RBI says , CICs should ensure that the actions taken by lending institutions pursuant to today 's announcements do not adversely impact the credit history of the borrowers .
The reverse repo rate ( short-term borrowing ) is also reduced by 90 bps to 4% .
It has been decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks by 100 bps to 3% of net demand and time liabilities ( NDTL ) with effect from the fortnight beginning 28 March 2020 for a period of one year , the central bank says .
According to Mr Das , the country needs conventional , unconventional measures to combat virus .
" Hence the monetary policy committee ( MPC ) has voted for a sizeable reduction in the policy repo rate and for maintaining accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary , to revive growth and mitigate impact of COVID19 , " he added .
" Global economic activity has come to a near standstill and expectations of shallow recovery in 2020 are dashed .
The outlook is heavily contingent on intensity , spread and duration of COVID19 .
There is a rising probability that large parts of the world will slip into recession , The RBI governor says , adding , " Our effort is to effort macroeconomic stability .

" It has been decided , in consultation with the government , to permit banks in India which operate international financial services centre ( IFSC ) banking units ( IBUs ) to participate in the NDF market from 1 June 2020 .
Banks may participate through their branches in India , their foreign branches or through their IBUs , " RBI says .

RBI needs to extend the rate cut reliefs to all borrowers with immediate effect .
yashomiraj  In Reply to hamungel4 days ago  The moratorium on EMI is an eye wash .
The interest will keep getting accrued during these 3 months and one would be required to pay interest on interest post 3 months moratorium period .
How is this easing one 's pain ? In fact one is paying more .
Bank is not losing any money .
Not surprising at all .
