The floor is lava  What you will need : Permission from Mum and Dad ( or whoever owns the house ) that it is OK to climb on the furniture .
HOW TO PLAY -- This is a ? ongoing game , which works best when sprung upon people in the room/area at random times .
Simply , one person yells : " The floor is lava ! " and then starts counting down from five .
Every other person must be completely off the ground by the time the countdown reaches zero .
What , or who , they climb on is up to them , but if any part of them remains on the ground then they 'll be burnt to a crisp .
LEVEL-UP -- The game can continue if you challenge other players to get to a certain place without touching the ground .
Watch as each player creatively devises a plan for crossing the dangerous lava without stepping down and ? burning their toes .
Control the robot  6  One player is the robot , the other is its creator .
you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Two .
Difficulty : Easy .
Time : 30 minutes  What you 'll need : ? Nothing .
How to play : ? One player is the robot , the other is its creator .
The robot must follow every instruction it is given .
The creator should decide on a simple task that he wants the robot to complete .
It could be ? making a sandwich , brushing their teeth , feeding the cat or any other number of random chores .
The creator then begins giving simple , clear instructions .
" It is the robot 's job to take the instructions completely literally .
If told to " walk forward " , the robot should walk until they hit a wall and carry on walking .
If told to " turn left " , the robot should continually turn left in a circle until told to stop .
If told to do ? anything complicated ( e .
" Go upstairs " ) the robot should turn to the creator and announce in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compute .
'  They will need much clearer and simpler instructions than that : Perhaps something like , " Lift your left leg and place your left foot on the stair in front of you , " etc .
After the task is completed , swap roles and try a new task .
Tips -- If you 're the robot and feel like you are n't getting precise enough instructions , do n't break character to complain about it .
Similarly , if you are the creator and the robot does n't seem to be following instructions , or is getting things wrong on purpose , make a big performance of tutting , complaining about malfunctions , then turning the robot off and on again .
If that does n't work , unplug them at the wall and phone the manufacturer .
If the robot feels uncomfortable at any point , stop the game and talk about it .
At no point should the robot feel forced to do anything too far outside its comfort zone .
Likewise , the creator should never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the robot should not agree to go towards anything risky .

Crambo  Crambo can help parents avoid situations such as thisCredit : Getty - Contributor  Players : Two or more .
Difficulty : Medium .
Time : 10-20 minutes .
What you 'll need : Nothing .
How to play : ? One player , the rhymer , picks a word .
Start with shorter words ( one syllable ) but you can move on to something more complicated once you are all used to the game .
Let 's say the rhymer has chosen the word " bed " .
They will think of a word that rhymes with " bed " and begin the game like this : " I know a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that they 're searching for a word that rhymes with " bread " .
But they ca n't just guess .
They have to only hint at the word they 're guessing .
For example , one guesser thinks of " red " .
So , they ask , " Is it a colour ? " to which the rhymer would respond , " No , it 's not red .
"  Another guesser might ask , " Is it on top of my neck ? "  To which the rhymer would respond , ' No , not in my head .
'  The game continues until a guesser gives a clue that leads to the correct word .
The rhymer will respond : " Yes , it is bed ! "  I 've just given an example , but here 's another .
Rhymer : " I know a word that rhymes with plate .
"  Guesser 1 : " Is it a garden door ? "  Rhymer : " No , not a gate .
"  Guesser 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , it 's not hate .
"  Guesser 3 : " Is it a summer party ? "  Rhymer : " No , not a fete .
"  Guesser 1 : " Is it just brilliant ? "  Rhymer : " No , it 's not great .
"  Guesser 2 : " Is it behind time ? "  Rhymer : " Yes ! It is late ! "  Tips -- This game is excellent because everybody is doing something .
Normally , the person who is n't doing the guessing is just saying " yes " or " no " .
In this game , they have to think of the rhyming word each time .
For a group where everybody needs to feel involved all of the time , this works really well .
If the rhymer ca n't work out the word that you 're guessing , keep giving clues , or give the first letter .
Never just tell them the word you 're guessing .
Level Up : The " question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty simple , but why not make the whole thing have a rhythm too ?  If you 're really into the " rap " ? element , you could beat along with a wooden spoon on the back of a saucepan .
If you have a particularly great round , why not write it down ?  These " Crambo " poems are fun , silly and make the reader guess along with the game .
Lego challenge  6  It 's worth trying this game at least twice , so you can play both rolesCredit : Getty Images - Getty  Players : Two  Difficulty : Hard  Time : At least one hour  What you 'll need : A small set of building blocks with instructions .
Lego is one of many types you can choose .
How to play : ? One player , the instructor , holds the instructions , but may not touch or point to the blocks .
Meanwhile , the other player , the builder , may touch and build with the blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must build the model .
The instructor will have to work out how to specify exactly which block to find from the set , and then how to add it to the model .
It 's really difficult , but any sort of pointing or demonstrating is banned .
Use colour , shape , size , location , and then prepositions such as " under " , " above " and " beside " to be really specific about where each piece goes .
The builder will have to listen carefully , and prepare to be wrong many , many times !  Both players will need to be patient .
It 's worth trying this game at least twice , so you can play both roles .
There are challenges for each .
One important bit of admin between instructor and builder will be what to call each type of brick .
You could go mathematical ( " two rows of five blobs , thin yellow rectangle " ) , freestyle ( " a kinda squat , flat banana piece " ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but yellow " ) .
Develop your own style and stick with it .
Develop a shared language .
Whatever you do , do n't operate your builder like a fairground crane game .
( " Left arm towards you , down a bit , up a bit , grab that piece .
No , the other one .
" ) This is not the way to play .

Sit on your hands and think about how you can be more specific .

Level up : If there are three of you , how about having one person as an instructor , one seeker who finds the pieces and one as the builder .
Make sure to rotate the roles nice and often .
