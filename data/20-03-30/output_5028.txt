Twelve days prior to his death , 74 year old L* had flown to Delhi for a short three-day visit for a religious congregation that was attended by hundreds of preachers and religious scholars from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana .
On March 26 , nine days after he returned from Delhi , L was rushed to a private hospital in Hyderabad after he collapsed at home from a bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found to be carrying the novel coronavirus only when doctors tested throat and nasal swabs taken from his corpse , a hospital spokesperson and family members confirmed to HuffPost India .
HuffPost India is withholding L 's full name and address to protect his family 's privacy .
At a time when health officials have been mostly successful in quickly tracing all coronavirus infections in the country to foreign travel , or a known patient , L 's case stands out as an anomaly .
Now health officials in Telangana are scrambling to unravel his chain of contacts in the hope of zeroing on precisely who gave L the disease , and preventing more infections from the same source .
Yet , his visit to Delhi to participate in a well attended public gathering in Nizamuddin , one of the city 's more crowded neighbourhoods , has revived the persistent fear that the coronavirus may have entered the " community transmission " phase -- something health officials are at pains to deny for now .
On March 30 , The Hindu reported that over 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On March 25 , the paper reported that another person -- a 52 year old man from Guntur , Andhra Pradesh -- also died of COVID-19 after attending the same function in Nizamuddin .
At a press briefing on March 30 , Union Health Secretary Luv Aggarwal stated that the coronavirus was still in the local transmission state , and the government would make clear if and when virus entered the community transmission stage .
Since L 's death on March 26 , a senior official in the Telangana Health Ministry confirmed that the state government has tracked down at least 260 people from Andhra and Telangana who attended the same congregation as L .
These people , the official said , have been placed under quarantine and are being tested for the coronavirus .
Of the results available thus far -- forty people have tested negative , while one person has tested positive .
But the specific source of L 's infection remains unknown , the official confirmed .
The Telangana government has notified the Delhi government , the source said .
Telangana health officials have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not entered the " community transmission " stage .
At a press conference called to announce L 's death on March 27 , the state 's health minister Etela Rajender maintained that , " people who have not been exposed to COVID-19 positive patients have not contracted the virus as of now .
No person has got it from unknown persons " .
" The patient had travelled to Delhi and was under treatment for pneumonia , " Rajender said .
As of March 30 , India had 1071 coronavirus cases and 27 fatalities .
But the country has tested fewer than 30,000 individuals -- far fewer than countries such as the United States , China , and South Korea .
The strategy of limited testing , Indian authorities have said , is partly because a shortage of testing kits prompted health officials to first focus on those more likely to be carrying the illness .
Last week , the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) published the results of a study suggesting the country 's unprecedented nation-wide lockdown could contain the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of the study was too limited to rule out " community transmission .
" Widespread testing , public health experts say , is the only way to establish if community transmission of the virus has begun .
In the meantime , India has compensated for the lack of testing by establishing a lockdown far more draconian than countries such as the United States which have far more confirmed cases of coronavirus .
Delhi Visit  On March 14 this year , L flew to Delhi to attend a congregation of Islamic preachers from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana .
He stayed in the city 's Nizamuddin neighbourhood , and flew back to Hyderabad three days later .
When L landed at the domestic terminal of Hyderabad 's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport on March 18 , the ICMR had mandated coronavirus tests only for those international travellers with flu-like symptoms such as a cough , cold , fever , and shortness of breath , medical practitioners who had been in contact with those who had tested positive for the virus , and anyone in direct contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelled abroad were asked to self-quarantine at home for 2 weeks .
This particular ICMR testing strategy was announced on March 17 , and updated on March 20 .
But when L landed in Hyderabad , he did not fit this narrow testing criteria and so got off his flight and went home .
The next day on March 19 , L 's son took him to an eye clinic to treat an inflammation in his left eye .
" The clinic 's doctor ruled it an eye infection and prescribed antibiotics and eye drops , " L 's 45 year old son said , explaining that his father had had eye surgery a few years ago and periodically developed eye infections .
L was also running a temperature , his son said , " The mild fever he had at that time was attributed to the infection .
"  The swelling subsided over five days ; then on March 24 L developed a cough .
He was again taken back to the eye clinic where the doctor asked him to continue the antibiotic course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 , L developed shortness of breath and started running a high temperature .
On the morning of March 26 , L 's son took him to a private health clinic in Saifabad in Hyderabad where he was found to have developed pneumonia .
On March 20 ICMR had broadened India 's Covid-19 testing strategy to include testing of people admitted in hospitals for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections ( SARI ) including pneumonia .
L was not tested for COVID-19 , despite having pneumonia , as he had been examined by the Out-Patient Department of a private clinic , and had not been admitted in a hospital as the guidelines for testing mandated .
Here , the resident doctor prescribed more antibiotics .
Antibiotics are known to be ineffective against viruses like the novel coronavirus .
" I was asked to administer injections thrice a day , " his son said .
" He was also asked to use a nebulizer to help with shortness of breath .
"  At home , L 's family of seven -- his 63-year-old wife , son , daughter-in-law ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 years of age -- kept him company .
" The only relief right now is that my wife and children were living on the first floor of the apartment while my parents and I kept to the ground floor because we did not want our children to catch a cold , " L 's son said .
By the evening of March 26 , L 's condition had deteriorated rapidly .
That night he was rushed to a nearby privately run health facility where he was taken to the casualty ward .
" The patient was brought in at 10 .
pm on March 26 .
We were told that he had collapsed in his home , " a hospital spokesperson said .
" There was no travel history for the patient so he was sent to the casualty wing of the hospital " .
He was given an electrocardiogram to measure his heart activity and declared dead soon after .
When the doctors learnt L had been diagnosed with pneumonia , they took nasal and throat swabs .
The test results came in twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is when L was found to be the first person in Telangana to have died of COVID-19 .
Meanwhile , several people -- including L 's family members and the doctors who treated him -- had potentially been exposed to the virus .
A hospital spokesperson said four medical practitioners who had interacted with L at the hospital had been told to quarantine themselves at home .
" All precautionary measures were taken while handling the body .
The deceased patient and his relatives were at the hospital only for 45 minutes " , the spokesperson said .
The authorities did not divulge details of protocols taken during post-mortem autopsy and embalming .
Once the positive test results came in , L 's family struggled to find an ambulance willing to take the body to a morgue in Gandhi hospital , a designated facility for Covid-19 cases .
" That was the longest night of my life , " his son said .
L 's death was announced on the evening of March 27 -- about 24 hrs after his death .
" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceased including the doctors who treated him were traced during this time , " said an official from the health department .
As of March 30 , the state is yet to track down L 's secondary contacts -- namely all the patients who visited the same clinics as L in the course of his illness .
Family in quarantine  L was finally laid to rest in a cemetery in Hyderabad on March 28 .
The Telangana police had handed over his body to a relative who conducted the burial in the presence of a few policemen .
No relatives or immediate family members were allowed at the burial site ; much of L 's family is in quarantine .
" We did not insist on Islamic rituals like bathing the body and covering it with white cloth because we wanted to follow the medical protocol , " his son said , explaining that the family offered Gayebana Namaz-e-Janaza or in absentia funeral prayer at home .
As of the morning of March 29 morning , four of L 's immediate family of seven tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be tested and remain in quarantine at the Gandhi Hospital .
