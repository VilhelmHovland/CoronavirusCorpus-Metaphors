Today 's newsletter is written by ACM digital news editor Janine Graham .
Generations have their own iconic touchstones - from songs to cultural references and political heroes ( and anti-heroes ) .
Even if we share a generation , your touchstones will be different from mine , we 've had different experiences , after all .
Given all the young people of Australia have experienced over the past year , wow , where do you start ? Who knows , but on so much of the evidence available right now , we 're in a remarkably positive place - believe it or not ! Take little Sophie Milner .
She 's eight .
She found a simple but very special way to cope with all that is encompassing the world right now .
She made dozens of 50 thank you cards for teachers at her school .
" I was with her when she was starting to hand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the teachers ' reactions were just beautiful .
They were so appreciative and happy about what Sophie had done , " her mum Charlene Daines said .
And the love goes two ways .
For instance , south of Wollongong , the motivation was " to spread kindness , not germs " .
One school potted daffodils to send to aged-care facilities , another turned a drive-by into a special , heart-warming event .
Teachers and staff from Dapto Public School lined up ( at an appropriate distance ) and encouraged the parents whose kids are being schooled from home to drive by and just say g'day .
" What we really want is for kids to feel as connected as they can be , " explained " Though we have been working online and that has been a really good thing for us so far , this was just a way to have some visual contact with each other .
" And remember back when bushfires gripped much of the nation by the throat , the kids , no doubt traumatised , kept it real - with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires chocolatey generosity and since the fires , fundraising shaves .
There is much goodness to fill many hearts - if you let it .
There 's also much to learn from millenials , take Andrea Cantle for one .
In a few short months she has stared down more catastrophe and heartbreak than many Australians have faced over a lifetime .
These are her words : " Share positivity every way you can .
Leave the ( bad ) news to the journalists .
