Photo by The Canadian Press/Justin  The federal government signalled Sunday it is shifting the focus of its COVID-19 aid towards Canada 's most vulnerable as public health experts expressed cautious optimism the nation 's physical distancing experiment could be working .
Most Canadians are entering the third week of a COVID-19 slowdown that has them keeping their distance from all but immediate family members , and some provinces are starting to report a slowdown in the rate of new infections .
On Friday British Columbia said its early modelling was suggesting social distancing had cut the spread of the novel coronavirus in half .
On Sunday , Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the daily increase in positive cases " seems to be stabilizing .
"  Dr .
Theresa Tam , Canada 's chief public health officer , said Sunday it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing schools and offices and restricting retail services has been on the virus 's spread .
" But next week will be very , very important , for me anyways , in terms of looking at those trends , " she said .
A little more than six per cent of cases so far have required hospitalization , and three per cent are in critical condition .
About one-tenth of the hospitalizations occurred in people under the age of 40 , a statistic Tam said she cites so people understand that younger Canadians can get very ill from COVID-19 .
She urged Canadians not to let up their efforts to physically distance themselves from others , with a particular message for those about to celebrate some of the biggest religious observances on the calendar , including Passover , Easter and Ramadan .
Tam said all will have to be adapted for the " two-metre bubble " of social distancing , and she is asking religious leaders for help to make sure that happens .
Trudeau said Sunday the crisis is taking a toll on all Canadians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were already struggling -- and it 's impossible for those who do n't have a safe home to go to .
" Tough times fall first and hardest on the most vulnerable in our communities , " Trudeau said , at his regular Sunday briefing outside his Ottawa home , where he remains in self-isolation .
Ottawa is adding a $7 .
million contribution to Kids Help Phone so the national charity can hire more counsellors and seek out additional volunteers to assist more young people calling and texting for support .
Another $9 million was announced for United Way Canada to deliver services to seniors who need practical help with such everyday chores as grocery shopping , filling their prescriptions or getting meals delivered .
Feds rolling out help for charities hit hard by COVID-19 economic slowdown  United Way and Kids Help Phone were among a coalition of Canadian charities that asked for help last week , warning they were going to collapse as COVID-19 wreaked economic havoc on their donors and volunteers .
Much like private sector businesses , charities report having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donations dry up .
The group says there are more than 1 .
million Canadians employed in the charitable sector , which accounts for eight per cent of Canada 's economic activity .
Trudeau said there will be additional help for charities announced in the coming days , but he also appealed to Canadians who are able to donate money or time .
" Not only are organizations in the charitable sector and the non-profit sector doing incredibly important work during difficult times , they 're also in many cases seeing their donations dry up and are very worried about their capacity to continue to do the work they 're doing , " he said .
The government already announced $157 .
million for homeless shelters and up to $50 million for women 's shelters as part of their massive federal aid package made public March 18 , mainly to help the organizations buy protective gear for workers and find ways to keep clients isolated as necessary .
While details of the funding are expected this week , Families Minister Ahmed Hussen said Sunday $15 million in emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing shelters to get hotel rooms for clients who need to be quarantined or isolated and to buy emergency supplies to protect frontline staff .
Trudeau said Sunday he intends to stay in isolation at his home for almost two more weeks even though his wife , Sophie Gregoire Trudeau , has fully recovered from COVID-19 .
Gregoire Trudeau was diagnosed March 13 after a trip to England , and was quarantined at the couple 's home until her doctor and Ottawa Public Health gave her the medical all-clear a couple of days ago .
She is now at the prime minister 's cottage residence in Quebec with their three children , while Trudeau stays at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa to continue to work .
He said they were careful to stay apart during his wife 's quarantine , but because he was sharing a home with someone who had COVID-19 he will stay isolated to follow the best advice of medical staff .
" I have to continue in isolation in order to be sure that we 're following all the protocols and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither he nor their children , Xavier , 12 , Ella-Grace , 11 , and Hadrien , 6 , have shown symptoms of the illness .
Trudeau was the first major world leader to go into isolation because of COVID-19 , and his role as both the head of a G7 nation and the only parent at home able to care for the couple 's three children garnered him headlines around the world .
