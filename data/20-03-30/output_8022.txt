The world needs to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and climate change simultaneously , and guard against people who try to use the current crisis to delay action on cutting carbon emissions , Greta Thunberg has urged .
The Swedish climate activist , who revealed last week that she and her father are likely to have had covid-19 , said the response to the outbreak revealed societal shortcomings , as well as our ability to change in the face of a crisis , but had also proved that we are able to act fast .
" If one virus can wipe out the entire economy in a matter of weeks and shut down societies , then that is a proof that our societies are not very resilient .
It also shows that once we are in an emergency , we can act and we can change our behaviour quickly , " she said in a conversation on New Scientist 's Big Interview podcast .

Thunberg said : " People will try to use this emergency as an excuse not to act on the climate crisis , and that we have to be very careful for .
" She said she understood the emergency the world was facing now , but it was n't an excuse to shelve action on emissions .
" People do n't want to hear about the climate crisis now .
I completely understand that , but we have to make sure that it 's not forgotten .
We need to treat both of these crises at the same time , because the climate crisis will not go away , " she said .
The campaigner and the Fridays for Future movement , which she kick-started with her first school strike in 2018 , have made their weekly protests virtual during the pandemic .
Students have been good at staying off the streets , said Thunberg , and although young people tend to have milder symptoms of the disease , " we still stand in solidarity with those in risk groups and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had mild symptoms of covid-19 , with some tiredness and a cough , but said that the more intense ones that her father experienced fit with the symptoms of the illness exactly .
Neither have been tested , as Sweden is only testing the most severe cases .
The 17-year old said she always found herself going back to the science of climate change in her speeches because it was n't something that could be contested .
" It 's not something you can have different opinions in , it 's just pure science .
In that sense , it 's very much black and white .
"  She has focused on the " carbon budgets " put forward by the UN climate science panel in 2018 , which attempt to estimate the carbon emissions that can be released into the atmosphere without breaching global warming thresholds , such as 1 .
? C and 2 ? C rises in temperature .
She said these budgets are insufficient because they do n't account for tipping points , such as the collapse of ice sheets in West Antarctica , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has .
Thunberg said she has taken heart from small successes , including the rejection of expanding an airport in Bristol , UK , and rewilding projects .
But she noted that the bigger picture of steadily rising global emissions was negative : " Yes , we need to see the victories , but we ca n't only focus on the victories because we close our eyes to the actual crisis .
"  Criticism from politicians , including Donald Trump , was a " milestone " , she said .
" We need to see that as a victory , when they criticise us like that .
But also it 's just so hilarious when grown-ups like that feel so threatened by children .
"  Thunberg said she was frustrated that media coverage focused on her rather than the many other young climate activists around the world , but she understood it .
Her rise as a public figure has been " very hard " for her parents , she said , because they saw both the positive and negative sides of it .
One of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others and to be a humanitarian " , she said .
On her life after education , Thunberg hopes the world will have taken serious action on carbon emissions so she can pursue a job other than as a climate activist .
" All I know is that I want to do something and I want to be somewhere where I can make the most difference , try to make the world a better place , but I do n't know where that will be , " she said .
