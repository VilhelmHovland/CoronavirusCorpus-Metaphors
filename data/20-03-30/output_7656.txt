Facebook Launches Live Streaming Features Amid COVID-19  Facebook created new live streaming features , as there is an increase in demand due to the outbreak of COVID-19 .
The new live streaming features will allow non-Facebook users to see live content on a mobile phone , and this a feature that was previously only available on desktop computers .
Mobile phone access for live streams was initially available for Android users , however , according to the company iOS capabilities will be released within a few weeks .
Facebook is also launching a new feature named ' Public Switch Telephone Network , ' which allows people to listen to content through a conference call .
This means non-Facebook users will still be able to access the live-streamed content in some capacity .
