Andy Warren caught up with former Ipswich Town midfielder Richard Chaplow to discuss his goal at Watford and his new life as a coach in California .
Even the distance of 5,000 miles and the passing of five years is n't enough for Richard Chaplow to escape the events of March 21 , 2015 .
Chances are he never will , either .
And that 's a good thing .
It 's now five years since the midfielder slotted the ball past Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes to send 2,000 travelling Ipswich fans wild as the last-minute winner sent Mick McCarthy 's Blues hurtling back into the Championship promotion picture .
The goal has become iconic and has perhaps , sadly , taken on added meaning given the Blues have n't had a moment of that magnitude , that late into a season , to celebrate since .
Like each of the previous four , this year 's anniversary saw Chaplow 's phone go wild .
The messages from supporters certainly brought a smile to his face with he and his young family in lockdown at their home in Newport Beach , California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day Ipswich 's official Twitter account always releases the video and everybody always remember it so I get plenty of messages , " he said .
" I think in recent times it 's been up there for a lot of people in terms of memories .
Myself included .
" I get it quite frequently throughout the year as well , with people posting the video , and then I check my accounts and all of a sudden I have a crazy amount of messages going on .
It definitely comes up six or seven times a year .
My phone goes mad .
" It always amuses me that it 's called ' Richard Chaplow Day ' and it 's all great fun .
I still have memories of going to support my team , Burnley , as a kid and it 's amazing now to have been part of a memory everyone 's sharing .
"  Richard Chaplow launches himself into a celebration after scoring the late winner at Watford .

" With about 10 minutes to go Watford had a corner and I was thinking ' get me on , get me on ' and then Mick put me on .
' Here we go ' I thought .
" Watford were dominating the game and we were sat in , waiting for an opportunity .
I got a couple of touches before that but the breakaway did eventually come .
" I 've always been a fit player and made a career of getting box-to-box , making late runs .
I just wanted to get up there to support Searsy ( Freddie Sears ) and to give him an option if he needed me .

Then we 're two on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I did n't have to break stride at all and that skill is a little underrated so it was probably as difficult as scoring the goal itself .
" I took a good first touch and , in years gone by , I might have lashed at it a little earlier .
But I looked up , picked my spot and slid it down the side of Gomes and into the net .
" The scenes were magnificent .
The fans , the player and the staff were going crazy .
It was real euphoria .
There were inflatable bananas , flamingos and beach balls flying round .
That 's everything you want to feel as a football player and everything you love the game for .
" I was over the moon to be able to come to the club and be a part of that and to have a moment like this to look back on , especially when all the messages come through , is a really good feeling .

Picture : PAGEPIX  For all the attention his goal at Watford has brought , it 's sometimes forgotten Chaplow played just six times for the Blues after joining on loan from Millwall to aid the push for promotion to the Premier League .
It 's a time he remembers fondly , though .
" I did n't manage to get on and impact things as regularly as I would have liked for a few reasons , " he said .
You may also want to watch :  " The competition in midfield was really strong and I was aware of that when I signed .
Cole Skuse , Teddy Bishop , Tabby ( Jay Tabb ) were there so it was a strong area .
I came in to bolster that a bit .
" I was grateful for the opportunity at the time because I was n't really enjoying my football at Millwall at all , so I needed a new route .
" Mick McCarthy was always someone I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footballer , whenever I played away there I always left thinking ' that seems like a proper club to play for , I wonder what that would be like ' .
" The team I joined was exactly as I expected a Mick McCarthy side to be -- full of good people and a really good energy around the training ground every day .
Hard work , respect , good values and no nonsense .
That 's a difficult thing to create and it 's not something I 've been part of often .
Richard Chaplow is now coaching at Orange County in California .
Picture : ARCHANT  " We made the play-offs of course but the real goal was to get promoted .
Sadly we did n't manage that .
"  It 's been a steady decline at Portman Road ever since , with the Blues now finding themselves in League One .
" I look from afar now and see the club is far too big and far too good to be where they are , so I 'm sure the day will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Premier League , " Chaplow said .
" Sometimes you have to step back before going forward again .
Leeds look like they 're on the brink of being able to do that now having been down for many , many years , and there are other examples too .
Richard Chaplow is now coaching at Orange County in California .
Picture : RICHARDCHAPLOW  " The level of League One a decade ago is no longer how it is .
Everyone 's able to compete due to great coaching , great budgets or whatever it is .
Football 's changed from what is was before .
" I 'm sure Ipswich 's day will come again .
" I was at Southampton when we were relegated from the Premier League to League One .
We built an identity again there , got very good at what we did and then got back-to-back promotions and carried it through .

Chaplow , his wife Emily and their two sons , all have Green Cards and are intent on staying in California for some time yet .
" We love it here , " he said .
" I maybe hung the boots up a season earlier than originally planned because it felt like the right time and that I was ready to step into the coaching side .
" The club offered me the assistant coaching role here and I 've learnt so much already .
I 've definitely developed an empathy for the coaches I 've worked for before because the hours are certainly different to when you 're playing and it 's a lot of hard work .

When I first joined the team we did n't have a training ground and we would get changed at the stadium and drive out , find a field , put your boots on on a park bench and train .
" I 'd not experienced that before because I had always been in the upper levels of the English game .
It was massively different but it felt like another opportunity for me as a person to grow , learn and embrace that side of it .
It was fantastic to come back down and feel like I did when I started as a kid .
" But after four-and-a-half years we have now transformed into something remarkable .
We have a 5,000-seater stadium with training pitches right outside , a small gym and the chance to do video analysis .
The growth has been magnificent and we 're maybe competing with some of the upper sides in League One .
