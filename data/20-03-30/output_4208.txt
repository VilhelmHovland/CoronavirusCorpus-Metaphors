Liz Nugent : ' People have accused me of being brave , but what is brave about surviving ? '  ' I am not a disabled writer .
I 'm a writer who happens to be disabled '  Author Liz Nugent .
Her books are commercially successful , and she has a growing number of fans hungry for her next work .
Photograph : Tom Honan  Liz Nugent was on her way to brunch at a friend 's house last November when she tripped and fell , dislocating her kneecap and fracturing her patella and tibia .
It was a bad accident by anybody 's standards , but for the crime writer it was devastating .
Since falling from a staircase aged six , she has lived with a neurological disorder called dystonia , which resulted in tonal dysfunction in her right leg and arm .
Because of this condition , her body went into spasm as she lay on the ground after the fall .
She waited for the ambulance , knowing her kneecap was " in the wrong place " .
The pain was " excruciating " .
" I was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , sitting exactly according to her physio 's instructions at the table in her sunny kitchen in south Dublin .
It 's a couple of days before widespread restrictions are put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic .
" I came home and then two mornings later I turned over in my sleep , and my kneecap dislocated again .
"  She spent six weeks in St Vincent 's Hospital , and six weeks in the Royal Hospital in Donnybrook , waiting for the bones to knit .
" Normal people , " she says , " would n't have had the spasm reactions " which is why her recovery was so long and slow .
She came out of hospital at the end of January .
She finds it easier to write from the male point of view , saying men have ' fewer thoughts ' than women do  Nugent , whose just-published fourth novel Our Little Cruelties is full of dysfunctional characters , does n't really write about " normal people " .
The book was completed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
That was something , considering she could barely write a text message for weeks -- " I was on very strong medication " -- never mind write or do edits .
Social media was her main distraction , as she just about had the attention span to scroll .
She was grateful for the steady stream of friends and unexpected visitors who turned up at both hospitals to lend their support .
It was a grim time .
The medication she was on to stop the spasms is also used as an anti-depressant .
" I ca n't say they worked in that way , I was fairly depressed .
When you ca n't walk for three months that happens , " she says .
She asks if I mind her smoking .
I do n't .
She is a full-time smoker since her accident , having previously only indulged while out socialising and drinking alcohol .
As she puffs on a cigarette , she explains that while in the Royal Hospital she was asked if she was a smoker , and she told them " only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later an occupational therapist came to me and said , do you have any cigarettes with you ? " At this stage , Nugent had n't smoked for six weeks , having been in hospital after the accident , but she did have a pack in a bag .
" She said : I 'm really sorry about this but for health and safety reasons we need to know you can light a cigarette , smoke a cigarette and extinguish a cigarette without setting fire to yourself .
"  So that night , in a freezing shed outside the hospital , for the first time in 10 years she had a cigarette without a drink .
" And it was so nice , " she says , exhaling .
" I ended up smoking three cigarettes every night in there and now I am back on the fags without the drink .
" She finds the story " hilarious " but wants to make sure it 's clear that taking up smoking again was her responsibility , and the occupational therapist was " only doing her job " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unravelling Oliver which launched her as a fresh voice in the psychological thriller genre , and both What Lies in Wait and Skin Deep which followed -- the reader is thrown straight into the action in her latest novel .
There is no slow build-up , just an immediate confrontation with some pretty despicable people .
" I learned that from TV I think , " she says .
" The Sopranos was the first show that did n't do big introductions to the characters , same with Breaking Bad .
You 're right into the story from the beginning , with no frame of reference for anybody .
I 've learned a lot from those writers .
"  The new book tells the story of three Dublin brothers , and from the beginning we know one of them has been murdered .
She finds it easier to write from the male point of view , saying men have " fewer thoughts " than women do .
" I 'm not saying they 're stupid , but they are much more straightforward , " she explains .
She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard McCullough , a sound engineer and multi-instrumentalist .
" I 'd be in a huff about something , and I 'd be like I 'm fine , and I would expect him to ask me more questions .
I was playing a game called ' guess what 's wrong with me ? ' .
But he thought I was fine because I said I was fine .
"  " Women overthink things , I know I do and most of the women I know .
"  She may find it easier to write men , but the three brothers in the book are complex characters .
William is a piece of work , a misogynist , " not a nice guy " ; Luke is a popstar , his already significant personal issues exacerbated by celebrity ; and Brian , while is some ways a sympathetic character , uses his mental health issues for personal gain .
The book explores the reason why each brother is so damaged , and much of it can be traced back to the family they grew up in .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this one just emerged , " she says of the narcissistic matriarch in the book .
I ask why she likes to write about dysfunction .
She says she is " fascinated " by people .
" When you grow up with a disability you are always a little bit on the outside .
So you become an observer .
You 'll find many writers were sick kids .
"  She credits her mother Siobh ? n for the well of resilience she is able to draw from .
She was never excused from games because of her disability , and it helped that she came from a big family -- her mum and dad had six children together before they split up , and her father John has three children from his subsequent marriage .
" We are a very tight-knit gang , " she says .
" I love them all .
"  I 've interviewed Nugent before and she has always struck me , I tell her , as being dogged and confident despite the challenges she has faced since childhood .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the RT ? soap , Fair City , mostly in an admin role , she kept entering writing competitions , one of which eventually led to the publication of Unravelling Oliver , an international bestseller .
" People have accused me of being brave , and I feel , what is brave about surviving and living and getting on with things ? I 've had this disability since I was six , when I had the original brain haemorrhage .
You ca n't expect the world to suddenly adapt to you , you have to adapt to the world .
"  Now , as well as dreaming up the next novel , she is writing a play commissioned by Landmark theatre company before the accident  That approach has changed a bit though , I counter .
A lot of current activism around disability suggests the world should adapt and become more inclusive of people living with all kinds of challenges .
Does she agree ?  " Well , I do and I do n't , " she says .
" I think a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great shame because there is a lot more to me .
I am not a disabled writer .
I 'm a writer who happens to be disabled .
And you know , I 'm not so bad .
There 's nothing I ca n't do .
I can cook .
I can eat .
One of the best things about coming out of hospital is being able to make myself a sandwich .
if you can have a sex life , employment and enjoyment of food , that 's everything .
"  And then a beat , a smile .
" I do n't miss skiing .
"  Nugent gives a lot of herself in interviews .
For example , she has spoken about how one day after meeting Richard , they were discussing whether they would have children together .
They decided not to .
" I have people very close to me who have really struggled to conceive and it 's heartbreaking for them and for me watching them go through that .
But I never had the feeling of wanting to be a mother .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much easier .
" They met 20 years ago , when Nugent was 32 and Richard was 27 .
" Neither of us have changed our minds , so we 're happy .
"  Her parents split when she was a child , and at the time her father was drinking heavily .
" He 's an alcoholic , but he 's been sober for 40 years and helped a lot of other alcoholics in that time , " she says .
He is in a care home now .
She hopes he will see the summer , but " he definitely wo n't see Christmas " .
" He told us two years ago he was ready to go .
he could n't wait to meet his mother again .
He 'd never darken the door of a church but he has a huge devotion to the Virgin Mary .
" Her mother Siobh ? n , now 87 , she says will outlive them all ; she enjoys life , shopping in Zara , her friends , her daily Irish Times .
Nugent once tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Gaiety School of acting in crutches .
" Not surprisingly " , acting did n't work out , so she went into stage managing , first in Ireland and later touring the world with Riverdance .
Now , as well as dreaming up the next novel , she is writing a play commissioned by Landmark theatre company before the accident .
She does n't want to say much about it , but does reveal that the opening scene is a middle-aged woman who wakes up with the pizza delivery person , a young man , who delivered her takeaway the night before .
" It 's a lighter piece , which will go into a dark place , " she says .
" It was a thrill when they asked me , because I was an assistant stage manager for a long time before progressing to stage manager and then production stage manager on Broadway .
I 've come full circle now , being commissioned by one of the best companies in the country run by one of the best women in the country , Anne Clarke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I just hope I can do it justice .
"  Nugent 's books are commercially successful , and she has a growing number of fans hungry for her next work .
Is she happy in terms of where she is at in her writing career ? " I once heard somebody say that you have to have written five books before you can be considered a proper writer , so when I have the next one out , then I can be a writer , " she says .
