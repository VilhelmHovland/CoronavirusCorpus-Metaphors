Air Canada to cut 16,500 workers  Air Canada says it is cutting 16,500 employees and slashing its network by up to 90% in April and May , confirming earlier reports in Canadian media .
" Due to the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 upon its business , the airline will reduce capacity for the second quarter of 2020 by 85%-90% compared to last year 's Q2 and will place 15,200 members of its unionised workforce on off duty status , and furlough about 1,300 managers .
The workplace reductions will be effective on or about April 3 and are intended to be temporary , " the airline writes in a statement on 30 March .
News of the staff reduction , which accounts for more than half the airline 's total staff of 30,000 , comes two weeks after Canada 's largest airline announced it had temporarily laid off 5,100 flight attendants .
It is unclear if the 16,500 staff cuts announced on Monday include the 5,100 attendants .

In addition to the staff reducitions , Air Canada will be taking extraordinary measures to protect its liquidity , including cutting salaries of top executives , delaying share buy-backs , drawing down lines of credit and implementing a cost reduction and capital deferral program , the company says .
The union representing the airline 's flight attendants , the Canadian Union of Public Employees , says it does not have any information regarding " additional " layoffs among flight attendants .
That could imply that the 5,100 layoffs announced on 20 March are part of the 16,500 mentioned on Monday .
This past weekend , Air Canada said it was continuing repatriation flights for Canadians who have been stranded overseas as the coronavirus brought most international air travel to a near-standstill .
