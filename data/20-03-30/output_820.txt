The coronavirus pandemic is reshaping education  On Sunday , Feb .
23rd , rumors started that schools in the Lombardy region of Italy -- the country 's economic powerhouse -- might close .
Confirmed cases and deaths from the new coronavirus were soaring .
The healthcare system was teetering , and Italy had to dramatically change course in a bid to halt the virus .
By evening , the region was in lockdown .
Within 24 hours , Iain Sachdev , principal at the International School of Monza , had organized his teachers and filmed a short video clip for students , faculty , and parents .
School would open at 9am on Tuesday , he said .
Be patient , he implored .
Taking a school online in 24 hours was a massive feat which would be messy .
Everyone would be learning .
Five weeks later , the school is still running -- unfamiliar in many ways , identical in others .
Teachers teach via video conferencing every day .
Kids participate using Padlet , a virtual post-it note system that lets students share ideas ; and Flipgrid , which lets teachers and students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , group work , and confer with teachers when needed .
Sachdev has overhauled the schedule from 50-minute units to longer blocks .
Teachers no longer use email , but Microsoft Teams .
The International School of Monza is part of the world 's biggest educational technology ( edtech ) experiment in history .
With 1 .
billion students out of school and hundreds of millions attempting to learn solely online , the experiment will reshape schools , the idea of education , and what learning looks like in the 21st century .
The pandemic is forcing educators , parents , and students to think critically , problem-solve , be creative , communicate , collaborate and be agile .
It is also revealing that there is another way .
" It 's a great moment " for learning , says Andreas Schleicher , head of education at the OECD .
" All the red tape that keeps things away is gone and people are looking for solutions that in the past they did not want to see , " he says .
Students will take ownership over their learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , and what support they need .
They will personalize their learning , even if the systems around them wo n't .
Schleicher believes that genie can not be put back in the bottle .
" Real change takes place in deep crisis , " he says .
" You will not stop the momentum that will build .
"  But as tech connects people in their homes , its limitations for learning are on display for all the world to see .
The crisis has cast a bright light on deep inequalities not just in who has devices and bandwidth , which are critically important , but also who has the skills to self-direct their learning , and whose parents have the time to spend helping .
It is a stark reminder of the critical importance of school not just as a place of learning , but of socialization , care and coaching , of community and shared space -- not things tech has hacked too well .
The pandemic is giving tech massive insights at scale as to what human development and learning looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissemination to augmenting relationships with teachers , personalization , and independence .
But the way it is has been rolled out -- overnight , with no training , and often not sufficient bandwidth -- will leave many with a sour taste about the whole exercise .
Many people may well continue to associate e-learning with lockdowns , recalling frustrations with trying to log on , or mucking through products that did n't make sense .
" This may be a short-term commercial opportunity for some vendors , says Nick Kind , senior director at Tyton Partners , an investment banking and strategy consulting firm focused on education .
" But for this to become transformational for teachers and learners , you would n't have wanted to start this way .
"  When the storm of the pandemic passes , schools may be revolutionized by this experience .
Or , they may revert back to what they know .
But the world in which they will exist -- one marked by rising unemployment and likely recession -- will demand more .
Education may be slow to change , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moving the world 's students online has starkly exposed deep inequities in the education system , from the shocking number of children who rely on school for food and a safe environment , to a digital divide in which kids without devices or reliable internet connections are cut off from learning completely .
According to OECD data , in Denmark , Slovenia , Norway , Poland , Lithuania , Iceland , Austria , Switzerland and the Netherlands , over 95% of students reported having a computer to use for their work .
Only 34% in Indonesia did .
In the US , virtually every 15-year-old from a privileged background said they had a computer to work , but nearly a quarter of those from disadvantaged backgrounds did not .
These divides will likely worsen , as staggering job losses and a recession devastate the most marginalized in every society , including all their kids .
Schools face a difficult choice : if they do n't teach remotely , all of their students miss out on months of curriculum .
If they do , a sizable group of already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther behind .
The gap between students is n't limited to internet access ; it 's also about the power and privilege of parents .
" If you are called to duty right now as a nurse or delivery person , you have no time for homeschool , " says Heather Emerson , managing director for IDEO 's design for learning group .
And not every parent has the level of digital literacy necessary to help their kids shift to online learning .
Schleicher says that his optimism for technology uptake is paired with pessimism about what this means for equity .
Those from privileged backgrounds will find the tools they need , through parents or tutors or their better-resourced schools .
But those from disadvantaged backgrounds will face multiple challenges , from the bottom of Maslow 's hierarchy to the top : food and shelter , which school helped to provide , connections to support children 's learning , and a lack of financial buffers to carry a family through .
" It is clear that this will not reach everyone and it 's not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" If you do n't know how to learn on your own , if you do n't know how to manage your time , if you do n't have any intrinsic motivation , you wo n't be very successful in this environment .
"  The OECD is one of many organizations advocating to increase access to open free , online educational resources and digital learning platforms for teachers and students .
For schools to succeed , teachers will also need access to training and support .
Meanwhile , the crisis is highlighting the role schools play outside of education .
At a moment when schools need to adapt how they teach , many are consumed with how to feed their students .
Gwinnett County , Georgia , one of the largest school districts in the US , is feeding 90,000 students a day .
" It 's a prime example of how schools have become not just learning institutions , but the heart of the social fabric of America , " Emerson says .
She argues that coronavirus offers an opportunity to see clearly all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the latest state standards , implementing district priorities , mastering new technology platforms , and caring for the physical and emotional well being of their students .
She suggests that schools can free up teachers to do more learning .
" What can we do to liberate teachers to focus on their craft ? " she said .
" And should n't we pay them wages that match the magnitude of their roles they play in our lives ? "  Indeed , the pandemic has woken people up to the challenges of teaching and focused some attention on another equity gap : that of pay for teachers .
After one day of home schooling in the US , Twitter lit up with calls for teachers to be paid more than investment bankers .
Classrooms  Many schools were woefully unprepared to move online overnight .
Those that were ready may hold clues for the promise , and pitfalls , of e-learning .
Students at the International School of Monza all had MacBooks ; last August , all teachers were given them too .
Sachdev is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have everyone equipped to learn online .
But he also said there were still a lot of pieces that had not been pulled together .
" We had the systems in place but we never really used them , " he said .
Julia Peters , who teaches economics and individuals and societies at the International School of Monza , says being forced online has allowed her to moved to a more " flipped classroom " in which students do more learning about basic skills and knowledge at home , via videos or platforms , and then come to school online to do work together .
" That way , when they come into the classroom we can work on the higher level skills such as analysis and evaluation , " she says .
It 's not a new idea at all , but circumstances are forcing adoption .
Another positive , Peters says , is that software like Microsoft Teams allows her to see her students as they are writing .
That allows for real-time feedback , rather than waiting for the work to be completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Her Grade 7 students are preparing an essay on beliefs , in which they " choose a debatable question " and research it .
" While they are independently researching and creating a presentation , I can call a weaker student to a private call and quietly work with them giving them the extra support they need , " she says .
That would be harder in a noisy classroom .
And some students who shied away from participation are stepping up .
" The quieter , more introverted students can participate more because they are not being seen by their peers , " says Peters .
Naima Charlier , director of teaching and learning at the Nord Anglia International School Hong Kong , says moving everyone online has had plenty of challenges but also has increased teacher confidence around technology and e-platforms .
" There 's a massive energy about how to do this incredibly different and difficult thing as well as we possibly can , " she says .
Teachers are trying and adjusting and sharing at warp speed what works and what does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they normally world , " he said .
" Every single teacher can see what others are doing , which is n't how things typically work .
"  No such silver linings exist for the millions of students who ca n't get online , or whose schools and teachers do not have the resources to even experiment with e-learning .
Depending on how long the pandemic lasts , governments may be forced to find creative ways to get more kids learning .
Technology  What happens to education technology after the coronavirus pandemic fades will rest in part on the quality of the tech itself .
Not everyone is optimistic .
HolonIQ , a market intelligence firm for the education market , poses questions twice a year to a panel of more than 2,000 global education executives and investors across public and private institutions and firms , from pre-kindergarten to lifelong learning .
In its most recent survey , half of ed tech firms said they were pessimistic about whether the coronavirus pandemic would make things better or worse in the short term .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden era for ed tech , for digital transformation , but more than 50% of ed tech is saying that over the short term , it 's worse or substantially worse off as an organization , " said Patrick Brothers , co-CEO of HolonIQ .
Meanwhile , 91% of educational institutions say they will be worse , or substantially worse off in the short term .
Schleicher , from the OECD , said the pandemic will expose how ed tech has largely failed to do what would be most powerful : leverage the relationship between teacher and learner .
" The big question for me is will we develop an ed tech solution that capitalizes on the relationship between students and teachers , as opposed to just broadcasting stuff , " he says .
" I think if we want to give this any chance of success for large numbers of students and learners , the teacher is going to be absolutely key , " especially in the younger years such as primary schools .
Pair good teachers , who coach and facilitate , with good content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Adaptive , interactive , science-based learning platforms may start to take hold -- especially for those using the opportunity of a crisis to help , rather than build market share .
Starting in early February , Century Tech , an AI-driven learning platform for schools , made its platform free for all schools who need it .
By March , it had expanded the offering to include all students who needed it , too .
Today , the British-based Century is giving training and access to its platform , which combines neuroscience and AI to individualize learning , to schools in 17 countries , including China , Vietnam , South Korea , Japan , the UK , Nigeria and Georgia .
Founder Priya Lakhani says anyone who wants it can use it .
" This is why we do what we do , and if we can help we should , " she says .
Innovations are abounding , but not in a coordinated manner .
Saku Tuominen founded Finnish nonprofit HundrED five years ago , to research education innovations from over 150 countries .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packaged 1,164 on its website , with ideas for everything from creativity , to the environment , to " forest schools .
" Two weeks ago , HundrED pivoted to work full time on coronavirus .
It is in the process of selecting from its library simple innovations that have the potential to work in many places in a home learning environment .
One example : the Global Oneness Project , an interactive community series about storytelling in which filmmakers and photographers share their work and explain how stories can connect people .
HundrED is following up with those innovators to see how they are adapting them for the crisis .
On April 3rd , a curated list of resources will be released ; on the 7th , webinars will be available to train educators .
" There is not a lack of tools , " Tuominen said .
But he believes there is are n't enough ways for the best ideas to be shared .
Beyond tech  So far , coronavirus has offered a stark reminder of the very human nature of schools .
Peters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online learning , but can not wait to get back into her building .
" Being online , I do n't think you really get a true sense of whether a student is really engaged and properly understanding , " she said .
Tech has n't solved that most basic of things .
" I look forward to the social interaction with the students .
"  Sachdev says it has been so hard for teachers to be removed from their students and from each other because teaching is such a human endeavor .
" None of us are used to smart working , " he said .
His school 's own journey shows the power of community , along with agile learning .
In the first week , he and his team focused on providing seven hours of online learning .
By week three , they eased up , freeing up more time for one-on-one and small group support , as well as offline projects .
They responded and adapted .
By weeks four and five , a small number of members of the school community were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The school pivoted again .
" It 's not about academics , " Sachdev said .
" It 's all about wellbeing for students and parents , and managing that from afar .
