The global Covid-19 pandemic is expected to hit planned wind and solar projects in Australia and other countries particularly hard , and wipe out any anticipated growth in renewables deployment in 2020 , according to a new study .
The Norway-based Rystad Energy says it had expected global solar additions to grow 15% to 140 gigawatts in 2020 , and wind additions to grow 6% to around 75GW .
But it now expects this growth to be eliminated , and its forecasts for 2021 have also been cut by around 10 per cent .
Analysts and renewable energy developers have previously expressed concern about some sort of slowdown -- due to a combination of supply bottlenecks and restrictions on the movement of people .
Rystad suggests a bigger impact could be felt in countries where the currency has declined sharply against the US dollar , and this will have a particular impact on Australia , where capital costs could rise by more than one third , along with Brazil , Mexico and South Africa ,  " The full extent of the impact of Covid-19 on the renewable energy market is just beginning to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by senior vice president Gero Farruggio .
" Initial reactions focused on possible mass production shutdowns and supply chain bottlenecks in China .
The lion 's share of renewable asset components is sourced from China , and projects under construction or in the procurement phase appeared particularly exposed when Covid-19 first struck .
" Yet thus far , it seems that global shipments have more-or-less arrived as expected , as Chinese panel and turbine suppliers returned to work relatively quickly , and production stabilized ; panel prices have ultimately remained steady in recent weeks .
" Companies typically procure key project components in US dollars despite reaping revenue in local currency .
Given this , projected returns on developments under procurement are already plummeting as unfavorable exchange rates result in soaring equipment prices .
Utility wind is most at risk , as the percentage of wind development capex procured in US dollars is 25% higher than that of a utility solar PV .
"  Farruggio says Australia will be one of the worst hit because its currency has fallen dramatically in recent weeks to a 17-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on orders that were otherwise imminent , " he says .
Much of the 2 GW utility PV solar expected to begin production 2020 in Australia is already built and going through the commissioning phase , which in many cases has been become long and complex , and in some instances heavily delayed .
" Work will continue on these projects .
However , the key determiner of success will be the process of grid connection , " he notes .
But the outlook is not good for projects seeking financial close , and that will mean that the country will likely miss its expected installation of around 1 .
of utility scale PV in 2021 .
Wind , because of its longer lead times , is still expected to deliver 4 .
GW of finished wind turbine capacity between 2020 and 2021 , but the 1 .
worth of approved projects scheduled for 2022 are at risk of delay .
" We feel it is now unlikely that Australia will see a standalone wind farm reaching financial close in 2020 , " Farruggio says .
Likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar way to Australia , with companies pausing on procuring solar PV projects which would have been commissioned in and after 2021 .
" Countries most impacted in this sector will be from emerging markets in Asia , the Middle East , India and Latin America , where the bulk of solar growth had previously been expected , " he says .
China and the US will be the least impacted by exchange fluctuations , and the number of solar installations in these countries is expected to remain fairly stable , although China may struggle to increase its solar capacity by 40 GW as initially forecasted .
In Europe , over 20 GW of solar capacity was expected pre-crisis .
However , all of the Euro 's gains on the US dollar from the beginning of the year have now been lost .
Foreign exchange issues for projects in Europe are less of an immediate concern but could take the forefront if the Euro falls further .
Strict travel restrictions implemented across the continent have now halted projects under construction .
In Latin America , Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects under construction .
However , both countries are experiencing steep currency declines versus the US dollar and procurement is expected to come to a complete halt on most -- if not all -- projects yet to be committed .
Projects hoping to be commissioned in 2021 will be significantly slowed or even indefinitely delayed .
Procurement in India is not expected to be impacted as much as in other regions facing depreciation , the report said .
Previously Rystad Energy estimated the country would see 5 .
GW of utility solar PV projects starting up in 2020 , increasing by 9 .
GW in 2021 .
