Pandemic reveals importance of growing your own food : Farmer  Scott Allin , owner of Aquatic Growers , has some tips for those worried about a lack of fresh food during the global COVID-19 pandemic .
Contributed photo  It does n't seem to matter what aisle you walk down in the grocery store these days , they conjure up images from a dystopian novel .
But there are some things we can do to create more food security for ourselves , family and friends , said Scott Allin , a volunteer with Sustainable Orillia and owner of Aquatic Growers .
Allin has a business growing different kinds of vegetables through aquaponics , which is a hybrid of fish farming and hydroponics , he told OrilliaMatters .
The plants are grown in water that is occupied by fish .
The fish are fed a high quality diet and their waste is what feeds the plants .
Anyone with a 65-gallon aquarium , some know-how and five fish can grow 200 plants , he said .
If you do n't want to go the aquaponics route , there 's always good old-fashioned gardening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our grandparents used to do , " Allin said .
" All that knowledge has been lost and we need to get it back .
"  There was a time , less than 100 years ago , when we did n't have grocery stores like we do now , he said .
" We grew our own food , we preserved it and we stored it .
"  If you are lucky enough to still have grandparents , you should be asking them to share their knowledge with you , he said .
If not , the internet is rife with information on how to grow just about everything .
The more space you have to grow things , the better , Allin said , but even if you have an apartment with a balcony or big windows , you can grow your own food .
Herb gardens or tomatoes are common apartment plants , but if you have little viable space available , you can always join a community garden in your area and get your own small plot , he suggested .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people , but I am not sure what the legalities are around things like insurance , " he said .
" What happens if someone gets hurt on their land ? "  If you have backyard space , your options open up , Allin said .
" Owning a garden is one of the simplest ways to become more self-sustaining , " said the Severn Bridge grower .
While you might want to immediately go all in on a huge garden with many vegetables , Allin cautioned against such an approach .
Gardening takes time to learn , he said .
" There are plants that are super-easy to grow , like green beans and lettuce .
"  You have to make sure your soil has nutrition , Allin said , but augmenting it with things like compost , which you can make yourself , is a good start .
" You can even use your lawn clippings for your compost , " he said , noting compost bins can be purchased or made yourself .
" Kale is also an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like squashes or watermelons , " he said .
" Squash do need a lot of water , though .
"  Some plants , like tomatoes and cucumbers , require a lot of nutrition in the soil and therefore fertilizer , he said .
" Cucumbers are a little fussy and can also have some issues with bugs , " Allin explained .
Allin said his soil does n't support root vegetable growing , but if yours is a sandy , light soil , you should n't have too many issues .
" You can even grow potatoes in a five-gallon pail , " he said .
" Just drill holes in the bottom of the bucket , add 10 inches of soil , and one seed potato will give you four or five pounds of potatoes .
"  Carrots , similarly , will also grow in a pail , he said .
If you 're looking to do some raised-bed gardening , Allin offered some ideas on how to do that as cheaply as possible .
" You can get a 50-300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 gallons , " he said .
Raised beds heat up faster which is better for many plants , but they also require more water than in-ground gardening .
After gardening season is done , your grandparents would have stored their root vegetables and foods like squash in a root cellar or cold room .
Some older houses in Orillia may still have the cold room in the basement , Allin said .
While there are some ingenious ideas online for storing your garden bounty , you can always opt to can your vegetables or freeze or dehydrate them , Allin said .
" We also need to stop wasting so much food , " he said .
" You 'd be surprised at how much less food is wasted if you 've actually grown the food yourself and know how much time it takes .
