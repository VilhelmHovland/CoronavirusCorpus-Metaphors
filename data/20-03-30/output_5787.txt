What the media and public are irked about is that Germany was not so well prepared for a pandemic as it could be , despite being warned of an impending pandemic way back in 2013 .
The first time I took real notice of reports on coronavirus was at the end of January .
When the first confirmed case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported from Bavaria in Germany , I was in a clinic in Thuringia .
Other patients in the clinic spoke about how media has found a new topic to cannibalise .
I was also wondering what the big deal was .
News and pictures from shut-down cities in China did n't interest me much -- the problem seemed very far away .
Two months later , I am sitting in " social isolation " in my apartment in Berlin .
Germany 's capital with almost four million inhabitants has come to a halt .
Nevertheless , the lockdown is not as strict as in India -- people here are still allowed to go out for walks if they are not more than two except for family members .
Police are patrolling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 1 .
metres is being followed .
If not , they politely ask people to follow the order .
Schools , universities , bars , theatres , caf ? s , restaurants , gyms and all other public institutions are shut all over Germany , though supermarkets and pharmacies remain open .
The stricter measures against the pandemic were mainly implemented during the last two weeks .
A board with information on coronavirus is seen at the Neumarkt subway station , as the spread of Covid-19 continues in Germany .
( Photo : Reuters )  I must admit I did n't understand the seriousness of the situation until recently .
Like many others , I thought that the measures taken are exaggerated .
Especially when ITB Berlin , one of the world 's leading tourism trade fairs , was called off on short notice at the beginning of March .
I was so looking forward to seeing my friends from the Indian tourism industry here .
When politicians and Messe Berlin discussed whether the event should be cancelled , I never thought that they could do that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world were expected .
They had booked flights , hotels and prepared for the fair so long .
Most of them lost a lot of money .
Who would have thought that instead of fairs , a corona-hospital for 1,000 patients would be built on the grounds of Messe Berlin a few weeks later ! Neither would I have imagined at the end of January , when I saw the first report on coronavirus , that the clinic in Thuringia would be closed because of the pandemic and a part of the staff will be under quarantine .
Since most people like me have no medical background , it takes some time to understand why " freedom " needs to be restricted so suddenly and this strictly .
Especially for the young people who did n't get it .
The " corona parties " were being held while doctors and nurses were already battling for the lives of people under dramatic circumstances in Italy , France and Spain .
People here in Berlin went on a panic-buying mode -- there is no stock of toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Even though the virus has n't killed too many people in Germany yet , a lot of them struggle with the pandemic measures .
The cost of living in Germany is relatively high , especially in bigger cities like Berlin , Hamburg , Munich or Frankfurt .
Without the subsistence level of 800 Euros per month per person , it is nearly impossible to survive .
Families , single parents , freelancers and smaller entrepreneurs are affected the most so far .
Many of them can not pay rent for their business or houses anymore .
The German government knows about the problem .
That 's why an " unprecedented package of support to Europe 's biggest economy worth hundreds of billions of euros to cushion the impact of measures to contain the novel coronavirus " was waved through all necessary institutions last week .
It " covers several areas : Small companies and self-employed people such as artists and carers are to receive direct grants of up to 15,000 Euros over three months .
"  If we were to discount the breakdown of the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call them empty here ) , and people wearing masks and gloves in public , the situation in Germany still seems relatively normal in the given circumstances .
What the media and public are irked about is that Germany was not as well prepared for a pandemic as it could be .
The Robert Koch Institute ( RKI ) , the government 's central scientific institution for biomedicine and one of the most important bodies for the safeguarding of public health in Germany , informed in the Parliament in a paper , way back in 2013 about a " pandemic caused by Virus Modi-SARS " .
The text reads like a short script for what has happened so far .
No one took it seriously though .
Now Germany is lacking staff , respirator masks , protective clothing and ventilators in hospitals or care homes .
People working in the health and allied services sectors have to take the risk of being infected .
What prevented Germany from large scale infections so far might just be the factor of time .
As of March 29 , 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 389 deaths due to COVID-19 have been electronically reported to the Robert Koch Institute in Germany .
All 16 federal states are affected .
The incidence of COVID-19 is highest in Hamburg , Bavaria and Baden-W ? rttemberg .
Most cases are between 35 and 59 years old ; men are more affected than women .
88 per cent of deaths occurred in persons aged 70 years or older .
According to Health Minister Jens Spahn , " Germany is still in the calm before the storm of the coronavirus epidemic and is using the time it has won with extensive testing to prepare for a wave of cases expected in the coming weeks .
"  " It 's going to get worse before it gets better , " say experts .
I hope Germany can still get away with bruises and it gets better soon in countries where people have been affected badly .
That said , I want to convey my utmost respect to the people of India who stick to the rules of the lockdown so gracefully .
