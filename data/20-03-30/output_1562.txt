People have been praising the efforts of the NHS in fighting the virus , with a mass round of applause held up and down the country last week .
Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled huge government support to businesses and employees as the coronavirus crisis unfolded .

But Prof James said : " There seems to have be an even greater shoring up of public support for the NHS than before .
" There is now an absolute loyalty that is almost replacing the Church of England in terms of a national religion in terms of our adherence to it and its core values .
" Any government will always have to do things using the NHS and not use other forms of providing healthcare .
I think to try and privatise any area of the NHS will be a very difficult path .
"  One future side effect of people being shut in their homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture : GETTY/ISTOCKPHOTO  In terms of the economy , the government announced massive financial packages of support for business and workers as the crisis unfurled , something Prof James warned society may find it difficult to let go of .
" There now seems to be quite considerable support for massive state intervention in everyday life and particularly in the economy , " he said .
" There seem to be no voices saying ' the government should n't do this ' .
Instead there is now this idea that the government should have a big role .
" It could well be that if this crisis goes on for a while , the massive intervention and state subsidy of employment , might actually be something that is difficult to roll back .
Could going on holiday be more complicated once the crisis is over ?

" I think it might be difficult to row back if quite a lot of people have benefitted from it .
Not just the very poorest , but the people who are middle income and have always normally had a job .
" There may be a lot of support for those measures , particularly if we 're in up and down economic territory afterwards .
That could be something that might stay .
"  Prof James said the crisis had been a knock to the nation 's sense of security and self-confidence .
" We 've had relative security in this country and Europe over the last 70 or so years , " he said .
" We have enjoyed material security , plus the freedom of movement that goes with it .
However we now feel a little bit more fragile .
" National governments have taken full control and absolutely locked down their borders against all people from outside without the right citizenship and nationality .
" Whether people will really want more open borders so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is over , or whether they will be more accepting of this more closed and insular world , is a fork in the road the country is going to have to face .
"  However it 's not all doom and gloom - there could be a baby boom on the way .
Prof James said : " When people are cooped up in a house for quite long periods of time it 's almost inevitable !  " The birth rate has been declining for almost the past 20 years , so we could certainly see that as a positive .
"  There could also be a resurgence in faith , he said , particularly if the death rate continues to climb .
" It was something that was very much seen after the First World War , " he said .
" People were looking to contact the dead .
Believing in spirits and looking for different sorts of religion and ideas is a way to explain the inexplicable , even in our secular society today .
