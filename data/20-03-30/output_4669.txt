The astonishing question is whether it will be enough .
The truth is nobody can know whether this mammoth spending can end after six months or will have to continue .
Scott Morrison warns that some economies could collapse and some nations could " fall into chaos " from the impact of COVID-19 , a dire outlook no doubt informed by the horror show in some of the projections for the spread of the virus .
Advertisement  Just as the government has been the lender of last resort to banks in the past , it is now the employer of last resort to workers .
Loading  The program is structured carefully to encourage big companies to halt redundancies because they know the federal money will be paid in the first week of May .
In a win for small business , the money also goes to sole traders and small companies where the owner can be considered an employee .
These are reasonable conditions on huge outlays .
The payment is not as generous as the United Kingdom scheme , which pays 80 per cent of salaries up to a cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian scheme pays $3,000 per month .
One key point is the Australian scheme lasts longer : Morrison promises support for six months , while the British payments run for " at least " three months .
Can UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson keep being more generous if the crisis lasts longer ?  Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also offer a flat amount , equal for all .
Those with mortgages in the big cities and towns will not survive on this money alone .
They will have to ask their banks to defer repayments for six months , which means adding to the term of their home loans .
This will not be enough for many tenants , either .
They have the protection of a ban on evictions , announced on Sunday night , but will need help with the rent as well .
Morrison 's message is that further assistance is being considered .
A fundamental point is many workers should not have to rely on this federal scheme alone .
Their employers are expected to keep paying some of their salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a replacement .
There will no doubt be problems to fix when Parliament returns to legislate the scheme .
A budget measure that would normally take weeks or months to fine-tune has been done in weeks under enormous pressure .
Keep this in mind if Morrison and Frydenberg have to make adjustments .
The final days of February are now ancient history .
Back then , Morrison said he would design policies to be " targeted , modest and scalable " so they helped the people in greatest need .
Loading  One month later he has to help everyone .
Could he have acted faster ? Could he and his ministers have done more to stop the virus ? That question will determine the next election .
For now , the government has done what it can within very real constraints .
The $130 billion follows the $17 .
billion in the first stimulus package , the $25 billion in cash for small business and the $21 billion in income support measures .
Excluding loans and loan guarantees , the government is spending at least $194 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next generation and it will only get heavier when the global slump erodes government tax revenue .
But there is no alternative .
