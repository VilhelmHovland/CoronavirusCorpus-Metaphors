Singapore -- The Prime Minister 's wife took to social media to repeatedly encourage everyone to " Mind the gap " and practice social distancing as Covid-19 confirmed cases in Singapore continue to rise .
On Friday ( Mar 20 ) , Ho Ching further explained the meaning of keeping a safe distance from others in a couple of Facebook posts .
The World Health Organization advises everyone to keep a one-metre distance to limit contamination risks amid the Covid-19 pandemic .
" Instead of taking out a yardstick to measure the distance , we simply stretch out our hands towards each other , " Ms Ho advised .
" If we can not touch each other with our outstretched arms , we are more than 1 metre apart for most adults .
"  As someone who has been closely monitoring the pandemic , the CEO of Temasek Holdings could n't reiterate enough the importance of minding the gap .

" Blow a flying kiss across the gap , do a tap dance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fist bump , stay out of physical touch but stay socially connected .
"  For children , she noted that an arm 's length would not be enough , although " their cough and spittle are not as powerful as adults .
" Ms Ho concluded that one adult 's arm plus one kid 's arm should be about one metre in length .
Or they can stay two arms ' length from each other , said Ms Ho .
" If we are with a suspected case or someone is sick , we need to double the Safe Gap , " said Ms Ho .
She suggested keeping a total three arm 's length apart from each other , which would be more or less two metres apart .
The PM 's wife illustrated that " if we do an air gap fist bump with outstretched arms , and another person can walk through the air gap of the 1st two air gap fist bumpers , without touching both bumpers , we would be 2 meters apart .
"  So .
Mind the Gap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the public asked how does the " gap stuff " work during commutes in buses or the MRT ? Another netizen suggested to " alight and walk " .
She included an example of Tokyo 's intricate subway system which had been revised into the " Tokyo Walking Subway " map to promote social distancing .
