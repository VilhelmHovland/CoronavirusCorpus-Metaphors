As South Africa enters its first full week of lockdown , in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 , many locals are adjusting to a life spent in the confines of their homes .
Another adjustment folks are making is dealing with restrictions on movement and not being able to head to the store on a whim .
While Takealot has said that it will continue to deliver essential goods to customers , one company fulfilling deliveries to South Africans is bound to cause issues and delays .
In light of that we bring you news from ride sharing service Bolt .
The firm has done something rather clever that allows drivers to keep earning money while delivering essential goods to South Africans .
" We have launched Bolt Business Delivery with two key goals in mind : to make sure that drivers on the Bolt platform can continue to earn a living safely , and to help businesses selling the essential products defined by the lockdown regulations to get orders to their customers quickly and safely , " said country manager for Bolt South Africa , Gareth Taylor .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or medicine can use the Bolt Business Delivery platform to facilitate deliveries which will be sent out between 05:00 and 09:00 and 16:00 and 20:00 each day .
These time periods are the times in which regulations allow ehailing services to function during lockdown .
Merchants will be able to schedule deliveries in batches or individually using the Bolt Business Delivery platform .
From here the merchant can track the order and the customer will receive an SMS when their order is dispatched ,  " During the COVID-19 outbreak , contactless delivery is mandatory for all Bolt Business Delivery orders to help prevent the spread of the virus from person to person .
Drivers using the Bolt Business Delivery platform strictly adhere to the regulations announced by the Minister of Transport , including sanitizing their vehicle with SABS-approved sanitizer after each trip , " said Bolt .
From that form we can see that Bolt is directing this service at grocery stores , ecommerce platforms , pharmacies , flower shops and restaurants ( although all restaurants are currently closed due to the COVID-19 restrictions ) .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hoping local businesses take up this offer so that more folks can get essential goods delivered while they practice social distancing .
