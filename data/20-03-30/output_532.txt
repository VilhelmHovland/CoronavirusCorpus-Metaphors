President Trump 's reelection bid hinges on his handling of coronavirus pandemic  Joe Biden says Trump mishandled the crisis , but he 's overshadowed as president gets the bulk of the media coverage .

( AP Photo/Alex Brandon ) ( Alex Brandon )  The coronavirus pandemic has changed the nature of the 2020 presidential contest , but not the face .
November 's election has always been a referendum on President Donald Trump .
Now , instead of a broad look at the pros and cons of his tenure , voters will largely judge him on his handling of the pandemic and its impact on the economy .
" It all depends on the length of our memory .
It may not be possible to know the dynamic until we see how this very strange story ends , " said conservative talk radio host Mark Davis .
Davis said that Trump would benefit if the country returns to normal this summer .
That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in things not related to the coronavirus fight .
If that does n't happen , Trump could face a headwind to reelection .
" If something goes horribly wrong , then that will be a problem , " Davis said .
Trump has driven the news coverage since he launched his presidential campaign in 2015 .
Now , his daily news conferences on the fight to curb the pandemic have made him ubiquitous with Americans at a time when they are forced into their homes .
Early data reflects a so-far , so-good moment for Trump .
A recent Gallup poll found Americans approve of Trump 's handling of the coronavirus crisis by a 60% to 38% margin .
Ninety-four percent of Republicans , 60% of independents and 27% of Democrats approve of his response .
That Americans -- at this point -- approved of Trump 's handling of the pandemic is not surprising .
From Franklin D .
Roosevelt 's handling of the Great Depression and World War II to George W .
Bush 's stewardship after the 9/11 terror attacks , presidents typically enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally around each other and their leader .
Often a controversial figure , Trump for the most part has projected well at his news briefings , and the relief package approved by Congress should help his standing with voters .
But the heat of a presidential campaign will force Trump to address criticisms of his job performance , particularly his response in the early stages of the pandemic .
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Democrats will use paid media to blast Trump for initially not taking seriously the coronavirus threat .
He called it a " hoax , " but later said he was talking about criticism of him from Democrats .
Many health experts say the nation is behind where it should be in testing residents for the virus , which has resulted in a dearth of necessary data to establish where the fight against the virus stands .
Trump has argued that he inherited a broken system that his team had to retool .
Whatever the case , Biden will try to put the country 's pain and suffering from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week he released a video criticizing Trump 's response to the crisis .
In times of crisis , American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment .
But all we 've gotten from Donald Trump are lies , excuses , and scapegoats .
Democratic strategist Lisa Turner said Trump 's message has been inconsistent and sometimes steeped in politics .
She said she 's not surprised that polls show Americans approve of his handling of the crisis .
" I 've never rooted for Trump more in my life for him to get this right , " Turner said .
" But he 's not getting it right and I do n't think those poll numbers will hold .
"  But Biden has immediate problems .
While Trump is beamed daily to voters across the country , Biden has been far less visible .
Other Democrats have captured the attention of base voters , including Govs .
Gavin Newsom of California and Andrew Cuomo of New York .

( Biden for President via AP ) ( Uncredited )  Cuomo has been so inspiring that some Democrats are pondering whether to draft him as a 2020 presidential candidate .
While that wo n't happen and does n't represent the majority view , it reflects the problem facing Biden .
This week he began to have more virtual meetings and interactions with voters .
He did some interviews , but not enough to counter the earned media enjoyed by Trump .
At some point the nation will get a handle on the virus and the focus will return to the presidential campaign and the conventions of both parties .
That 's when Biden hopes to make the case that he 's a better choice in times of crisis .
And Biden 's opponents will argue that he 's a bad risk .
Of course , no one really knows what the mechanics of a 2020 presidential campaign will look like , particularly if social distancing policies are still in place .
