But the problem the NRL have - and one shared by the likes of Sanzaar and New Zealand Rugby - is they face going broke very quickly should they follow the lead of most other codes and suspend competition in the face of the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic .
Television companies reportedly pay the NRL $AU13 million for each round of matches and , with little or no cash reserves , the governing body would not be able to absorb any kind of curtailment to the competition .
Super Rugby is the same , but made more complicated by the fact teams from five nations take part in it .
We might - provided no players show coronavirus symptoms in the meantime - see Super teams in New Zealand , South Africa and Australia playing derby games amongst themselves , but that wo n't be a lot of comfort to the Sunwolves or Jaguares .
I 'm a freelancer who people pay to offer a point of view on sport .
It 's a gig that has its moments , but overall I very much enjoy it .
But no sport means no work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
So I get why ARL Commission chairman Peter V'Landys is so keen to keep staging the NRL and can understand why Sanzaar chief executive Andy Marinos is nervous about the 2020 Super Rugby season ending up on the scrapheap .
But these are unique circumstances .
People around the world are dying in increasingly big numbers and there 's every reason to assume that similar will happen here .
Spare me these dribblers who say sport is essential to the health and wellbeing of a nation and that we must preserve our professional competitions .
What rot .
Those codes who can afford to call a halt to proceedings , have done , and those whose model is already busted are now hanging on for grim death .
Or should that be in the face of grim death ?  Because how anyone can pretend that we need sport right now or maintain , as V'Landys is trying to , that it 's a basic human right , is beyond me .
He has petitioned the Australian government for a handout on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really Australia at all .
I wish I was making that up or exaggerating for effect .
People are dying and , tired of forever being told the sky is falling , lots of us have been slow to react .
That includes governments and , while every attempt is now being made to contain the coronavirus , it 's all come a bit late .
The effects are already bad , but in due course they could be absolutely devastating .
And not just overseas , but in New Zealand as well .
So while I get that various athletes have spent years working towards the Tokyo Olympics and while I fear New Zealand Rugby might actually go broke , I do n't feel too inclined to feel sorry for them .
