Playing by the rules  The GAA - and the country - are breaking new ground  Following directives from the Irish Government and the Department of Health the majority of the country 's sporting associations have suspended all activity , in an effort to contain the spread of the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 )  Following directives from the Irish Government and the Department of Health the majority of the country 's sporting associations have suspended all activity , in an effort to contain the spread of the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 )  Contradictory as it may seem , we 've come a long way in a few short and surreal weeks .
Ireland , a nation of casual rule-breakers , has willingly accepted the imposition of Orwellian restrictions on our freedoms of choice and movement .
With the - thankfully few - Covidiot exceptions , we have embraced a version of totalitarian rule for the greater good .
Because we have no choice .
Because the alternative is too scary to contemplate .
In the midst of this seismic shift of mindset , the GAA has stepped up to the plate .
All matches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' training anywhere on this island .
The gates to every GAA club are locked .
Even the walking track around your local football or hurling pitch is now off-limits .
Officially this will continue until April 19 .
No one honestly excepts normality to resume beyond that date .
Given the tangible lives at stake , the first GAA team that sought to surreptitiously flout this blanket training ban would face a level of public opprobrium usually reserved for the likes of Lance Armstrong or OJ Simpson .
It 's just not on .
And , we remain convinced , it will not happen .
This nation 's predisposition to breaking the law ' just a little bit ' - by going 10kpm over the speed limit , by ordering one for the road 20 minutes after closing time - is legendary .
But this is different .
In this coronavirus world , the only bottles of Corona to be had are in your own private sitting room shebeen .
And yet , the GAA now embracing every latest Government imposition is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living embodiment of recalcitrant , pre-virus Ireland .
An association that , at club and county level , has bent rules and regulations with the spoon-buckling aplomb of Uri Geller .
All of this has been despite a constant Croke Park refrain , bemoaning unidentified counties who paid managers , or who paid lip service to punishing indiscipline , or who wilfully flouted regulations that prohibit training in the closed-season or sought to control overseas training camps .
It 's almost two decades since former GAA president Peter Quinn was asked to chair a committee tasked with investigating under-the-table payments to managers .
Quinn famously later admitted that they could n't even find the table .
Historically , many GAA clubs and counties have been wonderfully adept at circumventing such bothersome obstacles as amateur status .
Debate  Former director-general P ? raic Duffy circulated a paper , in December 2010 , seeking to stimulate a " long-overdue debate " on the issue of payments to inter-county managers .
In his valedictory report to Congress , in 2018 , Duffy dolefully concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy .
"  Recalling a meeting of county officers in Croke Park to consider the report , he wrote : " Overwhelming support was declared for maintaining our rules on amateurism , but even more obvious was a lack of enthusiasm for any attempt to implement the proposals made in the paper .
The initiative simply failed .
"  As Duffy stressed , many county and club managers are not paid beyond their legitimate expenses , but an " increasing number of irregular payments are now being made at club level .
"  It has taken the scourge of Covid-19 , rather than deep-seated principle , to bring this cottage industry to an abrupt halt .
In other respects , the sacred cow of amateurism has been cooked to a cinder by the soaring ( albeit legitimate ) costs associated with a county manager 's backroom army of physios , S&amp;C coaches , psychologists , nutritionists et al .
By and large , even as some county coffers creak towards insolvency , the average fan is happy to go along with this degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pot of silver .
You can launch a very cogent argument that no amateur rule is actually broken when these professional services are availed of .
You might argue - less plausibly - that in all the years where county boards facilitated star players in the evasion of suspension , their actions were perfectly above board .
Never mind if an opponent 's jaw was broken - so long as the perpetrator escaped the referee 's attention .
Or , even where a red card was brandished , so long as a barrister was at hand to offer the best legal advice on the sport of technical loophole jumping .
There is where carpets , not tables , became the hiding place of choice .
As far back as 1998 , Liam Mulvihill could not have been more emphatic in his denunciation .
" In too many cases there is still an inclination to sweep serious incidents under the carpet , possibly because of the perpetrator 's profile or perceived contribution .
Too often we blame the media for highlighting such incidents , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAA 's then director-general .
For years , Mulvihill 's perennial laments were blithely ignored as counties backed every avenue of appeal within the GAA or even acquiesced beyond that , to the steps of the High Court .
Thankfully , overt acts of violence at the elite level are now a rarity and maybe that 's partly because of those all-seeing cameras - albeit Omagh 's recent ' Tunnel of Love ' offered proof that individuals with flailing fists can still get off scot-free .
Less scope  Generally , though , there is less scope today for escaping suspension on a technicality .
The establishment from 2005 of a new disciplinary structure has been a positive , especially in ending all court cases , even if this alphabet soup of committees ( CCCC , CHC , CAC and DRA ) offers multiple potential escape routes .
But there remains an attitude of pushing the boundaries , reflected in that clich ? d promise that a suspended party will " go all the way to the DRA " to clear his name .
Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But now there are no Sundays for the immediate future .
What happens when games eventually return is anyone 's guess .
Will GAA managers , red-carded players and county boards accept decisions that may not suit them because , well , rules are rules and we 're all in this together ?  Somehow , we suspect , the oldest rule of all will triumph once again : that rules are there to be broken .
