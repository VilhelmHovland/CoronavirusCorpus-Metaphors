The stock market crash may continue , but I 'd buy FTSE 100 shares to make a passive income  The FTSE 100 's market crash has shown signs of recovery in recent trading sessions .
The index recorded one of its biggest one-day gains , as investors looked ahead to the prospect of an improving outlook regarding coronavirus .
However , past bear markets suggest there can be high volatility for some time after a market crash .
This may cause paper losses for investors in the short run .
But with the FTSE 100 offering high yields and recovery potential , now could be the right time to invest in a diverse range of stocks to make a passive income .
Global stock markets may be reeling from the coronavirus , but you do n't have to face this down market alone .

Click here to claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FTSE 100 's recent decline means it now has a dividend yield of around 6% .
That 's its highest ever level and highlights its income potential .
Of course , some of its members have already announced they will not be paying their dividends in the near term .
Others are likely to follow , as the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak becomes clearer .
However , income investors may be able to obtain FTSE 100 dividend stocks with highly favourable outlooks .
In many cases , their dividends are highly affordable and their financial positions suggest a good chance they will overcome near-term economic challenges to deliver rising dividends in the coming years .
Buying a range of income stocks today could be a sound move for investors who wish to obtain a generous passive income in the long run .
Passive income opportunities  The FTSE 100 's high yields coincide with a period of lacklustre returns elsewhere for income investors .
Returns on cash and bonds have been exceptionally low for many years , but are now set to worsen .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lag inflation over the medium term .
Similarly , previous opportunities in the buy-to-let sector could becomes less attractive .
Tax changes and more onerous mortgage requirements may make buy-to-let an increasingly difficult means of making a high passive income .
On a relative basis , the FTSE 100 seems to have a significant amount of income appeal at the present .
This could increase as the economic impact of coronavirus subsides over the coming years and a host of FTSE 100 shares are able to post rising dividends that beat the pace of inflation .
Buying today  Clearly , buying shares in the midst of a market crash is a risky move in the short run .
The bottom of the stock market 's fall may not yet have been reached .
But , over the long run , the track record of the FTSE 100 suggests a recovery is highly likely .
Buying large-cap dividend shares today could be a means of generating an attractive passive income , as well as capital returns , in the coming years .
Savvy investors like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity .

But you will need to act fast if you are going to beat the 5 April deadline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FTSE 100 dividend stock yields 12% ! Is it a brilliant buy following the market crash ?  The recent stock market crash has created a lot of investment traps for share pickers to dodge .
I think that the soon-to-be-renamed Royal Bank of Scotland Group ( LSE : RBS ) is another to be avoided at all costs .
I recently explained why the threat of armageddon for the UK economy poses huge dangers to RBS 's industry rival Lloyds .
The outlook is especially worrying for Britain 's biggest mortgage lenders , too , as the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) suggests .

The guidance follows government advice published last week for homebuyers to " delay moving to a new house while measures are in place to fight coronavirus .
"  A recent report from Zoopla illustrates the huge impact that the Covid-19 breakout is having upon the homes market , too .
This says that new sales enquiries had tanked 40% during the week to 22 March , i .
, before that government advice even came out .
The number of new sales dropped 15% year on year too , it said .
The property listings website thinks things could get much worse as well .
It reckons that the number of homes sold in Britain could tank by as much as 60% during the June quarter .
Tough conditions could also spill over in the third quarter of 2020 , Zoopla comments .
Under pressure  So why is RBS -- or Natwest Group , as it is soon to be known -- quite so vulnerable to this ? Well it 's one of the country 's largest mortgage lenders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The bank is the country 's fourth-largest lender and commanded a near-10% market share as of 2018 , according to UK Finance .
The FTSE 100 business can ill afford a sharp decline in mortgage lending .
The bank 's operations on this front are already being plagued by rising competition in this particular segment , in part a reflection of the emergence of challenger banks .
It 's a problem that pushed RBS 's net interest margins to 1 .
in the final three months of 2019 .
This was down four basis points from the previous quarter and a full 0 .
lower from the corresponding 2018 quarter .
Another to avoid  It 's not as if RBS , like its peers , does n't have enough on its plate for this new decade .
Sure , the period of crushing PPI-related penalties might finally be over .
But with Brexit already clouding the outlook for the 2020s , and the recent Covid-19 outbreak and prospect of a painful and prolonged recession , the risks for this Footsie share are unacceptably high .
At least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its huge 12 .
dividend yield for 2020 .
Nor am I impressed by its corresponding price-to-earnings ratio of below 7 times .
City analysts expect earnings at RBS to almost halve this year alone .
I think investors need to brace themselves for further profits pain over the short-to-medium term , too .
And with the Covid-19 virus now beginning to spread beyond of China and Italy , it seems very likely that the bull market we 've enjoyed over the past decade could finally be coming to an end .
Against such a backdrop of market worry , it 's little wonder that many investors are starting to panic .
( After all , nobody likes to see the value of their portfolio fall significantly in such a short space of time .
)  Fortunately , The Motley Fool is here to help , and you do n't have to face this alone .
