Four Priorities for a Global Pandemic Strategy  The world initially met the COVID-19 crisis in an uncoordinated fashion , with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone .
It is now clear that the only way out of it is together .
FUZHOU , March 25 , 2020 -- Medical experts to Italy pose for a group photo before departure in Fuzhou , southeast China 's Fujian Province , March 25 , 2020 .
A team of 14 medical experts from eastern China 's Fujian Province departed on a chartered flight to Italy on Wednesday morning to aid the European country 's fight against the COVID-19 outbreak .
Previously , China had sent two medical groups with a total of 22 people along with more than 20 tonnes of medical supplies to support Italy 's epidemic fight .

COVID-19 has not only Europe but the entire global community in its grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our world .
But precisely how will depend on the choices that we make today .
The coronavirus should be seen as the world 's common enemy .
Though this is not a war , we nevertheless need a " war-like " mobilization of resources .
But in times of crisis , our instinct is to turn inward , to fend for ourselves .
This reaction , though understandable , is self-defeating .
Going it alone all but guarantees that the fight will last longer , and that the human and economic costs will be far higher .
Although the enemy has triggered nationalist reflexes , we can defeat it only with cross-border coordination -- in Europe and beyond .
We need a common international approach to the pandemic and for assisting the most vulnerable , not least those in developing countries and conflict zones .
I have emphasized this point in recent discussions with G7 foreign ministers and many others .
The European Union must and will be a part of the effort .
Now is the time to show that solidarity is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , where France and Austria are sending more than three million masks to Italy , and where Germany is taking in and treating patients from France and Italy .
After a first phase of diverging national decisions , we are now entering a phase of convergence in which the EU takes center stage .
For its part , the organization is stepping up with decisions to facilitate joint procurement of vital medical equipment , a joint economic stimulus , and coordinated consular efforts to repatriate stranded EU citizens .
Following a virtual meeting of the European Council , EU leaders have agreed to intensify their joint efforts , not least by developing a European crisis-management system and a shared strategy to manage the coronavirus .
The COVID-19 crisis is not a battle between countries or systems .
At different stages of the pandemic , there has been reciprocal assistance between Europe , China , and others , demonstrating mutual support and solidarity .
The EU supported China when the outbreak emerged at the beginning of the year , and now China is sending equipment and doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concrete examples of global solidarity and cooperation ; they need to become the norm .
One way to think of COVID-19 is that it is accelerating history .
Through whatever changes are in store , the EU must remain a unifying factor , by promoting joint efforts with China and the United States to address the pandemic and its consequences .
Only with these three powers pulling in the same direction can the G20 and the United Nations make a real difference .
Beyond international coordination between governments , cooperation among scientists , economists , and policymakers also needs to be scaled up .
During the 2008 financial crisis , the G20 played a pivotal role in rescuing the global economy when it was in freefall .
There is once again an urgent need for global leadership along these lines .
There are four major priorities for global cooperation .
First , we must pool resources to produce new treatments and a vaccine , which should be regarded as a global public good .
Second , we need to limit the economic damage by coordinating fiscal- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third , we should be planning to re-open borders in a coordinated way whenever health authorities give the green light .
Lastly , we must cooperate to fight disinformation campaigns .
The outcome of the G20 's recent virtual summit points in this general direction .
But global and multilateral initiatives will need to be sustained and fully implemented in the days and weeks ahead .
As the virus spreads globally , we need to pay special attention to its growing impact on fragile countries , where it threatens to exacerbate existing security crises .
In Syria , Yemen , Gaza , and Afghanistan , millions of people have already suffered through years of conflict .
Just imagine what would follow if the coronavirus emerges in the region 's refugee camps , where sanitation and health services are already overstretched and humanitarian workers already struggle to deliver aid .
Then there is Africa , which is of paramount importance .
Owing to the 2014-16 Ebola epidemic and other outbreaks , African countries have some experience that Europe lacks in this crisis .
But health-care systems on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people is growing .
In many developing countries , a large number of people often have no choice but to go out every day and make a living in the informal economy .
Worse , handwashing and social distancing can be far more difficult in these countries , because running water is not always available and families tend to live in cramped spaces .
This is a fight that will need funding to win .
Developing countries depend crucially on three sources of finance : foreign investment , remittances , and tourism .
Yet all three are now being hit hard .
Globally , capital flows have fallen dramatically as investors flee to safe havens and migrant workers lose jobs and are unable to send money home .
We are facing a global recession ; to avoid an economic crash in developing countries , significant financial support and credit lines will be needed -- and soon .
Coordination among central banks and international financial institutions is the only viable way forward .
Finally , amid the overwhelming gloom , there is a chance to end long-running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation between rivals .
The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait , for example , recently sent aid to Iran , which has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19 .
No one can afford to wage multiple wars at the same time .
As UN Secretary-General Ant ? nio Guterres has urged , we should use this crisis as an opportunity to restore peace .
The world initially met the crisis in an uncoordinated fashion , with too many countries ignoring the warning signs and going it alone .
It is now clear that the only way out of it is together .
