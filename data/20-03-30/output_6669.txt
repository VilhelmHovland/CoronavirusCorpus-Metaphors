( Dave Zajac/Record-Journal via AP )  Urgent question from small businesses : When will aid arrive ?  Share this :  That 's the urgent question for small business owners who have been devastated by the coronavirus outbreak .
They 're awaiting help from the $2 trillion rescue package signed into law Friday .
But with bills fast coming due , no end to business closings and an economy that 's all but shut down , owners are worried about survival .
Millions of owners face April 1 due dates for rent , mortgage , credit card and other payments .
Some have been granted leniency from landlords and lenders .
But even then , there are other business and personal bills that are owed .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid off -- must be paid .
" How quick can we get these funds ? " says Adam Rammel , co-owner of Brewfontaine , a bar and restaurant in Bellefontaine , Ohio , that 's now limited to takeout and delivery service .
His revenue is down 60% .
Yet he has eight staffers , down from his usual 25 , whom he must pay .
" Relief ca n't come soon enough -- we 're a cash business with small margins , " says Rammel , who is looking to Small Business Administration loans .
He needs the money despite receiving some concessions from his banker .
Freelancers and people whose gig work has vanished are also anxious about having to wait .
" I need to pay my electric bill and the mortgage , " says Krista Kowalcyzk , whose Southwest Florida photography business has come to a halt as weddings have been canceled and customers have decided against having portraits shot .
She feels somewhat reassured that she can receive unemployment benefits .
But while she waits , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , I have also been asked for thousands of dollars in refunds .
"  At companies small and large , from restaurants and retailers to sports and entertainment venues , revenue has essentially dried up .
The same for the businesses that support those companies .
Even employers that are still operating have lost business as their customers have became too cautious to continue doing business .
The rescue package signed into law Friday provides for Small Business Administration loans to companies as well as to sole proprietors and freelancers .
The loans can be used for payroll , mortgages , rent and utilities , with those amounts forgiven and payments deferred .
It will also supply small loans that can , depending on an owner 's credit score , be approved quickly .
Employers can receive tax credits for retaining workers , though not if they have obtained one of the SBA loans .
Many owners are also seeking separate SBA economic injury disaster loans .
And the Federal Reserve plans to set up a program to lend directly to small business owners .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something they had n't previously qualified for .
And owners can be eligible for the $1,200 per person payment that 's available to many Americans depending on their income .
Whatever the source of funding , how fast it arrives at businesses across the country is sure to have a significant impact on the economy .
Slightly more than half of American workers are employed at businesses with 500 or fewer employees .
Every lost job means another person will struggle to pay rent or other bills .
Unpaid bills , in turn , cut revenue for other businesses .
Layoffs are mounting , and most analysts forecast that the economy will shrink significantly in the April-June quarter , with some estimating a 30% annual plunge for the quarter .
That would be deepest economic contraction for any quarter in records dating to World War II .
In the week that ended March 21 , roughly 3 .
million people applied for unemployment benefits -- more than 10 times the number for the previous week and nearly five times the prior record high .
Treasury Secretary Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , and in an interview with the Fox Business Network , Mnuchin said he hoped to release loan forms later Monday .
During the Great Recession , by some estimates close to 200,000 small businesses shut down .
Most of them died a slow death , with the consequences -- layoffs , reduced investment and expansion -- occurring gradually .
By contrast , the suddenness of the virus-related economic shutdown is threatening to quickly destroy even healthy restaurants , retailers and other companies almost without warning .
Katie Vliestra , an executive at the National Association for the Self-Employed , an advocacy group , says she 's concerned about the lag time between application and approval for even the small loans that are intended to have the fastest turnaround .
Most small companies have only 15 to 30 days of cash on hand , she said .
There are also worries about potential logjams at the SBA .
The agency 's inspector general 's office found that the SBA failed to quickly turn around thousands of loans after Hurricane Harvey devastated the Houston area in 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request for information about handling an influx of applications .
)  John Arensmeyer , CEO of the advocacy group Small Business Majority , says he 's concerned that the loans will be processed through the SBA 's traditional business loan program , which relies on banks to handle the initial applications .
" Banks have to retool their technology to do this , " Arensmeyer says .
" It 's going to be months before this money gets out there .
How many people are going to be able to maintain payroll , hoping to get this money ? "  On its face , at least , the rescue aid appears to address some of the most vital needs of small businesses , notably their ability to maintain or hire back furloughed workers eventually .
The issue is whether it will come quickly enough .
" The challenge is cash flow , " says Jason Duff , owner of Six Hundred Downtown , a restaurant in Bellefontaine , Ohio .
He has a staff of eight , down from 27 , handling deliveries and pickups .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make those payrolls as people come back .
"  Duff has less than a week of working capital funds available .
He is seeking loans from family and friends as well as some patience from vendors while he awaits federal help .
Don Allison has bills coming due this week for his business , a publisher of books about the Civil War and northwest Ohio history .
He and his wife are looking forward to a combined $2,400 .
But the royalty checks he must send out require a bigger cash infusion .
And he 's concerned about being in a long line of owners hoping to receive SBA loans .
" They 're going to be slammed , " Allison says of the SBA .
" How big a delay is there going to be ? "  Loans are at least a short-term need for many business owners .
But they are n't a solution for others that have been reluctant to take on more debt after the Great Recession .
Liliana Aranda , for example , who owns a now-closed skin care business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with debt payments -- especially since she does n't know yet how much the outbreak will affect consumer spending .
She already carries a small amount of debt .
The same is true for Susin Greenberg , a freelance hair and fashion stylist .
" Anytime I 'm thinking of loans , I 'm thinking I have to make money to pay it back in the long run , " says Greenberg , who lives in Highland Park , Illinois .
She 's focusing on other forms of financial aid in the rescue package but worries about how long it would take to arrive .
