2 of Detroit 's homeless positive for COVID-19 as city adds 300-plus beds , testing  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested positive for COVID-19 and are being separated with 27 others at a new facility opened amid the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic .
Detroit has added about 325 shelter beds for homeless people , rooms for isolation and launched a formal testing program for symptomatic members of the homeless community in an attempt to quell the spread , Donald Rencher , director of the Detroit Housing and Revitalization Department , said Monday .
The 29 homeless community members with COVID-19 symptoms were being isolated at a Salvation Army facility obtained by the city for a pandemic response for the homeless population , he said .
The city has opened three new buildings in their response thus far and hopes to add two other facilities by April 19 , bringing the total number of beds to about 500 .
Mayor Mike Duggan acknowledged the shelter coronavirus cases and efforts during a news conference on Monday .
He said nurses are visiting warming centers and shelters every two days for wellness checks .
Speaking about increasing testing and care in general in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discussed the new drive-thru testing at the Michigan State Fairgrounds in Detroit .
" We have to make these tests available to every single Detroiter regardless of whether you have a doctor , even if you do n't have insurance , even if you do n't have a car , " he said .
The city has been making and altering plans in recent weeks to confront concerns about the city 's vulnerable homeless population when it comes to the spread of COVID-19 .
Seniors and those with underlying conditions are especially vulnerable to the illness , health officials say .
They also make up a portion of the homeless population .
The city previously announced plans to open a Salvation Army building to create more room to isolate the city 's sick homeless people , but switched to a 124-room Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries building for greater capacity .
The city since learned there was more room at the initial building than they thought , Rencher said .
Now , both facilities are being used , along with a recreation center , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ? Neighborhood Service Organization shelter , so that location can be used as overflow space .
The city expects to have beds for about 1,600 people and is sending out street care crews to check on others who are unsheltered , Rencher said .
About half of the 2,100 chronically homeless people in 2019 were sheltered , according to officials .
The city has asked the locations of the shelters not to be released out of concerns with the wrong parties seeking testing or treatment .
The need for capacity comes as smaller shelters seek to maintain social distancing in their buildings and face capacity , Rencher said  The Salvation Army site , with about 101 spaces , is serving as the main location for COVID-19 cases and is staffed with nurses and Detroit Health Department workers .
It has about 37 units with individual bathrooms , Rencher said .
With the first shelter cases announced , Rencher said he ca n't say what that might mean for spread in the shelters but knows the city moved swiftly with screenings ahead of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't tell you what that number is going to be , " he said .
" We have people who are making estimations .
we 're thinking that based on other clues that we 're looking at between 425 to 450 individuals that could be affected .
by COVID , so we want to make sure we have the space for all those people .
"  In addition , Wayne State University , the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan and the affiliated DMC Foundation have partnered for on-site COVID-19 testing at the location .
Mariam Noland , president for the foundations , confirmed $100,000 had been granted for the effort , one of several the foundations are involved in to combat the virus ' spread .
Two staffers from Wayne State University are visiting the shelter on Mondays , Wednesdays , and Fridays to get swabs for testing , said Dr .
Phillip Levy , professor of emergency medicine and chief innovation officer for the WSU Physician Group .
Levy echoed experts in calling homeless people particularly at risk in the outbreak , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health care providers and have limited care other than emergency departments .
" If we can avoid them getting exposed and potentially succumbing to worse outcomes because of their other risk factors , then it 's really a no-brainer , " he said .
That 's how you measure a society , how it takes care of its most vulnerable .
"  The operations at Salvation Army and Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries will cost roughly $120,000 each per month , said Rencher , with exact costs for the buildings closer to $70,000 .
The city previously announced allotting $10,000 in additional expenses for the city 's 17 individual shelters , but with shelters facing difficulty getting supplies , the city is , in some cases , using the money to get supplies to shelters faster , he said .
The city also previously announced plans to seek city council approval on the release of about $1 million already provided by the U .
Department of Housing and Urban Development , but not used .
Some of the $2 trillion stimulus package signed by President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts , said Rencher .
It 's unclear .
