The cast of a physical comedy theatre group have uploaded one of their full performances to try and bring some laughter to people as they stay indoors .
Le Navet Bete have uploaded their version of Wizard of Oz to YouTube , which promises plenty of laughs and surprises along the way .
The group have proved very popular in Plymouth , having performed a whole host of shows at the Barbican Theatre and Plymouth Athenaeum across the last decade .
In March 2019 they performed to 1,300 people for one night at the Theatre Royal , with their performance of Dracula : The Bloody Truth , an evening which they say will live with them forever .
They are due to return to the Theatre Royal on October 4 with the Three Musketeers , but whether that will go ahead remains to be seen .
Until then , they hope they can make people laugh in their living rooms with their take on the Emerald City goings on , which was filmed at the Barbican Theatre .
