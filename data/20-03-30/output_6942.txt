NEW YORK , United States -- When automobile sales tanked after the 2008 recession , automakers cut budgets and focused on restructuring to survive .
Most did not acknowledge the fears and anxieties of customers worried about losing their jobs or the global economy .
Hyundai was an exception .
In 2009 , the Korean automaker promised to buy back cars from customers who lost their jobs within a year of their purchase .
The campaign was a hit , and Hyundai was one of the few car companies to see higher sales that year .
Its US market share hit a record high .
Hyundai provides a powerful lesson for fashion and beauty brands trying to engage with consumers during the coronavirus pandemic .
Before businesses can sell to customers stuck at home , they need to address how they are feeling : worried about their health , their families and their jobs , and not all that interested in shopping .
In a mid-March survey by GlobalWebIndex , a market research firm , 50 to 60 percent of respondents in countries where Covid-19 infection rates were increasing fast ( including the US and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In the US , 68 percent of respondents to a McKinsey survey said they were spending less on apparel , and 59 percent had cut back on skin care and makeup .
" It 's like a triple whammy -- people are n't going out and they are n't showing off their style , they are afraid about money and they are paralysed by anxiety , " said consumer behaviour researcher Kit Yarrow .
Trust is the basis of any successful brand , from Purell to Prada .
She said the biggest mistake retailers can make is " getting anxious and pushing too hard " for customers to shop .
Patience and compassion -- as hard as that may be as retailers are laying off staff and facing months of closures -- will strengthen a brand 's reputation in the long run .
" Consumers are looking for a sense of caring and unity and heroism , they want motivational stories about people , they do n't want to feel sold right now , " Yarrow said .
One email with a business update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all communications .
They ca n't pretend nothing is happening , but should n't be too alarmist either .
The key is to find a way to provide a sense of relief or validation by identifying with the anxiety everyone is feeling .
Whether they 're American , Italian or Chinese , consumers unable to leave their homes for weeks are also hungry for entertainment .
Streetwear label John Elliott is sharing music playlists , for example , while the print-heavy womenswear label Tanya Taylor is remixing classic paintings with its floral patterns .
If customers have stopped buying new products , teach them new uses for the ones they already own .
Glossier told customers it will offer FaceTime skin consultations , for example .
Style inspiration and beauty advice are a softer sell for an item 's merits than a direct pitch .
Forget about pushing the products that are " new in " this week , said brand and marketing strategist Ana Andjelic .
Inspirational stories or messages can give shoppers a mental break from the frightening news cycle .
" No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and we do n't need new clothes and we do n't know if we are going to have a pay-check on Friday , " said Andjelic .
Fashion and beauty can be comforting , entertaining and escapist .
Brands can reinforce that idea without asking for sales .
When consumers are ready for retail therapy again , they 'll know where to go .
" Remember what fashion is about -- it 's about joy , it needs to bring you joy , even if you just look at those products , " Andjelic said .
" Make them feel better .
"  Discounts are a mixed bag : they can lead to a short-term rush of sales but can be self-defeating in the current environment because they condition the shopper to avoid buying anything at full-price .
" Trust is the basis of any successful brand , from Purell to Prada , " said consumer behaviour consultant Chris Gray .
" It is tempting to think of ways to take advantage of what is happening in the moment and playing off of people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ultimately those are going to be self-defeating .
"  Rather than promising to donate a portion of each sale to a coronavirus-related cause , brands should consider donating money or supplies to hospitals instead , Andjelic said .
While sales are difficult to generate right now , growing a brand 's online community -- through social media followers or newsletter signups -- is still possible .
And small businesses that are struggling to keep afloat should also share that with their community , said Gray .
Entireworld founder Scott Sternberg posted a selfie on Instagram with a personal letter that was honest and vulnerable but also encouraged readers to buy his brand 's sweatsuits to wear at home .
These kinds of messages humanise a brand , and further acknowledge the anxieties everyone is facing , and normalising them .
Gray suggested brands offer an accessibly priced way for consumers to support a brand , either through a gift card or low-cost branded merchandise .
" This is time for brands to be thinking about that big picture , " he said .
