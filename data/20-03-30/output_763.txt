Associated Press  By TALES AZZONI and ANDREW DAMPF  Updated 3/25/2020 12:30 PM  ROME -- It was the biggest soccer game in Atalanta 's history and a third of Bergamo 's population made the short trip to Milan 's famed San Siro Stadium .
Nearly 2,500 fans of visiting Spanish club Valencia also traveled to that Champions League match .
More than a month later , experts are pointing to the Feb .
19 game as one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ epicenters of the coronavirus pandemic - a ' ? biological bomb ' ? was the way one respiratory specialist put it - and why 35% of Valencia 's team became infected .
The match , which local media have dubbed ' ? Game Zero , ' ? was held two days before the first case of locally transmitted COVID-19 was confirmed in Italy .
' ? We were mid-February so we did n't have the circumstances of what was happening , ' ? Bergamo Mayor Giorgio Gori said this week during a live Facebook chat with the Foreign Press Association in Rome .
' ? If it 's true what they 're saying that the virus was already circulating in Europe in January , then it 's very probable that 40,000 Bergamaschi in the stands of San Siro , all together , exchanged the virus between them .
As is possible that so many Bergamaschi that night got together in houses , bars to watch the match and did the same .
' ? Unfortunately , we could n't have known .
No one knew the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? It was inevitable .
' ?  Less than a week after the game , the first cases were reported in the province of Bergamo .
At about the same time in Valencia , a journalist who traveled to the match became the second person infected in the region , and it did n't take long before people who were in contact with him also had the virus , as did Valencia fans who were at the game .
While Atalanta announced its first positive case Tuesday for goalkeeper Marco Sportiello , Valencia said more than a third of its squad got infected , ' ? despite the strict measures adopted by the club ' ? after the match in Milan .
As of Tuesday , nearly 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for COVID-19 and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus - making Bergamo the most deadly province in all of Italy for the pandemic .
The Valencia region had more than 2,600 people infected .
Luca Lorini , the head of the intensive care unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 88 patients under his care with the coronavirus ; not including many more in other parts of the hospital .
' ? I 'm sure that 40,000 people hugging and kissing each other while standing a centimeter apart - four times , because Atalanta scored four goals ( the final result was 4-1 ) - was definitely a huge accelerator for contagion , ' ? Lorini told The Associated Press on Wednesday .
' ? Right now we 're at war .
When peace time comes , I can assure you we will go and see how many of the 40,000 people who went to the game became infected , ' ? Lorini added .
' ? Right now we have other priorities .
' ?  Silvio Brusaferro , the head of Italy 's Superior Institute of Health , said over the weekend at the nightly nationally televised briefing by the civil protection agency that the game was ' ? one of the hypotheses ' ? being evaluated as a source of the crisis in Bergamo .
' ? It 's certainly an analysis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By last week , Bergamo 's cemetery became so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks began transporting bodies to a neighboring region for cremation .
Italy remained the European country with the most cases , nearly 70,000 , and with almost 7,000 deaths - the most worldwide and more than twice as many as China .
Spain is the next country in Europe with the most cases , nearly 48,000 , and it has surpassed China in the number of deaths with more than 3,400 .
More than 435,000 people worldwide have been infected and the number of dead closed in on 20,000 , according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University .
Overall , more than 100,000 have recovered .
For most people , the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .
The official attendance for the Feb .
19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record for Atalanta , a small club making its debut in Europe 's top club competition .
Atalanta captain Alejandro ' ? Papu ' ? G ? mez told Argentine daily Ol ? it was ' ? terrible ' ? to have played that game .
' ? It 's a city of 120,000 people and that day ( 40,000 ) went to the San Siro , ' ? the Argentine said .
' ? It was a historic match for Atalanta , something unique .
To give you an idea , my wife took three hours to get to Milan , when that trip normally takes 40 minutes .
' ?  The game was played in Milan because Atalanta 's stadium in Bergamo did n't meet the requirements set by European soccer governing body UEFA .
Before the match , Valencia fans freely roamed around Milan and gathered at some of the city 's plazas , including the Piazza del Duomo , drinking and chanting team songs .
Looking back , the conditions for virus contagion were high , with thousands of people gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe was n't yet known - and then traveling back home .
Nearly 30 busloads of fans made the 60-kilometer ( 37-mile ) trip from Bergamo to Milan .
The evening before the match , there was no social distancing as officials from both clubs mingled and exchanged gifts and handshakes at a gala dinner offered by Atalanta .
Valencia defender Ezequiel Garay was the first Spanish league player to test positive for COVID-19 .
The team played a Spanish league game against Alav ? s about two weeks after the game in Milan , and later Alav ? s reported that 15 people in the club were infected , though it did not say the cases were directly related to the match against Valencia .
' ? Look at what 's happening in China , where players are testing positive for the coronavirus now - despite all the safety rules and precautions being taken , ' ? Tommasi told the AP , referring to a recent positive test for former Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini with Chinese club Shandong Lunen .
Fellaini 's positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in China , the virus has reportedly been receding there .
' ? It 's not going to be enough to just test the athletes , ' ? Tommasi added .
' ? The entire setting needs to be safe .
Because if one team is stuck , it blocks the entire system .
' ?  After winning the first leg , Atalanta advanced to the Champions League quarterfinals following another victory in the second leg on March 10 , which was played in an empty Mestalla Stadium in Valencia after Spanish authorities prohibited games involving teams from northern Italy to be played with fans .
A few thousand Valencia supporters gathered at the Mestalla to welcome the team , though , and to watch the match together in nearby bars and restaurants .
Over the past month , Atalanta has mourned the deaths of five former staff members .
While announcements on the club website made no mention of the virus , local media have reported that at least four of them died with COVID-19 .
Still , only one positive test from Atalanta has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to test their players unless they show symptoms , ' ? Tommasi said .
' ? Other squads tested everyone .
These are individual choices .
' ? The head of the civil protection agency has talked about the likelihood that for every proven positive case there are probably 10 actual positives .
' ? The high number of positives at Valencia makes you wonder .
' ?  With the Champions League suspended because of the pandemic , Atalanta has no idea when it might play in the quarterfinals - which again would be the club 's biggest game in its history .
In the meantime , both the Bergamo team and Valencia are left wondering about the unforeseen effects of their match in February .
