Calm amidst challenging times is often a key component of successful people , families , businesses and nations .
Annex Wealth Management President and CEO Dave Spano suggests mainly the same kind of approach with your investments through the current struggles of the stock and other investment market .
" Since 1900 , the stock market has had 32 bear markets .
Every time , it has come back .
no matter what the financial crisis , there will be another side .
We are going to get through this , and the stock market will be 33-0 at some point , " said Spano on WTMJ 's Steve Scaffidi Show .
" If you are investing for the long term , if you have a financial plan and you continue to invest , you will be rewarded down the road .
"  He says that some type of investments may be different than others in terms of possible tweaking to do with your investment portfolio , but a focus should be upon keeping balance within your long term plan .
" In 401k plans , it 's a little more difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for sure , rebalancing , " said Spano .
" You should n't get outside your risk tolerance .
If you have a plan , stick with your plan .
"  He also suggested possibly re-financing homes as an option , too .
" How can you not with these low rates ? " he asked .
" Rates are so low .
With the debt in this country .
the debt was $22 trillion , and it 's going to go up substantially with all the stimulus bills .
interest rates are likely to stay low for a long time .
"  But his final point was one on a much larger-scale : Keeping health as first priority .
" Let 's get through the public health issue .
The market will react to it .
