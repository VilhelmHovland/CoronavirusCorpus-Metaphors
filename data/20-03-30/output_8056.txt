People are going to die because some health experts are irresponsible and have misinterpreted a scientific article from 19 years ago .
I 'm not naming names , but these people are now posting very poor " advice " over the Internet .
Sadly , the misinformation is going as viral as the virus itself ! You can not and should not believe everything you read right online , even if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not everyone has the gift of accurately interpreting medical data .
That 's actually very hard to do .
Go onto the website PubMed and you 'll see what I mean .
Interpreting data requires a specific understanding of vitamins , enzymes , medications , genes , and metabolic pathways in your body .
I can read these things like a second language !  So , when I hear about a story going around about elderberries being bad for you , it peaked my curiosity .
Who would say that , and why ?  I 'm here to save the elderberry ! It has been documented to block viral attachment of certain types of coronaviruses to ACE 2 proteins/receptors .
These are in your lungs , and the deadly coronavirus latches on to these and attacks the lungs .
Follow me ? Elder is also well-documented to increase T helper cell counts .
You need those to fight back .
So , to hear from terrified people , who are now afraid of elderberry tea and herbs ( and supplements ) , because of nonsensical stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad !  elderberry ( Photo : GET-Creative )  Several bloggers and doctors are posting stories about how elderberries can increase a cytokine storm .
Again , this is not a fair statement .
The misinformation you 're getting was based upon a research article that evaluated blood cells in test tubes .
It was not a well-designed , placebo-controlled clinical trial .
It was not even done on real live people ( in vivo ) .
Writing today 's article is the only way I can disinfect the lies .
Elderberries are helpful , they have been with us for centuries ! But someone started a false claim that the precious herb would increase a cytokine storm and worsen your outcome .
Now that 's gotten posted to every social media site available ! Sad .
Irresponsible .
You see , there are good cytokines and bad ones .
Elderberry raises the good ones , COVID-19 raises the bad ones .
It does n't worsen any virus in my professional opinion .
I 'm pretty fired up about this ! I want to show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not printed in a journal that doctors commonly refer to like the Lancet , or NEJM .
It was posted online .
But regardless of the publication , allow me to go on .
Only 12 people were used who donated their blood ! A global pandemic with over 11,000 deaths on the planet .
We 're going to base our decision from data extracted from 12 test tubes ? !  I should stop right here but I 'll keep going .
The article is from 19 years ago ! I would n't necessarily rely on data from two decades ago to decide about my life today .
The researchers themselves concluded that elderberry , " reduced the duration of flu symptoms to 3-4 days .
"  The researchers also conclude that it " can activate the healthy immune system by increasing inflammatory cytokine production .
" They 're saying that in a good way , because you need anti-inflammatory cytokines in higher numbers to offset the pro-inflammatory ( bad ) cytokines .
They go on to say that elderberry , " .
could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer or AIDS patients , in conjunction with chemotherapeutic or other treatments .
"  I have a longer rant about this at my website suzycohen .
