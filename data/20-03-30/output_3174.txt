How prior trauma can affect the way you cope with the coronavirus crisis .
THE BASICS  A coping style is a typical manner of confronting a stressful situation and dealing with it .
There are various ways that people cope in times of crisis and there have been many studies about coping styles .
For example ( Endler 1997 ) postulated that there are three basic coping styles : task-oriented , emotion-oriented , and avoidance-oriented .
But there is another issue concerning coping styles that we do n't hear too much about .
This issue involves taking a closer look at how people who have a history of trauma react to a current crisis .
These individuals tend to fall on the extreme ends of a continuum .
The fact is , some of us seem to be at our strongest when facing a crisis , while others tend to fall apart .
The first type of person is the one who takes charge , the one who can be relied on to step up to organize things and take care of others .
Others tend to rely on this type of person for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall apart in a crisis .
They become immobilized or have a panic attack .
They often become so paralyzed in fear , become so numb , or become so dissociated that they have a difficult time taking action .
Because of this , they often rely on the strongest among us for stability and strength because they have a difficult time finding it in themselves .
Both types of people need to be appreciated and both need compassion -- from others and themselves .
The truth is , those who are seemingly the strong ones -- the leaders and caretakers -- often ignore their own needs and feelings and can also fall apart -- usually in the privacy of their own home .
And those who become immobilized in fear can also be strong if given the chance .
We are all both strong and weak , leaders and followers , caretakers and those who need to be cared for .
For example , those who were traumatized as a child or adolescent often suffer from PTSD .
PTSD is a severe anxiety disorder with characteristic symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
People who suffer from PTSD often relive the experience through nightmares and flashbacks , have difficulty sleeping , and feel detached and estranged , and these symptoms can be severe enough and last long enough to significantly impair the person 's daily life .
PTSD is marked by clear biological changes as well as psychological symptoms .
Those suffering from PTSD are often triggered by a current crisis .
To be triggered is to have an intense emotional or physical reaction , after encountering a trigger .
Triggers are anything that remind someone of a previous trauma .
The emotional reaction can be fear , sadness , pain , flashbacks , as well as any physical symptoms associated with these emotions ( shaking , fainting , fatigue ) .
More times than not , being triggered can cause an all-encompassing panic that spreads through their entire body .
Sometimes it goes away in seconds ; at other times , it lingers for weeks , making it difficult to function normally until their mind reaches equilibrium again .
While we tend to think about PTSD being characterized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency to deny , avoid or hide from our own feelings by focusing on the feelings and needs of others .
These people are so acclimated to trauma that they are seemingly impervious to pain .
They become the crisis managers , the rescuers , the comforters of others .
But as shut down as they are , it does n't mean they are n't suffering just like everyone else .
They often cope by excessive use of alcohol or drug consumption and they often fall apart once the crisis is over , often when no one else is around to comfort them .
On the other hand , those who fall apart in a crisis are often stronger than they think they are .
Yes , they have likely been triggered and may have a difficult time separating the present crisis from their past trauma .
Let them know that it is understandable that they would have such a reaction .
This kind of compassion can help more than you can imagine .
If they are not pushed and not judged , they can often regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing , and other mindfulness techniques ( see my current post on Psychology Today entitled " Coping With the Coronavirus With Mindfulness and Compassion .
" Once they are grounded and back into the present , they can often reconnect with their strength , sense of agency and competency .
When this occurs , do n't continue to treat them as if they are helpless .
In fact , assume they can take an active role in alleviating the stress of others since they are often far more empathetic and compassionate than the average person .
In this difficult time , we need to realize and remember the following :  We need to be aware that the way an individual reacts to stress or crisis is often based on their personal history , possibly a history of trauma .
We need to have compassion for people coming from either extreme .
We need to have compassion for those who seem to fall apart and become helpless by reminding ourselves that their reaction is " understandable " due to the trauma they experienced in the past .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invincible leader or caretaker .
Remember that no matter how " together " and invincible they appear to be , underneath all their strength lies a human with the same needs as everyone else .
Give them a hug , make them a comforting meal .
Tell them it is okay if they need to fall apart at times .
Tell them you appreciate their strength but that you want to be strong for them now .
Caretakers and crisis managers need to be encouraged to practice self-care and allow themselves to get in touch with their own feelings and needs .
When a person has been triggered it can be helpful to do any of the following : 1 ) do n't dismiss their feelings or reactions , 2 ) set aside your judgments about what you may consider to be " overreacting , " 3 ) let them talk through their panic , 4 ) if the person is okay with touch you can hug them , hold their hand , simply sit next to them , or let them cry on your shoulder , 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies ; doing puzzles or word games , etc .
as opposed to endlessly watching the news .
