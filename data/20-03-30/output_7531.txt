Coronavirus response highlights deepening partisan divide  Etters-area friends carpool it on a liquor run to Maryland .
Pennsylvania state-run spirits outlets are shuttered due to the Covid-19 virus outbreak .
They say it 's a 45-minute trip , one way .
York Dispatch  NEW YORK -- In Los Angeles , Mayor Eric Garcetti has instituted a shutdown on a city of nearly 4 million people and threatened uncooperative business owners with power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 3 million people , Gov .
Tate Reeves has allowed most businesses to stay open -- even restaurants , so long as they serve no more than 10 people at a time .
The divergent approaches are evidence that not even a global pandemic can bridge the gaping political divisions of the Trump era .
The fierce tribalism that has characterized debates over immigration , taxes and health care is now coloring policy-making during a coronavirus outbreak that threatens countless lives and local economies across nation .
There are exceptions , but Republican leaders have been far more likely to resist the most aggressive social distancing measures , emboldened by President Donald Trump 's initial rosy outlook and a smaller early caseload in their more rural communities across middle America .
But in the more crowded population centers on the East and West coasts where the disease first appeared , the Democrats in charge have been more willing to embrace strict steps such as curfews , sweeping business closures and law enforcement assistance .
" This epidemic has been a window into our politics , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kaiser Family Foundation , which has been tracking responses .
" Particularly over the past couple of weeks , a political divide has emerged .

In Los Angeles , Garcetti has instituted a shutdown on a city of nearly 4 million people and threatened uncooperative business owners with power shutoffs and arrest amid the new coronavirus pandemic .
( AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli , File ) ( Photo : Rich Pedroncelli / AP )  It is an election year divide that could have deadly consequences .
As his campaign struggles for attention , leading Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden has called for a nationwide lockdown to replace the patchwork of local responses , which have varied even among neighboring communities in the same states .
Trump , meanwhile , is largely allowing local officials to choose their own course and has encouraged them to compete for scant federal resources .
On Sunday , the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned the death toll could exceed 100,000 .
Politically , the strategy may be working for the first-term Republican president .
With the election just seven months away , Trump 's favorable ratings are ticking up , even if his numbers have fallen short of past presidents during times of crisis .
Yet the GOP 's loyalty will almost certainly be tested in the weeks ahead as the virus spreads from the blue-state coastal communities deeper into red-state middle America .
Democrats like Garcetti fear the politics that are shaping conflicting pandemic responses will have real-world consequences far more important than the next election .
" I do worry that making this a partisan issue will kill more people in redder states , " the Los Angeles mayor said in an interview .
" There is no way to keep this out of your city .

Pavoncello photo The York Dispatch  Interested in this topic ? You may also want to view these photo galleries :  In Mississippi , Reeves has adopted many social distancing measures such as limiting groups to 10 people , even if he 's resisted some of the most aggressive steps .
In an interview late last week , the Republican governor reiterated his opposition to a stay-at-home order , adding that he 's heeding the guidance of state health officials and Vice President Mike Pence himself , who told him directly during a recent conversation that the Trump administration is not recommending a blanket shutdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing enough as enemies of Trump who " do n't like the fact that I 'm a conservative and I 'm willing to pray .
"  He warned that extended social distancing orders could cause a more dangerous fallout than the pandemic by destroying the nation 's economy .
" I do n't think there 's any doubt that if the United States found themselves in a severe depression with 20% to 30% unemployment that the abject poverty that could create could lead to more health problems than this particular virus is causing , " Reeves said .
He added : " One size does n't fit all in this country .
"  No nation has more documented cases of the deadly virus than the United States , which surpassed 125,000 total infections and 2,200 related deaths over the weekend .
The partisan divide in infections and responses is difficult to ignore .
All 50 states have reported cases , but the seven with the most infections are led by Democrats .
New York may offer a cautionary tale for other states : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52,000 infections and 730 deaths in less than a month .
The bottom six states in total cases are rural states led by Republicans .
Numbers have been escalating virtually everywhere , however , particularly in more populous red states like Louisiana , Tennessee and Texas , which reported more than 7,200 cases and 175 deaths combined as of Sunday .
Fifteen of the 21 states that have issued statewide stay-at-home orders so far are led by Democratic governors , according to Kaiser .
The Republican-led holdouts include Florida , where Gov .
Ron DeSantis has so far agreed with Trump 's preference for a more incremental approach in the premier swing state , suggesting that restrictive measures be put in place only in the hardest-hit counties .
The GOP 's resistance was perhaps best explained in recent days by Texas Lt .
Dan Patrick , who told a Fox News audience that he would be willing to die if necessary to avoid severe social distancing measures that have essentially shut down local economies .
There are exceptions , of course .
Maryland Gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump over when normal life might resume .
And Ohio 's Republican governor , Mike DeWine , has been one of the most aggressive leaders in either party , banning spectators from sporting events the first week of March .
He was among the first governors in the nation to close public schools .
Aggressive steps by DeWine and others , however , have been complicated by Trump 's inconsistent rhetoric .
After repeatedly downplaying the threat at first , the Republican president adopted a more serious tone before suddenly suggesting last week that the worst could be over by Easter , which is April 12 .
He has now reversed that view , calling it an " aspiration , " with the extension of the social distancing guidelines .
Trump has also engaged in a war of words with Democratic governors in key states , where elected officials have openly complained about the lack of federal assistance to stem a dangerous shortage of coronavirus tests and medical equipment .
Late last week , Trump told Pence , " do n't call the woman in Michigan " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is considered a potential vice presidential pick for the ultimate Democratic nominee .
Trump dubbed her as " Gretchen ' Half ' Whitmer " on Twitter , claiming that she 's " way in over her head .
"  At the same time , the Trump administration began to contemplate a plan to encourage increased economic activity in areas where infections are low , which is largely in Republican-led states at the moment .
That , too , appeared to be sidelined by the president 's new view that fatalities could reach 100,000 or more .
" They have no right to tell me I need to stay in my house .
They can not impose a travel ban on me .
They can't .
it 's unconstitutional , " said Texas-based activist Mark Meckler , a co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots who now leads the Convention of States Project .
Meckler began conversations in recent days with other grassroots conservatives leaders to explore the possibility of filing lawsuits to block some of the more aggressive social distancing measures .
In the meantime , he 's encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not going along with it , " Meckler said .
" It does n't mean we wo n't be smart , but we do n't want to be sheep .
"  Meanwhile , the numbers are shooting up in California , which has reported more than 5,000 infections and 100 deaths .
Los Angeles Mayor Garcetti has assigned teams of city workers to ensure non-essential local businesses are complying with shut down orders .
He is empowered to shut off their water and power if necessary , and the California Democrat has authorized the police to arrest those who continue to resist .
Garcetti said there have been no shutoffs or arrests so far and predicts that " 99 out of 100 will comply .
"  He also offered a dire message to Republicans who have resisted similar steps : " In the projections , you could see this taking tens of thousands of lives in America or millions .
You chose .
But I do n't think anybody wants the second to be on their hands .
