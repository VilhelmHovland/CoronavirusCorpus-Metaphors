Social Navigation  REPORT : Multiple MLB Execs Believe Season Could Be Delayed Until Memorial Day or Later ( UPDATE : CDC Guidance )  Baseball is just one part of American life currently shut down in an effort to slow the spread of the Coronavirus -- Illinois and Ohio just announced that bars and restaurants will be carry-out only for a period of time , so the shut-downs just keep coming .
It seems that , by the hour , more and more aggressive efforts are being undertaken to " flatten the curve .
"  For that reason , what 's clear about the coming baseball schedule is that nothing is clear .
We know that the season is delayed to April 9 , but nobody actually expects baseball 's regular season to get underway anywhere close to that .
Too much is moving too quickly .
To that end , USA Today reports , via two anonymous MLB executives , that " There 's a real possibility the Major League Baseball season could be delayed until Memorial Day weekend -- or even longer .
"  Memorial Day is May 25 , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball until June .
I mean , the league has to have confidence , in advance of starting Spring Training Part Two , that the season can definitely open three or four weeks later .
That 's going to require picking a date pretty far down the road , in my view .
A shocking , painful reality is sinking in about this season .
A similar report from Jon Heyman :  The hoped-for April 9 MLB start date was always seen as a best-case scenario , and with developments over the past few days , based on talks with several execs today anytime before June would be viewed as welcome .
What a season that starts in June would even look like remains to be seen .
How do you deal with the length of the season ? Rosters ? Compensation ? The All-Star break ? The Trade Deadline ? The postseason ?  We 'll find out eventually .
The league is having a conference call tomorrow to discuss these issues , though I doubt we 'll hear any kind of hard-and-fast update .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In the meantime , you start to wonder whether it 's going to be possible for the Cubs and Cardinals to play their London Series in mid-June .
UPDATE : More on this soon , but this just announced CDC guidance all but assures there will be no regular season baseball until June :  It 's conceivable MLB could conduct Spring Training activities within that 8-week window ( see the third and fourth paragraphs in the guidance ) , but it would definitely be without fans .
And even in that case , getting to the regular season before June after the ramp-up period seems extraordinarily unlikely .
Buckle in , folks .
Sigh .
