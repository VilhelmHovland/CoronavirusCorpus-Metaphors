Sermons , Scripture readings and other liturgy read throughout the year are culminated on Resurrection Sunday , when Christians celebrate the biblical story of Jesus ' rise from death .
Churches big and small , spend months preparing for the day when their sanctuaries will see peak attendance as parishioners , decked in brightly colored suits and dresses , pack the pews .
Massive choirs practice songs of hope and inspiration , guest speakers are secured for sunrise services , Easter lilies honoring the deceased are prepped to be laid around altars , and children rehearse speeches that they 'll recite in front of family and friends .
This year , the hustle and bustle is missing in South Carolina .
While President Donald Trump previously said he wanted the country " opened up " by Easter , which falls on April 12 this year , though few health experts felt the date offered enough time to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus .
The president later backed off that hope , stating federal guidance urging social distance would remain through April 30 .
Several congregations had already suspended in-person gatherings through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting ready for grand celebrations , houses of worship are preparing for scaled-down Easter services that 'll be streamed online , featuring just a handful of musicians and a preacher .
Faith leaders are struggling to visualize Resurrection Sunday services minus the usual pageantry and , most importantly , the throngs of people .
Parishioners stand outside St .
Matthew 's Lutheran Church .
The church , which is usually packed with parishioners on Easter , will have an online presence this Resurrection Sunday .
File/Staff  Wade Spees  " Honestly , I am still trying to comprehend what that looks like , " said the Rev .
Eric Childers , pastor of St .
Matthew 's Lutheran in downtown Charleston .
Pastors and parishioners are trying to look on the bright side , saying they have an opportunity this year to be creative in worship and reach wider audiences .
The message of Jesus ' victory over death offers hope in these bleak circumstances , they said .
' A real special time '  " And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Corinthians 15:14  The significance of Easter to believers is hard to overstate .
Paul , one of the most influential leaders of early Christianity , notes in the New Testament how the entire faith hinges upon the single belief that Jesus Christ rose from death .
Without the Resurrection , there 's no Christianity .
Matthew 's spends all year preparing for the special Sunday , but , months out , the anticipation builds at the start of the Lent season , a six-week period of spiritual preparation .
During that period , the term " hallelujah , " which translates to " praise the Lord , " is n't uttered during services to offer a more somber tone that coincides with repentance .
To illustrate the idea , children write the word on pieces of paper and place them in the church 's " hallelujah box .
" It remains closed until Easter , when the box is reopened with a live animal inside .
Last year , the box revealed pigs .
One year , it was puppies .

For some individuals , the holiday marks moments of personal transformation .
The Rev .
George Crow , pastor of Northeast Presbyterian Church in Columbia , said it was a week or two before Easter when he recommitted to God while enrolled in the Air Force Academy in 1971 .
His passion for ministry grew when he later served in the Panama Canal Zone .
He 'd get up early each Easter at sunrise , a practice done by many congregations commemorating New Testament accounts of believers gathering at Jesus ' tomb " while it was still dark .
"  " It 's always been a real special time , " Crow said .
This year 's celebration will have a deeper meaning for Crow as he nears the end of his pastoral career .
He 'll step down in May as senior pastor , concluding a 40-year tenure at the church .
Instead of standing before a thousand worshippers in a packed sanctuary in his last Easter service as pastor , Crow will preach in front of a camera for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choir will be limited to just a few members .
They 'll sing as they keep space between each other , practicing social distancing .
Exiting pastoral ministry with a scaled-down version of his favorite Sunday worship service was not what he had in mind , Crow said .
" That 's not the way I wanted to end it , but I hope to be around for a number of Easters , " Crow said .
Family traditions will also likely be broken .
Each year , Mount Pleasant resident Cindy Ferrell hosts at her home an Easter dinner after church services at Seacoast .
Loved ones gather for food and fellowship , and children participate in an Easter egg hunt .
Those festivities wo n't happen this Resurrection Sunday if restrictions remain on in-person gatherings .
" I 'm really sad about that , " Ferrell said .
Ferrell , who has family members in the medical field , views this as an opportunity to help those on the front lines fighting the virus .
She thinks of her sister , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populated state has been hit hard by COVID-19 .
" We all have to band together right now , " Ferrell said .
" We have to think about others .

Email  " Behold , I will do a new thing " -- Isaiah 43:19  Within the past week , many pastors have been live-streaming sermons from their sanctuaries , giving parishioners some sense of regularity .
The Rev .
Charlie Murray Jr .
pastors First Baptist Church of James Island , where he offers high-energy sermons that engage in call-in-response .
But last Sunday , most of the pews in the sanctuary that seats 1,300 were empty , save for a few occupied by members of a small praise team .
Preaching without hearing the usual " amens " from the large congregation was a unique struggle .
The congregation , which consists of roughly 20 parishioners , will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures , said Pastor Debra Smalls-Gardner .
" That would be more feasible for our people , " she said .
Youth ministries remain vital in an age when small , traditional-style churches are seeking new ways to connect with children .
This Resurrection Sunday , Irving Chapel will have to forgo its children 's Easter egg hunt , which has historically been an opportunity for the tiny congregation to engage younger generations .
" That will be missed , " Smalls-Gardner said .
Some hope to have a grand , Easter-like celebration once the virus subsides and things get back to normal .
" When we do come back , we 're going to have one hell of a party for God , " Childers said .
Keeping the music  " Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord " -- Ephesians 5:19  A significant component of Easter worship is the music .
While sermons get the message across , lyrics telling the Resurrection story over sounds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and excitement .
Crow said the music is his favorite part of services .
It does n't matter what he preaches , it 's the music that people mostly remember , he said .
" I do n't know if anyone remembers what I say , but they leave inspired , " he said , giving accolades to Northeast Presbyterian 's orchestra .
This year , churches will replace large ensembles with praise teams of fewer than 10 persons .
Murray said , it 's likely the church wo n't have in-person worship for Easter , but he hopes to have an online sunrise service for those wanting a taste of normalcy .
While he wo n't have his usual massive choir this Resurrection Sunday , an organist , keyboardist , drummer and base guitarist will give parishioners a taste of their usual Sunday morning Lowcountry sounds .
Defeating death  When loved ones die , Christians find comfort not only in shared memories , but also in their faith of life after death .
But one does n't have to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Resurrection story is one of triumph and victory .
It 's a message that goodness can come from bad situations .
This year , as the coronavirus leaves many dead and thousands sick in its path , people can draw hope from the Easter story .
Hope that things will get better .
Hope that there 's light at the end of this dark tunnel .
