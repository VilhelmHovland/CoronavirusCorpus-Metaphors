Let 's do more than flatten the curve : Let 's get ahead of it  " Research confirms that doing good things for others bolsters our own mental health .
We can emerge from this stronger , and better , if we make sure our neighbours are n't just physically safe , but also mentally well .
"  There is a great irony at the heart of our swift and extraordinary public health response to COVID-19 .
Unprecedented measures are being taken to protect our collective physical health -- specifically among the most vulnerable among us .
So we 've got an obligation to come together , as a society , to mitigate the very real and dangerous side effects of our self-imposed isolation .
Seniors are not only at highest risk for developing life-threatening complications resulting from COVID-19 , they are also most likely to live alone .
People with compromised immune systems are more likely to experience anxiety .
Those living with severe mental illnesses are already more vulnerable to homelessness .
In a time when our world is being turned upside down , not only is the physical health of our most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in peril .
This global emergency has laid bare the reality that those of us who are economically privileged and able to work remotely , are also best-placed to promote and protect our mental health .
We can maintain continued social interaction through technology ; we do n't experience disruption to our pay schedule ; and , most crucially , we have the ability to keep our children ( if we have them ) safe at home .
We can order small diversions online and afford cable TV and subscription services .
That we 've been made uncomfortable is n't in dispute .
But our discomfort pales in comparison with those who were already living on the margins , surviving pay check-to-pay check , or relying on public shelters and soup kitchens .
It 's time , then , for those of us with vehicles , financial security and means to support others , to step up .
We need to use the time we 've gained back from our daily commute and the money we are n't spending on entertainment and restaurants to reinvest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government has enacted rapid and thoughtful relief , their critical economic measures ca n't replace life-affirming human connection .

In this time of physical distance , social solidarity has never been more important .
Many of us have closets full of clothes , yet we 're turning to the same comfortable sweater .
Rally your friends online and have them drop clothes on your porch to donate to a women 's shelter .
Do you have elderly neighbours ? Leave them a note on the door with your phone number , and ask them to put their grocery list in your mailbox .
Know a single mom trying to cope with kids and a tightened budget ? Order her a delivery of colouring books or a board game .
If your favourite restaurant is struggling to stay afloat , share a review and encourage friends to order takeout .
This is also a great time to clear out clutter .
Get ahead of spring-cleaning and call local charities to see what items they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others bolsters our own mental health .
We can emerge from this stronger , and better , if we make sure our neighbours are n't just physically safe , but also mentally well .
Let 's do more than flatten the curve .
Together , we can get ahead of it .
