As corporate India tries to find its feet within the new normal that is emerging , it is clear that our securities markets will continue to battle old problems , now clothed in new garb  In India , insider trading is a strict liability offence and regulated in terms of the SEBI ( Prohibition of Insider Trading ) Regulations 2015  In assuming a social , political and economic dimension that is unparalleled in modern history , the dreaded Covid-19 has also spun many cautionary tales in its journey across the world , making pitstops at economic power players such as China , UK , USA and India .
One of its obvious impacts has been on global securities markets .
Whether it is the Dow or the S&amp;P 500 , or closer home , the NIFTY and SENSEX , indices and markets across the world have taken a massive beating .
In India particularly , the impact of trade-wars , crude oil prices , liquidity problems , bank frauds and weakening rupee all imploded into the stock markets with the arrival of Covid-19 , sending our stocks in a volatile frenzy .
Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw precipitous falls as well as trading halts at both of India 's largest exchanges , on account of lower circuit triggers .
However , like clouds and their silver linings , such turbulent times also pose a lucrative opportunity for traders , especially those with insights into the impact of the prevailing state of affairs on listed companies .
Information about key performance metrics , such as financial projections , business disruptions , material contracts , governance responses , etc .
, allow a party to foresee underperformances , anticipate unexpected benefits and hence plan their trading and make allocation decisions more efficiently .
But when such information is not generally available to the market at large , the asymmetry allows for profiteering ( or avoidance of loss ) that can be penalised under the law in the form of " insider trading " .
Insider trading is a species of fraud and traditionally has been viewed as a crime of " misappropriation " , where fiduciaries of the company such as directors , CFOs and other persons in key management roles breach the duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from non-public information .
However , in such unprecedented times , insider trades may not be limited to traditional company insiders alone .
For instance , the US , arguably the jurisprudential fount of insider trading laws as we know them today , has been rattled by recent news about senators trading in stocks on inside information about the Covid-19 pandemic .
It has been alleged ( and extensively reported ) that members of the US Senate sold a significant portion of their holdings in advance of the market crash , as well as purchased shares , based on non-public information , gleaned from confidential congressional briefings about a growing public health crisis .
It is important to mention here that , unique to the USA , members of its Congress are governed by a special legislation , the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act , 2012 , which prohibits elected officials from using information received in their public roles , for private profit .
On March 25 , 2020 , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) issued a resounding and comprehensive guidance note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as for persons to refrain from trading prior to the dissemination of any such material information .
This was timely and served dual purposes - an advisory to disclose as well as a note of caution , reminding market participants of continued surveillance and vigilance by the US regulator .
In India , insider trading is a strict liability offence and regulated in terms of the SEBI ( Prohibition of Insider Trading ) Regulations 2015 .
Very stringently worded , these regulations prohibit selective communication of any unpublished price sensitive information and also penalise trading whilst in possession of the same .
The law is agnostic to the relationship of the individual with the company ; as long as the person trading has , or is reasonably expected to have , access to such data , he can be penalised .
SEBI also requires listed companies to formulate a code of conduct , put in place blackout periods , pre-clearance mechanisms and maintain processes that protect the integrity of their financial and other sensitive information .
In recent years , SEBI has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveillance of what is often a difficult transgression to clamp down on .
However , Covid-19 will undoubtedly pose unique challenges to our regulator on this front .
Although listed companies are required to make disclosures of material events , it will be a practical challenge to quantify or meaningfully articulate the potential impact of such a dynamic crisis on shareholders .
Since the pandemic itself and governmental responses to it are evolving rapidly , cogency of investor communication will naturally be impaired .
Consequently , the assessment of whether any information has actually assumed a certain " price sensitivity " or not , can never be a scientific one .
This poses somewhat of a Hobson ' choice to promoters , directors and other key actors within a corporate , when it comes to their personal trades in the company 's stock .
This problem is further compounded by the fact that submission of financial results has been extended to June 30th by SEBI , to assist with compliance burdens during Covid-19 , which means that trading window closures will be automatically extended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulator or case-by-case exceptions from the compliance officer itself .
Lastly , without key tools of the trade , such as phone tapping powers , SEBI will find it arduous to secure convincing evidentiary data , at a time when governmental lockdowns have enforced work from home protocols sine die , compromising on the conventional methods used by listed companies to protect their information .
Incidents of " accidental " tipping are bound to arise , since the work from home environment will naturally create headroom for information leakage and questionable employee conduct .
As corporate India tries to find its feet within the new normal that is emerging , it is clear that our securities markets will continue to battle old problems , now clothed in new garb .
It is therefore critical for both companies and regulators to formulate new solutions to address these unique concerns .
And for SEBI to also consider issuing proactive , detailed advisories that set the tone for expected market conduct .
