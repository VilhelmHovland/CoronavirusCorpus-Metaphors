Restrictions have been ramping up dramatically amidst the growing coronavirus outbreak , but there are still some out there who fail to get the memo !  Videos of Malaysians lazing around at restaurants , which were not supposed to allow patrons to dine-in , Malaysians taking evening strolls in parks , Malaysians making their way back to their hometowns or Malaysians simply being ignorant in light of COVID-19 is aplenty on social media .
And this one man is no exception .
Shared on Twitter , one man thought that he is above the law and began shooting a video of himself and a large group of people enjoying a feast in Langgar , Kedah .
" Quarantine kepala bapak dia quarantine ( Your father 's head la quarantine ) " were the words mentioned by the man shooting the video .
