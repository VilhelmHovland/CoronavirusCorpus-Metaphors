UNMC study gives more indication of airborne transmission of coronavirus  Amanda Bartling ( left ) and Sarah Trotter simulate how they process specimens to test for presence of COVID-19 at the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory in the Durham Research Center on the University of Nebraska Medical Center campus in Omaha on March 5 .
The initial phases of a joint study by the University of Nebraska Medical Center and others show new evidence that COVID-19 could be airborne , but perhaps not in the same way as other highly contagious illnesses such as measles .
The researchers , including those at Nebraska Medicine and the National Strategic Research Institute at the University of Nebraska , emphasized the study did not confirm the airborne spread , but rather identified genetic material from the virus in air samples that could show potential for that type of spread .
" More study is underway to determine if live culturable virus was captured in this study and additional evidence is needed to determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the airborne route , " the researchers said .
The samples of the study gathered from COVID-19 patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a method used to rapidly replicate the virus sample on commonly used surfaces and in the air of rooms of those patients .
Air samples from hallways outside of rooms where staff were moving in and out of doors were also positive .
The study suggests that COVID-19 patients , even those who are only mildly ill , may create aerosols of virus and contaminate surfaces that may pose a risk for transmission .
" Our findings show how important it is for health care workers providing direct care to these patients to take enhanced transmission precautions , " said John Lowe , vice chancellor for Inter-professional Health Security Training and Education .
" That means wearing the proper personal protective equipment , using negative air pressure rooms for these patients whenever possible and being mindful about the method of entering and exiting these rooms .
"  During the initial isolation of 13 people confirmed positive with COVID-19 infection , air and surface samples were collected in eleven isolation rooms to examine environmental contamination .
Many commonly used items , toilet facilities and air samples had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disseminated in the environment , researchers found .
The findings indicate that the disease might be spread through both droplets and person-to-person contact , as well as indirect contact with contaminated objects and airborne transmission with small droplets that may be able to travel distances .
It suggests airborne isolation precautions could be appropriate , the researchers said .
Mark Rupp , UNMC infectious disease expert , said if they find it 's just a few viral particles at a distance from a sick person , that might not be an important route for the transmission .
" So there 's a lot yet that we need to learn about , " Rupp said in a Facebook Live presentation on the study .
" But it is something that 's giving us pause and something that we 're again trying to be responsible with .
to provide for the safest care for these patients for our health care providers .
"  Rupp said he would n't promote the idea of everyone wearing masks , but reinforces the need for aggressive social distancing that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to person .
That means staying at home , keeping your distance , washing your hands , not touching your face .
Especially if someone in your house has signs of respiratory illness , make sure to clean the environment -- toilets , countertops , door knobs , other surfaces -- and separate the person into his or her own room and own bathroom if possible .
" We know this virus is very susceptible to low level disinfectants , so bleach solutions , alcohol , those types of disinfectants , " he said .
As the warmer months approach , people might want to open their windows and get fresh air into their environments and not have stagnant air in their rooms .
Joshua Santarpia , Ph .
, research director for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction at the National Strategic Research Institute , said ongoing work will continue to improve the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and help identify ways to improve safety in the care of patients with this disease .

As bad as the losses from major event cancellations are , economists say the economic damage they cause is likely to pale compared to the effects of the widespread closings of restaurants , retail stores and other businesses .
The public health lab 's supply of extraction kits , which pull genetic material from the samples swabbed from patients potentially infected with the disease to allow testing for the novel coronavirus ' presence , are running thin .
Another person from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who has tested positive for coronavirus is expected to arrive at Eppley Airfield late Tuesday night , bringing the number of patients being treated at UNMC to 15 .
A third person in Nebraska has died from the coronavirus , the state Department of Health and Human Services announced in a news release late Monday .
