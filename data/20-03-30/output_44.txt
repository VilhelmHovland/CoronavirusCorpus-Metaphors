No one is unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic .
As a result of everything from government-mandated isolation to rampant unemployment , our lives look a lot different today than they did even a month ago .
Unfortunately , there are plenty of people out there ready to prey on the resulting fear and confusion .
Twitch user " Kitboga , " who is known for trolling telemarketers over livestream , recently made headlines for putting the spotlight on coronavirus scammers .
He 's uncovered everything from fake articles about coronavirus vaccines to companies hocking essential oils they promise will cure the virus .
" I 'm not a psychologist , but I imagine you are less likely to make rational decisions when you 're afraid , " he told Wired .
" Obviously there 's lots of fear right now .
We already are in that situation .
So the scammers are one step ahead .
"  Though Kitboga 's on-camera trolling bit is largely for entertainment , it brings to light a concerning trend that 's sprouted from the pandemonium surrounding COVID-19 .
Here 's a closer look at the various coronavirus scams out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Coronavirus Stimulus Check Scams  You 've likely heard about the highly anticipated coronavirus stimulus package that was recently passed , which could put some money in your pocket in the coming weeks if your earnings fall below a certain threshold .
Since so many Americans are expecting relief , it provides a prime opportunity for scammers to strike .
" The U .
government wo n't be calling people individually to ask them to verify their bank account details , " warned Nathan Hamilton , a personal finance expert and industry analyst at The Ascent .
He said if someone does call ( or text ) you regarding the stimulus , assume it 's a scam .
" If you used direct deposit on your last tax return , your stimulus payment will be sent directly to that bank account .
Otherwise , you 'll receive a check in the mail at the address you used for your last tax return .
"  In addition to direct payments , the stimulus package includes beefed-up unemployment benefits .
If you plan to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wo n't be approached first .
" Scammers may start contacting people out of the blue , offering relief payments , " Hamilton said .
" If you get a call like that , do not give out your bank account details or Social Security number .

Medicare Scams  Sara Hornick , a financial adviser with Hudson Wealth Management , says many of her clients are seniors , who tend to be targets of all types of scams .
In light of the pandemic , she 's seen a couple of new scams making the rounds .
For example , criminals are calling older Americans to offer a supposed coronavirus vaccine or preventive medicine that 's covered by Medicare .
" All that a recipient needs to do is provide credit card information to pay for a co-pay or shipping , and the medicine will be delivered , saving them from the pandemic , " Hornick said .
" Other times , these scammers will say that the recipient 's Medicare Supplement or Advantage plan will cover this medicine , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bank account information .
" That information is then used to commit identity theft .
Unfortunately , there is currently no coronavirus treatment or vaccine ? if there were , we would n't be facing a national crisis right now .
" Medicare itself is not providing anything , " Hornick said .
" All of your care should be coordinated through your doctor .
" She noted that there are local agencies that call and can be of service to folks 65 and older , but they will identify themselves as being from that particular agency .
And they will never ask for a Social Security number or bank account information .
Email Scams  The internet is a breeding ground for fraud , and email is one area where it 's easy to get duped .
" Cybercriminals love emergencies and times of uncertainty because people are scared , distracted and vulnerable -- making them ideal targets , " said Tim Sadler , CEO and co-founder of email security firm Tessian .
One email scam to watch out for is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFO .
They might send a message asking for personal details or financial information under the guise that your assistance is needed .
" I urge people to contact the person who requested you to do something via an internal channel like Slack or an SMS to confirm it was them , " Sadler said .
Similarly , as more companies transition to working remotely , hackers may pose as popular web conferencing applications and trick staff into clicking links that will " activate their web conferencing accounts .
"  " Be less trusting of any email asking you to take an action , " Sadler said .
" Look beyond the branding of the email or the display name and examine the full email address of the sender , and any URL , carefully .
"  Scammers are also impersonating trusted institutions such as the World Health Organization , insurance companies , and banks .
" These attacks might ask you to confirm personal details , which can be used to try and access your legitimate accounts , " Sadler said .
" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and ' confirm you are safe ' or ' confirm you have n't travelled to recent affected COVID-19 countries .
' "  Sadler recommended that if you think anything is unusual about an email , do n't click any links .
Instead , search for the institution online and find a support contact number to call and ask for verification that the communication is valid .
" As more companies transition to working remotely , hackers may pose as popular web conferencing applications and trick staff into clicking links that will ' activate their web conferencing accounts .

Fake Coronavirus Website Scams  As the coronavirus spreads and new information comes to light about detecting and treating it , people around the world turn to the web to keep up to date .
" Unfortunately , the combination of fear , confusion and the lack of factual information in some countries serve as fertile ground for cyberattacks , " said Salvatore Stolfo , a Columbia University professor and researcher and the chief technology officer of Allure Security .
Stolfo explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words ' corona ' or ' covid , ' many of which falsely claim to be data repositories for information about the virus , or to sell face masks , vaccines ( which do n't exist , yet ) and home tests that can detect COVID-19 .
In fact , analysis by Check Point Software , a global cybersecurity firm , found that over 16,000 new coronavirus-related domains have been registered since early January 2020 .
Additionally , coronavirus-related domains are 50% more likely to be malicious than other domains registered during that same period .
It 's important to be mindful of what sites you visit and share information with , Stolfo said .
Stick with trusted sources of information , and be wary of buying supplies from sites you 've never heard of that offer inventory no other legitimate sites do .
Investment Scams  After the stock market plummeted earlier this month , millions of Americans saw their portfolios sink along with it .
While many have understandably panicked over the situation , other investors see it as an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an alert to warn of investment schemes that could pitch products and services that will be used to control or stop the coronavirus outbreak .
" The SEC noted that there have been a number of internet promotions claiming that products and services of publicly traded companies can prevent , detect or cure coronavirus , and the value of the stock of these companies will increase dramatically as a result , " said William M .
Welch II , deputy counsel and chief compliance and ethics officer for Voya Financial .
" Individuals and companies should be wary of these types of promotions and understand that there is substantial potential for fraud .
"  Not to mention , many of these " hot " buys are based on speculation , and may not pan out in the end .
" Be less trusting of any email asking you to take action .
Look beyond the branding of the email or the display name and examine the full email address of the sender , and any URL , carefully .
" -- Tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Debt Scams  Debt scams are nothing new , but with individuals struggling to pay their bills as a result of businesses shutting down , scammers have even more opportunity to prey on the most vulnerable people .
" Some consumers may be in a financial position they 've never been in before and may not have the knowledge of how to spot a debt scam , " said Leslie Tayne , a debt resolution attorney and author of the book " Life &amp; Debt : A Fresh Approach to Achieving Financial Wellness .
"  For example , scammers often use enticing language claiming that they can help you settle your debt for a certain amount or within a defined time period .
" Because every situation is different , reputable debt relief companies can not put such specific parameters on debt relief , " Tayne said .
" If an offer sounds too specific or too good to be true , it probably is .
"  Keep an eye out for debt relief companies that use a P .
box instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or charge you up-front .
Those are all signs of a scam .
Coronavirus Tax Scams  The federal tax deadline was pushed back to July 15 to give people dealing with coronavirus fallout more time to prepare , which means criminals have even more time to enact their scams .
" Tax scammers may file a return in your name or contact you claiming to be the IRS , " Tayne said .
However , it 's important to know that the IRS will never contact you by phone before they 've sent you multiple written notices regarding your taxes .
" Even if you receive information by mail that contains identifying information , be wary that it may not be verified , " Tayne said .
" If you have any questions about tax returns filed in your name or mail you received claiming to be from the IRS , call your local IRS office directly for verification .
