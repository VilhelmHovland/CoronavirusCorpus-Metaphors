The number of COVID-19 cases in the Kingston area has doubled over the past weekend from 17 on Friday to 34 .
Two of those cases are health-care workers from Providence Care Hospital .
According to Kingston , Frontenac and Lennox and Addington Public Health , half of the new cases have been caused by community spread , while the other half consists of people who have returned home after travelling abroad .
" About 50 per cent continue to be returning travellers , which is what we expected , " Dr .
Kieran Moore , Kingston 's medical officer of health , said .
" But now we are seeing some ( people who were in contact with infected individuals ) from earlier on come down with the infection .
We are following up with all of these cases and make sure their contacts are aggressively tested .
"  Out of those 34 , only one man is currently in hospital receiving supplemental oxygen .
He was transported there from the primary assessment centre and is in stable condition .
He is the second person to be admitted to the hospital because of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The two Providence Care Hospital workers did not go in to work once they developed symptoms .
" We have all the necessary precautions in place , and I feel confident in our ability to respond appropriately to limit the spread of infection .
"  The phrase " flatten the curve " has emerged as the motto for all of the efforts underway to try to slow the spread of the virus .
What it actually refers to is trying to stop the number of infections from growing exponentially and overwhelming the health-care system as it has in countries such as Italy .
" It 's a highly infectious agent .
It wants to go from one person to three , and from those three to nine , to 27 and onwards , " Moore explained .
Even though the number of cases has doubled in just a few days , Moore said COVID-19 infections in Kingston are not growing exponentially or out of control at the moment .
Most of the new community-spread cases from over the weekend were people who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public health has been aggressively testing such people , and that is why so many were discovered in such a short amount of time , not because the virus is freely moving through the community , Moore said .
" We are seeing small pockets where families are getting infected and friends of families are getting infected .
Our staff is working seven days a week contacting these individuals , tracking them down , doing that public health detective work , to slow down the spread through our community , " he said .
" We knew that many of these individuals were at risk , and we were waiting during their 14 days to see if they would come down with symptoms , and some have .
They have been isolating at home and , in my professional opinion , they have n't been a threat to the community .
" We have only seen one or two cases out of those 34 that were unexpected .
