Self-isolating alone ? Here 's six of the loneliest movies ever to watch by yourself  When you 're self-isolating all by yourself you might think you 're as lonely as humanly possible - but these films prove you could have it worse .
As New Zealand endures the COVID-19 alert level 4 lockdown , many Kiwis are getting into binge-watching .
But what should you watch ? Newshub is here to help .
We 're bringing you streaming guides with advice on what to watch and where to watch it .
In this edition , I 've put together six of the loneliest movies ever to watch and relate to while self-isolating .

No one should ever be that lame .
But Tom Hanks is so endearing , even that dorky move is loveable in this tale of him stuck on a deserted island .
It 's spawned dozens of memes and if you light a fire while self-isolating , you 're 100 percent going to be acting out the fire-lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Hanks ever and in my personal top five of his along with Big , Saving Private Ryan , Bachelor Party and Philadelphia .
Where to stream:Netflix , Amazon Prime Video  Photo credit : XYZ Films  Arctic  Self-isolating at home is hard enough , but at least many of us have electricity .
And the internet .
And a bed .
And food .
Pretty much everything we need to not only survive but to do so in luxurious comfort .
That 's not the case for Mads Mikkelson in this 2018 survival drama that starts with him living in a plane wreck in the Arctic , hoping for a rescue .
It 's a solid watch , especially for the ingenuity and resourcefulness shown by the protagonist .
Oh , and do n't get Arctic confused with Polar , a different Mads Mikkelson film that came out some months later .
Where to stream:Neon  Photo credit : Warner Bros  Gravity  Being all alone in your home is one thing - but being all alone in space is infinitely worse .
My personal favourite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 masterpiece .
It follows Sandra Bullock as her space shuttle gets destroyed in orbit and she 's forced to fight her way back to Earth .
It 's a testament to the magic and power of modern visual effects , helped enormously by a stellar lead performance .
She goes through some extremely intense stuff to save just herself .
Meanwhile , all we have to do to help save thousands is simply chill at home for a month or so .
to stream : Hire from Google / Apple / Microsoft  Photo credit : FilmNation Entertainment  All is Lost  A lot of people seem to have overlooked this 2014 movie that features an almost entirely wordless Robert Redford battling the elements on a boat lost at sea .
It 's not the screen legend 's best ever work , but well worth a watch .
Like all of these lone survivor movies , the problems the main character faces and how he overcomes them really put into perspective my current lockdown problems .
I gave up on baking a cake without flour way quicker than Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh water in All is Lost .
to stream : Hire from Apple / Microsoft  Photo credit : Fox Searchlight Pictures  127 Hours  Being trapped at home sucks , but being trapped between two massive rocks in a canyon is way worse .
And no matter what the COVID-19 alert level 4 lockdown inflicts on us all mentally , nobody 's about to cut their own arm off to get through it .
I hope .
This Danny Boyle film stars James Franco as Aron Ralston , an American canyoneer who literally hacked off his own arm to survive .
In real life .
This got loads of awards buzz including six Oscar nominations for good reason - it 's a fantastic watch .
to stream:Hire from Google / Apple / Microsoft  Photo credit : Sony Pictures Classics  Moon  Another lone protagonist in space flick that works well with Gravity , but this one is more classic science-fiction than survival drama .
It 's still super lonely though .
It 's the very smart debut feature from Duncan Jones and remains his best film yet .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a three-year mining contract on the moon .
He 's looking forward to ending his self-isolation and heading back to Earth to catch up with all his loved ones , but then mysterious , spooky stuff starts to happen .
To say any more would be to spoil .
