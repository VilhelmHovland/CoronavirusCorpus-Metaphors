" We 're continuing to look at numbers .
As folks have seen , we 've had spikes .
We 've had a lot of growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Houston and so I 'll be making a determination tomorrow .
I 've been in contact with the different stakeholders with Mayor Turner and other mayors and the reality of it is , the question is not whether we 'll be extending the order .
It 's really a question of for how long we 'll be extending the order for , and this is really difficult .
You know it 's a difficult position we 're all a part of .
"  She also said Harris County is giving a 3-month extension to all delinquent property taxes .
Taxes wo n't be due until June , which is also when the penalty and interest will be due .

" We hope this will be a useful tool for folks , " said Hidalgo .
" The goal behind the dashboard is transparency .
