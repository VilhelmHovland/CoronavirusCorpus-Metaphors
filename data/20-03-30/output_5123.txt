Saeed Naqvi : Shaheen Bagh stir recast in tune with the Covid times  Guided by common sense , the women of Shaheen Bagh have been extraordinarily focused on the Constitution  A policeman pulls the remains of an anti new citizenship law banner as local authorities clear the protest site of Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi on March 24 , 2020 .
( AP )  A pity that television cameras were not on to record the elegance with which the protesters at Shaheen Bagh pulled the reins , paused and recast their movement to harmonise with the requirements of public health in view of the pandemic and the rule of law , in order not to be foul of Section 144 and the curfew .
The banners , graffiti and flags are now on the walls and balconies facing the protest site .
Even the wayside library that had sprouted nearby has moved to a balcony .
The Shaheen Bagh protests against the CAA had , in any case , transformed themselves into a nationwide debate on the Idea of India .
The latest to grapple on that theme have been two senior members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on recently .
Deb Mukharji , of the 1964 batch , a former high commissioner to Bangladesh , in an article in a leading newspaper , applies the image of the falcon , which is what Shaheen means , to the Shaheen Bagh movement .
The bird that soared -- is his preferred simile .
This invites a riposte from Kanwal Sibal , 1966 batch , and a former foreign secretary .
" Incidentally , falcons are predators , " says Sibal 's riposte on the IFS blog .
So unabashed is he on the secularism-nationalism debate that Mukharji feels constrained to challenge him , rapier in hand , on the very same blog .
What should a discerning non-Hindu 's stance be towards conversations of this nature which are taking place at numerous levels with a frequency gathering in momentum ? First , consider the evidence .
Justice S Muralidhar of the Delhi High Court is transferred within hours of his criticising the Delhi police over continuous violence for three days , its failure to register FIRs against hate speeches by the BJP 's Kapil Mishra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farewell to him by Delhi 's lawyers shows record attendance , with men and women in black gowns leaning over the railings .
The optics proved who won .
UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath 's government plasters city walls in Lucknow with poster-size photographs of activists in the anti-CAA protests .
The Yogi is determined to " name and shame " the protesters .
The entire operation is on the basis of allegations -- no proof .
The chief justice of the Allahabad High Court , Govind Mathur , takes suo motu notice of the outrage and raps the UP government on the knuckles .
The intra-Hindu tussle is at its fiercest in UP .
Little wonder then that retired High Court judge Rakesh Sharma brings out his arsenal and takes aim at the sitting chief justice .
" The competent revenue authority collector DM Lucknow has several powers , including coercive action of attachment sale of property .
"  As I have always maintained , in this orchestra the first violin was played in 1947 .
That musical score is now approaching the loud clashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler 's favourite composer .
The Mukharji-Sibal exchange is a summing up of the epic debate which has the nation in thrall .
Since both are eloquent on their respective positions , let them speak .
Mukharji sees three distinct takeaways from Shaheen Bagh .
" First , the Muslims as a community have emerged from a state of withdrawal and firmly demanded their rights as citizens of India , without seeking any crutches of political support .
" Second , Muslim women have liberated themselves from the taboos that kept them confined to their homes in large parts of India .
Veiled women have been able to look their interlocutor in the eye and firmly claim that neither ' mard ' nor ' maulvi ' would stand in the way of their demanding a just future .
Whatever the eventual political outcome of their demands , the liberation of the spirit of the community , and its women in particular , is here to stay .
" Third , the women of Shaheen Bagh have reclaimed what others had ceded to an aggressive nationalism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national anthem .
And the nation has been reminded that the ultimate guarantor of our freedom is the Constitution of India .
"  Enter Kanwal Sibal .
Sambit Patra on the Arnab Goswami show could not have been better .
" You have completely overlooked the hatred and poison injected into the people by the so-called tukde tukde gang , the adulation of terrorists , Owaisi 's rants , those of the leader of the Bhim Sena , recent statements about emulating Shaheen Bagh and cutting off our Northeast by Muslims who form a majority in the Chicken 's Neck area , the attempt to block the Jaffrabad Metro area in the light of the seeming success of the Shaheen Bagh that you extol , and , of course , Mamata Banerjee 's ravings .
"  Mukharji is determined not to let this go unchallenged .
" I am disturbed by your comment about cutting off our Northeast by Muslims who form a majority in the Chicken 's Neck area .
" Having been posted in Bangladesh , Mr Mukharji knows the vulnerability of Chicken 's Neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Muslim connection ? "  On Sibal 's tukde-tukde swipe , he is hard-hitting .
" When approached under RTI , the home ministry said they had no knowledge of any such entity .
" He agrees with Sibal that India is not yet a fascist state , " but I think we are showing disturbing signs of a pre-fascist one " .
This war within has had its share of martyrs too -- rationalists like M .
Kalburgi , Narendra Dabholkar , Govind Pansare and Gauri Lankesh , to name just a few .
Participation in this epic Kurukshetra by Muslims like the personal law boards have in the past helped exactly the forces which menace the nation today .
Keep an equal distance from the Hindu , who by himself is better situated to let a hundred flowers bloom .
Even more important is to keep the venerable maulanas away , busy with matters of faith .
Emulate the women of Shaheen Bagh who , guided by an intuitive and robust common sense , have been extraordinarily focused on the Constitution , the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorting itself out .
