Irrespective of religion , all Mumbai Covid-19 victims to be cremated  In a significant order , MCGM Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi decreed that the dead bodies of all Covid-19 victims must be cremated at the nearest crematorium irrespective of the religion to which they belong .
Mumbai : Not willing to risk infections even after death , the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai on Monday decided to compulsorily cremate all victims of COVID-19 irrespective of their religion .
In a significant order , MCGM Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi decreed that the dead bodies of all Covid-19 victims must be cremated at the nearest crematorium irrespective of the religion to which they belong .
He justified the move saying a religious community leader had brought to his notice that burial grounds for Muslim or Christians are located in densely populated localities of Mumbai , posing a high risk of contamination to their surrounding community or residential areas .
Pardeshi also said that any rituals involving the touching of the body are barred and not more than five persons shall be permitted to attend any such funeral .
The MCGM has further banned the procedure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burying it in a cemetery on the grounds that it would prevent early decomposition and the risk of the future spread of coronavirus would continue .
However , the MCGM said that for those who insist on holding the burial practice would be allowed provided they take the body out of Mumbai limits for the funeral rituals .
For this , they would have to make all arrangements including transportation and follow the relevant guidelines/precautions for the disposal of Covid-19 victims , he said .
The person concerned would be fully responsible for his actions and those found flouting the directives would be liable for penal action , said the MCGM chief .
