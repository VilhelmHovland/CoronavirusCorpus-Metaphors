During Thursday 's episode of the ABC medical drama , titled " Love of My Life , " fans witnessed Maggie Pierce ( Kelly McCreary ) take on a new relationship , saw Richard Webber ( James Pickens Jr .
) experience a terrifying turn of events , and got an inside look at Teddy Altman 's ( Kim Raver ) shocking past -- including her relationship with the love of her life , a woman named Allison .
Teddy -- along with Maggie and Dr .
Hayes ( Richard Flood ) -- ventured to Los Angeles to attend the L .
Surgical Innovation Conference and ran into some old friends along the way .
After Teddy , who is engaged to Owen Hunt but having an affair with ex-boyfriend Tom Koracick , bumped into her old roommate Claire , the two caught up and began reminiscing about that one special person in both of their lives -- Allison .
Between flashbacks , fans quickly learned that Teddy and Allison ( who was Claire 's girlfriend at the time ) were madly in love with each other and carrying on an affair , right under Claire 's nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past that we do n't know , " Raver , 51 , exclusively tells PEOPLE .
" set it up so well with those flashbacks in Iraq and with Megan and I wanted to know more about her .
They came up with the storyline with Allison , which blew my mind .
It was like that moment , oh my God , yes of course this makes so much sense .
"  " Love is very real , " she adds .
" It 's very complicated .
It 's very messy .
It 's very scary .
What Teddy 's doing right now with the whole affair , I get that that 's really upsetting to fans .
I think what 's interesting about it is it 's helping us understand the complexity of love and self love and so I feel like it 's really beautiful to see .
"  While Teddy is still trying to figure out her personal life , Raver says she 's proud of who her character is and what she stands for .
" I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love .
I just know that she loves who that person is and was .
I just thought that was such an amazing move .
"  " I think there 's going to have to be a lot of recovery in a way , " Raver explains .
" I do n't think it gets wrapped up right away .
I think there are a few explosions .
What is it going to be like ? What is the recovery going to be ? Who is she going to end up with ? What does that mean in the interim ? "  During the episode , an apologetic Teddy admitted to Claire that she was wrong in hiding that part of her life .
" I met the father of my daughter in Afghanistan after Allison died ( on 9/11 ) and he saved me from a grief so huge that I probably would 've let it kill me , " Teddy told Claire .
" For years , I loved him so much I felt guilty for loving him half as much as I loved Allison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty because maybe I was n't capable of letting someone love me fully .
And Allison did love me , yes .
But she loved you too , Claire .
Allison was in love with the both of us .
At the time , I did n't believe it .
I thought no one could love more than one person at once .
I thought love could n't be divided like that .
But now I do , I believe it .
And I 'm sorry for the lies , the betrayal .
I was a bad friend and I was selfish and I never , ever meant to hurt you .

He was then taken away on a gurney with Maggie by his side .
While it 's unknown what will happen with Richard , Raver says it 's " beautiful " the way his friends and family will support him .
