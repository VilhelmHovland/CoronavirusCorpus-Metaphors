The message today is very clear -- STAY HOME .
Most Virginia are complying , " doing the right thing , " " stepping up .
" But clearly , some people still need to hear the message about staying home .
Healthcare professionals are putting their lives at risk everyday .
But this weekend , some of our beaches and other recreational areas were literall packed .

Almost 1/2 of the COVID-19 cases in Virginia are under age 50 .
Every age group needs to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect public health .
Virginia has more than 1,000 confirmed COVID cases , and that number unfortunately will continue to rise .
What we 're seeing now is determined by how people acted two weeks ago .
Everyone needs to be patient with social distancing , as it will take time to social distancing .
Virginia 's hospital have 18,500 licensed beds , of which 2,000 ICU beds .
We know we will need more .
We are looking at several different models , each one shows different outcomes and timelines .
They all show Virginia having a surge in cases requiring hospitalization .
We have been trying to run ahead of that surge , make sure hospitals are ready , identify sites for temporary hospital facilities .
Army Corps is analyzing that .
Mary Washington has establshed a field hospital .
VCU has identified a student dormitory on campus .
In Wise County , Lonesome Pine Hospital has been designated as a COVID care facility .

We are at the beginning of a period of sacrifice .
This is an unprecedented and difficult time , which is why we need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly , and we will get through this together .
What 's changed since this past Friday ? Northam says he sees people congregating on the beach and completely ignoring what we 're doing .
They are being very , very selfish , putting our healthcare providers at risk .
The penalty for violating 10-person-or-less , stay-at-home orders continues to be the same as previously , very similar to neighboring states .
Restaurants still can only be open for takeout or delivery .
10 patrons or less , social distancing .
language in previous executive order remains in effect .
Having discussions about May municipal elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , so stay tuned .
Virginia still ca n't test everybody .
Problems mostly relate to supply-chain shortages throughout the nation , not just in Virginia .
Northam does NOT plan to treat different parts of Virginia differently , says the virus does not respect county lines .
Does the stay-at-home order impact golf courses .
Northam says one can go to the golf course and play , but clubhouses have to close .
Does Virginia track patients to the point of recovery ? That varies depending on capacity of local health department and other factors .
On expedited reviews and parole for vulnerable prisoners , Sec .
Brian Moran says that " they are doing a great deal with respect to review , " but by code , " we have no parole in the Commonwealth of Virginia .
" So there 's a limited population that can even be reviewed .
Also , victims need to be notified and given time to weigh in .
Already , the parole board has withdrawn warrants for technical violations on a number of people .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved for release , in order to minimize interaction between the parole officer and the parolee .
" Frankly , they 're getting a lot of healthcare *in* these facilities .
"  **37;118;TOOLONG  UPDATE 1:04 pm -- According to the RTD , " Virginia Gov .
Ralph Northam will order state residents to remain at home with some exceptions , as the state steps up its effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 , a source familiar with the order said .
Northam 's order will allow people to leave their homes to seek a wide array of essential services like medical attention , food , banking and more .
" That 's good news , as far as I 'm concerned , as nobody should be out there treating this like a vacation , having people over their houses for cookouts , going to the beach with a bunch of friends , etc .
Or , as one FB friend put it , " Since some people ca n't follow expert guidance like grownups .
"  *************  I 'll add video of the press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as highlights .
including what this " major announcement " turns out to be .
