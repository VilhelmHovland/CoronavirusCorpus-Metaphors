Coronavirus resources  The Bridgewater State University senior arrived in Cape Verde , the archipelago nation off the coast of West Africa , for spring break with two friends on March 5 .
They had a flight back to Boston on Monday .
But when they arrived at the airport in Praia , Cape Verde 's capital , they learned they would n't be leaving after all .
Their SATA Airlines flight had been canceled .
Two days later , the Cape Verdean prime minister announced a ban on all international travel to and from the islands .
The US Embassy in Praia has since closed .

" It 's like everyone is contradicting themselves .
You say we can go back , but how are we supposed to go home ? "  All over the world , thousands of Americans , like Tavares and her friends , are stranded as countries close their borders to mitigate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless flights back to the US only to see them canceled .
Meanwhile , they say their desperate pleas for help to the US State Department and its embassies have fallen on deaf ears .
In a White House press briefing Friday , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said : " We 're going to work to get people back .
We 're urging individuals , when they can get back on their own -- they traveled there on their own -- when they can get back there on their own , they ought to try to do that .
"  Americans stuck overseas say the message they have received from the federal government is more stark : Sorry , you 're on your own .
US Representative Jim McGovern , a Worcester Democrat , said Friday that his office has been working with multiple Americans trying to return home , including an elderly woman with health issues in Honduras , a married couple in El Salvador who have children waiting at home , and a group of Peace Corps volunteers in Ukraine who " were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGovern was one of 66 members of Congress who signed a letter sent Friday by Colorado Representative Joe Neguse to Pompeo voicing concern over what they say is the lack of federal support for Americans seeking to come home .
" The embassy should be coordinating whatever necessary arrangements need to be made to get these people safely back home -- period , " McGovern told the Globe in an interview .
" I do n't know why that has been such a challenge .
"  Earlier this week , US Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter that her office also has heard from Massachusetts residents overseas , and she supported efforts by Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who sent a separate letter to Pompeo on Wednesday urging him to provide more assistance .
In yet another letter to Pompeo on Tuesday , Senator Ed Markey , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who also signed that panel 's missive , called on the State Department to immediately form a worldwide task force " devoted to coordinating American Citizen Services ' response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix Bowen ( second from left ) attended a friend 's wedding in Casablanca on March 14 , then found out she could n't leave Morocco .
She finally secured a flight out on Friday afternoon .
Phoenix Bowen , who runs a production company and lives part-time in Boston 's Seaport District , traveled to Morocco for a friend 's wedding last Saturday , " knowing the risks .
"  When she went with friends to the Casablanca airport Tuesday to buy tickets , after her flight home was abruptly canceled , they found that no one was allowed inside the building unless they had a boarding pass for a flight leaving that night .
" We needed to reschedule .
but the airlines were n't taking calls , and they were n't replying to e-mails , so we could only do it at the airport , and we were being told that we could n't walk in , " said Bowen , who has a compromised immune system that makes her more susceptible to the virus .
Bowen , 25 , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London and then Boston , but before she left , she described a grim situation .
" People here are n't getting diagnosed .
There are no resources for that , " she said in a phone interview from Casablanca .
" They 're just staying indoors and are panicked over something that they do n't understand .
And they 're afraid of us .
They see Americans walking around , and they do n't want us coming into their shops .
"  Corie Welch , from Holden , is also worried about the increasingly dire conditions in Honduras , where she has lived for the past year and a half while working for a human rights nonprofit .
Welch , 25 , booked several flights that were all canceled after the Honduran government implemented more extreme lockdown measures .
Welch , who is in the city of El Progreso , near the Guatemalan border , has a seat on a flight that leaves this coming Tuesday but she fears that will be canceled , too .

" What we 've seen with this health crisis , it moves so quickly , so one day can really make a difference .
"  The crisis has also upended the life of Chris Knerr , an executive at the Needham-based software company Syniti .
He is trapped in Cusco , Peru , with his teenage children and his cousin .
From left : Chris Knerr and his children , Spencer Knerr and Chloe Knerr , and his cousin Jesse Carter are stranded in Cusco , Peru , where all travel in and out of the country has been suspended .
handout  Knerr , who lives in Princeton , N .
, arrived in Peru with his family on March 13 , hoping to hike the Inca Trail to the ruins of Machu Picchu .
Their plans were dashed last Sunday , when Peruvian President Mart ? n Vizcarra declared a state of emergency , canceling all flights in and out of the country and suspending domestic travel .

If they had caught the flight , it would have been a miracle : They 're staying at a hotel in Cusco , a 20-hour car ride from the Peruvian capital , with no way to get there now that the country has instituted a police-enforced lockdown .
But on Saturday morning , Knerr learned the Lima to Houston leg of the journey had been canceled .
Advertisement  Knerr has tried in vain to get help from the US Embassy in Lima , which has suspended all of its routine services : " I called them probably 50 times and I actually never got through myself , " he said .
As his and others ' pleas go unanswered , Knerr 's options for getting home are dimmer .
Now he may need to prepare for the worst .
" We may have to end up here indefinitely and ride out the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said .
" It seems ludicrous in retrospect , but a week ago , the world seemed like a different place .
"  On Saturday evening , Tavares received an email from the US Embassy in Praia , informing her that the Embassy finally had arranged for a chartered flight to bring Americans in Cape Verde to Boston next Tuesday at a cost of roughly $1,400 per person .
Tavares quickly snatched her ticket through Cabo Verde Airlines .
At that point , she 'd already spent about $1,500 on cancelled flights back to the US that the airlines have refused to refund .
" Officially have no more money in my account at all , " she told the Globe in a WhatsApp message Saturday .
" This is ridiculous , " she added .
