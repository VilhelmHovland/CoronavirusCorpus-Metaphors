As the government urges Indigenous people over 50 to stay home to avoid contracting Covid-19 , TV host Karla Grant has expressed distress at the risk the virus poses on Indigenous people , including her own mother .
The NITV presenter 's mum is Elizabeth Visser , a 75-year-old Arrernte woman residing at Sydney 's BaptistCare aged-care facility .
The nursing home has seen several diagnoses of the virus amongst residents and staff , with the number still rising .
Four deaths within the complex have left Grant and her family concerned for Visser 's life .
" If she were to get this virus that would be the end of her , " Grant told HuffPost Australia .
" She 's in a high-risk category ; she 's Indigenous , she 's elderly and she has a respiratory problem .
" She 's got a lot of things against her .
"  " It 's really sad , she 's 76 in a couple of weeks time and I do n't know if we 're going to be able to go in and see her at all .

In Monday 's special episode of Living Black , Grant investigates the outbreak of the virus and its impact on Indigenous communities and her own family .
Grant told HuffPost her mother 's survival depends on total isolation from outsiders , as well as having zero contact with her family who could be unwitting transmitters of the killer virus .
" She is doing well but the thing is , the whole place was put in lockdown last week , " she said .
" She can come out of her room and go to the dining area .
She ca n't leave the door of her complex Cooinda Court , she especially ca n't go to Dorothy Henderson where the cluster is .
"  Although Grant knows every consideration is being made to keep Visser safe , she said she is worried for her mum especially since " there 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people are highly vulnerable to Covid-19 due to comorbidities such as diabetes , blood pressure , and heart trouble .
NACCHO ( National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation ) is Australia 's peak Aboriginal health authority and has been imperative to convincing the government to lockdown Indigenous communities , with only essential services allowed under new biosecurity legislation .
Deputy CEO of NACCHO Dawn Casey said a Covid-19 outbreak in any Indigenous community would be " devastating .
"  " If you look at what happened in the 19th century with Native Americans and Inuits when the flu went through North America , which happened in Australia as well , it would be like that if it goes through communities , " she said .
Casey commended the government for listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and acting swiftly in restricting all travel to rural and remote communities but says there 's still a lot of work to be done .
" Because it 's so contagious and because of the comorbidity and people being in remote locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines - if it spreads in our communities , with the overcrowding , it 'll spread right through .
