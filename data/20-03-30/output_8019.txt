New York City Doubles Down On Social Distancing With Fines  Mar 30 , 2020 03:22 PM By Bob Fekete  One of the best ways everyone can help fight the spread of the coronavirus is to abide by social distancing standards .
This means that groups of people should no longer congregate , regardless of size or where the group is spending time .
In an effort to help enforce this , New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will start fining those who refuse to do their part .
This message came during a Sunday press conference held by de Blasio , as reported by Politico .
" You 've been warned and warned and warned again , " the mayor said during the press conference .
According to de Blasio , fines will typically range from $250 to $500 , but only for those who refuse to move or return after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're going to give people every chance to listen , and if anyone does n't listen , then they deserve a fine at this point , " de Blasio said .
" I do n't want to fine people when so many folks are going through economic distress , but if they have n't gotten the message by now , and they do n't get the message when an enforcement officer 's staring them in the face .
that person then deserves the fine , so we 're going to proceed with that .
"  It was also announced at the press conference that the New York MTA and New York City police will be monitoring subway cars to ensure proper distancing between riders .
Those that fail to comply will be removed from the train and made to wait for a less crowded train .
Additionally , the Staten Island Ferry 's schedule has been reduced , and now only one boat per hour will make the trip between Staten Island and the southern tip of Manhattan .
Politico reports that this service has seen a drastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway .
Fox 8 has reported that the New York City parks system will also try to do what it can to reduce crowds .
It was reported that tennis courts and soccer fields will begin removing nets to encourage people to stay home , and basketball hoops around the city are being removed .
