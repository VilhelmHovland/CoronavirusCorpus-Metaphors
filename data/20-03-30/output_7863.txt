Question of the Day  Should members of Congress be allowed to vote remotely ?  Story TOpics  MILWAUKEE ( AP ) - The coronavirus has delivered a severe blow to Wisconsin dairy farmers who rely on selling milk to restaurants , schools and the hospitality industry .
About one-third of Wisconsin dairy products , mainly cheese , are sold in the food service trade , the Journal Sentinel reported .
" The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring , right when we need money to buy supplies for the spring planting season , " said dairy farmer John Rettler of Neosho , president of FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison .
Dairy farmers are concerned about processing plants shuttering or slashing production since their product is perishable .
Baraboo cooperative , Foremost Farms , recently asked its members in a letter to brace for scenarios that may include dumping milk or scaling down the amount they produce , noting " the extreme nature of the coronavirus situation and the impact on the economy .
"  Farmers ' milk prices gradually returned to profitable levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 820 Wisconsin dairy producers quit in 2019 alone , a rate of more than two per day .
But Rettler said that optimism has faded due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
" Now , farmers are simply looking for ways to ensure their milk continues to get picked up in the coming weeks as the situation continues to play out , " he added .
For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .
President Donald Trump on Friday signed an unprecedented $2 trillion economic stimulus package that comprised of $14 billion for supporting farm income and crop prices and $9 .

Darin Von Ruden , a dairy farmer from Westby and president of the trade group Wisconsin Farmers Union , still believes the stimulus package may help their businesses stay afloat .
" Markets are evaporating as restaurants and schools shutter and exports stall , " Ruden said .
" Farm labor is in short supply with borders closing and falling commodity prices are decimating farm income .
Without this important support , many farms wo n't be able to last the summer .
