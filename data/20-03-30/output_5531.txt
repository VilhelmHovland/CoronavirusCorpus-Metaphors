How the Lockdown Drove a Workforce on the Margins to Further Alienation  An incisive report highlights how a substantial workforce of 139 million internal migrant workers , invisible to the system , has been the hardest hit post-lockdown .
Further , it lists the urgent measures needed to ensure a safe and dignified existence for migrant communities .
In the first few days of the nationwide lockdown imposed in India to deal with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic , there was one recurring image that burst through the television screens in all its starkness -- an unending procession of migrant workers deprived overnight of work , shelter and money , marooned in cities , facing hunger and health risks ; and leaving the city to go to their villages .
Trudging long distances with their families -- men carrying young children on their shoulders , the women with their meagre belongings hoisted on their heads -- for all bus and train services stood cancelled .
Going without food for long stretches , often risking the ire of policemen who preferred to speak through their lathis , with no relief in sight , they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an economic package for the poor and migrant populations and various state governments also announced relief measures , in reality there is scant relief for internal migrant workers .
they comprise a substantial segment of the workforce -- 139 million people , no less -- they are invisible to the system .
Left out of the equation , internal migrant workers are the hardest hit in the current lockdown situation , states a sharply articulated document brought out by the Udaipur-based public service initiative , Aajeevika Bureau , and the collective , Working People 's Charter .
The ' Charter of demands for internal migrant workers during COVID-19 pandemic ' describes in detail the extent to which the existing vulnerabilities of the " poorest and most vulnerable economic categories in the country " have been exacerbated .
More than that , it sets out the measures urgently needed to ensure " safe and dignified lives for migrant communities in the wake of the pandemic " -- measures to be taken in urban and industrial areas where migrants work andin rural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government needs totake .

?  Charter of Demands for Internal Migrant Workers during Covid-19 pandemic  Amidst the grave challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic , internal migrant workers who move from rural to urban areas to seek employment have been the hardest hit .
While various state governments have announced relief packages , and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced an economic package to benefit poor and migrant populations , they continue to leave out this substantial group of the workforce -- accounting for 139 million people !  These measures are restricted to beneficiaries under existing schemes , which do not include migrants who are unable to get themselves registered , or those with identity or domicile documentation , which migrants do not possess in the cities where they work .
Coming from the most socially marginalised groups -- including Scheduled Tribes and Castes , OBCs and Muslims -- internal migrants also comprise the poorest and most vulnerable economic categories in the country .
A nationwide lockdown , and physical distancing measures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India .
For migrant workers , this means a loss of job and wages as their workplaces shut down .
As casual or daily wage labour , they do not have fixed employers in order to demand paid leave .
Even where they have been working in the same establishment for many years , they do not have formal employment contracts to prove their status as workers .
At the same time , they fall outside the purview of public provisioning systems in the states that they work in .
Without identity cards , which establish their domicile in the destination state , internal migrant workers are unable to access food , water , sanitation , healthcare or housing .
Rather , they resort to living in highly informal and un-recognised settlements , including open spaces ( such as on pavements , near railway tracks or on public/private lands ) , in informal rental accommodation which are often congested and unhygienic , or within their worksites ( on construction sites , in factories or in hotels and dhabas ) .
In the last few days , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrant workers have been removed from their jobs , have not received long overdue wages and have no means to earn in the cities where they are trapped .
Many have been asked to vacate their rented accommodation as they can not afford to pay rent , and those living in their worksites have been asked to leave .
In open spaces they have faced evictions and harassment .
Without cash to purchase rations , no arrangements for shelter , and no transportation to return to their villages , scores of workers have been marooned in cities facing hunger , uncertainty and great health risks .

At the borders , they face long queues and police checkpoints , which further exposes them to health risks , and defeats the purpose of the lockdown .
Even where they return to their villages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of livelihood for their households is shutdown -- they are unable to purchase basic necessities .
They are also not able to access adequate healthcare back in their villages .
On the contrary , they are facing stigmatization as local communities and health systems fear that they have brought the infection with them .
This has created a sense of panic and hostility towards migrants in their own villages .
The horrifying situation facing this large group of workers -- who already face multiple vulnerabilities , including malnutrition , tuberculosis and other illness -- must be mitigated immediately .
This requires urgent , concerted efforts of various institutions across different states and the central government .
We put forth the following demands to secure safe and dignified lives for migrant communities in the wake of the pandemic :  Measures to be taken in urban and industrial areas where migrants work :  -- On an urgent basis , free and subsidised rations need to be made available to migrants without the need for identity or domicile documents .
While the central government and states have announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or subsidised rations , they are restricted to those holding ration cards with domicile status in the city .
While cash transfers are being made to poor households , these are based on existing lists of beneficiaries of different schemes .
Migrant workers do not have access to ration cards in the cities where they work , nor do they make it to official lists -- as an uncounted and invisible population they fall completely outside the purview of the state .
All such eligibility barriers should be removed so that critical assistance can be provided to migrants in this time of crisis .
-- Police cooperation at migrant work destinations is of utmost importance .
The state should reach out to high migrant pockets through civil society organisations in the cities to do a regular status check of food availability or other shortages and take measures for providing the same through the police .
-- Shelters should be opened up for migrants at all costs .
Many workers live in open spaces and are being assaulted by police authorities for being outside at the time of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living arrangements by landlords and employers .
Hence providing them with dignified shelter , where they also have access to cooked food and health checkups , is imperative .
-- Health systems at the level of the Urban Health Centres ( UHCs ) must be strengthened so that preliminary screening and counseling can be accessed easily by poor , vulnerable communities such as labour migrants .
These should complemented with intensification of health clinics in clusters where migrants are still stranded .
-- Banks and ATMs must be kept open and functional throughout the lockdown .
They are the only source of cash for migrants , who do not have UPI/PayTM/GPay .
This will allow them to access cash transfers through the government or private organisations and use it to purchase necessities .
-- Restaurants , small dhabas and eateries must be allowed to remain open throughout the lockdown .
Small , cheap eateries located in industrial clusters are often the only source of food for migrants who live within their work units .
They do not have cooking facilities or utensils in their living spaces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken in rural , migrant-sending areas :  -- Health systems should be strengthened at the village/tehsil levels ( PHCs and CHCs ) so that rural communities , including migrants who are back from cities , do not have to travel long distances to access healthcare in this dire situation .
Laboratories and testing facilities should be expanded to the district and block level so that migrants who have returned from other states and other rural communities can access them easily .
-- Health systems must work at the panchayat level , along with rural local bodies and community groups to ensure healthcare access to returnee migrants .
They must refrain from using tactics of intimidation and public shaming of migrants in order to bring them under quarantine .
Currently , lists of migrants and those being tested are being circulated publicly and notices are being posted outside their homes , posing a threat to migrant households by local communities who are panicked .
This must be stopped immediately , and anonymity must be ensured .
Health systems must act to spread correct information and awareness among local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create situations of under-reporting .
-- While Direct Benefit Transfer of MGNREGA wages has been announced , many rural households have not even received older MGNREGA payments that have been stuck for months .
These must be transferred immediately .
-- Accurate information about accessing subsidised rations must be communicated to rural communities who do not know how to access it .
Rural communities remain confused about where and how to procure rations , with many households facing shortages .
-- The police must refrain from lathi charge and harassment of those who step out of their homes , given the large shortages of rations and other supplies among rural households .
These households are also not able to stockpile rations as in the case of urban middle class populations and will have to buy in smaller quantities more frequently .
The police must cooperate in spreading information about how to access supplies and offer support for safely acquiring them .
Currently , ration and grocery shops are not allowed to open even for a few hours in rural areas .
Measures to be taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up mechanisms for inter-state coordination between source and destination states in prominent migration corridors across the countryso that migrant workers can be brought back home to safety and/or provided for adequately in cities , in terms of shelter , food and other relief measures .
Just as extensive arrangements were made to bring back Indian citizens stranded in other countries , labour migrants stranded in other states/cities must also be allowed to get to their villages during this period of great uncertainty and calamity .
Some states such as Rajasthan have initiated a limited number of buses once workers reach the Rajasthan border by foot , but connectivity must be expanded at least for a few days until inter-state workers are able to get to the relative safety of their villages .
The central government should mandate destination states to arrange transportation till the border , and source states to ensure that migrants are picked up from the border and transported to their villages .
Adequate health protocols such as screening , quarantine and testing ( as in the case of international travellers ) could be instituted for internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrants in destination states must be shared by the central government to supplement state efforts .
-- A legal cell must be set up both at the central and state levels to effectively protect the wages of workers .
Large evidence of non-payment of wages , forced leave and retrenchment have been surfacing since the lockdown .
This will result in significant wage losses for workers who are already on the margins of society .
Many migrants in industrial areas have been living inside their factories while work is shut down as they have nowhere else to go .
They have been subsisting on advances from their contractors who might deduct these sums from their wages once the lockdown is lifted , creating bondage-like situations .
In order to mitigate this , the central government must direct employers and contractors that advances given in this period can not be deducted from the wages , and keep the legal cell open for a period after the lockdown to respond to wage and advance related cases .
-- It is necessary to ensure universal PDS , ensuring subsidised rations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists of destination states .
central government has taken the step of subsidised rations for 80 crore citizens .
This measure will leave out migrants as they remain outside PDS lists in their destinations .
-- Cash shortages among migrant workers and their families should be tackled at the level of the source states , through MGNREGA payments and disbursements by rural local bodies .
The labour ministry has announced direct benefit transfer to construction workers using Building and Other Construction Workers ( BoCW ) cess funds .
The state governments have been " requested " to use these funds to provide for construction workers .
However , migrants often fail to get themselves registered as construction workers with the welfare board due to bureaucratic delays and complications and may not have access to bank accounts .
To overcome this , cash disbursements at the level of the rural local bodies must be made available .
-- Many migrants are also share-croppers , agricultural labourers or small farmers with landholdings that they cultivate seasonally .
For their benefit , the government must consider these demands of farmers ' groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay allowances to agricultural workers who lose work due to the lockdown ; and  Make an assessment of the crop loss due to the lockdown to ensure compensation , including the wages of agricultural labour and sharecroppers ; issuing direction to banks and the Reserve Bank of India to revise crop loan guidelines irrespective of pending instalments to start the fresh cropping season ; anddeclaring a one-year moratorium on the recovery of crop loans and all loans under different schemes .
