New Trump mileage standards to gut Obama climate effort  WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is poised to roll back ambitious Obama-era vehicle mileage standards and raise the ceiling on damaging fossil fuel emissions for years to come , gutting one of the United States ' biggest efforts against climate change .
The Trump administration is expected to release a final rule Tuesday on mileage standards through 2026 .
The change -- making good on the rollback after two years of Trump threatening and fighting states and a faction of automakers that opposed the move -- waters down a tough Obama mileage standard that would have encouraged automakers to ramp up production of electric vehicles and more fuel-efficient gas and diesel vehicles .
" When finalized , the rule will benefit our economy , will improve the U .
fleet 's fuel economy , will make vehicles more affordable , and will save lives by increasing the safety of new vehicles , " EPA spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said Monday , ahead of the expected release .
Opponents contend the change -- gutting his predecessor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Trump 's push to undo regulatory initiatives of former President Barack Obama , and say even the administration has had difficulty pointing to the kind of specific , demonstrable benefits to drivers , public health and safety or the economy that normally accompany standards changes .
The Trump administration says the looser mileage standards will allow consumers to keep buying the less fuel-efficient SUVs that U .
drivers have favored for years .
Opponents say it will kill several hundred more Americans a year through dirtier air , compared to the Obama standards .
Even " given the catastrophe they 're in with the coronavirus , they 're pursuing a policy that 's going to hurt public health and kill people , " said Chet France , a former 39-year veteran of the Environmental Protection Agency , where he served as a senior official over emissions and mileage standards .
" This is first time that an administration has pursued a policy that will net negative benefit for society and reduce fuel savings , " France said .
Delaware Sen .
Tom Carper , the senior Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " the height of irresponsibility for this administration to finalize a rollback that will lead to dirtier air while our country is working around the clock to respond to a respiratory pandemic whose effects may be exacerbated by air pollution .
" We should be enacting forward-looking environmental policy , not tying our country 's future to the dirty vehicles of the past , " Carper said .
In Phoenix , Arizona , meanwhile , resident Columba Sainz expressed disappointment at the prospect of losing the Obama-era rule , which she had hoped would allow her preschool age children to break away from TV indoors and play outside more .
Sainz reluctantly limited her daughter to a half-hour at the park daily , after the girl developed asthma , at age 3 , at their home a few minutes from a freeway .
" I cried so many times , " Sainz said .
" How do you tell your daughter she ca n't be outside because of air pollution ? "  Trump 's Cabinet heads have continued a push to roll back public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attention .
The administration -- like others before it -- is facing procedural rules that will make changes adopted before the last six months of Trump 's current term tougher to throw out , even if the White House changes occupants .
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which has been the main agency drawing up the new rules , did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday .
The standards have split the auto industry with Ford , BMW , Honda and Volkswagen siding with California and agreeing to higher standards .
Most other automakers contend the Obama-era standards were enacted hastily and will be impossible to meet because consumers have shifted dramatically away from efficient cars to SUVs and trucks .
California and about a dozen other states say they will continue resisting the Trump mileage standards in court .
Last year , 72% of the new vehicles purchased by U .
consumers were trucks or SUVS .
It was 51% when the current standards went into effect in 2012 .
The Obama administration mandated 5% annual increases in fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal show a 1 .
annual increase , backing off from its initial proposal simply to stop mandating increases in fuel efficiency after 2020 .
The transportation sector is the nation 's largest source of climate-changing emissions .
John Bozzella , CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation , a trade group representing automakers , said the industry still wants middle ground between the two standards , and it supports year-over-year mileage increases .
But he says the Obama-era standards are outdated due to the drastic shift to trucks and SUVs .
The Trump administration standards are likely to cause havoc in the auto industry because due to expected legal challenges , automakers wo n't know which standards they will have to obey .
" It will be extraordinarily disruptive , " said Richard J .
Pierce Jr .
, a law professor at the George Washington University who specializes in government regulations .
States and environmental groups will challenge the Trump rules , and a U .
District Court likely will issue a temporary order shelving them until it decides whether they are legal .
The temporary order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent cases has voted 5-4 that a District judge ca n't issue such a nationwide order , Pierce said .
But the nation 's highest court could also keep the order in effect if it determines the groups challenging the Trump standards are likely to win .
" We 're talking quite a long time , one to three years anyway , before we can expect to get a final decision on the merits , " Pierce said .
