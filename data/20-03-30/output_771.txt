There is an ever-expanding group of people who have been infected by the coronavirus but are no longer symptomatic , if they ever were -- the convalescents .
Governor Andrew Cuomo , of New York , has advocated for widespread blood tests as a way for restarting the economy in a way that is consistent with a responsible public-health strategy .
" I believe , once we get that test , you 're going to find hundreds of thousands of people who have had the coronavirus and resolved .
Let the younger people go back to work .
Let the recovered people go back to work .
" Yet there have been a number of reports , from China and Japan , about patients who have recovered from COVID-19 but subsequently fell ill again .
With the U .
economy in a state of near-collapse , is it worth the risk to invite convalescents back to work ?  With other diseases , convalescents have proved invaluable .
" We 've seen this in previous epidemics where survivors have a special role , " Dr .
Seema Yasmin , a former officer in the Epidemic Intelligence Service who now teaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
She observed the phenomenon firsthand in Liberia , in December , 2015 , when she was reporting on an Ebola outbreak and talked to survivors who were caring for stricken family members .
" People who have been infected but recovered have antibodies in their system that allow them to be out and about and be exposed to the virus , knowing that it 's unlikely that they 'll become reinfected , " she said , citing a 2017 study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases , which documented Ebola survivors who still had antibodies forty years after infection .
" Of course , with this virus , we also have to learn how long protective antibodies will stay in your body , " Yasmin said .
" It 's such a new pathogen , we have n't had a lot of time to say , ' Six months after infection , you still have protection .
' It 's just too soon .
"  If the virus does have the capacity to sicken people who have already become ill from it , devising a vaccine might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , points out that " even common viruses like influenza or respiratory syncytial virus can also reinfect " ; these viruses , fortunately , " tend to cause progressively less disease on subsequent infections .
" With COVID-19 , Graham said , " survivors may develop enough immunity to keep the virus from getting deeply into the lung , confining it to the upper airways .
" In that case , a repeat infection of COVID-19 would be more like a cold than pneumonia .
Recently , researchers in China exposed four rhesus macaques to the virus that causes COVID-19 .
All became ill .
One of the four monkeys was euthanized a week later , to determine its level of infection ; it had mild to moderate pneumonia .
The remaining monkeys recovered , producing high levels of antibodies .
By the twenty-eighth day , a viral load was undetectable in the three surviving monkeys .
The monkeys were then reinfected with the virus .
They each showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Another monkey was sacrificed , and no virus was found in its tissues .
No further evidence of disease was found in the two surviving monkeys .
It 's a hopeful report , but very limited .
Tom Frieden , a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who now runs Resolve to Save Lives , an initiative to prevent epidemics and cardiovascular disease , cautions COVID-19 convalescents not to think that they are totally immune from future infections .
" People can go back to work , but what I do n't want is for them to assume that they are protected by that prior infection , " he told me .
" Do n't assume that we have these new supermen and superwomen whom we can send out onto the battlefield , because the bullets are n't going to penetrate their armor .
We do n't know if that 's going to be the case .
"  A close friend of Freiden 's , Dr .
Barron Lerner , a practicing internist at Bellevue Hospital and a professor of population and health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being exposed to a symptomatic patient , on March 11th .
Five days later , Lerner was running a fever and experiencing body aches .
By March 23rd , he was feeling better , and he returned to work , although he is still suffering a lingering fatigue .
" Health-care workers need to be brought back as quickly as possible , " he told me .
He 's not been seeing patients directly , given that there 's an unresolved question of reinfection .
He told Frieden , " I 'm rooting for the immunity .
" Frieden responded , " You can root for it , but do n't count on it .
"  Immunity varies with different diseases .
Frieden gave the example of an epidemic of measles that took place on one of the Faroe Islands , an archipelago two hundred miles north of Scotland , in 1846 , before a vaccine was available .
" Everyone got it , a hundred per cent , because it is one of the most infectious diseases , " Frieden said .
After the outbreak , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Then measles came back , and again everyone on the island was infected -- except those over sixty-five .
They were all still immune .
"  There are also examples of viruses that do n't provide immunity after infection , or only protect against one strain of a disease and not another .
A 1908 study documented multiple reinfections of smallpox during an epidemic in Trinidad at the beginning of the twentieth century .
DNA viruses , like the one that causes smallpox , are relatively stable , but the singular characteristic of RNA viruses , such as influenza and coronaviruses , is that they mutate .
That 's why we can get frequent colds , and why it 's so difficult for scientists to decide which strains of influenza should be targeted by the annual vaccine .
Having one strain of dengue fever , for instance , does n't guarantee that the next one will be less virulent .
" You get dengue once , and it 's not so bad , " Frieden told me .
" You get it a second time , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So far , SARS-CoV-2 , as the COVID-19 virus is officially called , has not mutated .
" But it could , " Frieden said .
According to Marc Lipsitch , the director of Harvard University 's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics , previous studies of coronaviruses show that complete immunity " does n't last long , " but that subsequent infections are less severe and , probably , less contagious .
" That should be our guiding hypothesis , " he told me .
There are hundreds of coronaviruses that infect bats and which might pass into the human population .
The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Virus , or SARS , in 2002 , derived from horseshoe bats dwelling in a Chinese cave .
It killed about ten per cent of the people it infected .
In 2012 , another coronavirus , Middle East Respiratory Syndrome , or MERS , arose in Saudi Arabia , apparently originating with Egyptian tomb bats before spreading into camels and then into humans .
Among those who tested positive for the disease , it had a frightening mortality rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread .
Both of these predecessors are closely related to the virus that causes COVID-19 .
So far , no successful vaccine or treatment has been developed for either of these predecessor diseases .
It is likely that future coronaviruses , perhaps more mortal or contagious , will emerge .
Advertisement  Dr .
Philip Dormitzer , the chief scientific officer for viral vaccines at Pfizer , told me in an e-mail , " A vaccine or drug against one coronavirus wo n't necessarily work against another .
" He went on , " The problem is not as severe as it is for influenza , " which mutates constantly , " but it is much worse than it is for a virus that has remained relatively stable for a long time , like the rabies virus .
" Dormitzer pointed to another challenge to the creation of a vaccine for COVID-19 , " disease enhancement " -- in other words , making the illness worse .
The current dengue-virus vaccine protects most people who are immunized , but some people who receive it get a more severe case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so .
Something similar happened in tests of candidate vaccines for SARS , which were developed after the 2002 outbreak .
Those vaccines never got beyond animal trials .
" Given the variable experimental results seen with vaccine candidates against SARS , we 'll need to observe vigilantly to be sure that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines work as intended to prevent disease , " Dormitzer said .
" There are now intensive discussions among academics , regulators , and vaccine developers about how we can minimize this risk without excessively slowing the development of a potentially protective vaccine .
" A candidate vaccine , built on the knowledge gained from working on the MERS virus , is now in human trials .
If it succeeds , a limited amount of the vaccine could be available this fall .
When SARS looked as if it might sweep the globe as COVID-19 is doing now , doctors turned to an emergency measure , called passive antigenic therapy , in which blood plasma from convalescents is used as a treatment .
The plasma contains the antibodies that fought off the disease in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide some degree of protection for people in the throes of the disease .
In 1995 , with no effective treatment for Ebola at the time , and not even any equipment to separate the plasma , doctors in the Democratic Republic of the Congo took a radical measure : they transfused eight severely ill patients with whole blood from survivors .
They risked infecting the Ebola patients with other diseases that might have been in the blood of the donors , but at the time eighty per cent of Ebola victims perished .
Only one of the eight patients in the procedure died .
Plasma that has been purified , using a process called fractionation , is far safer than using whole blood .
On March 24th , the Food and Drug Administration approved using passive antigenic therapy in severe cases of COVID-19 .
Testing has already begun in New York , at Mount Sinai Hospital .
One of the first people to sign up was Barron Lerner , the doctor at Bellvue Hospital .
" They 've already got thousands of responses , " he told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to scale up , because you have to get antibodies from people , preserve them , make sure they do n't have other infectious diseases in them , then give them to someone else .
" There is only one disease for which convalescent plasma is standard care : Argentine hemorrhagic fever .
The technique drastically reduces the risk of death in such patients , who must be given half a litre of convalescent plasma within eight days of the onset of symptoms .
The method has also been tried against SARS , and against the H1N1 influenza , Frieden told me , " and it seemed to work .
" The dilemma is that convalescents need to be bled , and they would n't produce enough plasma to be broadly useful .
" Basically , you can get about a litre to a litre and a half of plasma from a person per week " -- not near enough to treat tens or hundreds of thousands of sick people .
COVID-19 convalescents will certainly return to work .

By themselves , they wo n't turn the economy around or stop the pandemic , but , until a vaccine and possibly a treatment are developed , they are all we have .
