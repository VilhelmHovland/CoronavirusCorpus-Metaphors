In a sweep of legal filings on Monday , a coalition of abortion rights advocates brought challenges in four states -- Alabama , Iowa , Ohio and Oklahoma -- over directives to temporarily ban the procedure amid the coronavirus outbreak .
So far , federal courts have ruled that Alabama and Ohio ca n't prevent abortions during the pandemic , according to the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
State officials claim that the orders are intended to preserve much-needed medical resources , but abortion-rights activists say the orders are an " excuse to attack essential , time-sensitive medical procedures like abortion .
"  The organizations , which include Planned Parenthood , the ACLU , and the Center for Reproductive Rights , asked district courts across the South and Midwest to block states from halting abortion services as part of directives to suspend " non-essential " medical procedures .
Last week , Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights also filed litigation against Texas for its temporary halt on all abortion services " not medically necessary to preserve the life or health " of the patient .
Those in violation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 180 days of jail time .
"  " We can not let anti-abortion activists dictate public health policy .
A global pandemic is not an excuse to attack essential , time-sensitive medical procedures like abortion , " said Alexis McGill Johnson , acting president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America .
" These political distractions cost valuable time and resources that our state and federal officials can not afford to waste .
Abortion is essential and patients who need this care can not wait .
This is what it 's come down to : court battles just so doctors and nurses can care for patients during a public health crisis .
Anti-abortion activists have gone too far .
"  Ohio Attorney General David Yost denied the state 's suspension of abortion services was political , in a statement shared with CBS News .
" The state of Ohio 's overriding interest is to save lives in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency .
That 's the only reason for the Health Department 's order , " Yost said .
" After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state of Ohio will take the course of action that will most quickly achieve that goal -- be it an emergency appeal , a trial on the preliminary injunction , a more specifically drawn order , or other remedy .
"  Attorneys General for Alabama , Iowa and Oklahoma did not immediately return emails requesting comment .
