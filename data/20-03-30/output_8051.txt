Jenny Harries told reporters some social distancing guidelines might need to be enforced through the summer and into the fall months .
SHOW TRANSCRIPT  " So over time , probably over the next six months , we will have a three-week review , we will see where we 're going , we need to keep that lid on .
And then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal , " said Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr .
Jenny Harries .
The U .
's deputy chief medical officer says the country 's coronavirus-related restrictions could remain in place for months to help prevent a second wave of infections .
During a press conference , Dr .
Jenny Harries said some social distancing guidelines might need to be enforced through the summer and into the fall .
She said the idea is to make sure any progress made against the virus is n't wiped out by British citizens abruptly returning to their everyday lives .
" If we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve , which is brilliant , but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living .
That would be quite dangerous , " Harries said .
Last week , Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a three-week stay-at-home order for the entire country in an effort to contain the coronavirus .
The order stops all unnecessary travel , closed nonessential businesses and encourages people to work from home if they can .
After that three-week period is up , officials will review the effectiveness of those restrictions and go from there .
