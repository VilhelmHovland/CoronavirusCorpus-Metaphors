President Buhari 's coronavirus speech is like fine wine with a bit of vinegar  President Muhammadu Buhari was presidential in his address to the nation on coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) on Sunday .
He got off his accustomed armchair ; stood up and spoke to Nigerians like an unfeigned commander-in-chief .
I could see the sense of urgency in his cadence and grimace .
Really , the president 's first COVID-19 ' ' outing ' ' is a far cry from the previous televised embarrassments .
Though it was a pre-recorded broadcast , the previous ones were recorded as well yet dismal .
So , there is some improvement in the president 's public address .
But it is dismaying that the president had to wait until citizens gassed him out of Aso Rock with ululations before he could do his bounden duty .
Weeks after coronavirus hit the country ; he is just addressing citizens on this lethal threat .
Be that as it may , he has spoken so I will dwell on the content of his speech .
The president said : ' ' Based on the advice of the federal ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cessation of all movements in Lagos and the FCT for an initial period of 14 days with effect from 11pm on Monday , 30th March 2020 .
This restriction will also apply to Ogun state due to its close proximity to Lagos and the high traffic between the two States .
' ' All citizens in these areas are to stay in their homes .
Travel to or from other states should be postponed .
All businesses and offices within these locations should be fully closed during this period .
' '  ' ' We will use this containment period to identify , trace and isolate all individuals that have come into contact with confirmed cases .
We will ensure the treatment of confirmed cases while restricting further spread to other states .
' '  The order to lock down Abuja , Lagos and Ogun is expected and apropos .
It has been proved by the China example that the surest way to combat COVID-19 is through social distancing -- and the plausible method of ensuring this is if people stay at home .
The same recipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entire region is quarantined -- and some other countries facing this viral enemy .
So , the order is a conscionable and reasoned strategy to deal with this problem .
But I think the president 's relief plan for Nigerians who will be impacted by this lockdown should have been more robust .
Beyond his take on providing relief materials for the vulnerable members of society -- which is quite inscrutable I must say -- there is no plan for working Nigerians who will lose the means to provide for their families at this time .
Also , I would have loved to see the president roll out sustenance packages for Nigerians who will be paying rent , electricity and water bills and other essential bills during this tortuous period .
In Canada , Justin Trudeau , the prime minister , last week , announced a plan to help ' ' workers whose income has been hit by the coronavirus .
Employees inside and outside the unemployment insurance system and the self-employed can apply to receive C$2,000 each month for four months ' ' -- according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moratorium on rent and other essential bills for working citizens .
Also , the UK and the US are implementing analogous relief plans for their citizens .
As a matter of fact , we are not as rich as those countries , but we could have borrowed from how comprehensive their plans are -- not necessarily paying every citizen a certain amount .
In addition , the president said : ' ' For the most vulnerable in our society , I have directed that the conditional cash transfers for the next two months be paid immediately .
Our Internally displaced persons will also receive two months of food rations in the coming weeks .
' '  I see a bit of ambiguity in this statement .
Who are the most vulnerable in our society ? What is the assessment for that ? Really , at this time , everyone in Nigeria is vulnerable .
Some companies are among the vulnerable , most Nigerians , including those in the middle class , are on the vulnerability threshold .
We are all made vulnerable by coronavirus .
So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encompassing .
In all , I hope the government will be more responsive to unfolding developments on COVID-19 in the country -- particularly as it relates to the economy -- and initiate measures accordingly , and not slither into inertia after today .
