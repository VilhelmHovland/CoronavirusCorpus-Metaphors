COVID-19 and developing Asia : Weathering the economic storm  In every dislocation , there is an opportunity .
For investors in alternative assets , the short-medium term dislocation wrought by COVID-19 in emerging markets presents an advantageous moment to allocate capital .
As emerging markets ( EMs ) batten down the hatches to confront the health crisis resulting from the coronavirus pandemic , policymakers are focused on containing the corollary economic fallout within their respective countries .
As COVID-19 reverberates across the world , Indo-Pacific countries are contending with the ricocheting of the virus , out from the epicenter of Asia , and returning to their shores , potentially via imported cases .
In terms of capital flows to EMs , emerging and frontier markets often witness substantive outflows with economic volatility in China , and also with a downturn in commodity prices .
1 Since the start of 2020 , with activity brought to a standstill across large parts of China , and with oil prices hitting 18-year lows , EMs have suffered colossal capital outflows in Q1 .
According to IIF , the number is ' unprecedented ' , and exceeds outflows during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantrum of 2013 , and market volatility in China in 2015 .
2  In some ways , EMs are in a better position to navigate external shocks than they were during the Asian crisis of the late 1990s , having implemented macroprudential measures since the GFC .
3 These include : moving from fixed to floating exchange rates ; reducing the fiscal deficit ; and bolstering foreign exchange flows .
However , the colossal coronavirus-related capital outflows are likely to be immensely destabilising , and may result in imported inflation via rapid depreciation of local currencies , as well as an increase to sovereign borrowing costs .

With swings in market volatility in the West , as investors move to cash and safe haven holdings , many EM corporates may come under significant duress and dramatic increases to debt service costs .
Looking to the real economy , the cessation of economic activity across the Eurozone is likely to have drastic implications for EM growth .
Demand shock in Europe directly hits the manufacturing sectors of markets such as China , Vietnam , and India -- countries which have increased their exports to EU-28 over the last decade .

The IMF is poised to deliver -- at current tally -- some $50 bn of emergency financing to low-income and emerging markets via rapid disbursement .
