President Donald Trump has accused hospitals of hoarding ventilators and says the devices need to be released .
Trump made the remarks during a White House press briefing on Sunday night .
" We have some healthcare workers , some hospitals .
hoarding equipment including ventilators , " he said .
" We have to release those ventilators -- especially hospitals that are never going to use them .
"  Trump did not specify which hospitals were hoarding ventilators , nor did he provide evidence to back up his claims .
He also told reporters they should look into a purported disappearance of masks from New York hospitals , where he said use had risen from 20,000 a week to up to 300,000 .
" Where are the masks going -- are they going out the backdoor ? " Trump asked rhetorically .
New York has become the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak .
As of Sunday night , the state had confirmed more than 59,600 coronavirus cases and more than 965 deaths .
Ventilators are a vital tool for medical facilities trying to save the lives of people with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But experts have warned that America faces a shortage of critical supplies in the months ahead as the number of cases continues to grow .
A February report from the Centre for Health Security at Johns Hopkins found that the US had about 170,000 ventilators , including about 8,900 held in a national reserve .
One expert has estimated about 1 million Americans may need ventilator treatment during the coronavirus outbreak , straining the country 's resources even if all those cases do not overlap .
Shortages of other medical gear like masks have already started to affect US hospitals .
On Wednesday , Trump issued an executive order meant to prevent the hoarding and price gouging of essential medical equipment , including ventilators , masks , and chloroquine , a drug in clinical trials to test its viability as a coronavirus treatment .
" I do n't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators , " Trump told Hannity .
" You go into major hospitals sometimes , and they will have two ventilators .
And now , all of a sudden , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Trump invoked the Defence Production Act -- a Korean War-era national security legislation that lets the president direct industries to manufacture essentials during a national crisis -- on Friday , compelling General Motors to help the country produce ventilators .
" As usual with ' this ' General Motors , things just never seem to work out , " he tweeted .
" They said they were going to give us 40,000 much-needed Ventilators , ' very quickly ' .
Now they are saying it will only be 6,000 , in late April , and they want top dollar .
