Mayor Masina made an announcement during his state of the city address that he would use the city 's emergency funding to procure the vaccine ' Inferon B ' from Cuba to help fight the coronavirus outbreak , said Msimanga .
According to Africa Check , Masina was referring to the interferon alpha-2b , a drug used to treat the symptoms of diseases caused by some earlier strains of coronavirus , a drug that has not been confirmed to cure Covid-19 .
" This clearly indicates that no proper research was conducted before the mayor made his announcement .
" Mayor Masina was irresponsible in his pronouncement and gave false hope to the residents while the nation is in crisis , " said Msimanga .
He said the DA would monitor the usage of Ekurhuleni 's emergency fund to ensure it was not used to procure something that did not exist .
" We call on all politicians to act responsibly and follow the lead of the department of health in combating the spread of Covid-19 .
"  Today we had engagement with Ambassador of Cuba , Rodolfo Verson .
We received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , Venezuela and Brazil treat &amp; stabilized COVID-19 .
Geopolitics of Embargo must fall **26;303;TOOLONG  Masina has previously defended himself against the Africa Check article , telling the website to " know " its place .
" We do n't need useless checks that are not factual , " he said on social media .
Masina said there was nothing " fake " about the drug procurement from Cuba , adding he never said he was looking to get a vaccine but a drug .
Responding to the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse ( Outa ) , that has equally been sceptical of his statement , Masina said he stood by what he said at the council meeting .
" What is fake news on my statement ? I stand by what I said in council , not your edited version of what was said .
Hope you get that right and stop your nonsensical misrepresentation of facts .
Just read that section I sent you .
