Which could take until the end of April .
But he was not without a heart .
In a video message , he told his employees to go and get a job at Tesco for a while .
Cheers , Timbo !  His supporters ask -- what else could Martin have done ? If people are n't going to pubs , how can he pay staff ?  I 'll just point out that The Frankenstein Wurzel is worth an estimated ? 500million and that Wetherspoons spent years making record profits .
What did they do with that money ? Did they just set it on fire ? Maybe that could have been useful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you the profits get through a very difficult time .
Crazy idea , I know .

They also committed to delivering boxes of staple products to local care homes and community groups , and donating products to create care packages for customers to share with vulnerable neighbours .
I do n't know about you but I 'll feel a whole lot better about it the next time I 'm paying what feels like a lot for a gourmet pack of pasta at Waitrose .

Whilst we do n't know when we will reopen , what we do know is by supporting each other through this terribly challenging time , we will come through this stronger than ever ! "  How lovely .
Then he laid off 500 staff .
A chef who worked for him tweeted : " Such a shame to see how the company that you worked for and gave everything you had for two years throws you away like you are nothing but a little piece of s*** , especially in difficult times like this .
Even though they have absolutely nothing to lose by keeping you .
"  What did Gordon do ? He jumped up on YouTube to promote his new series Scrambled .
Yeah , you know what scrambles me , Gordon ? The fact that you are worth something like ? 140million and did this anyway .
I 'm not a whizz with the old calculator but assuming ( a very generous assumption ) that all 500 staff were paid the government-mandated maximum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cost you ? 3 .
to keep them all on until the end of June .
Or just under three per cent of Ramsay 's net worth .
Still , let 's not be too hard on Gordon .
He does have a lot of fabulous homes to maintain .
Let 's hope one of them is remote enough to keep him away from an angry public once this is all over .
