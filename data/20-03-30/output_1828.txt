THERE have been no exponential spikes in the number of Covid-19 cases so far , said Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah .
" We have been observing the cases very closely and have compared to other countries .
There have been no exponential spikes yet , " said Noor Hisham in his daily Covid-19 press briefing in Putrajaya today .
He said the increase of 150-200 cases each day was " stable " and attributed this to increased or active case inspections by MOH .
Noor Hisham was responding to a question on whether MOH is satisfied with the movement-control order ( MCO ) .
" So far , we have seen around 8 positive cases in every 100 tested .
This is within the range and there are no spikes .
" But we are prepared for the worst while hoping for the best , " said Noor Hisham .
He said this is one of the reasons why MOH is preparing additional quarantine centres and beds for Covid-19 patients .
On whether the MCO will be extended , Noor Hisham said they will review the situation after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks is up to all of us .
If we have social discipline we can flatten the curve to avoid the exponential spike .
" Our challenge is whether there is a second wave coming from Malaysians coming back from overseas .
We will only know after the first week of April .
If we have no exponential increase we can review the MCO again .
"  Before the MCO , there were around 10,000 Malaysians returning to the country from overseas every day , said Noor Hisham .
" But since the MCO , the Immigration Department said there are only 4,000 returns now .
"  The returnees will nevertheless be screened and even those who do n't have symptoms will be told to self-quarantine for 14 days , he added .
He said Malaysians will still need to practise social distancing after the MCO period .
" MOH will come out with guidelines to ensure social distancing after the MCO if there are Ramadan bazaars , " said Noor Hisham .
