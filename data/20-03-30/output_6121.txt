If New Yorkers do n't comply , they face fines and jail time , Raimondo said , adding that that 's not the goal .
" I want to be crystal clear about this : If you 're coming to Rhode Island from New York you are ordered into quarantine .
The reason for that is because more than half of the cases of coronavirus in America are in New York , " Raimondo said , adding that it 's not meant to be discriminatory .
New York Gov .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying he 'd sue Rhode Island if the policy is n't rescinded but believed they could " work it out .

" We have to keep the ideas and the policies we implement positive rather than reactionary and emotional .
"  President Donald Trump said Saturday that he had spoken with some governors and was considering some type of a quarantine to prevent people in New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut from traveling .

, the country 's epicenter of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined other states in imposing quarantines on air travelers from the New York area , including New Jersey and Connecticut , and New Orleans , two places where COVID-19 outbreak is more severe .
The Republican said travelers who do n't comply with the 14-day quarantine risk jail time , adding that state troopers would conduct visits to make sure people were staying put .
In Rhode Island , which reported its first two deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday , a team of a Westerly police officer and a Guard member were visiting stately and modest coastal homes in the Westerly neighborhood of Watch Hill collecting contact information from New Yorkers and telling them to self-quarantine .
They expected to go to about 1,000 homes over a few days .
" This is more of an education tool to make people aware and comply with what we are asking them to do , " said Westerly , Rhode Island , police chief Shawn Lacey .
" We are certainly hope it does n't get to enforcement action that has to happen .
"  Reha Kocatas , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Rhode Island home , said his wife and two children were visited by a police officer and a national guardsmen .
Already under a 14-day quarantine per a state order because he had arrived from outside the 50 states and the District of Columbia , Kocatas said he volunteered information to the authorities including the number of people in the home , when they entered Rhode Island and his and his wife 's date of birth .
But he questioned why it was necessary to send a police officer to his door .
" It seemed like a pretty large waste of resources for something that could have been volunteered through an online form pretty quickly , " he said .
" If New Yorkers are such high risk individuals , why are we putting first responders in front of these individuals is a little questionable since there is no action item at the end of the day , " he continued .
" They were n't going to remove us .
It seemed like bureaucratic grandstanding .
The local community that happens to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time is the essence in preparing for other things .
"  Ramaindo said only an estimated 50% of Rhode Islanders are complying with social distancing , with crowds spotted at a beach , groups at parks , crowds at big box stores and house parties .
As a result , she banned gatherings of more than five people and urged people to limit interactions to the same five .
For those who are not complying with social distancing : " I 've said it last week , I 'm going to say it again , knock if off .
You are risking the lives of everyone in this state , " she said .
People able to work from home must do so , she said .
Residents who work in Massachusetts and must go to work , must self-quarantine after work at home , she said .
For most people , the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
