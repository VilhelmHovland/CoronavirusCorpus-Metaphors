Since part-time island residents began flocking to each of the islands in recent days -- many in an effort to isolate in summer homes -- there have been growing concerns among local officials and year-round residents that the islands would be incapable of handling the influx in the event of an outbreak .
On Sunday , Governor Charlie Baker said state officials want people with second homes on the islands to stop going there .
" We have talked to people on both Nantucket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with second homes there have been going there , " Baker told reporters at a press conference .
" We would prefer they not do that and that they stay on the mainland and do n't create additional issues for both of those islands at a point in time where they do n't have the same level of service capacity in place they would typically have in the summer .
"  " We continue to work on the strategies we have with respect to social distancing and work and we 're going to continue to adjust those as we see fit , " he added .
Nantucket officials said Sunday the decision to issue a stay-at-home order was made in consultation with island hospital and public health officials " with the intent to ' flatten ' the rate at which coronavirus is potentially spread .
