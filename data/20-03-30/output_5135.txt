Trans heroes play good samaritan to homeless and hungry inCity of Joy  They are largely shunned by society , ridiculed , stigmatized and forced to live a cloistered existence .
But for happy occasions like childbirth or a wedding , they are rarely welcome anywhere , and face the taunt and derision with characteristic nonchalance and , of course , respond with their typical sneering clap .
Society may have distanced itself from them in happier times but these bunch of eunuchs or transgenders , smelling of cheap lipstick and talcum powder , are playing good samaritans to the homeless and the hungry in the City of Joy as the coronavirus rampages through the world .
Shankari , a member of the community , was seen with others distributing rice , potatoes , dal and other food material to rickshaw pullers , maidservants and daily wagers who have lost their jobs , at Garia .

We ca n't sit idle .
We will take care of them even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shankari .
All in her team wear masks and exercise social distancing .

Thousands of kilometers away in Bengaluru , the transgender community is in distress .
Many of their folks , down with diseases caused by AIDS , contracted from clients for whom they are mere objects of carnal pleasure , find it difficult to meet their basic needs .
With streets empty and markets closed , many of them who depend on beggary for survival , are going without food .

Nobody is coming forward to help us , " a transgender said .

" I 'm disappointed with the federal and the state government 's response towards the community .
We are the ones affected directly , our daily life is on the streets where we beg and get paid for sex .
our daily life is affected like any daily wager .
There is no food , no money for rent , there are HIV positive people unable to buy medicines , " she said .
Kolkata 's Shankari is also worried but has not given up hope .
" Corona is a deadly virus .
We have to bear with the hardships the lockdown has brought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things get better .
For now , we are sharing with people whatever we have .

" Chhabirani , a transgender in Kamarhati area of North 24 Parganas , is busy distributing biscuit packets and home-cooked khichdi with two others at a naya basti slum .

But see , we are also humans , who are moved by the plight of all fellow humans .
We can not sit idle at home .
We are here to help these people who are starving , " said Chhabirani , her voice betraying the stigma they face and her visage the will to serve .

" No real hijra will beg for alms in public places .

We get our dues from people who are happy with our performances , " her tone oozing with dignity and unmistakable strength of character .
These unsung heroes in the fight against the coronavirus that has brought the world to its knees did n't get a clap of appreciation on March 22 during the Janta curfew declared by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but that is rightfully theirs , too .
