NEWS RELEASE INNISFIL IDEALAB AND LIBRARY/TOWN OF INNISFIL **25;1770;TOOLONG INNISFIL -- It has been some time since the Town of Innisfil has witnessed the direct effects of a global hardship like COVID-19 .
In response to this , the Innisfil IdeaLAB &amp; Library 's Special Collections Librarian , Kate Zubczyk , is taking this time to acknowledge the significance of living history - calling for photos , stories , and documentation to add to the local digital archive Our Stories Innisfil .
We have not seen the temporary closure of public spaces , have not had to work and play from home , nor have many of us witnessed what it was like to go to our neighbourhood grocery store only to see that some of the necessities were gone .
These rapid changes have inspired our community to come together in unique ways and we have noticed that residents of all ages are documenting their stories and experiences , both positive and negative .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed some light on the effects of COVID-19 in Innisfil and beyond , " Zubczyk says .
" The biggest obstacle to collecting social history like this is the impression that every single one of us believes that our stories are ' not important ' or ' too boring ' .
It 's not true !  " What we absolutely do need is people being honest about what it 's like to try to work from home while home schooling your six-year-old , being a teenager isolated from friends , the anxiety you may have around going to the grocery store , or the hopefulness you feel when you see stories of encouragement on social media .
"  With your contributions , your local library will be able to document and preserve a realistic story for future generations , sharing intimate details , lessons , and primary information that can be used to inform historical studies , research papers , and more , revealing what it was like living through this difficult time .
Kate Zubczyk , Special Collections Librarian , is asking for the community to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogs , social media posts , photos , and videos alike , to contribute to this invaluable collection of historical documents .
These can be submitted to **31;1797;TOOLONG or **34;1830;TOOLONG .
