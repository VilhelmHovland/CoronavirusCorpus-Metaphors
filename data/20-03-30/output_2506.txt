Quarantine Unecessary for New York , Surrounding Area -- Trump  President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he would not be quarantining New York City 's metro area , which has emerged as the nation 's largest hot spot for the coronavirus , after floating the idea earlier in the day .
" On the recommendation of the White House CoronaVirus Task Force , and upon consultation with the Governor 's of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , I have asked the @CDCgov to issue a strong Travel Advisory , to be administered by the Governors , in consultation with the .
Federal Government , " Trump tweeted .
" A quarantine will not be necessary .
Full details will be released by CDC tonight .
Thank you ! "  Shortly after Trump 's tweet , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a domestic travel advisory urging residents of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut " to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately .
"  " This Domestic Travel Advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries , including but not limited to trucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply , " the CDC said in its memo .
All three of the states mentioned in the CDC 's advisory have issued travel restrictions of their own for residents .
Earlier in the day , Trump said he was considering a short-term quarantine of the tri-state area immediately surrounding New York City .
" We might not have to do it but there 's a possibility that sometime today we 'll do a quarantine -- short-term , two weeks for New York , probably New Jersey , certain parts of Connecticut , " Trump told reporters outside the White House Saturday afternoon .
The measure would 've been " an enforceable quarantine , " Trump said , adding that he 'd " rather not do it , but we may need it " to restrict people traveling from New York to other states .
" They 're having problems down in Florida .
A lot of New Yorkers are going down -- we do n't want that , " Trump said , adding that he had just spoken with Florida Gov .
Ron DeSantis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has sought to limit travel from the New York area to his state , using the National Guard to enforce mandatory quarantines on airline passengers arriving in Florida from New York , New Jersey and Connecticut .
Trump said he planned to speak with New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo later Saturday , though Cuomo said that evening that he had not yet heard from Trump about a possible quarantine .
The White House is not currently considering shutting down the New York City subway , he said .
Federal law gives the president and the federal government vast emergency powers in a pandemic , including the ability to quarantine people to slow the spread of disease between states .
But it 's not clear how the federal government would enforce what Trump described , and Cuomo and others questioned whether it would be legal .
Government officials in New York and New Jersey were taken aback by Trump 's comments .
Cuomo seemed surprised when asked about the statement during his daily coronavirus briefing in New York , telling reporters he had not discussed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't even know what that means , " Cuomo said , adding " I do n't know what you would be accomplishing " and that he does n't " like the sound of it .
"  New Jersey Gov .
Phil Murphy said he had a " very productive " conversation with Trump on Friday , but that " nothing about quarantine came up .
"  " I literally saw the story as I was walking into the room , " Murphy told reporters , at a daily press briefing on the coronavirus on Saturday .
Murphy said that his recent order requiring that all " non-essential " businesses close down until further notice is very aggressive and acknowledged that more action might be needed .
" Until further notified we are going to continue to do what we 're doing , " Murphy said .
" Do we consider regularly taking further steps ? You bet .
Whether prompted by the president or more often than not our own .
We will continue to be as aggressive as we have been , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued in a series of tweets that a strict quarantine of the three states was unnecessary and said that he wanted to speak to Trump " directly about his comments and any further enforcement actions , because confusion leads to panic .
"  And New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio 's office said it did not have any information about what Trump might be planning .
" We do n't have any details and are n't sure what the president means by his comment , " Freddi Goldstein , a spokesperson for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio , said in an email .
" What we know is that while New York City is the epicenter of this crisis right now , it 's in all 50 states .
What we need is more supplies for our hospitals -- that 's how we can save lives .
"  A senior administration official said Trump spoke with Cuomo on Air Force One .
The official said the White House coronavirus task force has been telling the president that stricter guidelines may be necessary in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the city and going elsewhere to self-quarantine for two weeks .
When Cuomo told CNN later Saturday that he had not talked with Trump since his remarks , he added : " I do n't believe that he could be serious , that any federal administration could be serious about a physical lockdown of states or parts of states across this country .
I do n't believe it is legal .
"  Cuomo also said that he believes other states restricting New Yorkers ' travel are not acting legally , and he said he would sue Rhode Island if the state did not reverse policies stopping cars with New York license plates as they enter the state .
" We 're talking to Rhode Island now .
If they do n't roll back that policy , I 'm going to sue Rhode Island because that clearly is unconstitutional , " Cuomo said on CNN .
Trump spoke with reporters as he left the White House for Norfolk , Va .
, where he delivered remarks at the Naval Station Norfolk send-off for the USNS Comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The Comfort " will open capacity all over New York City , " Trump said .
It is expected to arrive in New York on Monday .
The president was accompanied to Virginia by incoming chief of staff Rep .
Mark Meadows ( R-N .
) , Defense Secretary Mark Esper , senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and social media director Dan Scavino .
Acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien were also on hand , chatting as Trump spoke to a near-empty parking lot with the Comfort docked behind him .
The ship 's engines began stirring shortly before Trump concluded his remarks , and about a dozen sailors on the upper deck saluted the president as the ship pulled away toward the Chesapeake Bay as the speech concluded .
