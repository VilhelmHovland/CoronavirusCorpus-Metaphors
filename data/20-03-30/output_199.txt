Environment Court judge John Hassan said on Thursday the court would allow submitters three more weeks , or until 8 May , to contest the Proposed Marlborough Environment Plan ( PMEP ) .
The date had previously been pushed back 13 days after the Marlborough District Council failed to upload the " track changes " version of the environment plan until almost two weeks after its release .
" In light of the government 's announcement that New Zealand has now been placed at Covid-19 Alert Level 4 , and uncertainty over how long such measures will last , the court will extend the period for lodging appeals to ensure parties are not put under any undue pressure .
"  The judge said the Environment Court was " well set up " to work from home , and would continue to process and accept filings like normal - the only difference being the court currently did not need hard copies .
Marlborough District Council chief executive Mark Wheeler said on Friday morning that the decision , which was not influenced by the council , did not surprise him .
Mr Wheeler said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extension due to the coronavirus outbreak .
" We 're quite comfortable with the extension , " he said .
The plan brought three of the region 's major plans into a single document - a " New Zealand first " - and defined what activities were appropriate in Marlborough 's urban , rural and coastal environments .
It was expected the plan would save ratepayers money , as the council would only have to review one plan , instead of three , every few years .
More than 1300 submissions were made on the plan , covering more than 17,500 separate points .
Hearings for the plan started in November 2017 at Blenheim 's Omaka Marae and finished in April last year .
Principal environment judge Laurie Newhook said the Environment Court was not classed as an essential service by the government , and would not physically sit in court while the Level 4 alert was in place .
He said some remote activity on cases would continue , depending on the urgency of the case , but it was unlikely hearings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most urgent circumstances " .
