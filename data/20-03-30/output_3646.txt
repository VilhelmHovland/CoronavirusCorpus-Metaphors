Asian countries show signs of containing Covid-19 -- here 's what we can learn from them  Professor Wilmot James is a former South African member of parliament who now teaches political science and conducts ( non-clinical ) research on children and catastrophes in pediatrics at Columbia University in New York City .
The Brenthurst Foundation spoke to him about the Covid-19 pandemic , which he calls a ' slow-moving hurricane ' -- a wildly uncertain event affecting every part of our personal and public lives .
When you compare the rate of new infections for European countries with those of Asian countries , a startling pattern emerges :  South Korea , Japan , Singapore and Hong Kong report a much slower rate of infection than the US , UK , Spain , Italy and others .
What is the difference between these countries ? According to Professor James , they learnt as they went along , and acted swiftly .
" There are a couple of lessons there .
The one is that if you test ' aggressively ' you know what you 're looking at , you know who 's at risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the scale of the problem and to act on that .
So , the lesson is rapid detection and surveillance .
" The second is -- and South Korea learnt this the hard way , although they have had one of the best responses of any country -- you need to shut down travel and you need to introduce physical distancing very quickly and scale it up fast .
"  The point of physical distancing , explains James , is to stop transmission of the virus and give your health system -- hospitals , equipment and staff -- time to catch up .
That way , the system wo n't be crippled or overwhelmed by the number of cases at any point in time , as is the case in places like Spain and Italy at the moment .
Corona will necessitate improvements to our medical systems  On the South African government 's response to the pandemic , he says : " It 's clear that South Africa took some really good advice and acted swiftly .
"  The Global Health Security Index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released their global report for all countries in October last year .
" We ranked South Africa 34th , " he revealed .
" When we look at the individual scoring , we are strongest when it comes to detection and surveillance , but not very strong when it comes to resilience of our health systems .
It 's therefore right to try and scale up immediately .
" There is a project underway to improve our systems ; there is no doubt that this emergency will accelerate that improvement , because this is a threat .
Of course , some systems are harder to fix than others .
Hospitals , informal settlements , etc , will be a huge challenge .
But when it comes to Covid-19 , we 've done well ( so far ) .
" South Africa has taken the right move in being led by the president and taking a whole-of-society approach , " says James .
" In Vital Signs , the book that we put out in January , there 's a recommendation that the president take the lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presidency for constant vigilance .
I 'm not saying he 's taken our advice or read our book , but he 's certainly risen to the occasion , and has taken the lead for Africa .
Especially since South Africa is assuming the leadership of the African Union this year .
"  Our lives could change for the better after this  " The economic fallout from the pandemic is already a dramatic one .
And the severity will depend on how long the pandemic lasts .
But it will burn out at some point .
And how it will affect productivity and supply chains is not clear , but it will be dramatic .
" About $9 trillion has been shaven from stock markets already .
" The World Bank estimated a few years ago that a Spanish flu-like pandemic could shave off $4 trillion , but this is probably an underestimate .
We will certainly see some kind of economic depression and this will also speed up deglobalisation .
" We will have to travel less -- which will be a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a good thing for South Africa .
Store-front retail will continue on a downward trend , as delivery apps and online orders become even more popular .
" Economists say there was a need for a correction anyway .
What comes out of it , whether it will be long term -- the effect is not entirely clear .
" But I think there 's also a sense on a human level that people are thinking , ' What is really important for me in my life ? ' .
Maybe there are some durable lessons there -- that we are spending more time with our families .
