CORONAVIRUS : It 's tough self-isolating as a family - but what if you live alone ?  Daily challenges of life in lockdown  I LIVE in a busy village , close to pubs , shops and restaurants .
In the evenings I often hear live music from one of the bars , the chatter of people out and about , and in the mornings I wake up to the sound of shop deliveries .
I never realised how much I loved that noise till now .
The eerie silence that hangs everywhere is deafening .
Normally I enjoy a bit of peace and quiet , some respite from the frenzied pace of life , but I have learned over recent days that too much quiet is unsettling .
I am living in isolation , in a house with just me in it .
I 've always liked living alone ; it is a choice I made and I 'm very used to it .
Over the years I have shared houses and flats , and they were some of the best times of my life , but now I like having my own space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as I left it .
The washing-up has either been done or is still sitting in the sink , depending on whether I had the time or inclination to do it .
When I close the front door , I shut the world out for a while , and it 's just me , in my own space .
Now that space is my workplace as well as my home .
Like many people , I am working from home and living in lockdown , alone .
Living alone is fine , so long as you see people regularly .
But I ca n't call round to my sister 's for a coffee , we ca n't walk her dog together or have Sunday tea with her kids .
I ca n't invite friends over , or arrange to meet up anywhere .
I still ca n't get used to that .
This is a new way of life for everyone .
People 's lives are unravelling in various ways , from the friends who left flowers on their mothers ' doorsteps last Sunday to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bistro , which he loved , and is now bored and restless at home instead of being at school or out with his mates .
I do n't know who I feel sorry for most in lockdown - the kids whose last leg of school , those rites-of-passage weeks you carry through life as precious memories , was suddenly snatched away ; the elderly in social isolation , some alone and frightened ; the unpaid carers whose wellbeing depends on respite they can no longer access ; the children who are safer out of their homes than in them ; the women at risk from abusive partners ; the young families cooped up and stressed out ; the exhausted , frustrated frontline medical staff trying not to dissolve into despair ; couples whose weddings are called off ; the poor chap in the Co-op I saw being sworn at when he politely asked an irate shopper not to fill her trolley with several huge cartons of milk .
The eeriness is n't just in the silence .
It 's in the space between us .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people .
I felt self conscious , like I had no business being out on the street .
Were curtains twitching ? A woman was leaning out of an upstairs window , chatting to a neighbour in his garden .
Was it just me or did they tut as I walked past ? " We 're allowed one walk a day , " I muttered , quickening up to pass them .
Who knew a stroll in the spring sunshine could trigger low level paranoia .
Even the birdsong was unsettling .
I walked past an empty playground , which was beyond sad .
As we keep hearing , these are " unprecedented times " and everyone will have challenges .
" It 's like a bad dream " - who has n't said that at least once lately ?  But one day , eventually , this will be over .
And maybe we 'll come out of it not taking so much for granted .
I hope to value simple pleasures - going to the cinema , a pub quiz , a curry with friends , swimming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games with my family - because I know how quickly they can be gone .
