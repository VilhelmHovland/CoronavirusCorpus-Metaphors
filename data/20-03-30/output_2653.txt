NEWS RELEASE PASO POR PASO ******************** Four Paso Por Paso directors visited Guatemala in early February and fortunately returned well before COVID-19 became an issue .
While we all recognize the serious threat we face here in Canada , imagine how desperate the situation will be if the virus gets a foothold in any of the less developed countries including Guatemala .
Since our return , the government of Guatemala has taken a number of measures , including closing schools , in the hope their actions will be effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 .
We will continue to follow the situation in Guatemala .
We were delighted to be part of the tradition of the sponsored students coming to Panajachel , making Valentine cards for their sponsors , renewing friendships and receiving food baskets .
It is an excellent opportunity to sit down with our students and get to know them and their needs better .
The extra food provided by Paso is always appreciated and needed .
We visited the school in Tierra Linda and as always , were welcomed with presentations by children of all ages .
We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppet show of Little Red Riding Hood .
The children are always so cheerful and welcoming and it is wonderful to have the opportunity to see them perform and to experience their joy in attending school .
Their teachers are to be commended .
It was a coincidence that the day of our visit the electricity grid was down for the entire district and there were no lights or microphones at the school .
With their typical resourcefulness , the show went on .
Following the presentations , we had a meeting with the principal and teachers , who really wanted us to know how much they have appreciated our support over the years and to show us how our support has made a difference in the lives of the students and the learning environment .
While our funding has made some significant improvements , for example with the construction of the roof over the outdoor area , we know there is still much we can do .
Consequently , we asked them to identify items that would have a positive impact on the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items identified was the need for decent desks for the students .
After many years of use they are in deplorable condition .
The PASO Board will be considering this ' need ' and will be looking at ways in which we might begin to replace the desks in the future .
The balance of our time in Panajachel was spent visiting the homes of our students which is a very important part of our annual trip .
The students and their families are always so welcoming and offer whatever hospitality is within their means .
We always feel like honoured guests in their homes and they appreciate our annual visits and our interest .
It was a great trip and it is always very moving and humbling to see how appreciative and thankful the people are .
Paso also sponsors students to attend post-secondary institutions and provides funding for micro-loans for women in the village of Tierra Linda .
More information about these two activities will be provided later .
