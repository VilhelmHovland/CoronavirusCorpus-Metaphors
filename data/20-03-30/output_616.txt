At this point , her friends backed out .
It was just too much to ask during such a stressful time at school .
Her parents , Becky and R .
, encouraged her to see how far she could go .
So , she finished the paperwork , did the doctor 's visit , did another interview which included playing a test game , graduated from college and waited .
A couple weeks later , she got a call that the show would be flying her and a friend to California , but that there was still no guarantee that she would make the final cut .
She was incredulous .
" Am I being punked ? " she wondered .
SHE HITS A WALL , LITERALLY  She picked her mom as her plus-one " because she 's my best friend " and the two flew out June 2019 .
Much of the day , she hung out with several other potential contestants , not knowing until an hour before the taping that she had been selected .
She was summoned to get her hair and makeup done and an outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be wearing in the Taj Mah Wall game .
All she had to do was memorize a few items from a collage she was briefly shown and repeat them back to Ellen when it was her turn .
It seemed easy enough at first .
" When you get up there and you 're in a front of a live audience and Ellen is standing like eight feet from you , your mind just goes blank , " she said .
She held her own for several rounds and was second to last when she incorrectly guessed that she 'd seen a star in the collage .
Ellen pushed a button and she was pulled back , screaming through a break-away " stone " wall where she disappeared behind a stream of fog and lights .
She landed gently on a mat behind the set .
She wants viewers to know she lasted much longer than it seemed .
Several of her correct answers were trimmed for time .
" It definitely looks like we do n't have good memories , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ '  The show was done , the episode taped and she was sworn to secrecy with no idea when it would air .
And , no , she did n't get to personally meet Ellen .
" I was just happy that my name came out of her mouth , " Sass said .
Fast forward to March 2020 .
She got a job as a supply chain coordinator with Aveda Corp .
Her family slipped in a quick trip to Greece to visit her brother Charlie who was studying abroad before the coronavirus brought them home .
The episode aired while they were away .
" Greece is about seven hours ahead .
My phone was blowing up in the middle of the night , " she said .
She was surprised at the feedback from friends .
" People said , you are such a light and such a positive , energetic spirit , " she said .
" I did n't realize that until I saw myself on TV .
