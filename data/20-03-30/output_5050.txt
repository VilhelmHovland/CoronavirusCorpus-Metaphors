US extends social distancing to April 30 in hopes of avoiding 100,000 coronavirus deaths  ( CNN ) -- Social distancing guidelines that have shut down cites across the US have been extended to April 30 as a top US health official warns that 100,000 or more people could die in the US from the novel coronavirus .
" What we 're trying to do is not to let that happen , " Dr .
Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said Sunday .
The guidelines urge Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 and advise older people to stay home .
Fauci estimates between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths are possible , he told CNN 's Jake Tapper on " State of the Union .
" But , he said , that could change .
" Whenever the models come in , they give a worst-case scenario and a best-case scenario .
Generally , the reality is somewhere in the middle , " he said .
As of Sunday evening , there were more than 139,000 cases of coronavirus in the US .
At least 2,429 people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 in the US , President Donald Trump said , " we all together have done a very good job .
"  Fauci called the extension a " wise and prudent decision " in mitigating the spread of the virus that could reach more than a million people in the US .
Doctors and nurses describe chaos on the front lines  Whether it is from uncharted territory , dwindling supplies or hospitals feeling the spike in cases , doctors and nurses describe chaos on the front lines .
Trauma physicians that normally rely on literature , research and training are now " flying blind " without instruments and building guidelines from the ground up , the physician said .
And when they are done treating coronavirus patients in trauma , they head back to the ICU to treat more .
An attending physician in the anesthesiology department of a Long Island , New York , hospital told CNN that a shortage of supplies has staff wiping down and reusing single-use protective equipment and using anesthesia machines as ventilators when they ran out .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
" There are just so many patients who are so sick it seems impossible to keep up with the demand .
"  And even when the supply is adequate , the demand can be overwhelming , an emergency room nurse at NYU-Langone Brooklyn told CNN .
It is unlike anything the nurse has seen before : patients in their 20s to 90s being intubated , sending patients only to have them back the next week needing intubation and sectioning off the emergency room for coronavirus and everything else .
Though its getting harder and harder to confine the number of coronavirus patients to one area , the nurse said .
Deaths of a state employee , a journalist and an infant reported  Illinois officials announced Saturday the death of an infant who tested positive for the virus .
The death of a child younger than one year with coronavirus has previously been reported in China .
That child had a pre-existing condition .
The same day , Louisiana Gov .
John Bel Edwards announced that April Dunn , the 33-year-old chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complications from coronavirus .
" I was proud to have an advocate like April on the task force and on my staff .
She set a great example for how other businesses could make their workforce more inclusive , " Edwards said .
CBS News producer and talent executive Maria Mercader , 54 , died Sunday of Covid-19 in New York Sunday , CBS said .
She had been on medical leave for an unrelated matter since late February , the network said .
FDA issues limited emergency use of treatment  Without an approved treatment for the virus , the US Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to use on patients hospitalized with coronavirus .
Though evidence is limited on the efficacy of chloroquine , or its closely related analogue hydroxychloroquine , the FDA said the drugs ' benefits outweighed their risk .
" Based on the totality of scientific evidence available to FDA , it is reasonable to believe that chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be effective in treating COVID-19 , " said the agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients who are currently hospitalized and weigh at least 110 pounds , and health care providers must contact their local or state health departments to access the drugs .
Talk of quarantine turns to travel advisories  The state of New York has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the US .
Officials have struggled to obtain the resources to match the cases that have surged to more than 59,000 .
Deaths from the virus in the state increased by 237 in less than 24 hours over the weekend , reaching at least 965 deaths .
Trump had contemplated issuing an enforceable quarantine for parts of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , but later said it will not be necessary .
Instead , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel advisory Saturday , urging residents of the three states to " refrain from nonessential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately .
" The states would have " full discretion " on implementing the advisory , which exempts employees in critical fields .
" The fact of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " New Jersey Gov .
Phil Murphy said when asked about the advisory on ABC 's " This Week " Sunday .
" A travel warning , we 're fine with .
"  Murphy added that his state is " all in on flattening the curve .
"  The CDC advisory came as some state officials began implementing their own restrictions on visitors from outside their states .
Florida has opened highway checkpoints to screen for motorists coming from Connecticut , New Jersey , New York and Louisiana and require them to isolate for 14 days or the duration of their visit , the Florida Department of Transportation ( FDOT ) said .
Louisiana has the third most cases in the country and the second most deaths per capita .
Delaware Gov .
John Carney modified his State of Emergency declaration Sunday to also order out-of-state travelers to self-quarantine for two weeks .
