COVID-19 Stuff Here  No , the idea is that when your testing regime is based on clear and obvious symptoms and there is a population that you know to be , in general , asymptomatic carriers of the virus you do n't lock up your most vulnerable with them .
You also do n't put your most at risk population in a position where they are required to make more contact with others ( e .
grandparents caring for children of health workers ) .
These are significant considerations basic computer simulations do n't take into account .
No , you just let them move freely among the community infected others and make the situation worse .
irrespective of the modelling and how many asymptomatic individuals may / may not be in the community .
the lived experience is that where either massive testing and isolation ( Singapore , Taiwan , Sth Korea ) or lockdown/severe restriction ( China other than Hubei ) has been practised then the number of cases expressing the disease has been dramatically reduced .
Where it has nt or has been implemented too late ( Italy , Spain , USA ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial , it is a judgement call , the scientists/medicos advising governments have been pro " go early , go hard " , the economists , and some modellers much more restrained , both here and OS ; this from Andy Slavitt , who used to run Medicaid in the US for Obama  COLOR=rgba ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 .
) The scientists are gloomy .
They generally do n't like any solution or recommendation other than complete lock down , testing ( which we do n't have ) , and strict controls .
They are pessimists or realists or some kind of " ists " .
Almost every other suggestion is met with why it does n't work .
DHS and risk and security people are all about probability , odds , actions , and nimble protocols .
They know there 's no perfect answers .
I relate more to this group , which is why I need the scientists and their wisdom .
The combination was powerful together .
/COLOR  my personal bias is the shut it down theory , and although it will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive , so i can completely understand those who want an economically pragmatic approach .
in the near future we will hopefully have a widely available antibody test to see who is now ( hopefully ) immune and not contagious , allowing them to return to " normal " activity , whatever that will look like in 6 - 12 months or longer .

in the meantime i implore you all  STAY THE FUCK AT HOME UNLESS YOU REALLY , REALLY HAVE TO GO OUT  I get the economic pragmatism but many behind that are acting like this would be the sole cause of the impending recession .
Which it is not .
All this has done is brough forward that timeframe .
Better to concern ourselves with the health issues now and then approach solutions to the economic malaise we 've been building toward for some time .
If they ai nt in lockdown in 3 days , they 're fucked .
Actually , less than 3 .
they are , i have friends in NYC saying that front line medicos are using garbage bags with hole for head and arms as PPE ! ! ! they have run out of proper gear - gowns , gloves and no appropriate masks .
the modelling here ( in VIc at least ) is a little more reassuring but totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates clearly rise massively when hospitals are overrun and lots of people ca n't be given treatment .
A major issue is we do n't really know a lot of things .
In a pandemic you ca n't really wait to find out what is going to happen before you take action because by then you 've severely limited your choices .
Fatality rates for the flu are what they are because we vaccinate lots of people particularly those in the high risk categories .
Yes , and many people require hospitalisation for illnesses apart from Covid-19 .

Rubbish , this is not just bringing ' forward an impending recession ' it is plunging us into a recession deeper than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us sustaining consecutive growth quarters below those of the Great Depression and unemployment rates higher .
What a ridiculous write-off it is to claim halting all production for months is somehow on par with some abstract ' impending ' recession .
Rubbish , this is not just bringing ' forward an impending recession ' it is plunging us into a recession deeper than we 've ever seen before .
Even the conservative forecasts have us sustaining consecutive growth quarters below those of the Great Depression and unemployment rates higher .

Mate , debt levels have been rising for some time .
The fact that our economy can not sustain a short shut down due to the fact that it will burden businesses and their obligations in relation to that is n't the sign of a healthy economy built on solid foundations .

Absolute folly .
The idea we were on trajectory for a recession magnitudes worse than the Great Depression is completely laughable .
It 's so telling that the ones yelling the loudest for lockdowns seem to have no idea of the consequences .

I 've never suggested it would be magnitudes worse than the great depression .
I 've been arguing for health over economics acknowledging it will have economic ramifications .
I 'm fully aware of the consequences but I 'm prioritising health .
But please enlighten us as to the true cause of the economic impact of shutting down and why it 's vital for businesses to keep operating if there is n't serious underlying issues in the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea we were on trajectory for a recession magnitudes worse than the Great Depression is completely laughable .
Which is why nobody was suggesting it .
The fact is the Libs - being " superior economic managers " - refused to take pragmatic financial measures to keep a society on an upward trajectory .
Rising debt , no real wage growth , denial of increases to Newstart , and a raft of tax cuts ( mostly for people who did n't need them ) put on the table as some kind of salve .
They 've done nothing to arrest the upward motion of net debt against GDP that Labor left them after the GFC , and chained themselves to the anchor of a future surplus which in real terms - at $7B - meant very little when the previous treasury under Joe Hockey declared a Budget Emergency but the red arrows kept heading north .
Interest rates at all time lows .
National consumer debt at all time highs ( housing going mental ) and very few levers left to pull for the RBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession under ScoMo at some point , or at best a break in the 29-year growth .
Whether it could have been rescued by stimulus is up for debate BUT if it was stimulus in the form of infrastructure building , well we could use some in the energy sector .
Heap of easy yards to be made politically in decarbonisation via wind farms and transmission upgrades .
