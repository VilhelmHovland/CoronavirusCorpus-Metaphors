SABC News journalists were covering service delivery protests in Motherwell when they allegedly came under fire from the SAPS .
SABC News journalists Zolani Moya and Gcobani Blom were hospitalised in Port Elizabeth on Friday after an alleged assault at the hands of the South African Police Service ( SAPS ) .
Moya and Blom were covering a service delivery protest in Motherwell , Port Elizabeth .
The SAPS Riot Unit reportedly rolled in to disperse the protesters , but in the process , it is alleged that they opened fire on the journalists with rubber bullets .
SABC journalists shot with rubber bullets  " We were informed by our regional editor , Diedre Uren that at 9:00 yesterday our team , Zolani Moya and Gcobani Blom , were at the Motherwell intersection on the Addo Road outside Port Elizabeth covering a story about service delivery protests when they came under fire from the police , " said SABC Editor in Chief Phathiswa Magopeni .
Magopeni said that the journalists were clearly identifiable and the protest peaceful yet disruptive to the flow of traffic .
She would add that the journalists were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blocking of the roads , " Magopeni added .
" The crew was identifiable in a SABC branded bakkie .
The cameraman was on the back of the bakkie filming when the radio reporter noticed an oncoming ' Hippo ' riot vehicle .
They immediately jumped down and tried to get into the vehicle to leave the area .
The community was around them but peaceful .
"  " Our vehicle was not blocking the road as it was parked on the side of the road .
But police without warning started firing rubber bullets , and as our team tried to flee , they were shot at and injured .
" This attack was unnecessary and extremely hostile .
Every care is taken to train our journalists on what to do in hostile situations .
They are told to clearly identify themselves which they did .
It is a brazen attack that must be investigated at the very highest level of the police leadership .
"  The alleged attack has been condemned by the South African National Editors ' Forum ( SANEF ) .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of journalists from the South African Broadcasting Services ( SABC ) , although clearly identified , came under attack by riot police SAPS and were pelted with rubber bullets , " a statement from SANEF reads .
" SANEF will table this matter at its upcoming meeting with the National Police Commissioner and the Ministry of Police .
" The attacks and assaults on journalists at crime scenes by police , and the censorship by police of journalists doing their job at crime scenes are on the increase .
" These actions prevent journalists from informing the public of the truth , a right enshrined and protected in our constitution .
" Service delivery protests are a common feature in our country and journalists have a right and a duty to covering these stories .
The officer responsible must be held accountable .
"  The injured journalists were taken to hospital but are expected to make a full recovery .
