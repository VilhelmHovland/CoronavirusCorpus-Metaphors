Cometh the hour  There are three major levers for pharmacies to consider for business survival during the coronavirus pandemic , say Bruce Annabel and Mal Scrymgeour  Cometh the Hour is a truncation of an old English phrase , ' Cometh the hour , cometh the man ' meaning either that every person ( or industry ) is particularly good at a certain task , and when the appropriate opportunity arises , that person can prove themselves .
Or , it can also refer to an ideal scenario where a person is most needed , they suddenly come to the rescue .
Some in the industry believe that pharmacy is in the role of rescuer in this health crisis .
It 's more complicated than that and probably not the positive news that some have hoped for .
After an initial uplift in sales , if anything , this crisis puts more financial pressure on pharmacies than ever before .
We 'll explain more in this article .
There are three major levers for businesses to pull : Respond , Recover and Thrive .
Respond .
To respond , you need to prepare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it survive , because that is in fact what it is .
Determine your priorities .
There are four key focus areas :  Stay well .
If you and your team are not well , the business does not function , or perhaps even open .
If you are not well , you can not perform your role in helping the community survive and recover from the health crisis .
Staying well is job number one .
It must always be the first priority .
Get product .
The wholesalers are working very hard under difficult circumstances to ensure supply , we saw their excellent efforts during the recent bush fires earlier this year .
However , wholesalers rely on suppliers who in turn often rely on other suppliers further down the supply chain .
The concept of ' Just in Time ' manufacturing and keeping the lowest levels of stock that you practically can , is suddenly a deeply flawed model .
Without doubt , there will be a ' supply chain bubble ' that we anticipate having an impact in late April and May .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying as people try to secure products , which in turn creates gaps  For products made in the US and Europe , this bubble will be months long .
Get used to shortages and out of stocks .
Sell/distribute product .
That might mean you continue to retail as you are , it might mean you have a ' restricted access pharmacy ' where you can service customers , but with no contact .
Deliveries might be something you find your business having to do in a big way , particularly for older people at home including those supported by the In-Home Care packages .
If you have an online store , this might suddenly become a large part of your business .
If you do n't have an online store , you might find that you need a team taking phone orders or making outbound calls .
The upshot of this is that the potential to keep operating might mean more labour and different ways of working requiring different skills .
Telehealth interactions demand will increase .
That will change the economics , HR and reinvent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business very quickly .
You need to communicate clearly to five groups :  Team  Customers  Suppliers and wholesalers  Your bank , accountant and financial advisor  Government  Your team need to know what is happening , management of different scenario 's and how to stay well .
Your customers need to know how you are operating , what you can and ca n't do and most importantly , the rules of engagement including how to deal with fearful customers .
Understand what your stretched suppliers and wholesalers can and ca n't do .
Your financial advisors/accountants will need to understand what changes are taking place and assist you manage the business through this health crisis .
Fortunately , pharmacy is an essential service and a critical support resource for consumers .
There has been a huge reactionary spike in sales but that is about to slow and it 's reasonable to assert that more stock and your labour costs may increase as detailed above .
However , as time progresses slowing sales may fall below historical levels for a time until latent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure sufficient funds are retained to pay for the purchases made during the spike , i .
: conserve cash , manage it carefully and manage overheads carefully .
It is not a pretty situation and will imperil many pharmacies .
Those with debt should alert their financiers that they may need to take advantage of the loan repayment moratorium offered and interest capitalisation packages .
Fortunately , interest rates have fallen to an all-time low that will assist cash flow management .
In addition , small business financial support and initiatives such as payroll tax support is available on a state by state basis .
The fifth group must be considered and that is dealing with state and federal governments to source every support initiative available .
Get in touch with your financial advisers for details .
The situation will keep changing and communication with all groups is a must .
Recover  Whatever way you look at it , this crisis is unlikely to be short lived and when we emerge through the other side the world will be a bit different to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , we will be hugely dependent on technology and probably become quite adept at using it plus home deliveries will be a strong channel .
The shape of industries will change .
Recovery is unfortunately , going to be a medium-term play .
What do you need to do ?  There are six areas you will need to address :  Management team .
For smaller businesses , this is often the owner or a couple of partners making the decisions .
For the larger businesses these teams may largely be in place .
Our very strong recommendation is to get a core group of executive level advisors , often this means getting expert help .
You 'll need financial advice ( typically your existing provider/bank/accountant ) .
Strategic advisors/industry experts .
Working with your Doctors will be more critical than ever .
What shape does this take ? It will need to be much more structured than the previous low-key relationships most of us have had in the past .
Operational expertise -- often this comes from you .
As you 've seen with many larger businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often you 'll need support in making those decisions .
The existing skills you have employed in the business might not be what you need moving forward .
Digital might suddenly be critical and that might mean you need to onboard that expertise either internally or externally .
Financial continuity .
This will be crucial as inventory and wages costs are likely to increase , your pricing will need to move .
With a jump in prices due to short supply , you 'll need to remain competitive too .
Staying on top of costs and adjusting pricing will be absolutely critical for your businesses to survival .
It 's now a weekly task as a minimum .
It 's not going to be an easy road ahead .
External advice would be smart to get .
And now .
Supply Chain .
Work closely to fully understand the supply chain issues with your wholesalers and suppliers .
Networking with pharmacies in your trade area to swap stock may need to be broadened well beyond the existing network  Customer engagement .
Suddenly email groups , marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement become critical .
The old product and price advertising catalogues are n't quite so relevant .
Expertise , advice and product availability will be the new black .
Have you noticed price is no longer the big issue it was ? It has been replaced by simply being in stock .
Digital capabilities .
What has been seen as nice to have suddenly becomes a must have .
We recommend investigating Microsoft Teams as an option for communicating with others in a business context .
We 've found it to be excellent .
Thrive  The focus right now is maintaining the business and responding to the crisis .
Thriving and looking at a future model is probably some way off yet .
However , smart businesspeople are not only navigating the current crisis , but also looking beyond and seeing what a new future might look like .
Without the benefits of a crystal ball , it is difficult to envisage just what this looks like , but we can put in place a framework to work through the options .
There are four key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how have we responded , what do customers want , and how do they transact in this new paradigm ?  Marketplace review .
What does the competitive and supply landscape look like ? How will it change ? What is our role in the new world ? What is our market position ?  Recovery and contingency planning .
The future will continue to evolve and even if we determine a course of action , it will likely change .
We 'd recommend developing a minimum of three scenarios .
Financial restructuring .
Some businesses will escape unscathed or potentially better off than they were , some will become insolvent .
Whatever the case it is highly likely that the financial situation will be different .
Once you have determined the steps above , you can look at your financial options .
We are in unprecedented times .
Rapid adjustment is required .
Things will be different .
Your priorities are clear .
Respond -- stay well is priority one , and survival of you , your team and your business .
