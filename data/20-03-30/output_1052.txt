But those rules are coming under severe pressure because of the virus-induced crisis , with regulators trying to balance the rights of passengers eager to recover whatever costs they incurred with transport companies trying desperately to stay afloat .
The Commission said in official guidance last week that airlines are still obliged to offer refunds to passengers despite the coronavirus crisis .
Airlines have been lobbying for years to water down the EU legislation -- which they think is exceptionally costly .
Those efforts have ramped up during the crisis : Airline lobbies A4E and ERA wrote a joint letter to the Commission earlier this month saying the right to a refund " could have serious financial implications for airlines in the short term .

The British Business Travel Association wrote to airlines calling on them to stick to the rules on providing refunds .
" The current EU regulation on air passenger rights only provides harmonized rules in case of cancellation by airlines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general of consumer rights group BEUC .
If passengers themselves opt not to fly , then refunds depend on airline small print and national rules .
" Consumers should be free to cancel travel booked in the near future without cost .
"  Asked about its refund policy , a spokesperson for Brussels Airlines said it is still in place .
" If the passenger does not wish to make use of this ticket value and prefers a refund of his ticket , he/she is of course free to request one , " the spokesperson said , adding that the high number of claims means the carrier will take longer to handle them .
However , a letter from Transport Commissioner Adina Valean to EU transport ministers and seen by POLITICO said the Commission is working on " further clarifications " on its legislation given the circumstances .

so vouchers work just fine for me , " said Sabina Ciofu , who runs EU and trade policy at lobby group TechUK .

" Passengers should have the choice : vouchers are not mandatory , " she said .
EU rail passenger rights rules , currently being reformed , say operators should offer passengers a cash refund if that 's what they want .
