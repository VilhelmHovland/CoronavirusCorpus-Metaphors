Sarah is a mother of three young kids with another on the way .
After being laid-off from her full-time position , she took a part-time job at Trader Joe 's -- which she then voluntarily left amid the coronavirus pandemic to focus on the health of her family and herself .
The 39-year-old mom , who was born in New Zealand but now lives in New Jersey , opens up about her experience of working at a grocery store when its employees are considered essential -- and who are risking coronavirus exposure from crowds -- and making the difficult decision of choosing health over income .
I 'm 21 weeks pregnant and I have three young children , ages 12 , 8 and 6 .
The good thing was , throughout the day , they give you many opportunities to leave your post and go clean and do your sanitizing and take a break if you needed to .
They were very good about all of that stuff , but in the end , looking through different articles about risk factors associated with the disease , I decided I just could n't be in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth with management there about any way to make my duties a little bit different because of my high risk with pregnancy , and I also have Type 2 Diabetes .
So , they gave me the leave of absence option , which they supported -- but obviously , it 's unpaid .
Trader Joe 's is one of the best employers that I 've ever worked for , and it was only a part-time job .
They said I can come back whenever this calms down .
So , I just had to make a call for my health .
They said , " It 's more important that I 'm out of harm 's way " because it is a very front-line position .
The company has been very supportive , though .
They 've called twice already , in two weeks , to check up on me and see how I 'm doing .
But making the decision was hard .
I would n't call it lucky , but I was semi-lucky enough to be able to go on unemployment back in late January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , we were already taking a cut , losing full-time income for unemployment .
Any extra money I was making was contributing to the house -- that was our grocery money , our gas money , whatever it would be .
I really had to talk to my husband , who works at a trucking repair agency , and say , " I know it 's not safe that we 'll be losing a couple of hundred dollars a week .
" And it has been tougher .
But the only good thing about it is , we 're not going anywhere or doing anything , so we only have the essential things to afford .
My husband , however , still goes to work but he is going into his own office .
And when he comes home , he 's not to touch any of us , straight into the shower .
When I was working at Trader Joe 's , I found , in general , that the customers we dealt with were very patient and understanding .
They understood that it 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer .
I actually was given a Dunkin Donuts gift card from a customer , thanking me for coming in .
So everyone was pretty orderly and Trader Joe 's does a really good job of controlling that environment .
But even if they had offered me a few extra dollars , I still probably would have bowed out because I think my health is more important .

Trying to do distance learning with three children is difficult .
I 'm used to having some downtime and I do n't get that right now .
But overall , everything is good .
We 've been doing a reward system at home with the kids called " C " bucks , for corona-bucks .
The kids collect dollars if they do their work , or if they 're not arguing , etc .
And when things open , we 're looking forward to getting out with them and doing something social .
It 'll be a treat for them .
As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do question going in for certain things but at the same time , I feel like things like maternal doctor 's appointments are pretty well policed .
And I 'm supposed to have my mother come over from New Zealand .
She 's there now and it 's a whole different ballgame , seeing how they 're approaching it over there .
She would n't come right now anyway , but I 'm hoping later .
I 'm just hoping all of this goes away .
