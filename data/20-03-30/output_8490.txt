10 Scriptures to Give Peace to Coronavirus Fears  Jessica Brodie  202030 Mar  As the coronavirus death toll rises and the world responds with curfews , government shutdowns , school , and business closures , and emergency aid , fear is on the rise .
Many of us not only fear what is but also what could be : Will I get the virus ? Will my child , parent , or other loved one become infected or die ?  What about the economy or the impact on local businesses ? Will I lose my job ? Can my retirement account survive ? Will we see another Great Depression ? For some , even deeper fears begin to spiral as worry builds about food-hoarding , price-gouging , looting , and the possibility of a long-term police state .
But take heart : God knows our deepest fears , even the ones we can not speak aloud , and His holy Word , the Bible , offers a host of comforting verses to bring peace in the center of our distress .
What Does the Bible Say about Fear and Peace for the Christian ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus Christ , we can take comfort in one critical , all-important truth : We are children of the Lord , " born not of natural descent , nor of human decision or a husband 's will , but born of God " ( John 1:13 ) .
Indeed , we belong to God .
For in Jesus , we have eternal life , and nothing on this earth can prevent that ( John 3:16 , John 5:24 ) .
Because of this , we do n't need to worry .
The word " fear " appears more than 300 times in most English-language translations of the Bible .
Most of those references involve God assuring us -- through Jesus , through His prophets , through songs and stories and more -- that we are safe with Him .
Matthew 10:28 tells us plainly , " Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but can not kill the soul .
Rather , be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell .
"  That is , the only proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving fear of the almighty and awesome power of God , and we can rest easy knowing we are His children and loved by Him .
This leads us to what we should experience as God 's precious children : a true and unrelenting sense of peace .
The word " peace " also appears hundreds of times throughout the Bible .
As Jesus tells His disciples in John 14:27 , " Peace I leave with you ; my peace I give you .
I do not give to you as the world gives .
Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid .
"  Here , then , are verses of reassurance to cling to during this pandemic .
Scriptures 1 - 3  " So do not fear , for I am with you ; do not be dismayed , for I am your God .
I will strengthen you and help you ; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand .
" -- Isaiah 41:10  Here , God reassures His people that not only will He help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be delivered from all troubles through the promised Messiah .
I am with you , I am your God , and I will help you , He tells us -- in the coronavirus , in persecution , in everything .
Do Not Be Anxious  " Do not be anxious about anything , but in every situation , by prayer and petition , with thanksgiving , present your requests to God .
And the peace of God , which transcends all understanding , will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus .
" -- Philippians 4:6-7  Here , the apostle Paul assures Christians the proper response to any situation is to pray to God for help .
When we give God our fears , we receive an abiding peace in return .
Do Not Worry  " Therefore do not worry about tomorrow , for tomorrow will worry about itself .
Each day has enough trouble of its own .
" -- Matthew 6:34  God calls His people to a " Kingdom mentality , " in which we focus our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our needs .
Jesus tells us simple creatures like birds do not worry about the future , and God takes perfectly good care of them .
Why should we , His children , expect anything less ? We are loved by God , and we do n't need to worry about what will happen to our bodies , our family , the economy , or any other earthly concerns .
We just need to trust God and be at peace that our daily concerns are covered .
Scriptures 4 - 6  Slide 3 of 5  4 .
God Did Not Give Us a Spirit of Fear  " For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid , but gives us power , love , and self-discipline .
" -- 2 Timothy 1:7  We are filled with a powerful , loving , self-controlled spirit , given to us as children of God by the Lord Himself .
This is not a spirit that bends to the chaos of panic but one that rises up in the name of God Almighty to do His work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Fear ?  " The Lord is my light and my salvation -- whom shall I fear ? The Lord is the stronghold of my life -- of whom shall I be afraid ? " -- Psalm 27:1  Here , David puts full confidence in God 's utter authority and ability to protect him .
It 's a powerful verse to hold in our hearts when we 're tempted to worry about the coronavirus or any other trouble we face .
We can have total peace , for God is in control .
Later You Will Understand  " You do not realize now what I am doing , but later you will understand .
" -- John 13:7  This was spoken by Jesus to His disciples after He washed their feet , reassuring them that even though they can not see it , there is a divine plan , and all is well .
We might not see the big picture when it comes to the coronavirus , but God is in charge and has a plan .
As His children , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptures 7 - 9  Slide 4 of 5  7 .
God Works for the Good of Those Who Love Him  " And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him , who have been called according to his purpose .
" -- Romans 8:28  As Christians , we know God works in all things , good and bad .
For us , His children , He can transform things meant for evil and chaos ( even the coronavirus ! ) into good , furthering His heavenly Kingdom here on earth .
Be Strong and Courageous  " Have I not commanded you ? Be strong and courageous .
Do not be afraid ; do not be discouraged , for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go .
" -- Joshua 1:9  Here , God reassures a frightened Joshua that , even though the situation appears dire , He will fight Israel 's battles with and for them as they enter the Promised Land .

I 'm with you .

In this world you will have trouble .
But take heart ! I have overcome the world .
" -- John 16:33  In this section of John , Jesus is preparing His disciples for His impending mission to leave this world and reunite with the Father .
The disciples do not know exactly what this entails yet , but they cherished these words after the resurrection .
Coronavirus or no , we are wrapped in the safe , protective , and loving arms of Jesus .
The world might offer us trouble , but Jesus has overcome the world .
And through Him , so have we .
Scripture 10 and Prayers  10 .
There Will Be No More Death  " ' He will wipe every tear from their eyes .
There will be no more death ' or mourning or crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed away .
" -- Revelation 21:4  This destruction of the last enemy , death , will come in God 's ordained time .
Until then He watches over creation , and His people , He holds close .
He is near not far , He knows your sorrow , and He is your High Priest who swallowed up death and rose from the grave .
One day there will be a renewal of the entire created order , a new heaven and earth will be brought forth or transformed by God 's hands and voice and this new place will know no sin .
God will reverse the curse of sin ; the curse which has spread over everything in creation bringing with it disease , destruction , and suffering .
But Jesus has overcome the world , He has overcome sin and death , and He has secured your place in the refuge of God Almighty .
He will wipe away every tear on that day and suffering and sickness will be no more .
