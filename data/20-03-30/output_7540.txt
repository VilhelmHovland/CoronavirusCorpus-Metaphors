Watch : Ventilators are in high demand for Covid-19 patients .
How do they work ?  Ventilators are one of the most important tools hospitals have for keeping Covid-19 patients in the most critical condition alive .
Between 21% and 31% of Covid-19 patients in the U .
have required hospitalization , and 5% to 11% have required intensive care .
Officials have not reported how many of these patients developed respiratory distress so severe they needed to be put on a ventilator , but among one group of patients in China , 12% did .
The number of Covid-19 cases is growing at such a rapid pace , it is possible that many hospitals will not have enough ventilators available for the patients that need them .
If this happens , any patients who would otherwise survived their infections could die .
advertisement  In the video above , we look at how ventilators work , and how they are used to treat patients with Covid-19 .
I relapsed Thursday after almost 5 days clear of the worst symptoms .
It hit my lungs with a vengeance , accompanied by higher fever than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't own a car , and certainly ca n't use car services ) , but we 're reluctant to sit in the ER for 5 hours , then lie in a hallway while others who truly needed attention , received it .
Rightly so .
My husband had recently upgraded his CPAP .
As I had increasing difficulty in drawing air without a wheezing cough that emptied my lungs .
We tried the CPAP .
It was difficult getting started , past the cough , but concentrating on my breathing helped .
It made a HUGE difference .
Within an hour it was pushing enough air to fill my lungs and we could turn it to the lowest setting .
It 's a bit drying , but every 6 hours I take a break and use steam to help .
It 's going into day 3 and it 's helping enormously .
Chest still hurts but breathing is more important , and I 'm sleeping a couple of hours here and there .
I 'm so grateful to leave a bed/ ventilator to those who truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility .
I 'm not recommending for people not to seek professional care if they need it , but The CPAP made a huge difference for me and I hope some who have access can try it .
