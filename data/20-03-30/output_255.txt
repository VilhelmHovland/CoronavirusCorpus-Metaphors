Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images  KUOW , an NPR Member station in Seattle , said earlier this week that it will no longer air the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings live .
The announcement was both praised and condemned by listeners who contacted the Public Editor 's office .
Overwhelmingly , the listeners who have reached out to my office have asked that NPR itself cease airing the briefings as a routine practice , echoing calls elsewhere for the live coverage to stop .
But some managers at Member stations report the opposite ; their listeners want to hear the full briefings live .
We 've heard that from listeners , too , particularly in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least that which I have heard , is heated , but the arguments are also as thoughtful as you 'd expect , coming from station employees who take their public service role seriously , and listeners who are seeking out trustworthy information sources .
The debate breaks down into three broad threads .
One is that the briefings have become less newsworthy over time .
While the briefings do in part provide important updates from officials as the nation attempts to conquer a raging pandemic , they can be meandering and contradictory , and the president has at times also used them to spread falsehoods and air personal grievances .
KUOW , in making its announcement , cited " a pattern of false or misleading information provided that can not be fact checked in real time " as its reason for discontinuing the live broadcasts .
( It also said the decision was not politically based and that it would " revisit this decision daily .
" )  An alternative view is that NPR 's role is to bear witness , no matter what the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear directly how their federal government is handling this crisis .
Listeners get to decide for themselves the value of the information shared , perhaps by listening to NPR 's later analysis .
A third argument I 've heard from listeners is that by not airing the briefings live , NPR would be " censoring " the administration .
First some background  This may be pedantic , but it 's important context : When I talk about NPR , I am referring to the decisions that are ultimately made in the D .
newsroom .
Those decisions mostly play out in what is heard on the weekday and weekend versions of Morning Edition or All Things Considered , the midday Here and Now , on npr .
, the hourly newscasts , or in so-called " special coverage , " when NPR goes live for breaking news .
But NPR is also something else .
It is a constellation of more than 1,000 public radio stations around the country , such as KUOW , that are licensed to local communities or community organizations such as universities .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage , but fundamentally , they make local decisions , responding to the needs of their communities .
That 's per their mandate from the Federal Communications Commission , which has the power to take away those licenses to use the public airwaves .
Not every community has the same wants or needs .
An ethical approach  It 's a specious argument that not airing the briefings is tantamount to censorship .
It 's not as if NPR would be refusing to report any news coming out of the briefings if it did not carry them live .
The daily news shows and hourly newscasts have reported extensively on what the president and others have said during the briefings , and continue to do so .
One listener wrote to us equating the COVID-19 briefings to President Franklin D .
Roosevelt 's World War II fireside chats .
But the two situations are not equal , nor is the media environment the same .
Unlike in the 1940s , when newspapers and radio were the only major news sources , we are now in an era of abundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on npr .
or myriad other places .
They can be watched live , or after the fact .
( That said , there are indeed some media consumers in rural areas who do not have cable or broadband connections and who rely on public radio airwaves to receive news .
That 's where local community station decisions come in .
)  Both of the other arguments have merits , and the good news is that technology makes it easier to satisfy both camps .
It 's important to see the government at work .
But increasingly , the briefings are being held around 5:30 p .
ET , which is the heart of the first airing of All Things Considered .
By cutting away to carry the live feed from the White House , NPR has had to jettison other valuable reports on how the country is responding to this crisis , as well as other important news .
( And as an aside , I think NPR has been doing an excellent job covering this wide-ranging story , from the science to the financial ramifications to the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is that question of misinformation .
If NPR runs a 90-minute briefing live , how many listeners are sticking around for the analysis , context and fact-checking afterwards ? The NPR newsroom 's self-defined mission is , among other elements , to " serve the public and democracy .
" I take that to mean that it should provide facts to help listeners make decisions in their lives , not spin , particularly at a time when public health is at stake .
That means having its reporters listen to the briefing and immediately share important updates in the newscasts and newsmagazines , without giving a platform for falsehoods , or speculative comments on as-yet-untested treatments or campaign rally-style rants .
Those who want to can watch the full briefing at npr .
( albeit without that all-important context ) and NPR has made the link easy to find , sending out breaking news alerts , among other things .
Earlier this week , NPR was taking a middle road on air : preempting All Things Considered to air the first minutes of the daily White House briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting back to the newsmagazine partway through the briefing , to provide analysis of what was said .
That is better than running the entire briefing live , but a better public service would be to simply stop the live broadcasts and report on what is said later , using the same news judgment as for any story .
Of course , NPR could still do what it always has done : break into its regular programming if the briefing warrants .
Those are my opinions , and mine alone .
Here 's what the newsroom told me yesterday , via an official statement :  " We make our editorial coverage decisions based on the news environment in any given hour , on any given day ; our decision regarding providing live coverage of the White House daily COVID-19 briefings is no different .
Today , we have decided to lean into our original reporting and analysis on our daily programs like Morning Edition and All Things Considered while offering our Member Stations a live stream of the White House briefings on a separate channel , but our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here 's my translation : No live coverage of the briefing last evening , but that could change in coming days , depending on the circumstances .
Stations that want to can run the live coverage on air or online .
I approve .
