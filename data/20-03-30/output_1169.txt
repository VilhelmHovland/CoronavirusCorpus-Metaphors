Scotland 's Charity Air Ambulance boss ' immensely proud ' of north-east crew for making this week 's launch possible  The north-east 's new helimed will take up service at the end of this week , despite nationwide disruption .
Coronavirus might have caused Scotland 's Charity Air Ambulance ( SCAA ) to cancel a grand launch event , media access and a planned tour taking the aircraft around the region ; but the crew will begin its lifesaving work on Friday .
Like many workplaces across the country , the charity 's non-essential staff are working from home .
And builders transforming Babcock 's hangar in Farburn Terrace into a purpose-designed air ambulance base are expected to complete their work by this evening .
Teams , while working in isolation or at recommended distances , have been in at weekends as efforts were ramped up to get the job finished ahead of take-off .
SCAA chief executive David Craig said : " We are always immensely proud of the crew but , even in these difficult circumstances , they have also been working behind the scenes helping to put it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger jobs of getting the helicopter and base ready , they have been getting equipment and essentials together .
" They were in over the weekend to get things sorted and indeed two of them were completing their final sign-off for part of their training yesterday .
" Everyone has worked tirelessly to get this done and it 's a lot of things people wo n't see .
" And even in these difficult circumstances we still continue to help people all over Scotland .
" It 's hugely exciting to be launching this week and we look forward to increasing air ambulance capacity and resilience .
"  The Aberdeen-based EC135 T2E copter will be the charity 's second aircraft , having flown from Perth airport since 2013 .
Although tasked to jobs all across Scotland by the ambulance service , it is hoped the north-east 's most seriously ill and injured patients will benefit hugely from the new aircraft as it will drastically increase the reach of Aberdeen 's major trauma centre .
Mr Craig said : " We are deployed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasking and deployment has not changed .
" Obviously crew are putting themselves at the frontline as quite frankly they will not know is someone is transmitting coronavirus .
" They are kitted out with protective equipment required .
" As for the transferring of coronavirus-positive patients that 's something we leave firmly with the ambulance service -- we are ready to help and assist where we possibly can .
"  Mr Craig also vowed that plans to let north-east communities get up close to the aircraft would not " go to waste " as an open day will be held once the Covid-19 pandemic is overcome .
Scotland 's Charity Air Ambulance has made a huge impact since 2013 , saving lives and preventing suffering .
That is why the P&amp;J campaigned successfully for SCAA 's second helicopter to be based in our region .
The countdown is now on for the aircraft -- call sign Helimed 79 -- to start flying missions from Aberdeen Airport .
But this is an emergency service that relies entirely on donations .
Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help hit its ? 6million target and get things off to a successful start .
So please do anything you can to raise those funds and show that We 're Backing Helimed 79 .
