The lockdown to check the spread of Covid-19 could take a heavy toll on India 's economy .
Image : Sanjay Rawat  On February 28 , 2008 , when finance minister P .
Chidambaram got up in Parliament to unveil the Union Budget of 2008-09 , little did he know what was in store for the global and Indian economy in the coming months .
At that point in time , the Indian economy was chugging away nicely , having grown at 8% gross domestic product ( GDP ) for 12 successive quarters -- till December 2007 -- and there was a lot of optimism that this growth would only accelerate in the years to come .
That belief got a further boost when the finance minister opened his speech in Parliament saying that " the Indian growth story , so far , has been an absorbing and inspiring one .
' '  In fact , the first three years of the United Progressive Alliance government , the GDP had grown by 7 .
, and 9 .
, resulting in an unprecedented average growth rate of 8 .
, and Chidambaram said that he was confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 .
A sense of optimism reigned in many sectors , which saw a considerable hike in their outlays ; Chidambaram also " promised a 20% rise in education and a 15% increase in health spending to spread the benefits of an economic boom beyond the cities to rural areas .
"  What was most interesting was the government 's revenue and fiscal deficit numbers were better than the Budget Estimates .
For FY07 , the revenue deficit was 1 .
of the GDP compared to the Budget Estimate of 1 .
in the FY06 and the fiscal deficit of 3 .
% was actually .
less than what was estimated a year earlier .
And a confident Chidambaram said that further progress will be made in 2008-09 .
While the revenue receipt of the Central government was projected at Rs 6,02,935 crore for 2008-09 , the revenue expenditure was kept at Rs 658,119 crore ensuring that the revenue deficit was pegged at 1% of the GDP .
Similarly , the fiscal deficit , estimated at Rs 1,33,287 crore was kept at 2 .
of the GDP , which was below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act .
But when the Lehmann Brothers collapsed in the U .
on September 15 , 2008 , all hell broke loose .
The Indian economy too was hit , but the impact was less compared to what some other countries went through .
But on July 6 , 2009 , when Pranab Mukherjee , then finance minister , was presenting the Union Budget for FY10 , the rosy picture of the Indian economy had changed completely .
The high GDP growth trajectory of 8 .
had given way to 6 .
during FY09 despite three focussed fiscal stimulus package in the form of tax relief and increased expenditure on public projects along with the RBI taking a number of monetary and liquidity-enhancing measures .
The total fiscal stimulus of Rs1,86,000 crore was nearly 3 .
of the GDP at 2008-09 current prices and the total expenditure was increased by 36% over that of 2008-09 .
" This fiscal expansion will go a long way in reversing the impact of economic slowdown and accelerate our growth revival in the medium term , " Mukherjee said .
However , the fiscal accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's fiscal deficit surge from 2 .
in FY08 to 6 .
in FY09 ( revised upwards from 2 .
in the Budget Estimate ) to 6 .
in FY10 as against 6 .
of GDP estimated in the Budget .
The revenue deficit too jumped to 4 .
from the Budgeted Estimate of 1% in FY09 .
Not just that even wholesale price index saw a sharp rise of 13% in August 2008 .
If the great financial crisis could bring a growing nation to its knees , imagine what the impact of the Covid-19 shock could do to the country 's growth numbers and the consequent fiscal and revenue deficit numbers in FY20 and FY21 .
The revenues numbers were already looking a little shaky in FY20 because of the government 's high estimate in the last three months as compared to the rest of the year .
The government is unlikely to meet the target of collecting Rs1 lakh crore from the goods and services tax every month given the state of the economy today .
Again financial gains from schemes like Vivad Se Vishwas are unlikely to flow in at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crore in FY20 now seems like a distant dream .
Finding a strategic buyer for Air India seems most unlikely , given that the entire aviation industry is desperately trying to keep its head above water as more and more countries cancel domestic and international flights .
Even finding a suitor for the profitable Bharat Petroleum Corporation looks difficult since most oil majors are struggling with oil prices virtually scraping the barrel .
The choice for the government is simple .
Go on a borrowing spree to save the nation by diluting the FRBM Act or say goodbye to the 10% nominal GDP growth rate for FY21 .
