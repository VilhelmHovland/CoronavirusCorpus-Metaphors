Ask Adam : How Much Should I Tip on Delivery and Pickup During Coronavirus Quarantining ?  If you 've read my previous columns on tipping , you know I am a huge proponent of taking care of your service staff .
And now , it is more important than ever to do so , and to be even more generous than you normally would be .
Also , in these tough times , call the restaurant directly to place your order .
Ensure they are making the full amount you are paying , instead of a portion of the price going to one of the delivery apps .
The restaurant needs the money now more than ever .
Here is my rationale and my recommendations for both scenarios :  Delivery  If this were a normal day that you were ordering delivery , I would be advocating for a 20 percent tip , no question .
If it were inclement weather , only jerks do n't tip 25 to 30 percent , with 30 percent being absolutely mandatory if it 's a snowstorm and you still must have your pizza or lo mein .

Delivery personnel are putting themselves at risk every time they venture outside .
They are tired , they are scared , and the surge in deliveries means they are working harder than ever .
That means you tip them well , which at this current time , means you tip them 50 percent .
That 's right : one-half of what you spent on your food .
If you are ordering in , you need to be taking care of the people who are delivering it to you .
Curbside Pickup  In this situation , you 've also taken a risk by going out , but the service staff is literally trying to survive .
Tip at least 30 percent , and more if you can .
We all need to support each other right now .
