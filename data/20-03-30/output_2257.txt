WASHINGTON -- The U .
military has decided it will stop providing some of the more granular data about coronavirus infections within its ranks , citing concern that the information might be used by adversaries as the virus spreads .
Defense Secretary Mark Esper outlined the plan in an interview with Reuters , saying that he wanted the military to keep providing broader data about infections in the armed forces , which rose by more than a third to 280 current cases on Thursday .
But Esper , a former Army secretary , said he wanted some of the more mission-specific information to be withheld to prevent compromising operational security .
" What we want to do is give you aggregated numbers .
But we 're not going to disaggregate numbers because it could reveal information about where we may be affected at a higher rate than maybe some other places , " Esper said , without disclosing precisely what information would be withheld or when the plan would be implemented .
Such a decision could upend expectations about the kind of disclosure about coronavirus fallout the public can expect from the military , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces of well over 1 million active duty troops .
Beyond daily updates on infections across the armed forces , the U .
military has been telling the public for weeks about the locations of individual cases , from on a warship to inside the Pentagon and at overseas commands throughout the world .
Esper noted that it was one thing to disclose the case of the first U .
soldier infected with coronavirus , which U .
forces in South Korea did last month .
But he wanted to guard against creating the expectation of regular updates everywhere .
" I 'm not going to get into a habit where we start providing numbers across all the commands and we come to a point six , seven weeks from now where we have some concerns in some locations and reveal information that could put people at risk , " he said .
Esper said operational security was particularly important in places overseas where the United States is combating adversaries , noting the fight against al-Shabaab in East Africa as well as Islamic State militants in Syria or Afghanistan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be disrupted by the coronavirus , saying " we have more than enough capability .
"  " The rate of infection and its impact is not hitting us at the levels that we have any concerns about right now , " he said .
Pentagon spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said in a statement that the Department of Defense was " committed to transparency , " holding regular briefings and town halls .
But she added disclosing readiness data at the unit level could be a risk .
" If at some point in the future , a commander believes that the coronavirus could affect the readiness of our strategic deterrent or strategic response forces we would understandably protect that information , " she said .
