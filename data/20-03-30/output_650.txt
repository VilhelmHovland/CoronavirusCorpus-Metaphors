Coronavirus : You have questions , here are some answers  As the coronavirus pandemic continues , new questions about the virus and how to respond in our daily lives arise every day .
The Chicago Tribune took concerns from readers and started asking experts those questions in early March .
We 've added answers from other settings when experts have answered questions publicly .
As health officials scramble to understand the virus , questions that are no longer relevant have been removed .
The remainder have been edited for length and clarity .
March 24 , Dr .
Robert Murphy  Murphy is executive director of Northwestern University 's Institute for Global Health and a professor of infectious diseases at the Feinberg School of Medicine .
He 's an expert in HIV infection , viral hepatitis , antiviral drug development and global health .
Advertisement  Murphy was part of a weekly , hourlong webinar focused on COVID-19 hosted by Northwestern 's Buffett Institute for Global Affairs .
Have we learned anything new about the virus ?  A .
Loss of smell may be one of the first symptoms of COVID-19 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A .
The model shows that the U .
is in the peak infection stage , but the damage will occur later in the year .
The peak damage estimate is during May through June .
How many people should we be testing right now ?  A .
We should be testing 4,000 people in Illinois daily and 100,000 people in the United States daily .
We are not doing that .
Why do we keep hearing experts say that testing is important ?  Advertisement  A .
Besides identifying those who have COVID-19 , there are a lot more people than we thought who have no symptoms but are infectious and are spreading the disease .
The only way to prevent this is mass screenings .
If we do n't do mass screenings , I think nothing else will work .
South Korea has done the most tests out of any country and has seen it pay off in blunting the curve .
Do we really need such an extreme reaction ?  A .
The more forceful we act now , the shorter the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong , Taiwan and Singapore have been able to suppress the infection because of their strict measures .
How long do we need to practice social distancing to get us through the epidemic ?  A .
It 's not 15 days .
There are models that show the stricter you are , the shorter the bump .
If we stop these interventions and leave it up to the states , I think we 're in a lot of trouble for the next 12 to 24 months .
If we all get on the same page , we can start seeing decline in the early to midsummer .
What would happen to the hospitals if we do n't blunt the curve ?  Advertisement  A .
We just do n't have the beds .
The intensive care units will be overwhelmed with people who need ventilators .
People working in the hospitals need masks , gloves , gowns , and we do n't have the capacity today to even provide hospitals with the amount of protective equipment that is necessary .
It could lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coronavirus cases would be on top of what 's already going on during a normal day in a hospital .
Why is there such a huge test kit supply shortage compared with other countries like South Korea ?  A .
At the beginning of this thing , we opted to make a conscientious decision not to import World Health Organization-approved tests from Asia and Europe .
We insisted on making our own tests .
Those tests took weeks to make .
Once they were sent out to the states , we realized they did n't work , so all those kits came back and we had to redo it .
We wasted a whole month during a crucial time period as the number of people infected doubled in some places every three days and in others , every seven days .
We have n't been able to catch up since .
It 's a war without a general .
Why is the U .
so far behind other countries in blunting the curve ?  A .
The United States is not set up with a strong public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gives guidance , and the states have the option of complying or not .
The decision-makers are largely finance or business people .
They 're ignoring our public health experts .
If that continues , we 're in big trouble .
What 's happening on the state level ?  A .
Governors do n't have the ability to marshal the industrial forces the way the president would be able to .
Essentially , their hands are tied , so they 're competing with each other for resources .
What actions could the government be taking ?  A .
Stricter border control , rapid testing and reenacting the Defense Production Act of 1950 , which allows the government to take over industries during war or times of crisis .
We could direct companies to make more ventilators or personal protective equipment or reagents or test kits while requisitioning hotels and sports arenas .
It 's not popular in certain groups and maybe it 's an extreme measure , but with what 's coming up , I do n't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders and Fox News seem to suggest that a lift on restrictions is coming soon .
What do you think of this news ?  A .
I watched last night to see where this idea was coming from .
I was really horrified .
If we lift up our guard now , then the coronavirus will become the No .
1 cause of death and completely overwhelm the ( hospital ) system .
So why stop at the national level ? What is happening on the international level ?  A .
Combined international efforts would be best , but what international authority do we have ? WHO can make recommendations , but they do n't have any teeth .
The United Nations can make recommendations but again , where is the teeth ? The teeth is going to be at the national level , and it 's going to depend on the quality and determination of the national leader .

Todd Nega  Nega is an infectious disease physician with NorthShore University HealthSystem .
Since the virus can live on surfaces for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail , packages , groceries or newspapers are safe ?  A .
We believe that the virus can remain on surfaces for several hours and , in some cases , days , but there remain more questions than answers about exactly how long and on what type of surfaces .
The chance of getting the virus after touching a surface that an infected person sneezed on , for example , is highest within the first 10 minutes , then diminishes with time .
The chance of picking up the virus from mail or a package that was delivered or groceries is highly unlikely .
The CDC recommends that people take steps to clean and disinfect surfaces -- do n't forget your phones -- and continue to do this routinely .
Wash your hands after you return from the grocery store -- and throughout the day -- and wash all fresh vegetables and fruits .
Remember that the virus is primarily spread through direct person-to-person contact .
As always , continue to wash your hands regularly .
How common are asymptomatic carriers ? Is it possible that some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it along to others who become ill ?  A .
It 's currently unclear what percentage of the outbreak is being spread by asymptomatic carriers , but it 's very plausible that they do play a role .
Scientists from around the world are studying this aspect of the virus because it may contribute to why it is spreading so rapidly .
This is why it 's so important for everyone , no matter your age or health status , to practice social distancing and good hygiene as recommended by the CDC .
Advertisement  Q .
I am still required to go to work , and I take public transit to get there .
When I return home at night , should I wash my clothes ? Should I be laundering every article of clothing , even jackets and hats , after wearing it once ?  A .
The viability of the virus on clothing depends on the type of fabric .
For example , germs are easier to wipe clean off leather or vinyl because they are n't as porous as fabric .
Practice routine washing of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill the virus .
Use the same process for the dryer .
If you 've been in a crowded area like public transit and could not practice social distancing , it 's a good idea to wash your clothes when you get home or at least put them in a laundry basket until you can wash them .
Does the virus exacerbate conditions like asthma , bronchitis , emphysema and seasonal allergies , or does this mean I may have the virus ?  A .
It can , just like any other virus .
Although many other factors this time of year can also cause an exacerbation of chronic lung diseases .
What factors will we use to determine when the serious health risk of COVID-19 has passed ? I 'm hearing estimates of normal life activities being on hold for weeks or months , so how will the medical community determine when it 's OK to go back to school , work and eventually hold larger gatherings like concerts and sports events ?  A .
We will have to wait for CDC guidance on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , the numbers have started to rise again .
What does " shelter in place " mean ? Can I go for a walk or run if I 'm not close to anyone else ?  A .
" Shelter in place " means to stay at home and only go out for essential activities or functions .
In general , it is fine to go for walks or runs because it will help with your overall physical and emotional health during these unusual circumstances .

Robert Murphy  Murphy is the executive director of the Institute for Global Health at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and also a practicing physician at Northwestern Medicine .
Q : What 's the best way to practice social distancing ?  A : This depends on the setting and host ( patient/person ) .
High-risk individuals ( age 60-plus years , underlying cardiac , lung , cancer , hypertension , diabetes or other immune suppressive conditions/diseases ) , should limit contact as much as possible with other people .
Basically , stay home .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol .
You should also keep away from anyone who is sick , keep your distance from other persons ( 6 feet is recommended ) .
Q : Now that reports of confirmed cases of coronavirus are becoming more common in our area , what happens once someone has been diagnosed ?  A : If they have few or mild symptoms , stay home and treat it like you have a bad cold .
If ill , seek advice from your medical provider which could result in hospitalization , especially if you have any co-morbidities .
( For instance , people with chronic lung , cardiac or kidney disease , those who have already weakened immune systems , who have had a transplant , diabetes , etc .
)  Q : Many people have seen the graphic about " flattening the curve .
" Can you explain this and discuss whether that is a helpful or accurate way to think about things ?  A : The epidemic in the U .
is growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will reach a high point or peak , then start to decline as public health measures begin to take their effect and/or the at-risk population becomes smaller through social distancing or they all get infected , get immune and no longer can transmit virus .
It 's a typical bell-shaped curve with the top of the curve being the peak .
Q : If you have a confirmed case of coronavirus , then recover , is it possible to be diagnosed again in the future ?  A : Probably not .
Q : Are there any precautions people need to take when purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables at grocery stores ?  A : Wash your hands or use sanitizer after getting home , wash the fruit and vegetables like you usually do anyway .
Q : Is it possible to have influenza AND coronavirus ?  A : It is highly unlikely to have both simultaneously .
March 10 , Dr .
Robert Citronberg  Citronberg is the director of infectious diseases at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge .
Citronberg has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How is coronavirus transmitted ? What is the incubation period ?  A : The incubation period can be anywhere from two to 14 days .
The incubation period is the time between the acquisition of the virus and the time that you develop symptoms .
The median time is about five days .
There are two principal ways to get it , and it 's important to understand both .
The first is the more obvious , which is from droplets , when someone coughs or sneezes into your face .
( Or within about a 3- to 6-foot radius .
) If someone coughs or sneezes , the droplets fall right to the ground , so you can walk into a room a few moments afterward , and there will be no droplets in the air .
The more interesting and important method of transmission is contact .
So even though the droplets fall to the ground , they may also fall on a tabletop and other surfaces , where they can live for at least several hours .
So then say you touch that tabletop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually infect yourself .
I think the key to understanding this , the way to break the chain of transmission is 1 ) to not cough or sneeze directly into someone 's face 2 ) stay away from people who are coughing or sneezing 3 ) be really mindful about keeping your hands clean and washing your hands , using hand sanitizer , all the time .
A : The mild symptoms are body ache , maybe some fever and a cough .
And those symptoms last for about a week .
If someone has symptoms after a week or so , where they start to get worse , the cough gets worse , the shortness of breath gets worse , that 's a sign they may be developing more severe disease .
The severe disease actually does n't start right away .
Let 's say you have the virus and you 're really not feeling at all better or worse after a week , then you would be at risk for severe illness .
Q : Is there a cure for coronavirus , and if there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And how long will it take to recover ?  A : There is no cure , no drug .
Unlike influenza , we have drugs that treat influenza .
There are trials going on around the world .
Advertisement  The treatment is supportive care , by that I mean , IV fluids , medication , things to break your fever , to make you feel better , to support you and give your body a chance to heal .
It 's a little frustrating because there is no drug you can get , but in many cases , supportive care is fine .
Remember that about 80% of people with this coronavirus infection either have no symptoms or mild illness that does n't progress to severe illness .
So supportive care actually is important .
It prevents people from getting dehydrated .
Usually people who are sick , they recover within a week or so if they have the mild illness , up to about two weeks to feeling back to normal .
And remember , some of these people , especially some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise ship who are in quarantine , they have absolutely no symptoms .
They tested positive but no symptoms .
So it 's kind of hard to gauge when they 're feeling better because they never felt bad .
But for the people who do get symptoms , usually about a week and up to two weeks when they could be feeling a lot better .
