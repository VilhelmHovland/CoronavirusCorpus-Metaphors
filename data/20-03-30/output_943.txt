Follow @nrossolillo  Let me first be very clear about one thing : The coronavirus pandemic is no Great Recession of 2008-09 .
While it is already wreaking havoc on what just a few months ago appeared to be a resurgent global economy , the financial situation in 2008-09 was driven by structural issues and excess within the economy itself .
While COVID-19 is exposing that there are financial issues -- soaring corporate and government debt , global supply chain fragility , and inequality that means the masses remain underprepared for times of crisis -- the spread of the infectious disease is an external disruptor versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existential , let 's talk brass tacks .
While the situation is different now , the old financial crisis investor playbook can still be dusted off and searched through for potential strategies related to the current situation .
One of those strategies that worked well for myself and others who rode out the last severe downturn was investing in big box stores , namely Walmart ( NYSE:WMT ) , and to a lesser extent Target ( NYSE:TGT ) .
Walmart stock in particular massively outperformed the stock market downturn in 2008-09 and helped investors return to making money quicker than the market overall did .
Interestingly , something similar is playing out right now .
And Target , I believe , is in better shape to weather a downturn than ever before .
But why not e-commerce ?  Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) has gotten plenty of attention as well , and rightly so .
It 's highly profitable Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) division will likely continue to benefit as the world gets pushed further down the road of digital -- even after the dust settles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue too since so many households are confined to their homes .
However , while retail is the largest segment at Amazon as far as revenue goes ( AWS was only 12% of the total in 2019 ) , it is barely profitable .
AWS , on the other hand , comprised two-thirds of operating income .
Plus , while Amazon 's retail business could surge , some of its third-party sellers -- especially those that focus on non-essential retail sales -- could struggle .
And Amazon 's retail skewing toward basic household goods does n't equate to more profitability either .
While Amazon is certainly a stock that investors may want to consider right now , I still think investing for the retail segment is missing the point .

Circling back to the tried-and-true  This brings our conversation back to Walmart and Target .
The two big-box stores have made great strides in recent years ramping up their own e-commerce capabilities , and all the while have remained profitable doing so .
Margins , as is the case with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Walmart and Target means net income is still robust .
In fact , the coronavirus crisis could mark a turning point in both companies ' e-commerce journey .
Walmart , in particular , has n't seen overwhelming success in its digital ventures , at least when it comes to running a profit , and it reportedly lost some $1 billion last year on between $21 billion to $22 billion in online sales .
However , its grocery division has been picking up steam , and the ability to order online and schedule a pickup time could gain a big boost thanks to the pandemic .
As scale is likely the roadblock to generating positive cash , picking up a ton of new customers amid self-quarantine orders bodes well for the big-box store .
While Target does n't boast the same grocery business as Walmart , it too has nonetheless made great strides in its e-commerce department .
Digital sales grew 29% in 2019 , accounting for the bulk of the company 's 3 .
surge in comparable store sales ( a blend of foot traffic and ticket size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had a negative effect on profits , but as seen in the aforementioned chart , Target is also beginning to realize an uptick in the bottom-line as its digital efforts start to bear fruit .
While I invested in Walmart on the expectation that consumers will start searching for bargains and clamping down on budgets , I think Target could also benefit from a similar shift in consumer behavior .
Plus , while Walmart stock has held up and pushed to new all-time highs since coronavirus took control of the world , Target stock has fallen 25% .
I 'm betting on a quick rebound there as it 's likely the company continues to benefit from higher traffic .
While this is no financial crisis of 2008-09 , I think the ultimate results will be similar and big-box store stocks will outperform the market overall .
For investors looking for some safety net for the next year , Walmart and Target are worth a look .
