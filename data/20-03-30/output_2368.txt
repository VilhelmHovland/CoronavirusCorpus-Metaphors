Authority that operates the airport has yet to lay off any of its approximately 500 employees  Vancouver Airport Authority CEO Craig Richmond on March 17 speaks at a news conference at his airport , in front of the Spirit of Haida Gwaii sculpture by Bill Reid Glen Korstrom  What happened : Vancouver Airport Authority ( VAA ) CEO Craig Richmond told Business in Vancouver that more than half of the approximately 26,500 workers at Vancouver International Airport ( YVR ) have been laid off .
His authority has also halted construction at the airport , throwing an additional 2,000 on-site construction workers , and 2,000 off-site construction employees , out of work .
The cuts are a direct effect of the COVID-19 pandemic .
Why it matters : YVR is an engine of the regional economy , helping facilitate $20 .
billion in total economic output and $10 .
billion in total GDP across , according to its operator , the VAA .
VAA 's CEO , Craig Richmond , told Business in Vancouver March 27 that more than half of the approximately 26,500 workers at YVR have been laid off .
The vast majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and top-ups such as the B .
's government 's program to provide a one-time $1,000 payment .
None of his authority 's approximately 500 employees have yet been laid off and he said laying off his own staff " is not contemplated at this time .
"  One reason he has not yet laid off any of his staff is that " it really does n't matter how many passengers there are , there are many functions that just have to keep going .
"  The COVID-19 pandemic has ground passenger traffic to a near halt , prompting layoffs at many companies and airlines that are based at the airport .
That includes everyone from baggage handlers to food-court employees to ticketing agents .
VAA had been underway with ambitious expansion that required around 2,000 construction workers to build new parkades , an expanded terminal and other upgrades .
Richmond said construction is halted and they have been laid off , as have about 2,000 others who were working off-site , such as form workers .

" Maybe your job in accounting has changed , or maybe someone in finance can take a turn in operations , " he said .
" We 're keeping people gainfully employed and busy .
"  Richmond has so far shut down about 11% of the terminal space at the airport and he expects that closed off space could eventually total 58% .
The closed terminal space will not affect operations but it will help save time and money spent cleaning and maintaining the space , he said .
" It comes as no surprise that YVR 's core business has taken a substantial hit , " he said , referring to travel bans , national orders to stay home as much as possible and a general reluctance for people to travel .
" The impact can be seen and felt everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls .
We 're currently anticipating a 40% to 50% decline in passengers over the year .
Right now , we are seeing between about 10,000 and 20,000 passengers per day , down from a standard March break , where we 'd be close to 70,000 passengers .
"  All flights , except those from within Canada , the U .
, Mexico , the Caribbean and Saint Pierre and Miquelon are landing at : YVR , Calgary International Airport ( YYC ) , Toronto Pearson International Airport ( YYC ) and Montreal Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport ( YUL ) .
" We expect international and U .
traffic to drop to near-zero in the weeks ahead , " Richmond said .
" We anticipate our domestic traffic will drop to about 30% of its normal volume .
Frankly , it is going to get worse before it gets better .
"  Richmond , who has spent decades in the airport-management business , said that the current crisis ' impact on operations surpasses that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2008-2009 global economic downturn in terms of longevity , depth and human cost .
" It 's the biggest challenge YVR has faced , " he said .
" Because we are an economic engine for the region , the impacts have been far reaching .
"  Richmond had planned to retire in June and the airport authority 's board had been looking for a replacement .
The board , Richmond said , has asked him to stay on if needed , and he accepted .
" I have agreed to stay on temporarily as required , " he said .
" It is the right thing to do and it 's the least I can do .
"  Richmond on March 17 vowed to " never close " his airport , prompting some on social media to say that such a decision would not be up to him , but rather it would be up to the federal government .
BIV put that question to Richmond March 27 and he said , " the federal government would want us to stay open .
Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are medical flights , there are emergency flights .
I ca n't conceive of a time the airport would be closed .
In fact , we were n't closed during 9-11 , the airspace was .
