Erie County is n't just seeing a rise in Covid-19 cases , but a rise in hospitalizations .
As of Sunday afternoon , Health Commissioner Dr .
Gale Burstein reported 11 county residents have been hospitalized .
Three are in intensive care .
That translated into a hospitalization rate of 19% of confirmed cases in Erie County , which was higher than the statewide rate of 13% as of Sunday morning .
The hospitalization rate may be artificially high , however , since the county 's ability to test for the illness is stalled .
Many more people are likely to have been infected with the new coronavirus than are currently being tested countywide .
" We are seeing a higher level of acuity as the disease epidemic progresses through our community , " Burstein said .
Andrew M .
Cuomo said Sunday he 's a big believer in extensive testing for Covid-19 because tracking and quarantining individuals who test positive for the virus , as well as their close contacts , will slow the spread of the disease .
But the additional information he shared regarding county testing shows how unevenly testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks in the top 10 of New York counties with confirmed cases and is the largest county outside the New York City region .
Yet Erie County has tested 300 fewer residents than Monroe County due to a shortage in testing materials .
It has also tested nearly 2,000 fewer residents than Albany County , which has easy access access to the state Wadsworth Lab .
While the county 's Public Health Lab has no ability to do more tests for anyone other than highest-priority cases , Poloncarz said that , after speaking with the governor 's office , the county expects a new batch of testing materials to arrive by Tuesday .
That 's the same day the Erie County Public Health Lab expects to finish testing all the samples it had taken last week .
In addition , he said , every major health provider is hoping to conduct hundreds more tests per day by sometime next week .
The county had 57 confirmed cases out of 565 tests that are either completed or pending Sunday afternoon , but that figure rose to 64 Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases were in Buffalo and Amherst , which remain the two communities with the highest concentration of confirmed cases .
Meanwhile 293 other residents were in quarantine Sunday afternoon .
Aside from Buffalo and Amherst , 14 other towns and cities in the county also have confirmed cases .
Confirmed and reported cases for the rest of Western New York included nine in Niagara County , two each in Allegany and Wyoming counties , and one in Genesee County .
Cattaraugus , Chautauqua and Orleans counties reported no confirmed cases , according to the Governor 's Office .
Both Poloncarz and Burstein reiterated the need for all residents to behave as if the virus is already widespread and practice good hygiene and social distancing measures .
They should also be self-monitoring their symptoms , checking for a fever of 100 .
degrees or greater and shortness of breath .
" We expect Covid-19 to be in every community right now ; just because you might not see it on our interactive map , " Poloncarz said , referring to the county 's online heat map of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now .
Covid-19 has been in Western New York for probably weeks now .
"  He said he knew of at least one local case in which a person who was feeling ill went to work anyway and later tested positive .
His coworkers all had to be placed in mandatory quarantine as a result , he said .
Because the county believes the coronavirus is prevalent throughout most communities in the county , Burstein said the Health Department is no longer releasing a list of public places where individuals diagnosed with Covid-19 have been .
" It 's really a gross underestimate of the risk in our community , " Burstein said .
Finally , as the county works to marshal enough personnel to assist with the public response to the health crisis , Burstein said the county wants to hear from anyone who would like to assist the county and has experience in health care or public health , even if they are students .
The county also wants to hear from anyone who may be able to assist with providing personal protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandra Tan uses her Erie County government beat to find issues and stories that tell us something important about how we live .
