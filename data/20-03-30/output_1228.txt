Joan Plant is a direct descendant of the Blackwells and the Furnesses , two of 83 families who survived the plague .
" Would we do it now ? " she says .
" You have to think their trust in God was so complete and so much part of their lives that many of them would not be afraid of dying .
We can not comprehend that -- although I accept that many of them would also have been terrified .

" I was asked that question by a Christian magazine a few years ago -- if the plague came again , would you stay or would you go ? I would stay because I have nowhere else to go .
All my family are here and it would have been the same for many during the plague .

The disease came not from China but from the capital , arriving in a consignment of cloth for a tailor , George Viccars .
The cloth was damp and Viccars hung it in front of a fire to dry .
The plague-carrying fleas contained inside it awoke .
As the disease took hold and under the direction of the local rector , the 26-year-old William Mompesson , the villagers agreed to cut themselves off from the outside world so the plague would not spread across the north of England .
Food from the nearby Chatsworth Estate was left at entrances to the village and paid for with coins left in vinegar as a disinfectant .
They isolated themselves for 14 months .
Some have estimated the mortality rate of coronavirus to be around 1 per cent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those it touched .
So , for the greater good , the population of Eyam agreed to accept the likelihood of death .
The plague did not spread but once the disease had burned itself out in the village , in November 1666 , there were 260 dead out of a population of around 800 .
Reminders  Eyam is not much bigger now than it was then , but the reminders of what it once endured are everywhere .
Jane Hawksworth lived next to Mompesson 's church .
A plaque details that by the time the plague had subsided , she had lost 25 of her relatives .
Ms Plant adds : " At the time of the plague , the Bradshaw family , who lived at the top of the village , were wealthy people with horses and carriages .
They left .
Mompesson sent his children away to Yorkshire , although his wife , Catherine , stayed to tend the sick and died on 25 August 1666 .
Catherine was consumptive and that has parallels with today in that it often killed those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half centuries on , Mompesson 's successor is Reverend Mike Gilbert .
His small church receives up to 50,000 pilgrims a year .
He said : " When the coronavirus first broke out , we had some Chinese students from Sheffield University .
They put a prayer for their country on a globe we had in the church .
A week later I got a message from the Chinese province of Hubei on my phone .
I took it to a Chinese takeaway to translate and it said : ' The coronavirus is here in Hubei and we are scared .
Thank you for praying for us .
"  Eyam has not forgotten its past .
The macabre nursery rhyme " Ring a Ring o ' Roses " -- a reference to the red marks that were the sign of the plague -- is embedded deep into the village 's fabric .
