Of fuel tankers and infernos  It was another sad day in the Nigerian road users ' history when on Thursday , the 28th of June 2018 , a tanker ferrying premium motor spirit exploded on the Otedola bridge in Berger , along the lagos-Ibadan expressway .
As if that was not enough , on Friday , 29th June , a tanker and a truck collided on the Abuja-Minna highway resulting in another inferno , while the death toll for that can not be ascertained as at the time of this writing , no fewer than three have also been confirmed dead .
While the news comes in ripples of shock , it can be leveraged on as a call to action .
Nigeria is such a reckless country where we do not learn until something tragic happens .
Now that tragedy has knocked on our doors , it is time to take action .
How can the menace of fuel tankers and infernos be curtailed : We must first be committed to redefining our transportation system , Nigeria is arguably one of the few countries left that use tankers in transporting petroleum and other crude products across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move these ' essential evils ' across the terrain at relatively low risk as compared to transporting with tankers .
In looking for an alternative to fuel tankers in the transport of crude product in the country , the foremost alternative is rail .
What happened to the Nigerian railway system ? All that is left in most states is just a few surviving carriages and an under staffed , ineffective railway service .
If we ever hope to correct the menace of fuel tankers and the resultant infernos that they have been associated with , we must be committed to redefining our transportation system .
Prompt attention must be paid to insurance .
No one knows the exact number of cars in the mass wreckage that littered the pages of newspapers on Friday morning .
There is no official figure of how many of those cars t were insured or not , although going by the Nigerian culture of negligence and the way we handle things lightly , very few of those cars would have been insured .
If nothing , insuring those cars would have cushioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family .
It 's high time we have started taking insurance serious , it may not rank so high on your personal scale as a measure to prevent reoccurrence of such an incidence .
It is a palliative measure that will cushion the effect of the occurrence if it ever happens again , which is highly probable .
Another huge and necessary step in curtailing this menace is commitment to quality design and building of tankers .
As the need arises , these tankers may be constructed using a different design structure that distinguishes them from other long vehicles .
The end gain of this is to achieve high quality traction , fantastic driver handling and fewer cases of eventualities on the high way .
It is seemingly a ' Nigerian ' problem to only look for solution after a disaster has occurred , so many accidents that have occurred on our roads would have been prevented if only we were committed to quality design of fuel tankers and conveyors .
Will it come as a shock to you that in some of these petrol tankers , the tankers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwed to the vehicle of conveyance ? That should come as no shock because not only is this happening in Nigeria , it is more of the expectation than the exception .
Some states have enacted laws that mandate heavy duty vehicles , including petrol tankers , to travel only at night .
This is based on the assumption that traffic is usually lighter at night and , as such , these heavy duty vehicles can travel without causing a high level of risk to other road users .
It may be just time to legislate such a law .
Finally , every road user must make it a duty to embrace responsible driving and road usage .
As reported by some passengers , some drivers even after seeing the petrol spill out of the tanker on Otedola bridge were struggling to reverse their cars .
This ended in a gridlock that eventually increased the number of causalities in the fire incident .
Away from the inferno , there have been countless times that a gridlock occured on major highways without any satisfactory cause ; it is most times due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must also , as a matter of urgency , desist from paying lip service to the construction of durable and highly motorable roads .
This will go on to prevent the recurrence of such terrible incidents .
If the road network within the country is in top shape , the headache of the average road user would be minimised .
As much as we are mourning the souls lost in the Lagos and Abuja infernos , we must take steps towards avoiding a repeat .
Coming on the backdrop of such a bloody weekend for the nation , these steps will not only be definitive , they have to be radical and life-changing .
