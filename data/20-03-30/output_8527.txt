Israel 's Netanyahu Under Precautionary COVID-19 Quarantine  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his close aides have been placed under precautionary quarantine after a staffer within his office tested positive for COVID-19 , the premier 's office said Monday .
In a statement , Netanyahu 's office said the quarantine decision was precautionary as the veteran prime minister had not been in recent proximity with the ill staffer .
" The preliminary assessment is that there is no need for the prime minister to be quarantined , as he did not come into close contact with the individual and did not personally meet with that person , " the statement said .
" Over the past two weeks the two were never in the same room at the same time , " it added .
The statement further noted that the " epidemiological investigation " was ongoing and that Netanyahu and " his close staff would be in confinement until ( tests ) were completed .

The Knesset said it was offering footage from its surveillance cameras to the health ministry for them to see where and when Paluch had been in the building , for the health professionals to determine which measures need be taken .
Israel , which has more than 4,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases , has imposed severe restrictions to contain the spread of the virus , including a total ban on non-essential movements .
