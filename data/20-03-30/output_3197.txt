Sandman Centre is empty , vacated by a virus , hollow and haunted by dashed dreams .
The Kamloops Blazers won the 2020 B .
Division crown , their first taste of provincial supremacy since 2012 and second in 18 years , but pursuit of the WHL championship was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic , which led to cancellation of the rest of the season and playoffs in major junior hockey across Canada .
In the summer of 2018 , Matt Bardsley inherited one of the better young cores in recent club history from his predecessors -- jettisoned general manager Stu MacGregor and director of player personnel Matt Recchi .
Bardsley , along with director of player personnel Robbie Sandland ( promoted last summer ) and front-office and scouting staff , astutely built on the foundation while amassing draft capital and hiring head coach Shaun Clouston , who took a job that Portland Winterhawks ' associate coach/assistant GM Kyle Gustafson reportedly turned down .
Clouston iced an offensive juggernaut that , at times , overwhelmed opponents by playing fast and hurling rubber on net , the team firing 2,424 shots on goal , an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals ( 271 in 63 games ) .
The October departure of associate coach Darryl Sydor due to personal reasons made way for Cory Clouston , Shaun 's brother , to take an assistant coaching role , the former NHL bench boss adding experience and expertise that helped push the group to 86 points in 63 games .
Netminder Dylan Garand was third in the league in goals-against average ( 2 .
) and tied for third in save percentage ( .
) ; Orrin Centazzo wound up second in the league in goal scoring , with 44 goals in 63 games ; and Kamloops wunderkind Logan Stankoven , a 16-year-old rookie , exploded in the second half of the campaign , finishing with 48 points in 59 games .
Stankoven notched 29 goals -- 18 of them in 30 games after the Christmas break -- to tie the Blazers ' goal-scoring record among 16-year-olds , set by Rob Brown in 1984-1985 ( Brown was a defenceman that season ) .
The formula -- throw in fledgling young forwards and a veteran blue line that included Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimidating leader Montana Onyebuchi -- was dynamic , with Kamloops ( 41-18-3-1 ) finishing 14 points ahead of the second-place Victoria Royals in the B .
Division .
The Blazers had a game in hand on the Royals when the season was scuttled .
Still , nobody should have been counting chickens .
The Portland Winterhawks ( 45-11-3-4 , 97 points in 63 games , WHL regular-season champions ) and Everett Silvertips ( 46-13-3-1 , 96 points in 63 games ) were good bets to emerge from the Western Conference , formidable squads in a U .
Division that also boasted the Spokane Chiefs ( 41-18-4-1 , 87 points in 64 games ) .
Division foes Victoria ( 32-24-6-2 ) , Vancouver ( 32-24-4-2 ) and re-emerging Kelowna ( 29-28-3-3 ) , under head coach Kris Mallette , would not have been easy outs .
But Kamloops had a team that could have made serious post-season noise and dreams of hoisting the Memorial Cup -- the ultimate revenge on the hometown Rockets , who bested the Blazers in their bid to host the national championship tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what might have been , said Franklin , is painful .
The captain , along with fellow overagers Martin and Ryan Hughes ( all among Bardsley acquisitions ) , do n't get their swan-song moments or the chance to chase pro contracts with playoff success .
Players with NHL Draft potential are left with similar missed opportunities .
The list of things that seems unfair -- for every player in the league and season-ticket holders and office staff and sponsors and so on -- is long and disheartening to dwell on .
So we look ahead to next season .
THE FORWARDS  How the Blazers approach their 20-year-old dilemma will answer a few questions up front and on defence , with seven eligible returnees and only three spots available .
Centazzo seems a lock to fill one of them , with forward Brodi Stuart and blue liners Onyebuchi and Sean Strange among those left vying for the remaining two slots .
" For me , obviously , I want to be back in Kamloops , 100 per cent , and still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is living in Merritt with his parents .
" This off-season is about focusing on my skating and strength and trying to get better with that , and coming into next season wanting to have my best season yet .
"  Franklin and Hughes combine to represent 1 .
points per game that graduate from the Blazers ' forward group , a considerable vacuum of offence .
Kamloops brass is confident the cupboard is stocked , trumpeting a next-man-up mentality .
" That 's what 's important , " Bardsley said .
" When you have a strong list , you do n't have to bring in a lot of guys .
That 's been a philosophy we 're trying to execute .
" We do n't want to be thin in an age group or position .
If you have a strong list , the natural progression should almost take care of itself .
"  Should Stuart stick , here is an early guess for the top three lines :  * No .
1 -- Centazzo , Zary , Stankoven ;  * No .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No .
3 -- Caedan Bankier , Matthew Seminoff and Daylan Kuefler .
That top unit -- again , a KTW projection and nothing more -- would have potential to be among the most potent in the league .
" With Zary and Centazzo , you 've got a spot on the right side and there are some options , two or three guys that have the potential to do that , " Blazers ' bench boss Clouston said .
" Stankoven is a guy that could play up there .
Pillar and Sopotyk .
we 'll take a look at a lot of different things .
"  Stankoven , Bankier and Seminoff , each of whom will be 17 next season , and Kuefler and Pillar , entering their 18-year-old campaigns , made significant strides this past season and seem poised to continue trending upward .
Reese Belton , who will be 18 , played in 32 games last season and is expected to be given opportunity to earn more ice time in 2020-2021 .
Fraser Minten signed in January with the Blazers .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 points in 34 games last season , a 15-year-old toiling alongside Connor Bedard for West Vancouver Academy midget prep in the Canadian Sport School Hockey League .
Bedard has been granted exceptional player status and is eligible to play full-time next season in the WHL as a 15-year-old .
He is the first player from Western Canada to be granted exceptional status in the CHL .
Minten seems likely to crack the Blazers ' roster next season .
" Once he made the decision to commit to come to Kamloops , I felt his game took off , " Bardsley said .
" Maybe the pressure was off .
Now , he knows where he 's going to be .
Tye Spencer , who played for us on that East Division swing and in exhibition , is a crafty little player .
He 's going to have an opportunity to make the team , as well .
"  Bardsley could opt to add a forward in the CHL Import Draft , with blue liner Libor Zabransky , who will be 20 , a European in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those are conversations we 're going to have with Zabransky shortly to get a bit of a feel , " Bardsley said .
" He can come back , whether with us or into the league .
I 'm sure he has an opportunity to play pro hockey .
"  Defenceman Inaki Baragano will occupy the club 's other European slot .
THE DEFENCEMEN  Again , Bardsley 's decisions on 20-year-olds will help determine how the roster looks on the back end , along with the addition of two rookies ready to log regular minutes .
Shaun Clouston and the GM plan to discuss the roster this week and conduct exit meetings with players , looking to highlight areas for improvement and hear feedback .
" We wo n't come to camp with three overage guys .
There will be more , " Clouston said .
" We 've got until October 10th to make a decision .
There 's definitely not a decision being made today .
"  Onyebuchi and Strange are top-four D-men , if they are here .
If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have trade value , most likely to return draft capital .
Quinn Schmiemann is pegged bell cow , the Tampa Bay Lightning draft pick certain to eat huge minutes and in line to take over from Martin as point man on the power play .
" I hope to be a guy that 's counted on , but nothing comes easy , so you 've just got to work hard this summer and be prepared for next year , " Schmiemann said .
Bardsley took a risk drafting Mats Lindgren seventh overall in the 2019 WHL Bantam Draft , but that gamble appears to have paid off .
Lindgren , who was verbally committed to play for the University of Michigan , signed last June with Kamloops and is expected to play regularly next season in the WHL as a 16-year-old .
Connor Levis , a forward nabbed 20th overall by Bardsley in the same draft , remains unsigned by the Blazers and verbally committed to Michigan .
" I still feel confident he will be a Blazer , " Bardsley said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his family .
"  Logan Bairos , who will be 17 , nearly cracked the Blazers ' roster out of training camp last summer .
He is expected to be a fixture in the defensive rotation in 2020-2021 .
" For Mats and Logan , with their development , we have to fast-track that a little bit , " said Bardsley , noting both players earned limited regular-season minutes with the Blazers this past season .
" We 're going to be graduating at least Max Martin .
And it could be one or two from the back end depending on what happens with Strange and Onyebuchi .
"  Baragano seems poised to occupy a top-four spot when play resumes .
Ethan Brandwood , who will be 18 , impressed Clouston during limited minutes last season and adds to a group that will be younger than it was in 2019-2020 .
Boston Buckberger , who turns 17 in June , is unsigned , but garnering interest from Blazers ' management after a strong midget campaign for the Saskatoon Blazers .
" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got Baragano , who I think has the potential to have an outstanding year coming up , " Clouston said .
" The back end , potentially , right now , the way it is set up , is younger , but we have some key guys returning that have the ability to play top four .
It 's not like there is a big hole at the top we have to fill .
" I do n't think anybody anticipated Seminoff to play on the third line for a big chunk of the year .
With Bairos and Lindgren , those guys have the potential to play higher up .
"  THE GOALTENDERS  Garand enters his 18-year-old season as the unquestioned No .
1 starter , expected to be selected in this summer 's NHL Draft following a stellar and injury-shortened season .
Dylan Garand in action earlier this season .
- Allen Douglas/KTW  " When you 're looking at a little bit younger back end , goaltending becomes crucial and we believe we 've got one of the best guys in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After that , there will be conversations .
"  Dylan Ernst , who will be 16 , was the first goaltender selected in the 2019 bantam draft , picked by Kamloops in Round 2 , 20th overall .
Rayce Ramsay , who will be 19 , held the fort while Garand was injured , starting 10 straight games in February in March , winning six of them .
He posted a .
save percentage and 3 .
GAA in 25 games , finishing with a record of 13-8-1-0 and three shutouts .
" There is an opportunity to bring three guys into camp and go from there , " Clouston said .
" There is also opportunity to do different things at all three positions , forward , defence and goaltending .
" It 's so early .
There are going to be conversations , different options looked at .
"  THE COACHING STAFF  Head coach Clouston took over last summer from Serge Lajoie .
The former Medicine Hat Tiger 's impact was immediate .
He is under contract and will return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Clouston said .
" My roots were pretty deep here in Medicine Hat .
I 'd been in one spot for 16 years .
It was a huge challenge , but one that I really embraced .
It was one of the most rewarding years in my entire carer , to go into somewhere new , mesh with the staff and work with the different personalities to try to create a team atmosphere and be a facilitator for that .
"  Whether his brother comes back is another story -- one Blazers ' fans will be following .
Cory Clouston 's future with the Kamloops Blazers is uncertain .
Cory Clouston 's meticulous approach to tactics and film study paid dividends , among other areas , on the power play .
The Blazers finished second in the league with a conversion percentage of 26 .
per cent , tallying 77 goals in 288 attempts .
In 2018-2019 , the local WHL club clicked on the power play at 20 .
per cent , tallying 53 goals in 258 attempts .
" We do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach in the NHL , " Shaun Clouston said .
" I think that 's something he would like to do again .
I do n't know what options will open up at this level or at different levels .
If he does n't find a head coaching job , I think he would be excited to come back .
" Maybe we 've got some unfinished business here .
We had a real team , a team with character and heart and compete and all the things you need going into the playoffs .
"  Added Bardsley : " He Cory did a really good job connecting with our players , a real good teacher of the game .
It 's a unique situation , coaching with his brother , but I thought it was a very professional coaching relationship .
"  The Blazers and Winterhawks boasted penalty kills that clicked at 83 .
per cent , leaving them tied for third in the league in the category .
" That 's why it was tough the way it ended .
It was a special group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" We 're looking forward to having as many of them return as possible to continue with what we 're doing .
"  Bardsley also gave a a nod to veteran trainer Colin ( Toldeo ) Robinson for helping keep the team together through all manner of maladies .
" Toledo is a big part of what we do , " Bardsley said .
THE DRAFT  Bardsley has draft capital at his disposal .
In 2020 , the Blazers have one pick each in the first , second and fifth rounds , and will select once in rounds seven through 12 .
Kamloops has two picks each in the third and fourth rounds and three picks in Round 6 .
The Regina Pats will pick first overall in the draft , which will be conducted online on April 22 due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
Kamloops will pick 19th in Round 1 and all subsequent rounds .
The Blazers ' 2021 draft board is also plentiful .
Kamloops has one pick each in the first , fourth and fifth rounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 and Round 6 , and three picks in Round 7 .
