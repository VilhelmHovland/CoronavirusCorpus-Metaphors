Social isolation for COVID-19 increases the risk of ' deaths of despair ' Opinion  We are in uncharted territory .
Never before have we been asked as a society to distance ourselves so dramatically from one another , and while these recommendations are 100% necessary to combat the spread of a deadly illness , the psychological consequences of social distancing are not trivial .
Numerous scientific studies on the adverse health consequences of social isolation suggest that we are on the brink of a potentially devastating mental health crisis that can increase the death toll from COVID-19 .
Social isolation increases the risk for " deaths of despair " like suicide or overdose as well as deaths from other causes like heart disease and cancer .
People will die from COVID-19 , and some will succumb to the adverse effects of the social distancing that is so vital to slowing the spread of the infection .
This impending crisis of isolation will affect rich and poor , young and old .
But no one is more at risk than our older , chronically ill population and their families .
Video chatting and talking on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older adults have the knowledge , skills and financial resources to use technology .
According to the most recent 2017 Pew statistics , 42% of U .
adults 65 or older own smartphones , but that number drops to 17% for those over the age of 80 .
Only 34% of U .
adults over the age of 65 report using social networking sites like Facebook or Twitter , which , in the age of social distancing , will help many people stay connected .
Furthermore , 17% of adults over the age of 65 have vision impairment and half of the adults over the age of 75 have difficulty hearing , which makes talking on the phone or video chatting challenging or impossible .
Older adults are being asked to isolate , and many will not have the resources and skills to mitigate the health-damaging effects of isolation .
Decades ago , physicians and nurses made house-calls .
During these visits , the clinician would not only perform important procedures but also allay feelings of anxiety or loneliness with a reassuring smile or a gentle hand on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of policy shifts that frequently undermine efforts to provide quality health care .
When clinicians provide less care , family members must pick up the slack , but social distancing will keep many away .
These family members may feel guilty or conflicted , but they should hold tight to the knowledge they are doing the responsible thing by social distancing during this epidemic , and try to channel your distress to productive measures .
For example , send care packages , make photo albums and scrapbooks for your loved ones .
If your loved ones are currently in a facility that is on lock-down , perhaps staff can help set up video chats for residents or read emails or letters out loud to help combat loneliness and isolation .
This kind of technology can also offer support for those with a limited life expectancy and their families .
But what is the adaptation to being able to hold the hand of a loved one too ill to speak on the phone ? In 2018 , the Governor 's Advisory Council on End-of-Life Care in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this crisis only underscores the need for action on that recommendation .
We also need to make it easier for everyone in New Jersey to receive mental health care .
Currently , New Jersey 's criteria for clinical psychologists to become licensed differ from our neighbors in New York and Pennsylvania .
Many psychologists licensed and practicing in New York or Pennsylvania are unable to become licensed in New Jersey , which contributes to the lack of highly trained mental health care providers in our state .
It is time to develop one national licensing process for clinicians to expand the availability of mental health and telemental health nation-wide .
Humans are remarkably resilient .
We have survived and rebuilt after natural disasters , wars and countless other tragedies .
We are in a tremendous period of uncertainty about our future .
How long will this last ? How many will die ? Now , more than ever , we must practice staying focused on the present and incorporating self-care techniques , such as getting enough sleep , sticking to a routine , nurturing hobbies , exercising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will help keep us strong and healthy during this stressful time .
People will die from COVID-19 , and some will succumb to the adverse effects of the social distancing that is so vital to slowing the spread of the infection .
