LETTER : History lessons on self-isolation  Outside Eyam , a village in England , there is a boulder which is known as the ' boundary stone ' .
During the bubonic plague of 1665-66 , the inhabitants of Eyam quarantined themselves to prevent the spread of plague in their village from spreading to neighbouring villages .
The plague had come to them via a flea-infected cloth sent from London to a local merchant .
When the plague was over , one quarter of the 1,000 inhabitants were dead .
However , the plague did not spread beyond the village .
Eyam isolating itself came about through the efforts of the local priest , William Mompesson .
He realized that going to other places would bring the plague with them and infect others .
He convinced them to stay home and also to prevent others coming to them .
A few tried to leave but most accepted their plight and made a pact with God to remain .
Food from outside was left at the boundary stone as well as money from the village to pay for it .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the event  This story is not only inspiring but it demonstrates how viruses are transmitted -- from person to person -- and it shows us the social distancing can contain outbreaks .
For the villagers there was a cost : they daily faced death and many succumbed .
Hopefully , self-isolation for us will be a protection from the virus , keeping each other safe .
The cost will be some deprivation and/or emotional and mental distress .
For others whose circumstances limit their self-isolation , there is greater risk , especially those on the front lines in health care .
Along the way a wisdom saying or prayer may be helpful , such as the Serenity Prayer : give me the serenity to accept the things I can not change , courage to change the things I can , and wisdom to know the difference .
