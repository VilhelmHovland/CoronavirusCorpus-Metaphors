0  Final Fantasy VII Remake is scheduled for April 10 in most countries and fans around the world ca n't wait to play this beautiful-looking action RPG , especially after the amazing demo .
In a fairly interesting bit of news , Square Enix revealed something interesting ; due to the Coronavirus , the company will actually release the game a bit early for those who live in Europe and Australia .
Square Enix confirmed the news on Twitter and asked fans who purchase the game early to not spoil it for anyone .
This might sound like an absurd request since most people already know the main plot of this game due to the PSOne original but there are a few new twists in there that will probably surprise us .
While we 're sure a number of fans will post spoilers on discussion-based websites like Reddit , here 's hoping they do n't do the same on social media .
Then again , we 're sure there will be a few assholes who will want to spoil your fun .
People can be pretty cruel .
Admittedly , most fans are smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be a problem .
At the least , some fans will know a bit more about Final Fantasy VII Remake than others and that 's okay .
Everyone is still getting the game , whether it comes out earlier or on April 10 .
Unless you only have an Xbox One , PC , or Nintendo Switch .
In that case , you 're gon na have to wait a bit longer .
Final Fantasy VII Remake will still come to North America and other countries on April 10 .
Europe and Australia might have it already .
