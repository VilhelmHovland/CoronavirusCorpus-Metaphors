A much-loved Orillia couple , Lyle and Elizabeth Fox , died two days apart late last week , victims of the dreaded coronavirus .
" We never expected something like this - to lose our parents so quickly , together , and in such a bizarre manner , " said their daughter , Jennifer Thorne .
She said she and her family and her brother Mike , who lives in B .
, are devastated .
She is pleading with people to take COVID-19 seriously and to heed warnings from the authorities .
" The most important thing is , please , please listen to the government , to the health professionals and stay home , " she urged .
" Please do n't put other people at risk .
"  And if you have ignored the warnings , she encourages people to call the authorities and confess .
" If you have been out in the community when you should n't have been , please let the authorities know , " she said .
Thorne , who lives in Arnprior , said she has been " overwhelmed " by support from people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had an " always growing circle of friends " that have been providing encouragement and assistance from afar .
The reality of the pandemic is crushing , said Thorne , who is trying to make arrangements from afar ; she is looking forward to a time " when we can hug again .
"  She knows her parents will be missed by many .
Elizabeth , 78 , was a long-time Royal Bank teller and an avid artist .
Lyle , 82 , worked for many years at Bell Canada , before becoming a part-time courier for MDS Labs .
While Elizabeth had some underlying health issues that made her vulnerable to the virus , Lyle " was in tip-top shape , " Thorne said , noting her dad worked out religiously and walked regularly .
In the first week of March , Liz and Lyle had decided to self-isolate to try to protect themselves , with Lyle venturing out only for groceries and other necessities .
It 's uncertain how Elizabeth contracted the virus .
But as they were isolating together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Lyle not to get the deadly virus .
And while Thorne is devastated , she is thankful for those who helped her parents in their final days .
She said a Simcoe County Paramedic Services attendant named Paul , and his colleague , " risked their lives " to come into her parents ' home two different times to bring them to Orillia Soldiers ' Memorial Hospital ( OSMH ) .
Their family doctor , Dr .
Peter Daniel , was " an absolute godsend , " said Thorne , who also praised the front-line staff at OSMH , including nurse Gwen Forrest .
" She was with dad right to the end , " said Thorne , noting Forrest grew up in the same neighbourhood where the Foxes have lived for more than 50 years and recognized Lyle when he was brought to the hospital .
" These doctors and nurses and technicians and paramedics and front-line staff .
they deserve our esteem .
They are absolutely amazing , " said Thorne .
For the circle of friends that knew and loved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be felt deeply .
Dick Sleep first ran into Lyle in 1972 at the Orillia YMCA .
" He was trying to get and stay in shape as was I , " recalled Sleep of his friend of almost 50 years .
" We both worked for large organizations , he the Bell Telephone company and me the OPP .
Over the years we ran together , biked , and skied , had a few drinks and generally looked after each other .
"  Sleep quickly learned Lyle had a great sense of humour - and had home-court advantage .
" Because Lyle was from Orillia ( actually Dalrymple ) and worked with many other Orillians he always had an advantage over me because I was n't born here and any interaction with some of the locals I had was , on occasion , not very friendly , " quipped Sleep .
Lyle was often out and about , working in the community .
" Any time you wanted to find Lyle you looked for a small tent over a manhole .
Look down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses perched on the end of his nose , splicing wire , " said Sleep .
In later years , after retiring from Bell , he got a part-time job working for MDS Labs ; his visits to local doctors offices always brought smiles to the faces of those who worked there .
Liz was a long-time teller at Royal Bank .
" She had a heart of gold and everywhere she went she knew somebody , " said Sleep .
Both gave back to the community in their own way .
" Lyle was big into the CANUS Games back in the day and had also been a Scoutmaster , " said Sleep .
" He was well known for the number of blood donations he made .
"  Liz volunteered at the hospital and helped at many bank functions .
" They both joined the Probus Club and joined the shufflers at Rotary Place , " said Sleep .
They were a well-suited couple , said Sleep .
" Liz was the perfect victim .
She always got wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course Lyle would rub it in , " said Sleep .
" Lyle had many stories to tell about Liz which would get her going but privately I think she wanted to be the centre of attention and played the victim very well .
"  Sleep said he will dearly miss his beloved friends .
" Liz and Lyle were wonderful people who really enjoyed their friends , " said Sleep .
" It was obvious they loved each other , their kids and grandson very much .
"  Because of the pandemic , no funeral will be held .
However , a celebration will be planned when " we can hug again .
