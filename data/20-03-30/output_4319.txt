' Just one case ' : fears coronavirus may spread like wildfire in world 's refugee camps  By Reuters - 29 March 2020  A child sleeps on a makeshift trailer with belongings from his family on while people flee their villages , on the road from Barsalogho to Kaya .
Barsalogho is a small town in northern Burkina Faso that hosts 10,000 displaced persons and refugees fleeing the resulting jihadist and inter-community violence .
Burkina Faso , which borders Mali and Niger , is facing jihadist attacks , which have killed more than 750 people since 2015 .
Under-equipped and poorly trained law enforcement agencies in Burkina Faso are unable to stop the spiral of violence .
According to the United Nations , jihadist attacks in Mali , Niger and Burkina have resulted in 4,000 deaths in 2019 .

The 25-year-old is worried that the disease will devastate the vast , crowded camps that house more than one million Rohingya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutal military crackdown in Myanmar .
" We are living in tiny , crowded shelters , we are sharing toilets , " he told Reuters .
" It is very difficult to protect ourselves , it 's too crowded , people ca n't breathe well .
"  Bangladesh , which has reported 48 cases of the virus and five deaths , imposed a lockdown on Tuesday , the same day it confirmed the first case in Cox 's Bazar , the coastal district where the Rohingya camps are located .
A family of four Rohingya have been quarantined after returning from India .
As the coronavirus forces the world 's big cities and wealthiest countries into lockdown , a potential humanitarian catastrophe threatens tens of millions of people crowded into refugee camps and makeshift settlements for displaced people from Bangladesh to Syria and across Africa , where healthcare and clean water is often scarce , sanitation is poor , illnesses are rife and social distancing is almost impossible .
" God forbid , if the virus gets into the camps , it would have a catastrophic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief and repatriation commissioner , told Reuters .
The United Nations says almost 70 million people uprooted by war and persecution around the world are in acute danger .
" We must come to the aid of the ultra-vulnerable -- millions upon millions of people who are least able to protect themselves , " said U .
Secretary-General Ant ? nio Guterres this week .
UNHCR , the U .
agency charged with protecting refugees , is looking to raise $255 million from member states to tackle the problem , part of a wider U .
response plan seeking $2 .
billion .
To be sure , camps in Bangladesh and elsewhere have experienced outbreaks of measles , diphtheria and other respiratory infections , and the SARS ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ) and Ebola epidemics did not lead to large-scale infections or mass deaths of refugees .
However , the latest coronavirus has exceeded all previous outbreaks , infecting almost 600,000 people globally and killing more than 27,000 , according to a Reuters tally .
For an interactive graphic tracking the global spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' JUST ONE CASE '  The mazy hills around Cox 's Bazar in Bangladesh are more densely populated than the most crowded cities on earth , with 60,000 to 90,000 people jammed into each square kilometer where as many as a dozen people share single small shelters and many more use the same water well and toilet .
Arafat , who fled violence in Myanmar eight years ago , urges people in his short videos to wash their hands and keep their distance from one another .
But he can not share the videos as mobile networks in the area have been curtailed by the government since last year on unspecified security grounds .
As a result , both he and aid workers are struggling to educate the population about the spread of the virus .
In recent days volunteers have been blasting public health messages from radios and loudspeakers , but Arafat said rumours and misinformation persist , with some pinning their hopes on prayer , eating leaves and exposure to heat to ward off the virus .
" It needs just one case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Cox 's Bazar-based aid worker from the International Committee of the Red Cross .
Further spread would be " uncontrollable , " he added .
The closest hospital with an intensive care unit is in the town of Cox 's Bazar .
The U .
refugee agency says it is trying to expand the capacity to 10 beds and to improve healthcare services inside the camps , but as rumours spread , some are panicking .
" What is happening ! " Mohammed Junaid , 21 , said in a message to Reuters .
" If something happens , where will we go for treatment ? "  MIDDLE EAST , AFRICA AT RISK  Similar fears are spreading in regions torn by war and natural disasters in the Middle East and Africa .
In Syria , where nearly a decade of war has uprooted 6 .
million people and forced some 5 .
million to flee to neighbouring states , the coronavirus is a new threat for communities ill-equipped to deal with it .
" We do n't wash our hands much because water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has lived for five years in a camp for displaced people on muddy ground near the town of Azaz , which houses about 150 families in grimy tents .
" Gloves and masks are not available and if they are available they are very expensive , " said al-Ahmad , who lives with his wife and seven children .
At another camp in nearby Idlib province , families have been moved from several large communal tents into individual tents , an effort to pre-empt the spread of the virus , though no cases have been recorded in the rebel-held northwest yet .
" We 've split them up as much as we can , " said Ibrahim Sahhari , an administrator at the camp near Maarat Misrin .
Idlib has received around 1,500 coronavirus testing kits in the last few days .
Its population is close to 3 million .
" Isolation is so difficult , " said Mohamed Tennari , a doctor and medical coordinator in the Idlib region .
" Some people are still living in schools or in mosques .
So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help the virus to spread very widely .
"  ' PERFECT STORM '  In Burkina Faso in western Africa , the Barsalogho camp houses about 75,000 people fleeing a jihadist insurgency , many in wood-framed tents covered with straw mats and white tarpaulin , pitched close together .
Medical charities warn residents of the dangers of coronavirus , which has already spread across the capital Ouagadougou , infecting over 150 and killing eight .
But shortages of water and sanitary supplies are making it difficult .
Families of up to 10 people share about 20 litres of water a day , or about five gallons , said Manenji Mangundu , who leads operations for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Burkina Faso , well below the 35 litres per person that the NRC says is enough for a proper response to the coronavirus .
" The situation in densely populated camps such as Barsalogho with poor healthcare is the perfect storm for a devastating outbreak .
Facilities are shared , shelters are shared .
If one case is reported in the site , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sawadogo , 27 , lives at the camp with his family and shares a tent with 10 people .
" I know we should wash our hands all the time and not greet people in the normal way , " he said , adding that he was aware of the growing number of cases from television news reports , but sometimes he has no water .
In central Mozambique , where more than 90,000 victims of last year 's Cyclone Idai are still living in resettlement camps , large families of more than 10 people cram into one tent , with shared water sources and latrines , often open air with only plastic sheets for privacy .
In some cases thousands of people share one water source , or they have to walk hours to one used by nearby communities .
Espinola Caribe , the World Food Programme 's head of sub-office in Beira , the port city where the cyclone made landfall and displaced tens of thousands of people , said any virus outbreak would be a disaster for those with immune systems weakened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed in the camps and posters printed to raise awareness as aid workers try to spread the message face to face .
Many camp residents do not have phones , and when they do , there is no guarantee they have power .
Even when the message gets across , Caribe said conditions make it very difficult for people to comply : tents become unbearably hot in the daytime and families are forced to mix at water points , where there might be a shared bucket for collection , and conditions can be unsanitary .
NOT THE FIRST  In Somalia , where violence and natural disasters have displaced 2 .
million of the country 's 15 million people , tens of thousands of families are dotted around the capital Mogadishu under makeshift tents of rags stretched over a frame of sticks .
Lucky ones may have a plastic tarpaulin .
The seasonal rains have just begun .
Somali telecom companies are sending text messages about the importance of washing hands .
But many have no soap and very little water , so simply use sand and ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several families might share one 20-litre container .
" We are already living in bad conditions and if coronavirus visits us , then there is no hope for life , " said Hawa Ali Ibrahim , a 50-year-old mother .
She lives with her husband , three children and grandchildren in the capital 's Alafuuto Camp , where there is no soap .
" We use sand and ashes to wash our hands .
"  Neighbouring Kenya is home to nearly half a million registered refugees , about 217,000 of those living in one sprawling camp called Dadaab , near the Somali border , according to the U .
UNHCR is training health workers -- some of whom are refugee community leaders -- and running a multilingual hotline for refugees to report symptoms .
They are increasing the distribution of soap and creating more hand-washing stations .
There have been no reported coronavirus cases in East Africa camps , said UNHCR East Africa spokeswoman Dana Hughes .
" These are not the first pandemics that we 've dealt with , " Hughes told Reuters .
