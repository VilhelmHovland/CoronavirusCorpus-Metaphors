Police are investigating a break-in at a Dutch art museum that is currently closed because of restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus , the museum and police said Monday .
( AP Photo/Peter Dejong ) The Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent van Gogh was stolen in an overnight smash-and-grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus , police and the museum said Monday .
The Singer Laren museum east of Amsterdam said " The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884 " by the Dutch master was taken in the early hours of Monday .
By early afternoon , all that could be seen from the outside of the museum was a large white panel covering a smashed door in the building 's glass facade .
Museum General Director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is " angry , shocked , sad " at the theft .
The value of the work , which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen , was not immediately known .
Van Gogh 's paintings , when they rarely come up for sale , fetch millions at auction .
Police are investigating the theft .
" I 'm shocked and unbelievably annoyed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudolph de Lorm .
" This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen - removed from the community , " he added .
" It is very bad for the Groninger Museum , it is very bad for the Singer , but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us , the community , to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from , especially in these difficult times .
"  The 25-by-57-centimeter ( 10-by-22-inch ) oil on paper painting shows a person standing in a garden surrounded by trees with a church tower in the background .
It dates to a time when the artist had moved back to his family in a rural area of the Netherlands and painted the life he saw there , including his famous work " The Potato Eaters , " in mostly somber tones .
Later , he moved to southern France , where he developed a far more colorful , vibrant style of painting as his health declined before his death in 1890 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum .
That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it were gone .
A team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbors .
Van Os said the museum 's security worked " according to protocol , " but he added : " Obviously we can learn from this .
"  The Dutch government on March 12 banned large crowds among its measures to halt the spread of the virus , leading several museums to close temporarily .
Before the closure , the museum was hosting an exhibition titled " Mirror of the Soul " with works by artists ranging from Jan Toorop to Piet Mondrian , in cooperation with Amsterdam 's Rijksmuseum .
The Singer Laren 's collection has a focus on modernism such as neo-impressionism , pointillism , expressionism and cubism .
It is not the first high profile theft from the museum .
In 2007 , thieves stole seven works from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Thinker " by Auguste Rodin .
The famous sculpture was recovered a few days later , missing a leg .
