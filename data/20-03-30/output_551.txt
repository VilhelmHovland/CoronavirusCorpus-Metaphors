Loss of polling site will aid Jefferson County incumbent , JP challenger says  The loss of a polling site in the Jefferson County town of Sherrill has one candidate expressing concern that his opponent in the District 13 Justice of the Peace runoff election has been handed a competitive advantage in the race .
Jeff Edwards of Sherrill , who is facing incumbent Justice of the Peace Brenda Bishop Gaddy of Altheimer , said the closure of the polling site in Sherrill puts him at a disadvantage , now that voters from six precincts in Sherrill , Tucker and Wright will be required to travel to Altheimer to cast a ballot on Tuesday .
In the March 3 Democratic primary , Gaddy and Edwards were the two top candidates , with Gaddy receiving 222 votes to Edwards ' 194 .
Because neither candidate received more than 50% of the vote , they were forced into a runoff .
In the three weeks since the primary , however , a pandemic that many believed at the time would be a minor annoyance has continued spreading across the state , the nation , and the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas , the first case of covid-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus , was confirmed on March 11 at Jefferson Regional Medical Center .
In the two weeks since , cases have risen in different parts of the state , and Arkansas recorded its first deaths .
An executive order by Gov .
Asa Hutchinson allowed emergency consolidation of polling sites and expanded absentee voting eligibility to all voters , shrinking the number of Jefferson County polling sites for the runoff from 14 to six .
That number then dropped to five when Sherrill Mayor Jody Campbell gave the order that Sherrill City Hall would not be a polling site on March 31 , forcing the consolidation of the Sherrill and Altheimer polling sites .
Edwards said he has a lot of support in the communities around his home in Sherrill , but he said he fears his supporters may not make the trip to Altheimer on the day of the runoff , something he said could cost him the election .
" In District 13 , there 's a couple of areas that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On that side of the river , there 's an older populace , and I do n't know of many people who want to drive over 60 miles round-trip just to vote , especially with everything that 's going on with this coronavirus .
"  In addition , Edwards said , Gaddy is a member of Mt .
Bayou Baptist Church in Altheimer , the location of the polling site on March 31 .
" My opponent has the opportunity to have the polling site at her place of worship , and she is a resident of the largest voting populace in District 13 , which is Altheimer , " he said .
" It 's going to be a challenge .
"  Contacted by phone on Thursday , Gaddy did not confirm whether she is a member of Mt .
Bayou Baptist Church , but she did indicate that she thought his objections were more of a political ploy than a genuine concern .
" I 'm not commenting on that because he has given me many , many , many challenges , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet with that because I do know politics can get really ugly , and I 'm not going to badger him one way or the other .
I 'm just going to let the people speak for themselves .
"  Gaddy said the spread of covid-19 , coupled with the fact that runoff elections typically see a low voter turnout , presents enough challenges for both of them .
" People do n't want to vote twice , I know that , " she said .
" Both of us are facing the same challenges , really , with the corona cases that 's going on , but there 's nothing I can do about it .
If the people 's going to vote , they 're going to vote anyway .
