' Our voices are not being heard ' -- mart managers appeal to Creed .
Amidst anecdotal reports of " numerous " farm-to-farm transactions on the ground , the Mart Managers of Ireland ( MMI ) is urging the Minister for Agriculture , Food and the Marine , Michael Creed , to provide " much-needed guidance " on alternative trade arrangements .
The association is also frustrated with the department over its apparent " lack of consultation " with marts on last week 's trade suspension , with many operations left " scrambling " for solutions .
Meanwhile , clarification is also being sought on the latest Government restrictions to combat the spread of the highly-infectious virus Covid-19 .
On Tuesday last , March 24 , the Taoiseach , Leo Varadkar , directed that all marts must suspend trading .
In a further public update last Friday , March 27 , the Taoiseach escalated nationwide restrictions advising that citizens " stay at home " -- with exceptions being permitted for certain ' essential services ' , including farming and food production .
Following these developments , MMI chairperson Eimear McGuinness wrote to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sellers -- are reaching out to mart managers to facilitate the movement of livestock .
Insistence  The letter -- which represents the views of around 30 mart managers from across the country -- states : " Marts were ordered to close .
in order to control the spread of Covid-19 .
" However , after hearing many reports of trade continuing between farmers via farm-to-farm transfers with huge numbers of buyers calling to farms , we feel the issue must be addressed by your department so that they can appropriately provide much-needed guidance at this time .
" As your department will be aware , marts are licensed by the Department of Agriculture and are also regulated by other authorities .
We offer weighing and licensed movement of livestock , as well as a trusted payment service -- providing safe and secure payment for sellers .
" We feel that , at present , the department should insist that the movement of all livestock should be processed ( and weighed ) through a mart .
"  Advertisement  Social distancing risk  MMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from visiting farms all over the country ; whilst ensuring that payment to farmers would be secure .
And " most importantly " , as the letter states , this would provide " full traceability " on any transactions and movement of livestock .
" With the marts now closed , social distancing can be controlled in a monitored fashion more strictly .
" The letter went on to say :  While we appreciate the communication efforts your department has kept with us throughout this process , we feel that our voices are not being heard clearly .
" More consultation with mart organisations should have been conducted .
Instead the farming sector and , indeed , ourselves have been left scrambling for unsecured alternatives to mart trade .
The letter concludes : " This correspondence is simply a request to your department to provide a voice to our farming community to convey what actions they are permitted to take ; and what integration in this process mart managers can offer .
