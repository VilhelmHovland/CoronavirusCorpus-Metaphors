Britain wakes up to coronavirus lockdown  Britain has awoken to a virtual lockdown after Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered people to stay at home , shops to close and an end to all social gatherings to halt the spread of coronavirus .
The unprecedented peacetime restrictions , which will last for at least three weeks , were brought in to prevent the state-run National Health Service ( NHS ) being overwhelmed as the number of deaths in Britain rose to 335 .
However , social media images showed London Underground trains were still packed with commuters on Tuesday and one large retail chain suggested it wanted to stay open .
There were complaints the advice was confusing or did not go far enough .
" It is absolutely critical for making sure our NHS is in the strongest position possible to restrict the spread , " Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told BBC TV .
" That means restricting social contact and following the advice the government has put forward .
People must stay at home to protect themselves , to protect the NHS and to save lives .
"  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes for very limited reasons such as going to supermarkets or once a day for exercise , were announced in a national address by Johnson late on Monday .
He had resisted bringing in lockdowns that other European countries have introduced but earlier advice for Britons to avoid gatherings was being widely ignored , with people flocking to parks and beauty spots .
All but essential shops must close immediately and people should no longer meet family or friends .
Police will break up gatherings of more than two people and social events such as weddings , although not funerals , will be stopped .
Gove said stronger measures than STG30 ( $A59 ) fines could be introduced .
" The police have a range of enforcement tools , and of course fixed-penalty notices and fines are just one of them .
If people do persist in behaving in an antisocial way , there are stronger measures that we have , " he told ITV 's Good Morning Britain .
Not everyone though was abiding by the tough measures .
Sports Direct , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would defy the order to close but later said it had asked the government for permission to open .
Gove said Sports Direct was not an essential shop and should close .
However , there was confusion about who should be allowed to continue going to work and what powers the police had to enforce the new guidance .
Gove himself had to correct a mistaken message he gave in an earlier interview that children of divorced or separated children could not move between parents .
Pictures showed the capital 's Underground trains were still crammed with passengers far closer than the two-metre recommended distance apart and London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he disagreed with the current definition of an essential worker .
" Only if you really have to go to work must you be going to work , " he told BBC TV .
Finance minister Rishi Sunak was expected to announce new measures later on Tuesday to help the self-employed so they would not have to go to work after critics said the billions of pounds of measures to help @ @ @ @ @ .
