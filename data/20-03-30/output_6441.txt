-- Adriene Hill  Coronavirus &amp; Daily Life  LA Suspends All Farmers Markets , Expands Eviction Moratorium  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , 2020 5:12 PM  All farmers markets in Los Angeles will be suspended until they can show the city they have a plan to enforce safe social distancing among their patrons , the mayor said Monday night , citing crowds that gathered this weekend .
" Now , this is a little different than the other closures because food is essential .
And I do n't want the closing of farmers markets to have even bigger crowds at our grocery stores , " Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said during his nightly update on the city 's response to the coronavirus pandemic .
Markets will now be required to submit plans that enforce physical distancing to the city 's Bureau of Street Services .
Garcetti said that will likely mean markets need to have one entrance and one exit and must enforce a safe distance between people waiting in line .
Markets will not be allowed to operate until they submit their plans .
Garcetti said the city also had to close Silver Lake Meadow , a popular spot near the Silver Lake Reservoir where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closure adds to the numerous park and trail closures already in effect across the city and county .
Garcetti also said the city is expanding the eviction moratorium that 's currently in effect .
The moratorium covers both commercial and residential units , and tenants will now have a full year to pay back any rent they ca n't afford to pay during the current pandemic , per a city ordinance Garcetti said he signed today .
" If you can not pay the rent as a result of this emergency , you can not be evicted , " he said .
In addition , Garcetti is implementing a new emergency order that puts a temporary hold on all rent increases in rent-stabilized units , of which he said there are 624,000 across 118,000 buildings in the city .
Normally , landlords can increase the rent by 4% per year under the Rent Stabilization Order .

He warned drivers that LAPD officers will be issuing tickets .

( Photo by JIM WATSON / AFP ) ( Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images ) JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Ima  Donald Trump on Monday warned Americans to prepare for more disruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks amid the coronavirus pandemic .
The U .
president acknowledged on Sunday that his goal of returning to normality by Easter wo n't happen and said the federal guidelines for social distancing would remain in effect until April 30 .
" Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days , " Trump said .
He warned Americans to expect at least another month of social distancing -- with all of its social and economic consequences -- would be necessary .
That decision was based on modeling that indicates the peak in fatalities might not arrive for another two weeks .
Public health authorities believe social isolation and bans on groups larger than 10 people will slow down the spread of COVID-19 and a smaller population of infected people will reduce the burden on hospitals and medical workers .

Financial markets , at least , have been buoyed by the passage of the relief legislation and the commitments by leaders in Washington -- including Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell -- to take whatever measures are necessary to sustain the economy through the crisis .
Trump on Monday hailed what he called the valuable contributions made by American industry and invited a number of company bosses to discuss their production .
Trump also said that a number of companies are producing ventilators to help the growing number of hospital patients .
The latest announcement came from Ford and GE Healthcare , which are on track to build 50,000 ventilators within the next 100 days .
Trump said that if the country produces more ventilators than America can use , he will send the surplus machines to Europe , perhaps Italy , France or Spain .

Villanueva : ' Here 's A Message For The Board Of Supervisors '  Updated March 30 , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  In a press conference this morning , officials from the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's department provided an update on coronavirus in local jails , including the announcement that an inmate has tested positive .
One inmate and four people working in the county jail system have tested positive for COVID-19 .
The inmate was housed at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility .
According to today 's briefing , he was removed from the housing area on the morning of March 26 , and has since been in isolation .
His condition is stable .
No one who had contact with the inmate is currently experiencing symptoms .
However , 190 inmates are in temporary quarantine , pending testing results .
Villanueva then turned the topic to the board 's effort to make changes to emergency protocol :  Here 's a message for the Board of Supervisors .

7 More Dead Of COVID-19 In LA County ; 6 Deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 2:49 PM  Published March 30 , 2020 12:59 PM  Seven more people have died in Los Angeles County because of the new coronavirus , bringing the total number of deaths countywide to 44 , while the number of positive cases has increased by 342 .
Six of those who died were older than 65 and one was between 41-65 years old .
In addition , six of the people who died had pre-existing health conditions , including the younger one .
In total so far , six of the people who have died in L .
County were residents of nursing homes , according to county public health director Barbara Ferrer .
That 's a sobering reminder that while most of the infections continue to be among people aged 18 to 65 , it is the elderly and those with underlying conditions who are getting hit hardest , and the more people who are infected , the greater the danger to those who are most vulnerable .
Earlier reports stated outbreaks at three nursing facilities and nursing homes .
Ferrer said the health department defines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three or more positive cases .
In total now there are outbreaks at 11 " institutional settings " -- a term Ferrer is using to include nursing homes and other facilities like jails and prisons .
Staff , faculty , and residents of all 11 facilities have been notified , Ferrer said .
In all , positive cases have been reported at 25 institutional settings .
That apparently includes one inmate at a jail , though Ferrer would n't say which one .
The total number of cases across all of these settings is 130 .
Here are some more takeaways from today 's update :  2,474 total cases in L .
County  86% of the people who have died also had underlying health conditions  The mortality rate for COVID-19 remains at 1 .
, though this is a number that will continue to fluctuate as more positive cases are identified  492 people have been hospitalized so far , or about 20% of all positive cases  Of those hospitalized , 184 were 50 or older , and 46% were over 65  26% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inmate has tested positive and been removed from the jail to isolation at a medical facility  4 staff members at correctional facilities have also tested positive ; all are isolated now , and their close contacts are quarantined  2 positive cases among the homeless , and these individuals are also in isolation with their close contacts being identified and quarantined  1 staff person working to provide homeless services has also tested positive  " Dozens and dozens of cases " among health care workers , Ferrer said , and investigations are ongoing where they work to identify possible exposures  As of yesterday , more than 15,500 people have been tested , and 12% of them have been positive  " It 's a good opportunity to remind all of us to be so grateful for the dedication of all of our healthcare workers .
They really do put their lives on the risk , on the line every single day .
They 're taking a lot of risks , caring for people who are often very sick and need elaborate and close contact in the care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt of gratitude for being on the job and doing such a good job .

California Gov .
Gavin Newsom announced what his office described as " a major initiative to surge California 's health care workforce " as the state deals with the novel coronavirus .
HEALTH CARE WORKER SURGE PLAN  The state is seeking additional health care staff to assist with the projected surge in coronavirus patients , with Newsom asking health professionals to register at HealthCorps .
The effort includes working with health professionals who may have retired in the last five years or are currently working to get licensed or relicensed .
The shift in licensing requirements is currently set to last through June 30 .
Over the next few weeks , Newsom expects that the state will be able to provide enough resources -- such as hospital beds and medical personnel -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this depends on factors like success in finding additional health care workers .
There are about 37,000 potential health workers available who could be tapped , according to Newsom .
Workers being asked to sign up , according to the state website , include :  Newsom asked people who know anyone who might be willing to give their time -- and be compensated for doing so -- to encourage those people to register to join the effort .
He also emphasized that this would only be temporary and that health workers should n't expect this to be the new status quo .
The health care worker surge program is being paid for through a number of sources , including both state and federal funding from sources like FEMA .
Shannon Udovic-Constant with the California Medical Association joined Newsom to encourage fellow medical professionals to sign up to help .
HOSPITAL BEDS AND OTHER RESOURCES  Over the last four days , the number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations in California has doubled , Newsom said .
He said that there are 1,432 hospitalizations , with 597 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county-level information on hospitalizations would also be released .
At least 50,000 additional hospital beds will be needed in the second half of May , according to projections , California Department of Public Health Director Mark Ghaly said .
The largest impediment to increased coronavirus testing at this time is a lack of swabs , Newsom said .
Among other potential surge sites for additional hospital beds , Newsom cited the L .
Coliseum as one location the state is looking at .
There were 150 ventilators that have been refurbished and sent back to L .
County , Newsom said .
Emphasizing the importance of continued social distancing , Newsom compared the current moment to skydiving , saying that we are not yet close to the ground -- so we should n't cut the parachute .
Newsom expressed his thanks to Facebook for donating $25 million in stipends to help with child care .

LAUSD Superintendent Austin Beutner confirmed the " first known diagnosis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video update today .
He said the school district first learned of the case last week .
" Unfortunately , " he added , " as the virus spreads throughout the communities we serve , we know this will not be the only employee or member of our school community who is diagnosed .
"  " Of 120,000 high school students , " he said , " there are about 15,000 with whom there has been no online contact since schools closed .
We 're working to reduce that number to zero .
"  2,000 high school students have received internet hotspots as part of the district 's deal with wireless giant Verizon .
Most high schoolers -- 88% -- have logged on at some point since March 16 , the first day schools were closed .
But the number of students who participate in online classes on a daily basis is lower : on any given day , about 68% of high schoolers log on , Beutner said .
Beutner said officials have started to distribute laptop computers and internet hotspots to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the district 's primary goal is to distribute devices to every high school student who needs them " as soon as we can .
"  While Beutner has not laid out a timetable for distributing all devices , he also counseled patience :  " Imagine trying to change the seats on an airplane , and maybe some of the wiring , while continuing to fly at 30,000 feet in the midst of a terrible thunderstorm in a plane low on fuel .
The shift to online learning in our schools is a bit more difficult .

As more restrictions on daily life have been put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 , we 're driving way less , so it makes sense that vehicle emissions are down .
But just how much is that contributing to our cleaner air ?  Researchers expect that the dramatic dropoff in private vehicle commuting -- plus the slowdown of truck traffic at our local ports in the early weeks of the pandemic -- had a notable impact on our improved air quality .
But it 's too early to accurately measure that impact , Fine said , thanks to that series of rainstorms we got at the same time our commuting and social lives started to taper off .
March is typically " one of our cleaner months , " Fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as winter turns to spring .
Here 's how he explained it :  " Those are the conditions that tend to clean the air anyway , absent any type of reduction in emissions .
So it 's been really difficult for us to tease out whether we 're actually seeing the effect of the lower emissions , or we 're just seeing our typical clean air that we get on these stormy days , and it 's too early to tell which factor is more important , or what we can attribute the clean air to ; it 's probably a combination of both .
"  Fine said it 'll be a week or two before AQMD researchers have a scientific sense of just how much our reduced commuting has helped clear the air .
For reference though , check out this map from NASA showing an eye-popping change in air pollution in China before and after the government there shut down transportation and slowed the economy .
Pasadena Unified Temporarily Stops Grab-And-Go Meal Service  The Pasadena Unified School District temporarily suspended free " grab-and-go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that an employee in one of its central kitchens may have contracted coronavirus .
" While the diagnosis of COVID-19 is not confirmed at this time , our hearts are with our PUSD team member and their family during this very difficult time , " Superintendent Brian McDonald wrote in the announcement .
The district initally said that service would not resume until later in the week , but later in the day it sent out an updated message saying meal distribution will resume on Tuesday with help from volunteers and an outside vendor while the kitchen facility is being cleaned .
Here 's more from the update message :  In an abundance of caution , we temporarily suspended meal service for today , March 30 after we received a report of a possible COVID-19 case involving a PUSD employee who worked in one of our central kitchens .
At this time , the case has not been confirmed .
Following the guidance of the Pasadena Public Health Department , deep cleaning and sanitizing of kitchens and facilities will be conducted , and employee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume regular meal service by PUSD staff on April 14 .

I am so grateful for the strength and commitment demonstrated every day by the employees of PUSD .
In times of crises such as the one we are living through now , it 's clear that heroes do n't always wear capes .
Instead , they use computers and telephones to teach , answer phones and emails to keep our operations functioning , and prepare meals so that our students and their families continue to receive the essential services that they rely on to get through this crisis .

No matter how engaging the professors make the classes , some of their efforts will meet with the reality that online learning is not what some students signed up for .
And motivation wo n't be enough for many community college students to overcome what the coronavirus crisis is throwing at them : lost jobs and many more hours during the day caring for family instead of studying .
