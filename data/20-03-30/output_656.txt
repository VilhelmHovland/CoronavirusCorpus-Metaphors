The American Physical Society canceled its annual March Meeting in Denver , Colorado , the country 's largest physics conference that draws over 10,000 annually , citing health and safety concerns due to the coronavirus outbreak .
The cancelation came less than two days before the conference 's scheduled start date of today , March 2 , leaving participants to cancel travel plans last-minute and even leaving those who arrived early in Denver without a conference to attend .
The APS cited the fact that many attendees would be visiting from outside the U .
, including from countries with the highest warning level for a travel health notice : China , Italy , South Korea , and Iran .

The meeting is among the most important of the year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results and network with peers .
The APS announced the cancellation on Saturday night over social media , through an update to their web page , and in email to participants , followed by a press conference yesterday .
Nature physics journalist Davide Castelvecchi , himself stranded in Denver , reported that the decision came specifically after the CDC upgraded Italy and South Korea to its highest warning level for travel .
Unfortunately , hundreds of physicists from around the world found out about the cancelation after arriving at their hotels on Saturday night or Sunday morning .
Audun Skaugen , a postdoctoral researcher at Tampere University in Finland , told Gizmodo via Twitter that he had gone straight to sleep after checking into his hotel on Saturday , only to wake up to a cancelation email on Sunday morning .
He 'd planned to attend a pre-conference course on machine learning in statistical physics and was going to give a talk on his own research Friday .

I was really looking forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was such a last-minute decision , " he said .
Toma Susi , assistant professor at the Faculty of Physics of the University of Vienna in Austria who would have been attending the meeting for the first time , found out an hour after checking into his hotel on Saturday night .
Both his flight ticket and hotel reservation had strict no-cancelation rules , and booking an earlier return flight was prohibitively expensive , so he chose to stay in Denver and work remotely for the week .

" As far as I can tell , nothing substantively new came out in the last day or two before the cancellation .
I would hope that APS will be transparent about the chain of reasoning that led to this very last-minute decision .
"  The APS wrote in the press release that those who registered for the conference would receive a refund for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels and U .
government funding agencies to " help mitigate financial hardship to people who were planning to attend .
"  Advertisement  With the conference canceled and no online alternative , some physicists turned Twitter into a makeshift virtual conference , sharing videos and forums to the meeting 's hashtags and announcing plans to stream their presentations on schedule .
The APS division of Soft Matter distributed a spreadsheet with many of its sessions and links to videoconferences .
Though the APS urged conference attendees to return home , physicists report struggling to book return flights .
Some are still trying to make use of their time in Denver .
" I came to the March Meeting to hear about new results and the new trends and topics researchers are excited about .
I also had several meetings set up with current and prospective authors , and I was planning on some good networking with people in the communities working on the topics I handle .
The in-person interaction at the March Meeting is invaluable for me , " Giulia Pacchioni , an editor of the Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She now plans to visit labs in the area and network with some of the many stranded physicists .

" However , with more and more flights being cancelled , I 'm a bit anxious about being able to go home without the trip becoming an Odyssey .
