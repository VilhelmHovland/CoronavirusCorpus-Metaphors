It takes a pandemic to render visible the deep inequalities that make up the highly unequal societies we inhabit .
As pandemics go , the power of COVID19 lies in its mobility , along the circuits of global capital , picked up and carried by the upwardly mobile classes feeding the financial and technology hubs of capital .
The irony of neoliberal globalization lies in the disproportionate burden of accelerated mobilities borne by the bodies of the poor at the global margins .
The poor , whose bodies are the sites of neoliberal extraction , are also the bodies to be easily discarded when crises hit .
The images of throngs of people , the poor , now expelled from their spaces of precarious work at the metropolitan centers of financial and technology capital , spaces that are projected as the poster-models of mobility in development propaganda , walking on the long walk home , are circulating across our mobile screens .
Images of a migrant worker dead after the gruelling walk home , a mother pulling her daughter as they try to make their way home , a young man bursting into tears at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries his sleeping daughter on his shoulders , crowds of workers waiting in long lines to board buses , these are the faces of the unequal India made visible by COVID19 .
These images of emaciated men and women , with little children , carrying pots , torn down bags and dilapidated beddings on their heads , walking on the roads and highways that form the infrastructures of the new India are haunting reminders of the masses of displaced people expelled by wars , riots , genocides , and famines .
These forced mobilities as expulsions reflect the worst excesses of neoliberal India , rife with caste-class hierarchies .
Deep inequalities and Indian society  Note in the backdrop of these images the high-rises and the gated communities that house India 's upwardly mobile classes , the classes that fuel its financial and technological imaginaries .
These are the classes that extract the daily labour of the precarious workers .
Ironically , also these same classes are quick to catalyse the expulsion of precarious workers when they are turned into threats , by an inversion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are largely carried by the upwardly mobile bodies traveling across global borders ) and driven by irrational fears .
For those of us in privilege sitting in quarantined safe spaces across the globe , for those of us with the privilege of ample space to enable us to quarantine , for those of behind the gates in the gated communities in the metropole , these images of moving masses of India 's precarious margins disrupt the ideological psychobabble of the " New India " we have been fed over the last three decades .
Or perhaps , we have been so well incorporated into the neoliberal ideology of self-help that we have lost our basic ethical commitment to feel empathy , to connect , and to join in solidarity with those at the margins of the societies we inhabit .
As I witness this apathy , I am reminded of a student from one of those Bombay high-rises who once sermonized that she does not pay much attention to the poverty around her .
We , the middle and upper classes , have habituated ourselves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped up by an ideology that constantly tells us that " we have the resources because we deserve them " and that the " poor are undeserving because they are lazy , not intelligent enough , or simply not entrepreneurial enough .
"  Talk to a techie or an investment banker working in the Silicon Valley circuit and you will be given these moral lessons on the neoliberal ethic and the ideology of " pulling yourself by the bootstraps .
" Ask an investment banker about the plight of the precarious classes amidst a crisis that is largely catalysed by neoliberal globalization , you will be inundated with whataboutery .
I write this OpEd from behind the safe privilege of my laptop screen , guaranteed a shelter , three meals a day , and enough stocked up food to last our family of five for a week .
We have our basic supplies of essential medicine and the basic supplies of daal and rice to meet our needs without having to step out .
We are in lock down mode because we can be in lock down mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most striking feature of the Indian lockdown is the paradox inherent in the state 's management of COVID19 .
Even as the state has decreed Indians to stay indoors , replete with police violence targeting anyone that is seen outside , large crowds of migrant workers are on the streets , walking insurmountable distance to get home .
Contrary to the 24/7 propaganda of the strong leader , the state here is weak and ineffective , demonstrating its lack of preparedness in addressing the needs of those at the margins .
The poor governance , lack of preparedness , and mismanagement of the crisis are publicly on display , contrary to the propaganda the regime concocts regularly .
The absence of careful planning and consideration of the needs of the migrant workers is evident in the absence of infrastructures of care .
For instance , transportation facilities following precautionary measures are entirely missing .
Similarly , transit-housing arrangements for precarious migrant workers following precautionary measures are entirely missing .
Infrastructures for addressing everyday food needs of migrant workers are entirely absent .
All this is ironic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to mobilize material resources quickly to set up infrastructures for marking and incarcerating so-called illegals picked up by its neo-fascist National Register of Citizens .
The precarious workers that hold up the IT-finance economies in the metropole are discardable .
Their bodies can be thrown off , disciplined , and violently targeted by the repressive state in its performance of governance .
What 's more , as amply evident on our screens , their bodies can be subjected to brutal violence and repression unleashed by the police as instruments of the state .
As all this happens , the yuppies from the gated communities that benefit from the labour of these precarious bodies are all too comfortable that the threat has been managed and mitigated .
Note the inversion at work here , much like other discourses of inversions carried out by the neoliberal regime .
The burden of COVID19 , a virus carried into India by the chains of neoliberal mobility , has to be borne by India 's underclasses .
The performance of risk is an inversion of the actual sources of risk .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made visible by COVID19 is constituted amidst extreme neoliberal reforms pursued by a state aligned with the interests of capital .
From the privatization of the telecommunication infrastructures to the privatization of the railways , the current regime is soaked in the worst excesses of the neoliberal ideology .
This translates into the large-scale absence of financial infrastructures , welfare resources , food resources , and essential shelter infrastructures to address the needs of those in poverty .
For a virus that thrives on mobility , guaranteeing these essential infrastructures is central to managing the epidemic .
With the Congress-led neoliberal reforms introduced in the 1990s to the BJP-led accelerated privatization of the Indian economy , the public health infrastructure in India has rapidly dwindled .
The systematic attack on the public health infrastructure has been catalysed by transnational Foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , which in the name of addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic , strategically invested into setting up a privatized management model .
The hegemony of the mantra of public-private partnerships categorically dismantled the already minimal public health infrastructures .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessing on our screens is a clarion call for advocates and activists to mobilize for rapidly building these basic infrastructures of health and wellbeing for the poor and precarious classes across India .
Significant proportion of economic resources need to be deployed toward guaranteeing basic income to every family in India in poverty , and simultaneously building the capacity of the health infrastructure .
The inequalities that we witness amidst COVID19 are not only deeply unethical , but are also strong barriers to effectively addressing the pandemic .
Inequalities profoundly impact the capacity of communities to respond to disease and illness .
Highly unequal societies are also societies that are disproportionately sicker .
The middle and upper middle classes must realize quickly they can not isolate themselves from the disease when the poor are placed at risk .
If India has a shot at addressing the pandemic meaningfully , it needs to accelerate the development and distribution of public resources for the most disenfranchised .
Testing needs to be made universally accessible , along with developing universal infrastructures for treatment .
We desperately need to quickly develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and wellbeing of India 's underclasses .
Doing so will need the active work of dismantling the morally bankrupt neoliberal ideology that has rooted itself in the cellular structures of India .
Nothing short of organized mobilization will achieve this .
The COVID19 crisis makes this amply clear .
How India responds to this pandemic will be a critical moral narrative of the values the nation aspires to .
This is the moment for the forces of the Left , activists , and people 's movements to articulate with clarity the necessary narrative for response , anchored in justice and equality .
