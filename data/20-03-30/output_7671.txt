Search form  SB Councilmember Calls for Off Limits Enforcement  Playgrounds , schoolyards , and parks are being watched closely to prevent people from gathering for sports during the virus crisis .
Santa Barbara City Councilmember Alejandra Gutierrez is asking parents , school officials , police and community leaders to make sure the young and old stay off of school grounds during the stay at home order .
This week there have been several instances of people playing sports and having body contact which can be a high-risk activity when spacing should be six feet due to the coronavirus crisis .
28 Comments  ADAM-I 'm not about reporting or fining anyone because they are in the park but maybe they do need someone to educate them as to the dangers of spreading the disease .
Maybe the doctors on wheels who go to the park every Tuesday could go to the parks on the weekends to educate people on the dangers of large groups of people like the ones that are in Ortega park every Sunday on the basketball courts and surrounding grassy area .
Also hand out masks if they have them .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner authoritarian in so many people .
For the authoritarians , it seems there is no limit to the severity of punishment that is justified .
They are willing to take drastic , even violent action to compel others to obey them .
And for all this , can anyone actually quantify the effect any of these distancing policies might have ? We are soon going to have an unemployment rate higher than the peak during the great depression .
Countless businesses will be bankrupt and closed for good .
State and local governments will run out of cash as tax receipts disappear .
Civil unrest is a rapidly growing concern in Italy and we are just a couple weeks behind them .
So , for all damage we are causing , can anyone actually prove what benefit we are achieving ? Is catching the virus at the grocery store or from a contaminated product received in the mail better than catching it at work ? Does social isolation actually achieve what it is supposed to ? In order for this policy to be justified , it had better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy both lives and livelihoods .
Alejandra Gutierrez and our other so-called public " leaders " want to enact more oppressive policies , and to scare us into accepting them .
That way we end up cowering in our homes , afraid to send our kids down to the park for an hour , for fear that some insufferable , virtue-signaling , finger-wagging scold on social media starts screeching about how we should be publicly shamed by all the other insufferable , virtue-signaling , finger-wagging scolds .
ADAM - I completely agree with you , but we still need everyone to follow the guidelines if we 're going to slow this thing down .
Then again , who knows ? Is there any proof the social distancing is working ? Has anyone who is staying home and washing/cleaning still gotten sick ? Would be interesting to know .
Sacjon , what I find fascinating is that all of the finger-wagging nannies seem to know all about what everyone else is doing , and are ready to report them to the authorities .
How is that ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're supposed to be home ?  I was driving on Milpas yesterday and observed a group of Latino men greeting each other with handshakes and hugs .
It appears social distancing does n't apply to big family gatherings in the culture as well .
This is why I 'm thinking more and more we need a total lockdown with stiff penalties for anyone caught closely interacting with people from other households .
My buddy came by yesterday to pick something up from my yard - we met outside keeping 10-15ft apart .
It 's easy to interact still , but just be careful !  We need Jason Dominguez back on the City Council as MAYOR ! ! ! He would have had a plan of action to deal with these issues we are now facing .
The eastside is going to suffer now that Alejandra Gutierrez has been elected .
She has no experience and is only self serving to her supporters not the eastside as a whole .
The mayor , Meagan , Alejandra , Eric &amp; Oscar all need to go .
As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's start working on Jason to run for Mayor .
Time to make a change for the better .
I could NOT agree more with this comment ! The Eastside District will definitely falter with Alejandra as the current Councilmember .
Her lack of experience and knowledge is clearly evident and her supporters should be embarrassed having elected a maladroit to this position .
We DEFINITELY NEED Jason Dominguez back in office !  As an incumbent Jason lost to a challenger , how often does that happen ? Ask Laura Capps about that .
And then he lost the Assembly primary .
He should move to a place where being a republican is an asset .
Perhaps Santa Maria ?  Councilmember Alejandra Gutierrez : Where the hell have you been since the outbreak of this pandemic ? ? ? ? You , like Councilmember Oscar Gutierrez , have NOWHERE to be found since this pandemic outbreak ! You are NOW asking parents , school officials , police and community members to do something when , in fact , you should have asked them from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan or strategy to help the Eastside District and its residents and should be ashamed of yourself ! ! ! Your lack of EXPERIENCE , INTELLIGENCE , and COMPETENCE is CLEARLY EVIDENT during this time .
But , most importantly , shame on the STUPID RESIDENTS who elected you to this position because you are NOT fit to serve our district ! Now , quarantined at home , I bet they regret their decision ! ! ! ! I surely MISS Councilmember Jason Dominguez as he would have had a strategy in place while being VERY PROACTIVE for ALL the residents and businesses of the Eastside District .
You , on the other hand , are very predisposed to ONLY aiding and assisting the Latinos while blatantly ignoring and neglecting the rest of the residents and businesses who make up the Eastside District .
DO BETTER Councilmember Alejandra Gutierrez ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  I have a friend of mine who has been trying to reach out to City Council Member Alejandra Gutierrez , District 1 via email on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to my friend , and my friend is getting very frustrated with her .
You 're not alone in not getting a response from Jordan ! I 've written him twice since November and , he 'll be glad to hear , probably wo n't bother to do so again .
He should take some hints from former area , also a second district resident , former mayor Marty Blum who ALWAYS acknowledged even if she did n't always have time to respond personally/directly .

btw , to send directly , by-passing the spam filter that is the joint address , just add @santabarbaraca .
to the last name preceded by the first initial .
( Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the police office , has agutierrez .
Not to worry : she 's very unlikely to respond anyway unless she knows you .
)  About two weeks ago I sent a message to my 2d district city council member .
He never acknowledged even receiving it .
About two weeks before that the mayor ignored ( as far as I can tell a different email sent to her ) .
They have , by the way , hidden their direct email business addresses in an attempt to funnel all communications through a city web site address .
They are definitely not looking to be responsive to their constituency .
As per ACLU and various state and local government mandates enforcement is limited during pandemic because jail and prison populations must be thinned out to protect held persons from possible exposure to the Coronaviris .
Google ACLU , Coronavirus , Civil Liberties , and geographic area to read varied policies : some effective to 4/7 , others to 5/31/20 .
No public input in CA due to suspension of Brown Act .
