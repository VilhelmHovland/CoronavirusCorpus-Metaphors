EasyJet parks entirety of fleet after completing rescue services  UK budget carrier EasyJet has opted to ground the remainder of its aircraft fleet , after completing hundreds of repatriation flights in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak .
It has also reached an agreement to furlough cabin crew for a two-month period from 1 April , paying them through a UK government job-retention scheme .
EasyJet had already parked much of its fleet -- comprising over 300 Airbus jets -- in response to increasingly restrictive measures imposed by governments across Europe .
But it had continued operating repatriation and rescue flights and says it has conducted over 650 such services and carried 45,000 passengers .
The final flight arrived on 29 March , although it remains prepared to operate more at government request .
" At this stage there can be no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights , " says the budget carrier .
" We will continuously evaluate the situation based on regulations and demand , and will update the market when we have a view .

It says its balance sheet is " strong " , with no debt refinancing until 2022 , but is holding talks with liquidity providers .
" We are working tirelessly to ensure that EasyJet continues to be well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus , " says chief executive Johan Lundgren .
EasyJet founder and key shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has , however , recently renewed his criticism of the airline 's fleet strategy , insisting that capital expenditure payments to Airbus over the next three years pose a " threat " to the airline 's viability .
Haji-Ioannou believes the airline needs to cancel its current Airbus order contract with a view to operating a fleet of around 250 rather than 350 aircraft .
EasyJet has 129 A320neo jets on order , of which it had received 34 by the end of February , plus outstanding orders for 19 A321neos .
