Date published : Monday 30th March 2020 7:16  The Premier League are reportedly discussing the conclusion of the season this summer with squads , officials and broadcast staff living in ' isolated camps ' and playing the remaining 92 games behind closed doors .
According to The Independent , there would be a " World Cup style " end to the season with a handful of games being played every day over June and July .
The idea is said to have ' gained increasing traction ' over the last few days .
There is an appetite among clubs and players to finish the season -- not least because of the massive financial implications of leaving the season undone -- and there is expected to be political support for the scheme as it would both boost the economy and lift the spirits of the public , giving them something to watch during lockdown .
The report continues : ' In order to complete the plan , clubs and their staffs would be confined to separate hotels away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- albeit with full testing and quarantine conditions .
The aim is to reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19 as even one case could derail the whole plan .
'  There is apparently an awareness that the idea could encounter opposition because of the implications of having medical staff at the games , while the blanket testing of players and staff could only realistically happen when general population is more widespread and the curve is flattened .
