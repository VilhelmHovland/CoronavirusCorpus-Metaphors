Oil prices at 17-year lows as virus ravages world  Oil prices extended losses in Asian trade on Monday and languished at 17-year lows , with the coronavirus crisis escalating around the world and no end in sight to a vicious price war .
US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 5 .
percent to trade at $20 a barrel , while international benchmark Brent crude was off 6 .
percent at $23 .
The falls came after the death toll from the pandemic surged past 30,000 at the weekend as cases in hard-hit Europe and the United States showed no sign of letting up .
Senior US scientist Anthony Fauci estimated the virus could possibly result in 100,000 to 200,000 deaths in the United States , while President Donald Trump extended " social distancing " guidelines until April 30 .
The president also said he expected the country to " be well on our way to recovery " by June 1 -- dropping his previous target of mid-April .
The virus has infected more than 140,000 in the world 's top economy and left more than 2,400 dead .
Oil markets have been plunging for weeks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus strangle demand .
Even as demand falls , supply has increased dramatically after top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia engage in a price war following a row about whether to cut output to support prices .
At the end of last week , Riyadh said it had not been in touch with Moscow about potential output cuts while Russia 's deputy energy minister said oil at $25 a barrel was not a catastrophe for the country 's producers -- signalling the two sides are still far apart .
" Demand concerns are critical but well known , what really took the market down were the signals we got from Saudi Arabia and Russia that they intend to continue their current path , " Vivek Dhar , a commodities analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia , told Bloomberg News .
" Market hopes of a deal have come undone .
" There are fears the commodity could fall further as storage tanks around the globe approach full capacity .
" When the storage capacity is filled , we should probably expect a response from Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " AxiCorp 's Stephen Innes said , though he warned " the longer their response takes , the higher the risk of another steep decline in oil prices " .
The retreat on oil markets comes after a bounce with equities last week that came after policymakers worldwide unleashed massive stimulus measures to prop up the virus-hit global economy .
