Numbers that matter right now :  The rapidly rising death toll .
The projections of additional potential deaths in the weeks ahead .
The length of time until the expected peak .
The death rate .
The number of confirmed cases .
The number of people who have Covid-19 symptoms , but have n't been tested .
The number of 911 calls in major metro areas like New York .
The staffing levels at area hospitals .
The number of available beds .
The number of additional beds that may be needed .
The current count of ventilators .
The supplies of PPE .
The capacity levels of local morgues .
The unemployment rate .
The length of time that social distancing measures will remain in effect .
The modeled death toll if the restrictions are eased .
Numbers that do n't matter right now :  Television ratings .
That 's why it was so disgusting to see President Trump bragging about the ratings for the White House 's coronavirus task force briefings .
Talking about ratings while people are dying and others are pleading for help ? It is beneath any human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Trump 's inner circle need to intervene and help him get out of his own way .
But I 'm not holding my breath .
Trump launched into an anti-CNN tirade during a Sunday afternoon presser , claiming that the network is " not trusted anymore " and that " people are not watching CNN anymore .
"  Again let me say : TV ratings do n't matter right now .
Viewership is up , across the board , but networks are wary of publicizing the numbers for the same reasons that they did n't tout their record ratings after 9/11 .
I 'm not going to get into all the specific metrics .
But for purposes of fact-checking the president 's lie , the month of March has been CNN 's most-watched month since September 2005 , when the Gulf Coast was recovering from Hurricane Katrina .
As an anchor and correspondent , I feel the pressure .
I know that our ratings are well above average right now .
People need reliable sources that are n't minimizing OR overstating the threat .
That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president should encourage , not seek to destroy .
Ratings reality check  Brian Lowry writes : It seems ridiculous to have to point this out right now , but here goes : Trump has a long history of exaggerating or outright lying about TV ratings , dating back to his claims that " The Apprentice " was the No .
1 show on TV long after it was n't .
And his series of tweets about viewership of his news conferences , quoting a NYT story that ( certainly in terms of the headline ) could have been a bit more sophisticated itself , overlook a series of disclaimers and qualifiers too long to mention .
? Kevin Kruse tweeted : " If all you care about are your TV ratings , remember that President Nixon attracted an estimated 110 million viewers for his resignation speech .
"  Haberman 's reporting  " I think the president is doing very little other than watching media coverage right now , " the NYT 's Maggie Haberman told me on Sunday 's " Reliable Sources .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
He 's just watching television and having meetings about this issue , and I think he 's more sensitive to negative coverage than he normally is .
so what he 's doing is lashing out .
"  ? The bottom line re : his recent spate of anti-media attacks : " He does n't want people to believe real time accounts that they are seeing .
"  " Reliable Sources " highlights  -- Doctors and nurses are alerting the public through social media , sometimes by smuggling videos out of hospital wards .
Esther Choo said rules restricting press access at hospitals should be revisited so that the public has a view inside virus-stricken ERs .
" Some of this information is important for public health , " she said .
-- The New Yorker editor David Remnick said Trump 's " lies , " narcissism , and " lack of empathy " have " led to disaster .
Has led to delay .
And this will be -- and I think history will prove this -- this will be something that 's paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  Stephen King 's sharp critique of Trump 's mixed messaging  The " Reliable " team had been working on booking Stephen King for months .
and I had planned to fly to Florida to interview him in person .
Instead , we talked via his webcam on Sunday morning .
" People are saying to me ' we 're living in a Stephen King world , ' and all I can say is , boy , I wish we were n't , " King said re : the horror novel nature of this moment .
&gt;&gt; King also said Trump 's handling of the pandemic is " almost impossible to comprehend .
" Watch .
Trump lashes out at Alcindor , demands she " be nice "  Oliver Darcy writes : Amid a global pandemic killing thousands of Americans , Trump disparaged CNN , NYT , and PBS at his press conference on Sunday , while saving his praise for a fringe right-wing network that has a history of peddling conspiracy theories .
Trump lashed out at PBS correspondent Yamiche Alcindor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst came after Alcindor noted that Trump had previously told Sean Hannity he was not sure if states would actually need the total number of ventilators they have requested .
" Why do n't you act a little more positive ? " Trump asked .
He added , " Be nice .
Do n't be threatening .
Be nice .
" Alcindor pushed back , noting she was effectively repeating what he had previously told Hannity , but Trump was n't having it .
When Alcindor came to ask her second Q , Trump cut her off and the microphone was taken away from her .
Diamond gives back the mic  Darcy continues : When Trump called on him later in the press conference , CNN 's Jeremy Diamond instead handed Alcindor the mic so that she could ask her second question .
Alcindor asked which health experts Trump had spoken to that had said more people could die from an economic recession than the virus .
Trump did n't directly answer .
" These are direct quotes , sir .
"  Darcy adds : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pressed Trump on last Friday comments about not phoning governors who are not " appreciative .
" Trump accused Diamond of lying and taking him out of context , but Diamond pointed out that he was reading " direct quotes .
" As Daniel Dale put it , " Reporters read Trump quote back to him , Trump denies and attacks .
" Check out Dale 's fact-check here , titled " Trump falsely denies saying two things he said last week .
"  Trump praises OANN  Darcy sends one more note : At the presser , Trump lavished praised on a personality from the far-right cable channel One America News .
The attendee asked Trump for a response to networks that are wary of airing his lengthy press conferences in full .
" Boy that 's a nice question , " Trump said .
" Thank you very much .
" When Trump called on her for a second time , she bizarrely asked the same question again .
which is quite revealing , when you think about it .
FOR THE RECORD  -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sunday , but " politicians getting them the box of N95 masks , that would be even better .
The fact that too many professionals do n't have them -- that 's a national disgrace .
