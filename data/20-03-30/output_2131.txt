As provinces prepare for worst-case scenarios with COVID-19 , Ontario insists decisions wo n't be based on age  Across the country , healthcare systems are making preparations for a worst-case scenario with COVID-19 -- one in which a healthcare system has exceeded its capacity , and more patients are in need of ventilators and ICU beds than the network is able to provide .
Ontario is drafting what 's called an " ethical framework , " health minister Christine Elliott says .
Several other provinces , from one end of the country to the other , are doing the same thing .
The efforts come with the grim backdrop of the pandemic 's toll on places like Italy , where doctors have been forced to make such devastating calculations already , after their medical system passed its tipping point .
As reported by Reuters , Italian physicians and specialists have attempted to triage COVID-19 patients to determine their chances of survival , to see whether they should attempt intubation -- a life-or-death calculation .
That measurement , per Reuters , factored in any pre-existing conditions , as well as whether older patients have family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , was listed as a factor .
But that 's not the case in Ontario , where officials have insisted age wo n't determine care .
On a conference call on Friday , University Health Network president and CEO Kevin Smith said that any ethical model based on a patient 's age was off the table in the province -- while noting that patients over 80 with serious illnesses and multiple comorbidities had a much higher death rate than the rest of the population , facing COVID-19 .
" We hope we 're never in a situation like this , " Smith said .
" But should we find ourself in a worst case situation like Italy and some other jurisdictions have found themselves in , it 'll be important to determine first whether or not a patient should go on a ventilator or other advanced form of life support .
"  They were receiving data about survival rates , he explained , and in some kinds of cases the prognosis was grimmer than others .
" With certain kinds of conditions , or problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very , very , very low , single-digit numbers of survival .
So if we ran out of ventilators , then that would be a process that one would have to consider , " he said .
Citing information from Europe and China 's outbreaks , Smith said patients with grimmer outlooks may include those with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other serious lung diseases .
" The more comorbidities -- so , if you had serious heart disease , a lung problem , some other serious respiratory history , diabetes , a number of other immune compromised situations -- the results have been poor , " he said .
" What we do n't want to do is leave frontline clinicians in a position to have to ration care , and we wo n't do that .
This will intervene before we start what might be considered futile care .
"  The Toronto Star recently obtained a copy of an Ontario Health triage document -- though the outlet noted that it was unclear whether their document was a draft or final version of the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breaking point , level 1 triage would see doctors advised to exclude patients with a greater than 80 per cent predicted mortality .
By a level 3 , the most specialized beds , patients with greater than 30-per-cent mortality would be excluded .
" Excluded " means that patient would no longer receive intervention like ventilation , the Star noted .
Ontario 's minister of long-term care , Merrilee Fullerton , reiterated on Monday that decisions around COVID-19 care would n't be based on the age of the patient in need of medical assistance .
" This is something that we need to be absolutely clear about , for our long-term care and the care within our hospitals , is there will be no discrimination based on age , " she said .
However , that approach has drawn some criticism .
Udo Sch ? klenk , an Ontario Research Chair in Bioethics at Queen 's University , argued to iPolitics that a patient 's age should in fact be considered -- and said those writing the province 's policies for a worst-case scenario should explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , per se , matters .
But we would say is , what you should aim for when you deploy healthcare resources , you should try to generate as much health as you can with them , " he said .
Factors might include how long a patient would likely need an ICU bed , he said -- and if there was data showing older people needed it longer , that may be an important ethical consideration .
He cautioned that any calculation about which patients receive care in a worst-case scenario needed to avoid discriminating against , for example , individuals with disabilities .
He argued that could be done by assessing their quality of life outlook within the frame of their quality of life before the virus .
Ultimately , he believes that assessing comorbidity -- as outlined by Smith -- could have the same effect practically as assessing a patient 's age , arguing that the elderly were more likely to have relevant pre-existing conditions .
( There were completely different ways of determining which patients get care , he added , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system would likely be " suboptimal , " Sch ? klenk opined , but he said he would n't be surprised if some jurisdictions went down that particular path .
)  Whatever criteria was ultimately determined , Sch ? klenk took aim at the fact that it was n't yet publicly available -- and noted that even some clinical ethicists had scrambled to find the triage policies for their own institutions .
" You want to ensure that the public is aware of what these rules are , how these rules came about , and frankly that these rules are clear , that they 're justifiable , " he said .
" In a democracy , we can expert this sort of thing , because frankly , we pay for this stuff .
"  He rejected the idea that outlining a worst-case scenario could cause undue panic .
" It 's really much better to calmly inform people of what the situation is , what can be expected and what they can expect of the state , and of the healthcare system we have , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers in health policy in these hospitals that this is not in place .
"  While the Ontario government has insisted that every effort is being made to ensure all patients in need of ventilators can access life-saving intervention , Premier Doug Ford offered a stark warning on Monday afternoon .
" The reality is , if there 's a massive surge of people coming into our hospitals in the next two weeks , our supply lines will be seriously challenged , " Ford said , reiterating his previous appeals for social distancing .
According to data provided by Ontario Health president and CEO Matthew Anderson and Deputy Minister of Health Helen Angus in a conference call on Friday , Ontario 's hospitals have 2,053 adult critical care beds , 1,321 of which have equipment for ventilation .
Adding in pediatric beds , the total number of critical care beds jumps to 2,142 , with 1,384 equipped to ventilate patients -- with just over 400 available at the time .
The province had around 210 ventilators stockpiled from the eras of SARS and H1N1 , Smith told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions , and the province has ordered 800 more -- 340 through an initial order , and 460 later .
They 'd received 40 as of Friday .
" We 're hearing from each of the companies how quickly we can receive the remainder .
I think it is months , not days , " Smith said .
They 've also made requests to the federal government 's emergency stockpile and have been in touch with some associations who may have equipment that can be used .
CBC News revealed today that suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases account for roughly one in four patients in Ontario ICUs , which is more than officially disclosed so far .
" It 's easy to turn on the TV and think what 's happening in Europe ca n't happen here .
But it can happen anywhere , " Ford said Monday , later adding that the province could either go the route of Italy and Spain , or that of countries like Germany and South Korea that he sees as better controlling the pandemic .
" We 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on supplies that are in desperate need around the world , and a race against this virus , " Ford told reporters .
" The next few weeks is critical .
on which way this curve 's going to go .
