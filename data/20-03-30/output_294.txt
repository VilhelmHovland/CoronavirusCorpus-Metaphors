Not only that , during this time of quarantine and social separation , the drivers ' roles have added significance : In some cases , they 're the residents ' sole link to the outside world .
" I 'm very proud of our program and what we have done during this coronavirus crisis , " said Joanne Glassoff , a resident of Toms River , who oversees Meals on Wheels for Jewish Family &amp; Children 's Service ( JFCS ) of Greater Monmouth County .
" A lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JFCS website , the program provides food to clients in need in the Covered Bridge and Greenbriar communities in Marlboro , and throughout Monmouth County , most weeks from Monday through Friday .
The meals are catered by Exquisite Caterers of Marlboro and picked up for delivery at the Marlboro Jewish Center .
Dealing with Covid-19 has both changed everything and produced an element of pikuach nefesh , saving a life .
Concerned about Gov .
Phil Murphy 's impending " Stay at Home " order , Glassoff was given special permission by Rabbi Michael Pont of the Marlboro Jewish Center to deliver two weeks of meals to over 80 clients on March 21 , even though it was Shabbat .
" It really was a special delivery , " Glassoff told NJJN .
" We thank our caterer , the Marlboro Jewish Center , and Rabbi Pont for helping us out .
We know we are essential under the governor 's rules , but we wanted to reduce our delivery trips .
" Glassoff also mentioned the role of her program 's kitchen site coordinator , Marisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go smoothly .
They are planning to conduct a similar delivery on April 6 , with Passover meals , both fresh and frozen , for clients .
The drivers wear gloves while making deliveries and call the recipient when they arrive at the residence .
They ring the bell , watch from afar as the recipient takes the package inside , and then call to confirm the recipient is OK .
" As long as we are dealing with the virus , this is our procedure , " Glassoff said .
In addition to her drivers ' phone conversations with the residents , Glassoff also has two volunteers who check in with her clients on a weekly basis .
Clients receive a monthly charge of $4 per meal , but they pay what they are able as a donation .
Sara Ullman , who serves as the Meals on Wheels Coordinator for Jewish Family Services ( JFS ) of Middlesex County , credited her pool of nearly 100 volunteers with ensuring that the Monday-through-Friday deliveries have been uninterrupted during the crisis .
" We will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Ullman , a resident of East Brunswick .
" Our volunteers have been outstanding and most have stayed with us through all of this and are a connection to our clients .
" She added that although they will not deliver meals over Passover , they will " be back right after that .
"  The program is catered by the Orchid Kosher Restaurant in Metuchen , and the meals are delivered to both JFS offices in Milltown and Monroe .
" We serve our clients in Highland Park to Woodbridge out of Milltown and a truck also goes to our office in Monroe to serve those in that area , " according to Ullman , who has been involved with Meals on Wheels since 2003 .
Clients are asked to donate an average of $3 per meal , though on a sliding scale , Ullman said .
" People pay what they can .
We do have some who are unable to pay .
"  And like all agencies , JFS of Middlesex is doing as much as possible to protect its volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals will be delivered , " she said .
" All our drivers wear gloves , ring the bell , and watch to confirm the meals have been received .
"  The Meals on Wheels program is administered by agencies in each county .
Eighty-five people receive Meals on Wheels in Union , according to Tom Beck , executive director of JFS of Central New Jersey .
Staff members at the YM-YWHA of Union County prepare the meals , and " The Y has assured us they will continue in this role , " he said in a telephone interview with NJJN .
" We are very fortunate .
"  Beck called the drivers ' role " invaluable " since they 're sometimes the only person interacting with a client .
Drivers are the agency 's first line of defense , he said -- they check on residents ' health and well-being and report any issues to JFS .
Beck said he employs four people to deliver the meals -- one driver and one person per delivery vehicle to take the meals to a residence or apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring the doorbell or knock .
" Our drivers have been given instructions not to get close , shake hands , and stop all physical contact , " he said .
Just about all clients receive one subsidized meal five days a week , but Beck said new safeguards were recently added " in case we run into issues in the near future " like having to miss a delivery -- JFS will include an extra frozen meal .
Holocaust survivors receive three extra meals for the weekend , subsidized by the Claims Conference , an organization that aids in the receipt of compensation and restitution for survivors , and " We have a few private clients who pay $9 a meal , and some do offer donations , " said Beck .
Said Glassoff , of Monmouth 's JFCS , " In this challenging time , it 's been great to see all the people in Monmouth County get together to help those who need it .
