" That 's a big deal , " said Christopher Westley , an economist and dean of FGCU 's Lutgert College of Business .
The results of the survey are based on about 950 qualifying responses .
The survey , requested by Lee County 's economic development office , is designed to put some numbers behind the effects of the virus on the region 's economy that could help bring more government aid and other relief to local businesses .
" It 's especially devastating to small business in the region and small businesses employ most of our workforce , " Westley said .
" In a sense , the coronavirus is an anti-small business virus , at least down here , " he said .

"  Larger businesses are more likely to survive because they usually have more resources available to them in tough times like these .
" What we see a lot of times is that the larger firms can afford the impacts more than the smaller firms , " Westley said .

Nearly 44% of respondents said travel bans have interrupted their business , with almost 65% stating that customers have cancelled orders or reservations due to the virus .

"  The study should help shed light on the decisions made by businesses to combat the virus .
" We are going to end up looking back at this and trying to decide if these measures were necessary , " Westley said .
