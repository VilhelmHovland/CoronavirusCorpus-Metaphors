Grading the Raiders ' offensive acquisitions  Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota in action during a preseason NFL football game against the Philadelphia Eagles Thursday , Aug .
8 , 2019 , in Philadelphia .
( AP Photo/Matt Rourke )  While the Raiders were rumored to have interest in the NFL 's top free agent , quarterback Tom Brady , they ultimately were not in the running for the six-time Super Bowl champion who is now a Buccaneer .
Most of their moves in free agency on offense were about depth .
Marcus Mariota has a chance to push starting quarterback Derek Carr for playing time .
The Raiders do n't need a starting guard , but Eric Kush has starting experience and provides valuable depth .
Darren Waller had a breakout season at tight end in 2019 , and Jason Witten can provide leadership for him and rising second-year TE Foster Moreau .
And while he 's probably most famous for his drops , wide receiver Nelson Agholor offers some draft flexibility .
Here 's a look at their offensive acquisitions .
QB MARCUS MARIOTA  FILE - In this Jan .
19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcus Mariota warms up before the NFL AFC Championship football game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Kansas City , Mo .
The Las Vegas Raiders have agreed on a contract with free agent Mariota to provide an experienced backup behind starter Derek Carr .
A person familiar with the deal said Monday , March 16 , 2020 , the Raiders reached the deal with the former No .
2 overall pick in the 2015 draft .
( AP Photo/Charlie Riedel , File )  FORMER TEAM : Titans  AGE : 26  NFL EXPERIENCE : Five years  STRENGTHS : Mariota has always been a dual threat , which is part of why he became a Heisman Trophy winner at Oregon .
At his best , he 's using his arm and his legs to make plays .
WEAKNESSES : Mariota 's accuracy and pocket presence have fallen off , particularly in 2019 .
In six starts , Mariota completed only 59 .
percent of his passes and was sacked on 13 .
percent of dropbacks .
Ryan Tannehill was sacked on only 9 .
percent of his dropbacks behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former No .
2 overall pick , Mariota has talent .
At worst , he 's an experienced backup -- which every team needs .
At best , he could replace Carr as the starter -- mimicking what happened to him in Tennessee in 2019 .
GRADE : A  TE JASON WITTEN  FILE - In this Aug .
29 , 2019 , file photo , Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten ( 82 ) smiles as he gives a broadcast interview from the sideline in the second half of a preseason NFL football game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , in Arlington , Texas .
Witten is returning to Monday Night Football in his more accustomed role as the Dallas Cowboys ' tight end and not a television analyst for the ESPN production .
Witten did n't know if ESPN asked to have him miked for the game , but wanted no part of it .
He said he has done it before and he did n't like .
His focus this week is to help the Cowboys build for their big win over the Eagles two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TEAM : Cowboys  AGE : 37  NFL EXPERIENCE : 16 years  STRENGTHS : Witten has been a solid route runner his entire career .
He knows how to get open , and his size still makes him a matchup issue .
He can be a great target on third down .
WEAKNESSES : Witten is not fast , especially given his age .
Unlikely to win a footrace .
FIT WITH RAIDERS : With Waller and Moreau already in tow , Witten has a chance to be a coach on the field .
He can provide value through his leadership .
And with 27 of his 63 receptions last year going for first downs , Witten can still move the chains .
GRADE : B  WR NELSON AGHOLOR  FILE - In this Oct .
13 , 2019 file photo , Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Nelson Agholor runs upfield after catching a pass during the first half of the team 's NFL football game against the Minnesota Vikings in Minneapolis .
The Las Vegas Raiders have agreed to a one-year contract with free agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AP Photo/Jim Mone , File )  FORMER TEAM : Eagles  AGE : 26  NFL EXPERIENCE : Five years  STRENGTHS : Agholor has mainly been used in the slot with the Eagles over the last few years .
He is an adept route runner who can separate .
WEAKNESSES : Too many drops .
FIT WITH RAIDERS : Agholor has experience , and his one-year contract for just more than $1 million means he 's a low risk/high reward signing .
But the Raiders still need to improve at the position through the draft .
They 're likely to get a WR at No .
12 overall .
GRADE : C  G ERIC KUSH  Cleveland Browns offensive guard Eric Kush warms up before an NFL preseason football game between the Washington Redskins and the Cleveland Browns , Thursday , Aug .
8 , 2019 , in Cleveland .
( AP Photo/Ron Schwane )  FORMER TEAM : Browns  AGE : 30  NFL EXPERIENCE : Seven years  STRENGTHS : Kush has experience being a backup and has started a total of 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons .
He 's a better pass blocker than run blocker .
WEAKNESSES : According to his Pro Football Focus grades , run blocking is Kush 's weakness .
He has graded out in the high 40s in the last two seasons , which would rank among the bottom 10 of guards who played at least 50 percent of his team 's snaps .
FIT WITH RAIDERS : Kush is not expected to be a starter , with Gabe Jackson and Richie Incognito solidly in place .
But should an injury occur -- and based on history , one will -- Kush can step in as a starter .
GRADE : B+  TE NICK O'LEARY  Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Nick O'Leary during the second half of an NFL football game in Oakland , Calif .
, Sunday , Dec .
15 , 2019 .
( AP Photo/Ben Margot )  FORMER TEAM : Jaguars  AGE : 27  NFL EXPERIENCE : Five years  STRENGTHS : O'Leary is a solid pass blocker as an in-line tight end .
And he 's made receptions when targeted .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also can contribute on special teams .
WEAKNESSES : O'Leary is fairly limited .
He 's only been targeted 77 times in his five NFL seasons .
FIT WITH RAIDERS : The Raiders have a lot of options at tight end , and on paper , O'Leary is jockeying for position with Derek Carrier at the bottom of the group .
Like Luke Willson last year , O'Leary may not make the team out of training camp .
