Secondary Menu  May we have a moment of your time ?  Our public funding only covers some of the cost of producing high-quality , balanced content .

to a friend or someone like you ?  Comments  Were you one of the millions of people in North America who wondered how you were going to continue doing your job if you were n't allowed to enter your place of employment ?  To be sure , millions of others have been rendered unemployed and underemployed because of the COVID-19 crisis .
But many of us continue to do our jobs in less than ideal circumstances .
That prompted New York Times columnist Charles M .
Blow to opine : " It occurs to me .
that much of what we were doing in the offices was unnecessary , that emails could have easily substituted for many of the meetings , that employees could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room .
"  Really ?  If this is true , it would have massive implications for society .
If one of the byproducts of this crisis is that we discover we can work just as effectively from home as from the office , consider the questions this would raise .
Do we need as many office buildings in our cities ? If not , then , presumably , we do n't need to be spending billions of dollars on mass-transit systems getting people to those buildings either .
Or on cars .
Or on the highways that carry those cars .
Or on clothes .
( Be honest : How many of you have been working from home in your pyjamas or bathrobes ? )  Stay up to date !  Get Current Affairs &amp; Documentaries email updates in your inbox every morning .
If , going forward , we no longer go into the office as much , then , presumably , we 'll also have fewer face-to-face interactions and get sick less .
In which case , do we need as many doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve our hallway-health-care problems that see some hospitals operate at more than 100 per cent capacity ?  ( Donald Trump thinks not , incidentally .
At yesterday 's daily briefing from the White House Rose Garden , the president suggested that mental-health issues and suicides would spike if people could no longer go back to work .
" People are going to be dying all over the place from drug addiction , " he added .
)  You can see where this is going .
If the new normal means leaving the house a whole lot less , will we have fewer restaurants but maybe many more takeout joints ? Would we have fewer cinemas but more people subscribing to Crave or Netflix ? Would there be less crime because fewer homes would sit empty during the day , therefore obviating the need to spend as much on law enforcement ?  The questions are endless .
I put Blow 's comments on Twitter to see what would come back , and reaction was mixed .
" This is n't a good substitute for human socialization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company great , " tweeted John Wright , who 's done public-opinion polling for three decades .
He added that , if companies now downsize because they 've seen the possibilities of more people working from home , we 'll " need to find other ways to socialize .
"  An independent IT consultant who goes by Yukon Cornelius pointed out that he was having trouble getting stuff done from home : " Something that I could have previously resolved via a 2-minute face to face deskside conversation now typically takes 7 emails and 2 conference calls spread out over 2 days .
"  But musician Chuck Mills had a different take .
" What 's the cost benefit analysis of commuting , stress , environment , lost productivity , etc .
, " he tweeted .
" We need to learn from this and change .
Silver linings are possible .
"  Dennis Travale , a retiree in Norfolk County , predicted that " this experience will have life changing impacts on individuals , families , corporations , schools , governments , etc .
We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a columnist for The Londoner , confessed , " I feel I 'm on a life raft some days , with no anchor .
The anchor being my colleagues , not the building .
I miss them .
"  University of Waterloo political science professor Emmett Macfarlane echoed that sentiment when he tweeted : " Those of us in the education sector have learned quickly how ' online ' is a poor substitute for physical classroom learning .
"  I 'd make the following observation .
I 've been amazed at how ably TVO 's own technical crew has managed to keep The Agenda on the air every night , having moved a camera , microphone , and lighting equipment into my attic at home .
It was crucial for us to be able to continue to serve our viewers , even if 95 per cent of our employees no longer have access to our studio and other facilities .
I 've joked that the whole operation feels as if it 's being held together with chicken wire and duct tape .
We just were n't set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our office .
Only through our crew 's ingenuity has it been able to happen .
But the fact is , the wonderful state-of-the-art digital equipment we normally use ca n't be used now , leaving our program looking decidedly second-best .
And anyone who feels that the kind of chemistry one can create with guests sitting in close proximity to one other in a studio can be replicated over Skype from numerous different locations -- well , trust me , it just ca n't .
Before we were all sent home from TVO out of an abundance of caution , I was in the midst of putting together a discussion : the guests were going to be current and former politicians who have dealt with mental-health challenges -- we were going to have a difficult conversation about how they 've managed to govern .
A sensitively managed discussion , in my view , absolutely required that all our guests be at the table in the studio , where they could truly see one another ( not on their laptop screens ) and connect with one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our executive producer to postpone the segment until we could do it properly .
There are some discussions you just ca n't do justice to over Skype .
Thankfully , she agreed .
Let 's give the last word on this issue to economist Mike Moffatt , an assistant professor at the Ivey Business School , in London .
On whether we can do our jobs from home just as well as from our offices , Moffatt tweeted : " Anyone who agrees to this does n't have young kids at home .
