Pritzker looks on as Dr .
Ngozi Ezike , director of the Illinois Department of Public Health , speaks Monday afternoon at the Thompson Center during the daily update on the state 's response to the coronavirus pandemic .
Rezin Garcia/Sun-Times  Illinois Gov .
Pritzker on Monday said the White House sent Illinois a shipment of hundreds of thousands of the wrong type of masks -- as the state saw eight more deaths and the spread of the coronavirus into half of its counties .
It appears a d ? tente between the Democratic governor and President Donald Trump is over .
After weeks of criticizing Trump 's response to the outbreak on national television and daily in press briefings , Pritzker last week said he was thankful for a White House shipment of N95 masks , which came after Pritzker asked Trump personally for help .
Instead the state received surgical masks , Pritzker said .
" My team is sorting through the shipment of 300,000 N95 masks the White House personally told me would be sent to our state , " Pritzker said .
" And while we do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say with certainty that what they sent were not the N95 masks that were promised , but instead were surgical masks , which is not what we asked for , " Pritzker said of the shipment .
" I ca n't emphasize enough how much we need the federal government to step up and amplify the size of their PPE personal protective equipment deliveries to Illinois and frankly across the nation , " Pritzker said .
He also urged Trump to use his unique power as president to force private companies to make more protective gear for frontline medical workers .
Meanwhile , health officials on Monday said another eight people have died from the coronavirus , bringing the state 's death toll to 73 people -- as COVID-19 has spread to 52 of the state 's 102 counties .
One of the deaths was an inmate in the Stateville Correctional Center , according to Dr .
Ngozi Ezike , the head of the Illinois Dept .
of Public Health .
Trump on Sunday extended federal social distancing guidelines to April 30 , and states including Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents are under a stay-at-home executive order through April 7 .
An extension of the order -- as well as a mandated extension of school closures -- is expected this week .
Pritzker said the decision is being evaluated daily .
The state on Monday reported 461 new cases , bringing the total number of positive cases to 5,057 .
The figure is a large drop from the 1,105 reported on Sunday , the largest single-day count the state has seen -- but Pritzker 's office said that is due , in part , to some commercial laboratories not running tests on Sundays .
Asked if Illinois was behind in testing , Pritzker responded : " Every state is behind in testing , there are not enough tests .
Any governor who 's being honest with you will tell you .
This is an enormous problem .
"  New tests by Abbott Labs offer results within minutes , but they ca n't be produced fast enough to keep up with demand from all over the country , he said ,  " The problem is that Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are n't going to be able to hive off enough of those for Illinois for it to be significant , " he said .
In addition to the death of an inmate at Stateville , 12 other men who were incarcerated are now hospitalized , including several requiring ventilators , Ezike said .
There are 77 more incarcerated individuals with symptoms who are isolated at the facility .
Eleven staff are also being isolated .
Pritzker , standing alongside Mayor Lori Lightfoot , also said the first 500 beds should be in place this week at the McCormick Place convention center , which the state plans to use as a field hospital .
The goal is to have the site have a 3,000 bed capacity to help treat COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms in order to alleviate the capacity of the state 's hospitals .
Pritzker said the state is also working to open two other facilities to help with COVID-19 response : the former Advocate Sherman Hospital campus in Elgin and the Metro South Health Center in Blue Island .
Army Corps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's South Building , which is among the sections of the convention center that will be converted to hold coronavirus patients exhibiting mild symptoms .
Ashlee Rezin Garcia/Sun-Times  Lightfoot on Monday warned that the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Chicago is doubling about every three to four days .
That could mean 40,000 hospitalizations .
" As I have said , and it 's true , staying home saves lives .
As I mentioned last week , if we do n't , in the city of Chicago alone , we 're looking at upwards of 40,000 hospitalizations , not cases , hospitalizations , " Lightfoot said .
" Here in Chicago our capacity for cases is still well ahead of demand for now .
But it 's truly a race against time &amp; we have nothing to waste .
"  Pritzker on Sunday had spent some of his daily press conference outlining the state 's testing capacity .
He said the state ran 2,000 tests per day on March 24 and by Sunday had stretched that to 4,000 tests a day .
The state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days .
Both Pritzker and Ezike have said more testing would help them know where the virus is spreading .
which will ultimately limit the infection and the spread .
" This is how we will get to the end of this pandemic sooner , " Ezike said on Sunday .
Also on Sunday , Pritzker warned that despite the state seeing its highest single-day death count -- 18 -- Illinois has not yet seen its peak numbers .
" We 're going to see an increase , unfortunately , of the cases and likely deaths , " the governor said .
The 10-part series titled " The Last Dance , " which follows the team 's 1998 title run , originally was set for June , before the coronavirus pandemic put the sports world on hold .
Andrew Marchand of the New York Post broke the story .
In Illinois , the COVID-19 focus has been squarely on Chicago , but the hardships , fears and worries have spread across the state , even if the overwhelming majority of cases are in Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
