Dr Liz Gordon : Making fake news out of a real virus  I can honestly claim to be the one that spotted Boris was out of sorts the other day .
He does n't look too good to me , I ventured .
The stress must be getting to him .
And , if I had substituted ' virus ' instead of ' stress ' , I would have been bang on .
And jolly good , too -- he deserves it for all his jolly posturing and manic hand-shaking .
What do you mean that 's a little harsh ? Come on -- you think so too .
Trump needs to get it too .
He is so narcissistic that he will only take it seriously when he has experienced it .
Get the virus to acknowledge the truth of what is going on .
Around the world , some on the extreme right have treated the virus as if it is a leftist plot .
This has two elements that I can see :  The populace of the world was deliberately infected by the Chinese , in a plot for world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , pushed by Trump and others .
My alternative formulation , penned last week , " The Pangolin 's Revenge " is just as likely a scenario .
The ' deep state ' has plotted to force extreme measures on states that will lead to economic meltdown as a way to get rid of the American President and institute a more social democratic system and reduce inequalities .
If only ! But it is true that the virus has a way of cutting through extremist bullshit , exposing bad ( and good ) leadership and hopefully bringing out a more altruistic response in us all .
Oh yes , and saving the planet , temporarily .
TDB Recommends NewzEngine .
In case you have not yet been introduced to the Johns Hopkins dashboard , it provides daily updates on the spread of the virus .
If you are bored , watching this can eat up minutes and hours .
It is an excellent summary .
That 's all for the moment from my little bubble .
As my beloved swimming is not available , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I feel comfortable and secure .
I hope you all do , too .
