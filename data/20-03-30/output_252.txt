Courtesy of Rabbi Joe Wolfson  According to her last count , Atara Gorsetman is an administrator of 11 different WhatsApp groups related to the coronavirus .
It started earlier this month , with a group to help those from her Riverdale synagogue who were quarantined , but quickly grew from there .
Within a few weeks , that original WhatsApp group had spun off to include one for volunteers willing to pick up groceries or medication for the quarantined or homebound , another for volunteers to call seniors who were isolated at home , and yet another offering creative ideas for parents with young children who were home from school and day care .
" It 's just beautiful , " said Gorsetman , who works as a school nurse at the Shefa School .
" People can not jump in fast enough to help .
"  As New York City hunkers down -- by Gov .
Cuomo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders and regular people are stepping up to do good and help those in need in their communities .
Whether it 's running errands for those at the greatest risk of contracting the virus , checking in on those in need of human interaction while remaining physically isolated , or collecting food for the hungry , helpers are emerging in Jewish communities all over the city .
" It 's about agency , it 's about giving people a sense that they can do something in this moment , " said Rabbi Joe Wolfson , who serves as the OU-JLIC rabbi at New York University 's Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life .
" It really helps to have something productive to do .
"  With college students attending classes in virtual classrooms and many headed home for the rest of the semester , Rabbi Wolfson knew he needed to do something to engage his community from afar .
He started a Google Form for students to volunteer in whatever capacity they could .
The options included actions that could be taken from home , like writing letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer in person with the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty , which serves poor New Yorkers , unloading and packaging food for the needy .
Four hundred people have signed up to make calls or write letters , from all over the world .
They have volunteered from Los Angeles , New York , Teaneck , Binghamton , N .
, Oaxaca , Atlanta , Chicago , Palo Alto , Calif .
, Fairfax , Va .
, Sao Paulo and Herzliyah .
Since he started the effort last Wednesday , 45 people have volunteered directly with the Met Council after being connected through Rabbi Wolfson 's organizing .
Of course , with these in-person interactions , there is always a risk of spreading the virus further .
While Rabbi Wolfson said he had received some pushback for organizing in-person volunteering , he insisted it was necessary .
" There is n't actually any client interaction , it 's just taking things off the lorries , putting them on the shelves , putting them together with what the individual people are going to need , " said Rabbi Wolfson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who need to eat and if people are healthy , then we have to do it .
"  NYC .
, the city 's official website , offers guidance for volunteers , saying those who are ill or are over age 50 should not volunteer in person , and others should take health precautions like washing hands , monitoring their health and keeping at least six feet away from others .
Coming from the Upper West Side , Rabbi Avram Mlotek delivered several bags of canned goods to a food pantry in Westchester after asking neighbors and community members to drop off food on his family 's stoop .
He said the people at the food pantry were happy to receive the donation but were in need of far more .
Rabbi Mlotek , who runs Base Hillel Manhattan , a community for young Jews in their 20s and 30s , plans to organize more donations of money and food .
" I 'm hopeful that as Pesach comes up , we can activate the community in an even more intense way to donate their chametz to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 8 .
The rabbi and his wife , Yael Kornfeld , a social work supervisor at DOROT , an organization that works with seniors in New York City , are also pairing up Base community members with elderly people who are increasingly isolated due to the large number of coronavirus cases in New York City .
" A lot of seniors are already isolated , " said Kornfeld .
" Regular , small interactions that are going to be cut out for a while are going to have a huge impact on them , so just having human contact is so important .
"  For both the volunteers making the calls and those picking up on the other end , the phone calls are mutually beneficial .
" We 've got plenty of 20s and 30s who are living independently who are also isolated , " said Rabbi Mlotek .
Volunteers are also launching efforts on their own .
Yale junior Liam Elkind , whose family belongs to Manhattan 's Steven Wise Free Synagogue , along with some friends organized " Invisible Hands , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorkers .
It counted 5,000 volunteers just a week after its founding .
Their efforts " remind me that we 're able to come together when the world feels like it 's pulling us apart , " Elkind told Vanity Fair .
" That 's the only way we pull through this , by pulling together .
"  " We can connect with people around the world but we need to make sure that we take care of those that live across the street or next door to us , " agreed Gorsetman .
" This model of caring for others in our community is just the beginning .
"  Gorsetman says she has about 50 to 60 dependable volunteers who have been ready to help with the needs of the Riverdale community .
She makes sure to keep requests private so that people are not embarrassed to ask for help .
" Most people are n't askers in this way but our world is changing , " she said .
