Even though the drivers are charging a hefty price for ferrying these workers , they are shelling it out in a bid to reach their hometown after losing their jobs due to the lockdown .

Typically , he would have a truck that has come into the city with a supply of vegetables and will ply empty on its way back to the rural regions .
Once the driver agrees , a message is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or region about the transport .
Date , time and pickup points are worked out .
Then , at least 100-odd passengers board every truck that is willing to take the risk .
As the district and state borders are sealed according to orders from the Centre , those who are found flouting the norms are being booked by cops .

The threat of the virus is real .
There is no work for us .
And even if we had work , what good is the money if we do n't survive ? Our grocers have stopped giving us goods on credit .
We have to struggle even to procure basic supplies .
It makes more sense to be back in our village , where the air is clean and people are helpful .
