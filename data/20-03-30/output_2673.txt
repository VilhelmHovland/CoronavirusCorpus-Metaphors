Food Banks and Pantries Are Facing a ' Tsunami ' of People in Need from the Coronavirus Crisis  Some places are seeing double their normal amount of clientele .
Food banks , pantries , and hunger relief providers across the country say they 're seeing an unprecedented surge in demand for meals -- sometimes double their typical amount of clientele -- as the coronavirus pandemic pushes more people into poverty .
From Silicon Valley to Chicago and New York City , organizations serving the poor told VICE News they 're seeing a staggering amount of people in need -- some of them entirely new to hunger relief programs .
Just last week , 3 .
million people filed for unemployment insurance after losing their jobs as broad " stay-at-home " orders closed much of the country 's nonessential businesses .
At one food bank in Silicon Valley , phone calls for information about where to get food or how to sign up for government benefits grew from fewer than 200 a day to more than 1,000 in the span of two weeks .
Food pantries , on the other hand , say they 're bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the closest thing I 've ever felt in America to the desperation I have felt in the developing world .
"  " I 've been doing this work on food insecurity and food banking for more than 20 years .
I was doing this work during 2008 .
While there we saw a tremendous increase in need , it happened over time , " said Leslie Bacho the chief executive officer of Second Harvest of Silicon Valley , one of the largest food banks in the nation .
" In this case it 's like a single moment , having so many people out of work , having their hours cut back -- so many people have suddenly been launched into this tremendous need .
It 's more like facing this sudden tsunami .
"  " That 's what 's so frightening to all of us , " she added .
Food banks like Bacho 's often operate like massive warehouses that store and collect the food that later gets distributed to nonprofit organizations and sites of need , like churches , schools , shelters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , operate like little grocery stores , farmer 's markets or distribution lines .
Many of those have shut down over the virus or transitioned to drive-thrus with pre-packaged boxes of food .
The sites that remain open in the Silicon Valley region -- and Second Harvest distributes to nearly 1,000 points across two counties -- have seen 50% to 100% increases in demand , according to Bacho .
Volunteers are also pulling out of their typical shifts left and right to keep themselves safe , or because they need to care for the ill .
Last week , Second Harvest even brought in the California National Guard to help pick up the slack , according to Bacho .
Several organizations VICE News spoke to said they were dealing with a similar drop in staff .
In New York City -- the nation 's epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic -- Josiah Haken , vice president of outreach for New York City Relief , a non-profit aiding the city 's homeless , said he 's also seeing record-breaking demand for his services .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110 gallons of soup in the past three weeks , especially since other non-profits in the city are reducing their services and scaling back hours to protect staff .
Last week , Haken was passing gallons of hot soup and baked goods to poor , homeless people in the city 's tony Chelsea neighborhood when , after two hours , he had to shut down .
People were still reaching past him for the remaining crumbs of baked goods .
" I grew up in West Africa , my parents were missionaries in Cameroon .
I 've seen developing world poverty , " Haken said .
" That was the closest thing I 've ever felt in America to the desperation I have felt in the developing world .
"  Across the country in Boise , St .
Vincent de Paul Southwest Idaho 's food pantries , the region 's largest , have seen their clientele double .
Just as troublesome , about 40% of the people coming to pick up food are new to his care , according to Ralph May , the organization 's executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are currently shut down , for income .
So he 's also worried about his own organization 's impending financial difficulties , should he have to continue spending on an increasing level of services .
" Our country was n't totally prepared for this , and I 'm not sure we could afford to be totally prepared for every potential disaster or challenge , " May said .
" But the sheer , radical change in life that 's happened over the last month is shocking .
"  Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit , the nation 's safety net had been showing troublesome signs of wear .
Homelessness has been on the incline in recent years , with 550,000-plus people living on the streets or in shelters .
Last year , the Federal Reserve reported that a quarter of Americans would n't be able to stomach a sudden $400 expense without selling something or borrowing money .
More than half of all Americans lack an emergency savings account .
" This has maybe shown just how fragile our nation is , it 's only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make it , " said Josh Greene , the lead pastor at First Baptist Church Fairdale , near Louisville .
His food pantry , which normally serves about 50 families per week , has doubled the amount of households it 's serving .
" It only took two weeks , " he added .
At The Ark -- a massive social services agency , shelter , and food pantry that serves 4,000 people in Chicagoland 's Jewish community each year -- twice as many people are coming through the food pantry , and it 's operating with fewer volunteers .
Executive director Marc Swatez said local foundations and businesses have graciously stepped up to rush his organization the cash they need right now .
" People are really scared , and the people who were already vulnerable coming into this crisis are even more vulnerable during it , and they 're going to continue to be vulnerable after it , " Swatez said .
" That just keeps compounding on itself .
