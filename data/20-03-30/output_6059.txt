Gantz , whose now fractured centrist Blue and White alliance had positioned itself as the alternative to Netanyahu in three inconclusive elections over the past year , was elected parliament speaker Thursday .
The two men had held talks through the night " aimed at establishing a national emergency government to deal with the corona crisis and the additional challenges facing the State of Israel , " said a joint statement from Blue and White and Netanyahu 's Likud .
" Significant progress was made during the meeting , " it added .
" During the course of the day , an additional meeting will be held in order to come to a finalised agreement .
" Gantz was tasked with forming a government following the March 2 vote -- something he had been unable to do after two elections last year .
There was no guarantee he would succeed this time , given a lack of cohesion within the anti-Netanyahu bloc .
The divided anti-Netanyahu forces , who held a narrow majority in the Knesset , Israel 's parliament , forced the ouster this week of speaker Yuli Edelstein , a member of Netanyahu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as speaker , triggering the break-up of Blue and White , with two key partners -- the Telem and Yesh Atid parties -- accusing Gantz of surrendering " without a fight " to Netanyahu .
Gantz and Netanyahu have both previously voiced support for a unity government to help combat the coronavirus pandemic , which has so far seen over 3,800 Israelis infected , including 12 deaths .
On Friday , Gantz justified his move as being " what my nation needs " given the coronavirus pandemic .
" I wo n't be the one who categorically refuses to step in and pull my weight in a state of emergency , " he wrote on Facebook .
There were no official details of the likely makeup of a future government , but Netanyahu has in past weeks proposed 18-month premiership terms -- with him taking the first , to be followed by Gantz .
