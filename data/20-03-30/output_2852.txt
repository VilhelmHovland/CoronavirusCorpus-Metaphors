Provides Business Update  BRAMPTON , Ontario -- DATA Communications Management Corp .
( TSX : DCM ) ( " DCM " or the " Company " ) , a leading provider of marketing and business communication solutions to companies across North America , today provided updates on its business related to COVID-19 , recent amendments to its credit agreement amendments , and on the timing of its regulatory filings .
Business Update and DCM 's Role in Supporting Essential Services  " DCM plays a critical role in the supply chain to essential services providers in several facets of healthcare , financial services , government and the transportation and logistics sectors , " said Gregory Cochrane , Chief Executive Officer .
" Our manufacturing capabilities , technology solutions , and coast-to-coast network are mission critical to industry leaders in these fields and , as such , we assume a special responsibility to maintain normal operations and to remain open .
We are focused on taking appropriate measures to ensure continuity of service to our customers .
"  The spread of COVID-19 and related restrictions on travel and non-essential services have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Canada and the United States and in a reduction in demand of certain non-essential services for the Company 's products and services .
While the Company expects these effects to be temporary , the duration of the business disruptions in Canada and the United States and the related financial impact on the Company , its business and its liquidity and results of operations can not be reasonably estimated at this time .
Recent Credit Agreement Updates  In connection with the Company 's continuing remediation efforts with respect to its previously reported implementation of a new enterprise resource planning ( " ERP " ) system company-wide ( excluding Eclipse , Thistle and Perennial ) in June 2019 and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company , its business and its financial liquidity and results of operations , DCM recently negotiated amendments to the terms of its credit agreements and obtained certain waivers from its senior lenders under those agreements .
DCM continues to monitor the rapidly evolving impact of COVID-19 on its business and continues to have proactive discussions with its senior credit providers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required .
" We recently negotiated amendments to our credit agreements and covenants in order to provide DCM with up to an additional $8 .
million of borrowing base capacity within our current credit facilities , " said Mr .
Cochrane .
" While we continue to make progress in resolving the financial liquidity issues encountered in connection with the implementation of our ERP system , reserves for past due customer receivables in particular have reduced our eligible borrowing base .
The additional availability provided by these amendments provided us with additional flexibility to work through our remediation efforts while we address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business .
"  DCM maintains a revolving credit facility ( the " Bank Credit Facility " ) with a Canadian chartered bank ( the " Bank " ) pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement ( the " Bank Credit Agreement " ) between DCM and the Bank .
DCM also maintains amortizing term loan facilities pursuant to loan agreements ( collectively , the " FPD Loan Agreements " ) with Fiera Private Debt Fund III LP ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LP ( " FPD IV " ) and Fiera Private Debt Fund V LP ( " FPD V " ) .
Each of FPD III , FPD IV and FPD V is a fund managed by Fiera Private Debt Fund GP Inc .
DCM also maintains a non-revolving term loan facility with Crown Capital Partner Funding , LP , a fund managed by Crown Capital LP Partner Funding Inc .
( " Crown " ) , pursuant to a credit agreement ( the " Crown Credit Agreement " ) between DCM and Crown .
Each of the Bank Credit Agreement , the FPD Loan Agreements and the Crown Credit Agreement contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants with which the Company must comply .
Earlier this year DCM entered into amending agreements for each of the Bank Credit Agreement ( the " Bank Amendment " ) , the FPD Loan Agreements ( the " FPD Amendment " ) and the Crown Credit Agreement ( the " Crown Amendment " ) .
The Bank Amendment provides thatadvances under the Bank Credit Facility may not , at any time , exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DCM 's aggregate accounts receivables and inventory ( less certain reserve amounts ) .
This amendment permits DCM ( i ) to add , for the period from January 1 , 2020 to April 30 , 2020 , up to $6 million on an unmargined basis ( the " Unmargined Amount " ) when calculating that borrowing base , and ( ii ) for the period from January 15 , 2020 to May 14 , 2020 , to remove from the calculation of that borrowing base , up to $2 .
million of reserves ( the " Excluded Pension Reserve Amount " ) on account of DCM 's deficit in respect of its defined benefit pension plan .
The Unmargined Amount of the borrowing base will reduce at the rate of $1 million per month commencing on May 1 , 2020 until the Unmargined Amount is fully removed from the borrowing base .
DCM will be required to reinstate the Excluded Pension Reserve Amount in the calculation of its borrowing base by adding $1 million and $2 million of that amount in May and June , 2020 , respectively , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 2020 and thereafter .
In addition to the financial covenants in the Bank Credit Agreement , the Bank Amendment added a new financial covenant that requires DCM to meet a Minimum Cash Flow Requirement ( as defined in the Bank Amendment ) .
In the event that DCM 's borrowing base exceeds total borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility by less than $1 .
million , tested on a bi-weekly basis , the Minimum Cash Flow Requirement requires DCM to demonstrate , in that circumstance , that net cash flows for the Company for the preceding four weeks do not vary negatively from its forecasted cash flows by more than $3 million .
The Bank Amendment also restricts DCM from making payments and distributions to non-arm 's length parties without the Bank 's consent , subject to certain exceptions , and increases the interest rate on DCM 's borrowings under the Bank Credit Facility by 0 .
for the period from January 1 , 2020 to September 30 , 2020 .
In addition , DCM has agreed to issue to the Bank warrants to purchase , for a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company at a price to be determined in accordance with the rules of , and approved by , the Toronto Stock Exchange .
The FPD Amendment permits DCM to defer the payment of regularly scheduled principal payments owing to FPD III , FPD IV and FPD V under the applicable FPD Loan Agreement effective February 15 , 2020 .
Scheduled principal payments will resume June 15 , 2020 .
The deferred principal payments will be added to the amounts due at maturity of the respective FPD Loan Agreements .
Under the Crown Amendment , for the period from January 1 , 2020 to October 1 , 2020 , all interest on outstanding borrowings under the Crown Credit Agreement will be deferred and will be capitalized on each date on which payment of such interest would otherwise be due by adding the amount of the interest due to DCM 's then outstanding principal and interest obligations under the Crown Credit Agreement .
Holders of an aggregate of $1 million in promissory notes issued by DCM to certain insiders in July 2019 have agreed to defer repayment of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be repaid out of the net proceeds of the rights offering completed by the Company in December 2019 .
Additional information regarding the Company 's senior credit facilities and other indebtedness is set out in DCM 's annual information form for the year ended December 31 , 2018 and its annual and interim financial statements and related management 's discussion and analysis , all of which are available on SEDAR at www .

Blanket Relief for Regulatory Filing Extension Due To COVID-19  As a result of COVID-19 pandemic developments , the Canadian Securities Administrators recently granted blanket relief ( the " Blanket Relief " ) for all market participants , providing up to a 45-day extension for periodic filings normally required to be made on or before June 1 , 2020 .
In accordance with the Blanket Relief , the Company intends to delay the filing of its audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31 , 2019 ( the " 2019 Annual Financial Statements " ) , annual management 's discussion and analysis ( " MD&amp;A " ) for the corresponding period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information form ( collectively , the " Filings " ) .

DCM expects to be able to complete the Filings and those deliveries on or before May 14 , 2020 .
