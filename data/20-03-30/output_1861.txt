There are several claims related to the source of the new Coronavirus as countries like Italy , US and China are facing a nightmare after the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019 .
But recently world 's top scientists revealed that the Coronavirus have been quietly spreading among humans decades before the recent outbreak in China 's Wuhan .
An investigation was conducted by US , UK and Australia based scientists who looked into data released by other scientists from all around the world to understand the deadly Coronavirus .
Their investigation revealed that the virus might have made the jump from animal to humans long before the first detection in the city Wuhan .
It should be mentioned that the study was conducted by recently tested positive , Ian Lipkin from Columbia University in New York , worked as a ' Contagion ' movie 's chief consultant and Kristian Andersen from the Scripps Research Institute in California , Andrew Rambaut from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and Edward Holmes from the University of Sydney and Robert Garry from Tulane University in New Orleans .
The study was published in the scientific journal Nature Medicine .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuhan began noticing a surge in the number of people suffering from a mysterious pneumonia-like virus since December first week .
Even though they tried to alert the Wuhan authorities about the unknown disease , they also tried to silence these doctors .
While tests for flu and other pathogens returned negative after patients got admitted in Wuhan hospital , an unknown strain was isolated .
A team of researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology led by Shi Zhengli traced its origin to a virus found in bats from a mountain cave close to the China-Myanmar border .
But it was revealed that the bat virus could not infect humans .
Later , scientists from Guangzhou and Hong Kong found Coronaviruses with a similar spike protein in Malayan pangolins that led to believe that teams recombination of genomes had occurred between the pangolin and bat viruses .
CoronavirusPixabay  The New Coronavirus  However , the SARS-Cov-2 , called as Novel Coronavirus had a mutation in its genes known as a polybasic cleavage site that was not found in other Coronaviruses in bats and pangolins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and US claimed that the mutation could produce a unique structure in the virus ' spike protein to interact with furin , which is a widely distributed enzyme in the human body .
It could then trigger fusion of the viral envelope and human cell membrane after coming into contact with each other .
As per the scientist , SARS and MERS have direct descendants of species found in masked civets and camels , which had a 99 per cent genetic similarity .
But for Novel Coronavirus , there is no such direct evidence , as per the international team of researchers .
Anderson further said , " It is possible that a progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 jumped into humans , acquiring the genomic features described above through adaptation during undetected human-to-human transmission .
Once acquired , these adaptations would enable the pandemic to take off and produce a sufficiently large cluster of cases to trigger the surveillance system that detected it .
"  As per Zhong Nanshan , who advises China on outbreak containment policies , said there was growing scientific evidence to suggest the origin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor from Beijing who is working in a public hospital and regularly checking Covid-19 patients mentioned numerous cases of mysterious pneumonia outbreaks were reported by health officials in several countries in 2019 .
He said re-examination of these cases from last year could reveal more clues about the history of this Coronavirus pandemic .
