House of Mirrors - Justin Trudeau 's Foreign Policy  By Jim Miles .
Dated : 3/30/2020 12:06:08 AM  Book Review  Some book covers are better than others , and that of Yves Engler 's House of Mirrors is beautifully expressive of the contents of his latest work .
It shows a very friendly faced and happy smiling Justin Trudeau in an iconic pose that says it all : America first .
is Engler 's eleventh book exposing the down side of Canadian politics .
It covers two main themes , the obvious first one is that of Canada 's involvement in the U .
imperial-hegemonic demands around the world .
The second , more domestic , is that the Liberal 's and Conservatives , Canada 's two main parties , are essentially the same thing when it comes to foreign policy .
Whereas the Conservatives are much more aggressive with their terminology while the Trudeau Liberals couch their words in fancier more humanistic sounding language , the end results are the same : following the U .
**29;3151;TOOLONG complex and in certain cases being ahead of that curve .
that as its underlying theme , Engler covers many topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with " The Canadian Monroe Policy " discussing how Canada fits into U .
initiatives throughout Latin America with the overthrow , attempted overthrows , and manipulations of various organizations ( OAS ) in order to control the western hemisphere .
While paralleling U .
interests , in terms of Venezuela , Canada , under Chrystia Freeland ' tutelage , has taken a leading interest with its support of the Lima group ( all sycophantic governments to U .
corporate interests ) against Venezuela .
long essay on the Middle East , " Loving Monarchies , Hating Palestinians " discusses how Canada relates to the Arab countries , Israel , and the Palestinians .
An earlier chapter , " The Sun Never Sets on the Canadian Military " , ties in with this chapter in exploring the numerous military sales and security contacts with Middle Eastern countries .
Large orders of military materials are sent to the likes of Saudi Arabia in support of its war on Yemen .
Much information and technological information for security is exchanged between Canada and Israel ( fun fact : Canada developed apartheid long before South Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still born two state peace process while the actual position is more one of asking why the Palestinians do not acquiesce to Israeli demands .
other important topics are presented : around the world from China and North Korea through to Freeland 's favorite bogeyman , Russia , and on into Africa ( military and mining interests ) ; around the world from its domestic carbon dioxide/environmental policies ; another hit on Canada 's mining interests in particular with South America ; and the language of " Judge What I Say , Not What I Do " .
It is interesting how often Chrystia Freeland 's name rises in connection with Trudeau 's foreign policy .
She is foremost in using the platitude about " international order based on rules " and the " rule of laws " .
Whatever the foreign policy , as Foreign Affairs Minister and now as Deputy Prime Minister ( a conveniently invented position ) , she carries considerable sway concerning Russia , Ukraine , Venezuela , Syria and other global hotspots ( coronavirus notwithstanding ) .
She inverts the colonial role , making Canada a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been an imperialist power .
we 've been the colony .
" In his conclusion , Engler reprises comments about Canadian banks , the mining industry , Russia , Israel , Iran , the military , and business in general .
He summarizes , " corporate Canada is highly international " with " segments .
tied to extreme capitalism .
" Extreme capitalism being capitalism dominated by and supported by the military-industrial complex with assistance from the financial community and the mainstream media .
with all of Yves Engler 's books , House of Mirrors is tightly written , with little philosophizing , allowing the information to speak for itself , information that is highly notated and well referenced .
The smiling man on the cover , Justin Trudeau , is essentially another true believer in an oligarchic world order ( along with Ms Freeland ) supported by an international array of corporate and military liaisons .

Miles ' work is also presented globally through other alternative websites and news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The novel coronavirus has now reached Saipan , with Esther Mu ? a , the Commonwealth Health Care Corp .
chief executive officer , announcing in an emergency press briefing last Saturday evening that the two specimen that were sent to the Guam Public Health Laboratory last March 27 were confirmed positive for COVID-19 on March 28 .
" The two confirmed positive cases involve a 42-year-old male and a 49-year-old female , " said Dr .
John Tudela , Medical Affairs director of the Commonwealth Health Center .
Both cases are isolated in quarantine at Kanoa Resort in Susupe after they presented symptoms and got tested at CHC last March 26 , Tudela said .
CHC has already started contact tracing for the two patients ' most immediate contacts , which include family members , friends , and members of a faith-based organization , where the two had gone .
One individual recently returned from Guam on March 12 and the other individual traveled to Tinian on March 13 and returned to Saipan on March 14 .
The two individuals stated that they showed symptoms around March 17 and sought care at CHC on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria of a " person under investigation " as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Protection .
Their specimens were collected on March 27 and submitted to Guam on the same day .
" Now that we have two confirmed positive COVID-19 cases , we are strongly advising all residents to be responsible in practicing good hand hygiene , social distancing , and protect our most vulnerable population , including our man'amkos and patients with chronic medical conditions , " said Warren Villagomez , COVID-19 Task Force director .
" Since January , we have done everything to be proactive as a government and implement strict social distancing procedures to keep you , your families , and our man'amko , and our loved ones with pre-existing illnesses safe , " said Gov .
Ralph DLG Torres , who also spoke at the press briefing , which was broadcasted live via the Office of the Governor 's social media page .
Andy ( not his real name ) , 60 , San Antonio , is not surprised .
He already expected positive cases to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , Saipan would definitely have one soon but I did n't expect it to be so fast .
I just hope people would take this seriously now , try and stay home and stay clean " , he said .
A Koblerville resident had the same thought , saying people should stop those parties at the beach and stay at home as much as possible to prevent the spread of the virus .
Precautionary measures  In a later interview , Tudela said that they have implemented precautionary measures for employees , volunteers , hospital staff , and those in quarantine at Kanoa Resort , which has been designated as a quarantine site .
The Mariana Resort &amp; Spa was also being used as a temporary quarantine site but the Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services brought those in quarantine there to Kanoa Resort yesterday .
Tudela stated that they have protocols to ensure the safety of everyone who are in quarantine , as well as the first responders .
" We are using PPE personal protective equipment , and also have designated areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without symptoms , " said Tudela .
Tudela assures that the two individuals are being monitored closely and checked daily , making sure they are stable and do n't need any additional health intervention .
There is no reason that the two individuals should be hospitalized , he added .
" I think all of us who are working at Kanoa are really taking a risk .
We are the frontline , and that 's why we would like for everyone to do their part , " said Tudela .
In addition , Tudela said that two positive patients that are in isolation do not have any contact with the rest of the people who are currently in quarantine .
" Those that are without symptoms , we have them grouped so that they can do daily stuff , but never in a large group , " said Tudela .
Individuals who are in Kanoa are also practicing social distancing -- keeping a distance of 6 feet from other people .
According to Tudela , " we have to prepare for the worst .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying 6 feet apart in public areas , and avoiding contact with our man'amko and our loved ones who have chronic illnesses , " said Torres .
CHCC ventilators  Right now , the Commonwealth Health Center has a total of 86 beds but only 76 beds are available and there are only 17 ventilators .
Tudela stated that they will be ordering more ventilation machines .
He stated that Kanoa Resort will remain a quarantine facility to help prevent any more spread or " repress any widespread transmission .
"  Since March 12 , a total of 388 test were performed up until last March 28 .
Guam now has a total of 56 positive COVID-19 cases and 334 negative , and one death .
According to a statement from Joint Information Center in Guam , seven patients have recovered .
A total of 48 individuals that were confirmed positive for the virus are currently in isolation .
