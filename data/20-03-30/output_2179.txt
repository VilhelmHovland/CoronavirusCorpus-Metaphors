Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , walks from the podium as President Donald Trump returns to speak during a coronavirus task force briefing in the Rose Garden of the White House , Sunday , March 29 , 2020 , in Washington .
Patrick Semansky/The Associated Press  When the U .
sneezes , the old adage goes , Canada catches a cold .
But what happens when the U .
coughs ? When it coughs that dry hacking coronavirus cough ?  We 're about to find out .
Story continues below advertisement  The United States is now the epicentre of the global pandemic with more than 135,000 cases and 2,500 deaths , and counting .
Even Anthony Fauci , the level-headed director of the U .
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , warns that 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
In Canada , we have every reason to be alarmed .
We could very well be on a similar trajectory .
Our two countries share the world 's longest non-militarized border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two-thirds of all Canadians live within 100 kilometres of the border .
We ca n't help but wonder if the mayhem that is being experienced by hospitals in New York State and nursing homes in Washington State -- both of which are snuggled up against the Canadian border -- will soon spill over .
In Canada , the common shorthand we use is taking U .
statistics and dividing them by 10 .
Yet we do n't have one-tenth of the U .
cases , 13,500 , or deaths , 250 .
We have a little fewer than half those numbers , about 6,500 and 60 .

in response to the coronavirus ? Or does it mean we 're doing half as much testing and wallowing in ignorance ?  We 're probably doing a little bit better than the United States on social distancing because we got an earlier start .
We also started testing earlier , but the U .
has ramped up quickly and is testing far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus on Jan .
The U .
saw its first case Jan .
January seems like a decade ago now but it 's fair to say neither country acted with much urgency because the outbreak was still seen as one that was confined to China .
Still , the United States appointed a coronavirus task force .
It was headed by Vice-President Mike Pence .
Canada took a lower-key approach : Public health officials were in charge and politicians largely took a back seat .
Canada 's response , at least on the health side , has been neither politicized nor partisan .
Story continues below advertisement  In Canada , politicians have taken advice from public health officials and acted on it without much pushback .
( On the economic side of the equation , it 's quite different .
That is the bailiwick of politicians .
)  In the U .
, President Donald Trump has , as always , insisted on taking centre stage .
He routinely pushes aside and contradicts public health officials by saying , for example , that lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's policy flip-flops are dizzying .
In contrast to Mr .
Trump 's bombast , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been almost self-effacing .
Seemingly worried at treading on provincial toes , he has emerged from self-isolation each morning largely to lob bromidic marshmallows about the importance of staying at home .
The other common problem our two countries have experienced is mixed messaging coming from provinces and states .
In the U .
, about 160 million people have " shelter in place " orders but in some states it 's business as usual .
In Canada , it took 10 days for all the provinces and territories to declare states of emergency , and they all mean something slightly different .
What we do n't know is how well social distancing and self-isolation orders are being respected , and what difference they will make .
Story continues below advertisement  The American coronavirus testing debacle has been well-documented .
The U .
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a test but it did n't work , and that cost public health officials almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started testing much earlier but ramped up very slowly .
The result is that , in both countries , it 's estimated that the real number of cases is five to 10 times the official number .
Ultimately , only time will tell how the two countries compare .
For Canada , the most frightening aspect of the U .
outbreak is seeing how it has overwhelmed New York hospitals .
hospitals have excess capacity ; Canada 's tend to routinely operate overcapacity .
In Canada , we have a lot less wiggle room , and the ability of hospitals to withstand an influx of cases will be tested in the coming days .

Then we may have to deal with impact of the coughing monster next door .
