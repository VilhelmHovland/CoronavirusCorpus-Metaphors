Protecting women is missing from pandemic management measures in India  The Covid-19 virus is deadly .
This is a pandemic and unprecedented measures need to be put in place in order to save human lives .
Yet , as we make extraordinary adjustments for the sake of this objective , there is increasing recognition of the ways in which the health-related warlike emergency measures are disproportionately affecting specific sections of our society adversely .
Governments have responded to these in various ways , some more proactive and considerate than others , but their overarching message has been : this is the price we have to pay to halt the spread of the virus .
While some adverse effects may not have easy solutions , it is still imperative that we identify them .
If saving human lives is the overarching objective , it is worth asking ourselves this question : could the lockdown , which is essential , be organised better to minimise or eliminate the loss of lives from the negative consequences of the pandemic management measures ? Also , while some adverse effects may not have easy solutions , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories about the immense hardships faced by migrant workers , daily wagers , health workers , and people with disabilities .
There are accounts of how the new norm of " social distancing " is not being seen for what it is , viz .
, physical distancing , but is seen as a license for glorifying the demeaning and despicable , not to mention illegal , practice of untouchability towards castes that were stigmatised for doing the most menial jobs nobody else wanted to do .
Commentators have made excellentsuggestions about how some of these hardships could be alleviated .
The central government finally announced a set of measures ; whether these are adequate to the enormity of the challenge is a moot point .
Coupled with these are racist attacks on people from north-east India because of their similarity with Chinese phenotype .
India is not unique in this regard ; other countries are experiencing similar negative whiplash on specific sections of their populations .
As the spread of the virus gives a fillip to all kinds of discrimination , we need a reality check .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But should that translate into stigmatising groups , imposing the burden of adjustment on the most vulnerable ? No .
In an eminently watchable video on essential hygiene to halt the spread of the coronavirus , an Italian grandma reminds us that the virus has no nationality .
One day there will be a vaccine for it , and it will die .
The discrimination will endure .
There is no vaccine for it .
Gendered impacts  The one section of the population that is painfully , but sadly not surprisingly , absent from this discussion of negative consequences ( whether unintended or foreseen but inevitable ) of the anti-pandemic measures has been women .
Painfully because the negative consequences of pandemic control measures on women are wide and deep .
Unsurprisingly because this is yet another instance of a gender-blind policy that ignores its disproportionate impact on women .
The intimate partner violence curve  While gender has been absent from the official lens everywhere , the last week has seen a few ( although far fewer than warranted ) pieces about the impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obvious impact of the lockdown imposed to flatten the curve has been a rise in domestic and intimate partner violence ( IPV ) as has been noted for the US , the UK , and China , among other countries .
A rise in domestic violence ( DV ) literally increases the risk to women 's lives : as one curve gets flattened , the other one slopes upwards , perhaps not exponentially , but sharply , nevertheless .
The accounts are painful to read .
Women are being battered by frustrated partners and being threatened to be kicked out of the house if they fell sick .
A child called a US helpline to report that her mother 's partner had abused her mother and her .
With schools and workplaces shut , women and girls in abusive situations have no respite .
What , if anything , can be done ?  One of the big myths about DV and IPV is that it is greater among poorer sections .
The reality is that rich and middle-class women are not immune to it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " essential service .
"  In India , because this is seen as essentially a problem of the poor , it 's not very high on policy priorities , given the class bias in policymaking .
Helplines , shelters and legal assistance for battered women are woefully inadequate at the best of times .
It is incredibly hard for women to speak up openly even under the most supportive conditions .
With the sudden lockdown , when women find themselves isolated , alone and vulnerable , what are their options ? Virtually none .
The first step is for administration and law enforcement agencies to recognise the gravity of the problem , to believe women and to sympathise with them .
At this time , more than at any other time , women need solid assurance that they will be heard , and that help would be sent if they fear for their or their children 's lives .
Reaching women in distress needs to be classified as an " essential service .
"  The police will have to be told in the strictest terms that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caste or religion .
Given the recent instances of violence by the police , this might seem like a big ask , but the powers-that-be need to insist on the right policy response .
Household and care work burden  A lockdown increases the burden of household work for all families .
Children are off from school .
They have to be home-schooled , fed and entertained .
The elderly are at risk and have to be attended to with greater care than usual .
In India , the daily lives of middle-class families run on the backs of a slew of service providers : maids , drivers , gardeners , dhobi , garbage collectors , small vendors who bring essential goods right to their doorsteps , and neighbourhood provision stores that have an incredibly efficient home delivery service .
This whole apparatus is now disrupted , as homes with part-time help are confronted with increased housework because the service providers are in lockdown too .
While both men and women are stranded at home , which of the two is dealing with this avalanche of domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
In practice , it 's the women , regardless of whether they hold a job ( i .
earn a wage ) or not .
If they do , then the double burden of domestic chores and their day jobs is now multiplied many times over , because their day job now has a new name : WFH ( work from home ) .
For those of us who might be fortunate enough to be in families that share the burden , it is difficult to imagine the catastrophic effect of this sudden and seemingly indefinite rise in work pressure on the mental and physical health of women .
This is not imaginary fear-mongering .
South Asia , particularly India and Pakistan , has one of the highest ratios , globally , of the times spent on unpaid care work by women relative to men , as the chart shows .
The exclusive responsibility of household work or domestic chores on women is one of the key constraints on women 's ability to work outside the home , as my work with Naila Kabeer shows .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-blown economic recession , as the Indian economy was already tottering when the virus hit .
This will mean job losses , with women disproportionately vulnerable to being laid off , making the already declining female labour force participation rate even lower .
For those with secure jobs and a regular salary , a temporary lockdown could be a great way to slow down , rejuvenate and pay attention to their creative side .
However , creativity requires not being burdened by the monotony of never-ending domestic chores .
The Atlanticreminds us that William Shakespeare and Isaac Newton did some of their best work while England was ravaged by the plague , because none of them had childcare responsibilities .
Stop the spread , share the burden  The question is not " to lockdown or not to lockdown .
" The question is : how should we lockdown ?  The question is not " to lockdown or not to lockdown .
" The question is : how should we lockdown ? What are the checks and balances that need to be in place ? Where should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can take this one step further .
If as a result of the lockdown , gender roles within the household revert to the 1950s , flattening the pandemic curve would have flattened all the gains made by women towards equality across the globe .
We need to be mindful of how we kill the pandemic , without making women 's equality and mental health collateral damage .
As a first step towards that , we need to recognise and highlight the disproportionate gender impacts of the lockdown .
While the state machinery can step in relation to IPV , the intra-household sharing of domestic chores is within the private domain .
However , women that are valued for their economic contributions outside the home are also more likely to be respected inside the home .
Once the lockdown ends , employers need to be especially mindful of not laying off their women employees disproportionately .
Overall , policies aimed at ensuring gender equality in labour force participation and in wages will go a long way towards paving the way for gender equality inside homes .
