We 're driving just after dusk along a wooded country road , rain pitter-pattering on the windscreen , the white beams of the headlights cutting through the shrouding mist to reveal pine trees and furrows of sticky mud lining the roadside .
We come to a gentle stop at a small guardhouse beneath a commanding silver sign , the CCTV cameras above watching us .
The security guy punches his keyboard , waves us through .
That 's when I see her .
Ren ? e .
Zellweger , that is .
Her beautiful filled and filtered face is plastered over a towering billboard on the side of a massive white , windowless sound stage at Pinewood studios , west of London , where parts of Judy -- the Judy Garland biopic -- were filmed .
But I 'm not here for Ren ? e .
Or Judy .
I 'm here for Bond .
James Bond .
Nearly all the Bond films were shot here at Pinewood , beginning with Dr .
No in 1962 .
We pass one sprawling sound stage after another -- there are 18 on the lot -- including a stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , testament to the voracious appetite for film and TV content in this age of streaming and nesting .
Located within the green belt , a swath of rural land that rings London , Pinewood opened in 1936 on the grounds of a Victorian manor house , Heatherden Hall .
Thousands of films have been shot here , from classics like Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) to recent blockbusters like Star Wars : The Rise of Skywalker ( 2019 ) .
It hosts the 007 sound stage , one of the largest film stages in the world .
This is the first act in a press junket extravaganza for the latest and 25th James Bond film , No Time to Die .
It 's late October 2019 , over two months before China will alert the World Health Organisation to several cases of an unusual pneumonia in the city of Wuhan .
At this point , No Time to Die is pitched for an international release in the first week of April 2020 .
Box-office takings across Asia will be a crucial determinant of its success -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money are at stake .
This is the most expensive Bond movie ever made , with a reported budget of $US250 million ( $380 million ) , a crew of 650 , and enough sponsored product placement ( Omega , Aston Martin , Heineken , Jaguar Land Rover , Bollinger ) to make a marketing executive 's eyes water .
Film junkets on this scale are a devil 's bargain for journalists -- leaving us feeling guilty of churlish ingratitude if we do n't deliver a positive , gushy story after we 've been flown to film sets across the world and put up at fancy hotels , and shamefaced for selling our souls if we do .
Scout 's honour , I 've been a 007 fan since I was a kid , so I 'm torn between the " Wowww , I ca n't believe I 'm on a James Bond set ! ! ! " response , and the captive anxiety of " Oh no , they 've changed my interview schedule again , " " Will they give me enough time with Daniel Craig/Rami Malek/Lashana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make this story not sound like a free ad for the film ? "  Advertisement  Daniel Craig on James Bond 's attitude towards women : " He 's a hero , but he 's also deeply flawed .
It is up to audiences to decide on Bond .
Not for me .
" Credit:Nicola Dove  Either way , my circadian rhythms have been doing a river dance since I arrived in the UK the day before , after 27 hours in a tin can in the sky .
Just after dusk , about a dozen of us , all long-lead print and online reporters from Europe , Japan , the US and UK , pile into two minivans for the 10-minute drive from our hotel to Pinewood .
But not before we 're asked to sign two embargoes and cautioned " interviews should be straightforward and film-focused and not involve any games or gimmicks " .
It 's not as if we could go crazy with plot spoilers : even the actors do n't know how No Time to Die ends , as three alternatives were reportedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of hard-nosed investigative reporting , I spent a night in a semi-coma googling fun facts such as 007 author Ian Fleming choosing the name " Bond " because he considered it short and manly , and his fictional super spy attending Fettes College in Edinburgh , where Sean Connery was the school 's milkman in the mid-1940s .
Ursula Andress 's famous scene in 1962 's Dr .
Upon arriving at Pinewood , we 're ushered into Workshop 10 , where a German journalist ahead of me is gazing wide-eyed -- gasp ! -- at Ursula Andress 's white cotton bikini from Dr .
No ( often dubbed " the most famous bikini of all time " ) , which is suspended in a tall glass cabinet in a corner .
( I later learn , to my disappointment , that it 's a replica .
) That iconic cinema moment when Andress 's character , Honey Ryder , emerges from the glistening Caribbean waters all coppery and dripping was reprised by Daniel Craig in his nutcracking baby-blue togs and tanned , jacked physique more than four decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2006 ) mirrored Ursula Andress 's scene -- but for a different audience .
:  My attention switches to four framed Bond movie posters -- all Craig vehicles -- lined up across the walls in order of release : Casino Royale ( 2006 ) , Quantum of Solace ( 2008 ) , Skyfall ( 2012 ) and Spectre ( 2015 ) , most featuring the gun-barrel silhouette of 007 , brimming with adrenalin and testosterone , with a glam , sexy woman draped at his side .
Advertisement  It 's hard to pinpoint the exact moment when excessive , smug masculinity became unfashionable .
Even Craig himself has labelled Bond a misogynist , and hates the term " Bond girls " , something I 'm keen to ask him about .
The problem for the ageing Bond franchise has not been finding crazier stunts , cooler gadgets and more luscious locations .
The problem has been Bond himself .
007 is the most famous ladies ' man in modern cinema , a love ' em and leave ' em serial shagger whose pick-up and post-coital lines in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 21st-century ears .
Take the opening scene from You Only Live Twice ( 1967 ) , when Sean Connery 's Bond is under the sheets with Ling , a pretty Chinese woman :  Bond : Why do Chinese girls taste different from all other girls ? Ling : You think we better , huh ? Bond : No , just different .
Like Peking duck is different from Russian caviar .
But I love them both .
: Darling , I give you very best duck .
Ah , what a cultural shift has occurred since Roald Dahl , the acclaimed children 's writer who wrote the screenplay for You Only Live Twice , penned those gems .
Or has it ? Thirty years later , in Tomorrow Never Dies ( 1997 ) , audiences were treated to the following :  Bond : I always enjoyed learning a new tongue .
Moneypenny : You always were a cunning linguist , James .
Over the past 20 years , the Bond women have been empowered , especially so since Craig became the man from MI6 .
But can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Die has been made at a particularly " woke " moment .
The last film , Spectre , was released in November 2015 , two years to the month before #MeToo went viral .
No Time to Die risks hitting a new raw spot when everyone is chattering about gender and power dynamics .
How do you update 007 's man-whore ways without stripping him of his macho mojo ?  That question has long been uppermost in the mind of Bond producer Barbara Broccoli , who has just sailed into this office/press room with her producer half-brother Michael Wilson .
Broccoli , 59 , and Wilson , 78 , are lauded as Bond royalty .
Advertisement  " Two more nights of shooting , " sighs the balding , bearded Wilson in his deep , southern Californian drawl , sitting behind a tabletop of flickering digital recorders and smartphones .
The wrap in two days ' time will be " bittersweet " , she reflects , because " Daniel is saying it 's his last " .
" But is it really ? " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around for this one , but I do n't think we 'll get him to come back , " Broccoli says resignedly .
" This is it , " adds Wilson quietly .
Craig , who famously griped while promoting Spectre that he 'd rather slash his wrists than play Bond again , was reportedly " talked around " when Broccoli and Wilson waved a $US25 million cheque in front of him , plus a percentage of profits .
When one reporter asks if this film has been their biggest headache to date , the duo burst into raucous laughter .
( Shooting was plagued by a string of hold-ups , from a change of director over creative differences , to Craig requiring minor ankle surgery after an on-set accident , to the damaged exterior of the 007 sound stage after a " controlled explosion " went awry .
)  Advertisement  " They 're all headaches , " says Wilson , tossing his head back , not knowing that the mother of all headaches is still ahead of him .
Broccoli is the daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in 1961 teamed up with theatre and film producer Harry Saltzman to raise money to bring Ian Fleming 's character to the big screen .
( Saltzman had already put in a bid to the bestselling author for the screen rights .
) The two men formed Eon Productions ( an acronym for " everything or nothing " ) to produce the first Bond film , Dr .
No on a budget of $US1 million , which reaped $US59 .
million and paved the way for the high-grossing blockbusters that followed .
When Skyfall hit cinema screens worldwide on the franchise 's 50th anniversary in 2012 , it hauled in $US1 .
billion at the box office , an all-time Bond record .
( Its successor , Spectre , raked in a highly respectable $US881 million , but was less warmly received by critics and audiences , which puts greater pressure on No Time to Die to succeed .
)  From the outset , this has been a family franchise .
Albert Broccoli was married to actor Dana Wilson , who already had a teenage son , Michael , from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets , although over different decades , both moving up the production ranks until Cubby Broccoli passed the keys of the Bond kingdom , and its parent company Eon , to his two offspring in 1995 , a year before his death .
Since then , Barbara and Michael have held an iron grip on the franchise -- overseeing every casting decision , signing off on every line of dialogue , presiding over every phase of marketing .
( Michael 's two sons also work for Eon .
)  The title of the movie , announced last August after more than two years of being called Bond 25 , has drawn a mixed response from fans , given the word " die " has popped up so often -- Live and Let Die ( 1973 ) , Tomorrow Never Dies ( 1997 ) , Die Another Day ( 2002 ) .
" The title is always difficult , " observes Broccoli .
" I came in one day and thought , ' That 's it .
' Then I realised No Time to Die was actually the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made it more special to me .
My dad 's legacy is prominent , all through these films .
"  Against considerable hand-wringing among her professional peers who believed a blond , rough-edged 007 would be met with a cool response from audiences , Broccoli was determined to cast Daniel Craig after seeing him in the 2004 British indie crime film Layer Cake .
It proved an inspired choice : Craig 's performance in 2006 's Casino Royale , the origin story of 007 , succeeded in rebooting the franchise , which was at a creative stalemate following four financially successful but low-calorie Bond outings by Pierce Brosnan .
Supported by a more nuanced script , Craig elevated the super spy from a cheesy caricature into something gritty and vulnerable , a man with demons and a capacity for true love .
Even Bond 's trademark quips got an update : in a casino scene when 007 is asked by a barman whether he 'd like his vodka martini shaken or stirred , he replies , " Do I look like I give a damn ? "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Broccoli gushes that Craig 's upcoming turn as 007 is his best ( " this film has an epic emotional quality ; it 's going to blow them away " ) .
Rumours are rife that Bond himself will be blown away -- that in one alternative ending , Bond is killed , which would throw open the door for a radical reboot of the franchise for the post-Craig films .
Slumdog Millionaire 's Danny Boyle , the first director , was replaced after a script dispute by Cary Fukunaga of True Detective fame .
But the very title of the film , No Time to Die , suggests Bond 's survival .
Advertisement  Whatever his fate , Broccoli and Wilson enlisted Emmy award-winning actor and scriptwriter Phoebe Waller-Bridge , of Killing Eve and Fleabag fame , to sharpen up the dialogue in a script already penned by Bond veterans Neal Purvis and Robert Wade and polished by director Fukunaga .
" Phoebe has great humour and wit , is in touch with the zeitgeist and Daniel is a fan of hers , so it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's clear the duo is first and foremost aiming to create a huge popcorn hit .
Whatever happens in the world in the meantime is outside their control .
" Nobody wants to make the last Bond film , " says Wilson reflectively , adding that they 've followed most of the tried-and-tested formulas , including a liberal dose of exotic locations .
" We started filming in Norway , then Jamaica , then up to Scotland , then locations in London , then Matera in Italy for three weeks , then back here .
It adds up to the usual travel adventure .
"  Daniel Craig was offered $US25 million plus a percentage of profits to play Bond for the fifth time .
Dove  Bullets are firing everywhere inside a hotel on a rain-washed , dimly lit Havana street .
I have no idea what 's going on because I 'm stuck behind a wire barrier with two other journalists and a publicist , checking out a man who looks eerily like Daniel Craig walk towards us with a pastry and a wide smile .
Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stand-in .
This is the dream machine in action -- in the middle of Pinewood studios .
Mark Tildesley , a blue-eyed , bespectacled 56-year-old who is the film 's head production designer , has already explained how he and his team took a reconnaissance mission to Cuba to suss out how they might film there , but were stymied by pesky politics ( " they kept asking how we were going to portray the country " ) and logistics ( " we faced the prospect of shutting down streets and knocking down walls " ) .
And so , after sketching and taking photos of Havana 's finest neoclassical architecture , Tildesley built this whole street at Pinewood in just nine weeks , including the facades of bars , nightclubs and a barber shop .
" We 've created a set more Havana than anything in Cuba , " the cheery , rugby-mad Brit explains , standing beside a diagram of the set .
We 've already been taken on a tour of the production workshops , including those of the prop makers who handcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber Beretta 418 when you get to see a silver birch Aston Martin DB5 replica , the classic Bond car that first appeared in Goldfinger , firing a blaze of fake bullets from pop-out machine guns behind the headlights ? ( I shamelessly accept an offer from a publicist to take a photo of me beside one of the DB5s used in the film , which I intend to shamelessly post on Instagram .
)  In a large tent about 50 metres from the set , we watch Daniel Craig on a monitor , taking his mark on the set of a Havana hotel , looking upwards and firing his gun with both hands .
Few men , let alone those over 50 , look better in a four-figure Tom Ford suit ; few actors do inscrutable swagger better .
Between takes , 007 walks into our tent .
But the 007 in question is Lashana Lynch , whose character , Nomi , is given Bond 's secret agent number after he leaves MI6 ( the film 's opening premise has the super spy coming out of retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend track down a missing scientist ) .
Lynch , a tallish , vibrant and down-to-earth 32-year-old of Jamaican/British origin , says she is excited to be a major character in the franchise : " My character is a black woman in 2019 overcoming so much .
"  Which raises the question , will Lynch be the next James Bond , or is hers a one-off role for this film alone ? As Barbara Broccoli has repeatedly said that Bond " can be of any colour , but he is male " , it 's unlikely to be the former .
In 2018 , Broccoli told The Guardian : " We do n't have to turn male characters into women .
Let 's just create more female characters and make the story fit those female characters .
"  In any case , the films have come a long way since the days when the Bond girls had names like Pussy Galore ( Goldfinger , 1964 ) , Chew Mee ( Man with the Golden Gun , 1974 ) and Holly Goodhead ( Moonraker , 1979 ) .
Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be underwritten stereotypes , with the exception of Judi Dench as M .
As most of the journalists I 'm accompanying are seasoned entertainment reporters who 've interviewed many of the Bond stars before , notably Daniel Craig , I ask one what 's he really like .
The reporter leans inconspiratorially , outside the earshot of a nearby publicist .
" Grumpy .
He can be quite short with you .
"  " Grumpy ? " I say , a little too loudly .
" What 's he got to be a grumpy about ? "  Daniel Craig on location in the southern Italian city of Matera .

It 's early December 2019 , only weeks before the announcement of the novel coronovirus outbreak , and the worldwide promotion of No Time to Die is in full throttle .
I 'm in New York for the major one-on-one and group interviews with the cast .
As the full twinkling panorama of Manhattan slides into view on this freezing snowy night , my cab driver declares , " I must come this way six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing that skyline .
" Ah , the heady thrill of Noo Yawk , a storybook city that 's officially the most popular set location in the film and TV world , but a city that amazingly -- or perhaps not -- has seen only one James Bond film , Live and Let Die , set here , back in 1973 .
( That also happens to be the first Bond film Daniel Craig saw as a little boy .
)  I ask the driver , who must be in his early 50s , whether he 's a Bond fan , but he mishears me .
" Bong fan ? ?  " No , no , James Bond , you know , 007 .
One of the old films , Live and Let Die , was partly filmed here .

About a dozen of us have already been given a sneak preview of the trailer for No Time to Die ; now we 're set to meet Daniel Craig and Barbara Broccoli in a " round table " interview .
When the pair walk into the room , I 'm struck by Craig 's assured , commanding presence .
Dressed in dark blue trousers and a jacket over an open-necked shirt , he 's craggier in the face and slighter than I imagined , but by no means short , at 178 centimetres tall , or 5 foot 10 .
A reporter kicks off by asking the 52-year-old how he 's feeling now he 's wrapped up his last Bond film .
Craig circles the question briefly , saying he feels " sad " it 's over but is " immensely proud " of the five films , which brought " all the Bond tropes back in , but in an original way " .
He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , I did n't want to do any of them , but I 'm so glad I did now .
"  What 's been the hardest thing about playing Bond ? " Doing this , " he says dryly , looking down the table at us .
" I did n't want to do this movie , I did n't want to do any of them , but I 'm so glad I did now .
"  Daniel Craig  I seize the awkward pause and ask how he thinks Bond evolved during his 007 tenure , particularly in light of the social earthquake of the #MeToo movement .
" Are you talking to me ? " he jokes , turning to face me with more than a little ice .
" Of course , you , " I smile sweetly .
" This is a long conversation I 've had with Barbara , " he replies .
" How do you deal with Bond 's misogyny , or his problem with women ? He 's got a fairly messed-up attitude towards women .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done is find these incredibly strong female characters who he 's come up against .
He 's a hero , but he 's also deeply flawed .
It is up to audiences to decide on Bond .
Not for me .
"  Broccoli cuts in : " Bond has already had trouble forming attachments , and that 's part of the character .
He 's an orphan .
He fell in love with Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale and she broke his heart .
" Craig warms to the theme .
" We could throw in all kinds of references to the world , and I think we all agree it dates a film .
"  Within seconds of the duo exiting the room , there is a little echo , beginning with one reporter piping up , " Well he was in a good mood today , " while another enthuses , " So much more open and chatty , " and someone else offers " nice mood " .
Even one of the publicists in the lift remarks on how chatty and cheery " Daniel " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , having to do interview after interview with reporters asking so many of the same questions .
Craig can now return to his $US6 .
million brownstone across town , his day of soulless press meets over .
I 'm escorted to the 11th floor , seated in a spare chair outside the lift doors , and asked to wait .
I count 10 publicists milling about , some crouched on the floor in the corridor , heads in their phones , at least one standing sentry at each door to the suites .
Behind each of these doors a major star from the film is ensconced , waiting for reporter after reporter to march in with their list of questions .
A publicist checks her running sheet , says , " You 're up next " and ushers me down the hallway .
Another opens a door with a minor flourish while a third inside immediately clicks on her phone 's timer for my 10-minute slot .
I 'm about to meet French actress L ? a Seydoux , who plays Dr Madeleine Swann , Bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I .
Ca n't .
Help .
Looking .
Resplendent in a black pants suit with black high-heel boots and pearl earrings , Seydoux is breathtakingly beautiful .
The odd puffs of smoke billowing behind her ears , which I quickly realise are from her discreet vaping , add another disarming touch ( smoking-hot French actresses being apparently exempt from no-smoking rules in New York 's finest hotels ) .
As she describes her character , the 34-year-old 's soft , lilting French accent lulls me into a kind of trance .
" She 's not there to please Bond 's sexuality .
she 's a real character .
I would n't call her a Bond woman .
"  Jolted out of my reverie , I grab my handset in a panic .
It 's switched to silent .
Our heads turn to the offending publicist .
She 's been rustling her notes , for which she apologises profusely .
Confused by how Seydoux has mistaken a clipboard 's paper-shuffling for a ringtone , I offer irrelevantly , " Do you find interviews boring ? "  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .
I like it when it 's a conversation like this .
you exchange ideas .
You never know how people will pursue you .

Our time up , I ask L ? a Seydoux whether she 'd like to see a female Bond .
" I do n't really care , " she says .
" No , not so much .
" before adding that we 're all a mass of contradictions .
" I am a very scary person , " which she immediately corrects to " scared " , adding , " I am strong and I am weak .
I like to be in the light , but I also hate it .

I 'm about to enter the villain 's lair .
Rami Malek plays the film 's villain , Safin .
Dove  The first thing you notice about Rami Malek is his distinctive honey-rich baritone voice .
The second is that he 's exceedingly polite and exudes a chill vibe .
Sitting cross-legged , he patiently answers questions , and good-naturedly gets up to shake my hand at the beginning and end of the interview ( the only star to do so during my time in Bond 's world ) .
I 'm interested in how he manipulates his voice to suit his character , the villain Safin .
" I really do n't enjoy the sound of my own voice , " the 38-year-old admits .
" William Conacher a British dialect coach helped me get the phrase voice right for Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody and gave me some ideas for the villain , which I took to Cary Fukunaga to see whether they would fit .
"  Did he research any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go through the Bond villains , but a catalogue of cinema history and picked out all my favourite villains .
" His favourite ? The former MI6 agent turned cyber terrorist , Raoul Silva , played by Javier Bardem in Skyfall , because of his backstory .
" There 's nothing simplistic about being a villain , " observes Malek .
" What drives that human being to do what they are doing ? Is their malice defined by them or defined by others ? "  We proceed to talk very briefly about his extraordinary journey -- being the son of Egyptian immigrant parents , having a twin brother , growing up in Los Angeles , going to school with fellow actor Kirsten Dunst -- and his astonishing rise .
" Look man , if you told me in the span of two years , I 'd be playing an icon like Freddie Mercury , then the villain in a Bond film , I would have laughed at you , " he says .
" I do n't take this for granted for a second .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awards last year , he took a stumble on stage ; there are videos of him on YouTube taking other falls .
Is he a little clumsy ? " I do n't think of myself as clumsy , " he laughs .
" Perhaps I have a little too much on my mind .
"  Malek has an earnest reverence for his craft .
" When you 're at this level and working with such talented people , there is not much room to be anything other than poised , specific and intense .
"  As I 'm leaving the hotel and grabbing my luggage for a mad dash to the airport , it occurs to me that Bond would n't be seen dead boarding a plane with a bag .
I pass the highly engaging Lashana Lynch on her way to the lifts .
" You know , you 're about the only reporter who still uses a notepad , " she observes .
" Well , I like to do some things the old-fashioned way , " I reply , stealing a Bond line from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference clearly passing her by .
I feel compelled to elaborate .
" I record , but the notes are for observational stuff .
" " Ah , I see , " she laughs .
" Hope you 'll still see the film .

The much-awaited title song for No Time to Die by 18-year-old singer-songwriter Billie Eilish , beloved by Generation Z , has been released , and the publicity machine has the pedal to the metal in the final lap to the film 's opening .
But news of the coronavirus has become increasingly alarming .
While the entertainment industry is hardly a priority in the face of a global pandemic , those whose livelihoods depend on the production , distribution and promotion of films are hit hard as cinemas across China , South Korea , Japan and Italy close their doors in February .
On March 2 , the founders of the world 's two biggest James Bond fan sites send an open letter to Eon , MGM and Universal calling for the postponement of the film 's release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rainy morning of Thursday March 5 , my phone lights up with emails and texts .
A statement has been issued from the offices of Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli : the release of No Time to Die will be postponed until November .
The rescheduling is likely to cost unknown millions in cancellation fees and relaunches .
No Time to Die is the first Hollywood blockbuster to shift its release date because of the coronavirus .
Suddenly , Lashana Lynch 's words outside the lifts back in November seem oddly prescient .
