' Do n't blame bats for Covid-19 '  Genomic research showing that the 2019 novel coronavirus disease ( Covid-19 ) likely originated in bats has produced heavy media coverage and widespread concern .
There is now danger that frightened people and misguided officials will try to curb the epidemic by culling these remarkable creatures , even though this strategy has failed in the past .
As an environmental historian focusing on endangered species and biological diversity , I know that bats provide valuable services to humans and need protection .
Instead of blaming bats for the coronavirus epidemic , I believe it 's important to know more about them .
Here 's some background explaining why they carry so many viruses , and why these viruses only jump infrequently to humans -- typically , when people hunt bats or intrude into places where bats live .
The challenges of life as a bat  It 's not easy being the world 's only flying mammal .
Flying requires a lot of energy , so bats need to consume nutritious foods , such as fruits and insects .
As they forage , bats pollinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guavas and agaves ( the source of tequila ) .
Insect-eating bats may consume the equivalent of their body weight in bugs each night -- including mosquitoes that carry diseases like Zika , dengue and malaria .
Bats convert these foods into droppings called guano , which nourish entire ecosystems , have been harvested for centuries as fertilizer , and have been used to make soaps and antibiotics .
Since fruits and insects tend to follow seasonal boom-and-bust cycles , most bats hibernate for long periods , during which their core body temperatures may fall as low as 43 degrees Fahrenheit ( 6 degrees Celsius ) .
To conserve warmth , they gather in insulated places like caves , use their wings as blankets and huddle together in colonies .
When fruits ripen and insects hatch , bats wake up and flutter out of their roosts to forage .
But now they have a different problem : Flying requires so much energy that their metabolic rates may spike as high as 34 times their resting levels , and their core body temperatures can exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings filled with blood vessels that radiate heat .
They also lick their fur to simulate sweat and pant like dogs .
And they rest during the heat of the day and forage in the cool of night , which makes their ability to navigate by echolocation , or reflected sound , handy .
Diverse and unique  Humans are more closely related to bats than we are to dogs , cows or whales .
But bats seem more alien , which can make it harder for people to relate to them .
Bats are the most unusual of the world 's 26 mammal orders , or large groups , such as rodents and carnivores .
They are the only land mammals that navigate by echolocation , and the only mammals capable of true flight .
Many bats are small and have rapid metabolisms , but they reproduce slowly and live long lives .
That 's more typical of large animals like sharks and elephants .
And a bat 's internal body temperatures can fluctuate by more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit in response to external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the temperature of their surroundings , like turtles and lizards .
Carries 200 coronaviruses  Bats carry a range of viruses that can sicken other mammals when they jump species .
These include at least 200 coronaviruses , some of which cause human respiratory diseases like SARS and MERS .
Bats also host several filoviruses , including some that in humans manifest as deadly hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg and probably even Ebola .
Normally , these viruses remain hidden in bats ' bodies and ecosystems without harming humans .
People raise the risk of transmission between species when they encroach on bats ' habitats or harvest bats for medicine or food .
In particular , humans pack live bats into unsanitary conditions with other wild species that may serve as intermediate hosts .
This is what happened at the Wuhan wet market where many experts believe Covid-19 emerged .
With a few exceptions -- such as rabies -- bats host their pathogens without getting sick .
What makes bat a bat  Recent media coverage attempting to explain this riddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gene mutation , which may enable them to remain healthy while harboring such viruses .
But while the mutation may be of interest from a public health perspective , understanding where this novel coronavirus came from requires understanding what makes a bat a bat .
Why do bats carry so many diseases but seem unaffected by them ?  Genetic mutations that boost their immune systems may help .
But a better answer is that bats are the only mammals that fly .
With thousands of bats crowded together licking , breathing and pooping on one another , bat caves are ideal environments for breeding and transmitting germs .
But when bats fly , they generate so much internal heat that , according to many scientists , their bodies are able to fight off the germs they carry .
This is known as the " flight as fever hypothesis .
"  Bats at risk  Bats may not always be around to eat insect pests , pollinate fruit crops and provide fertilizer .
According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are critically endangered , and 104 are vulnerable to extinction .
For at least 224 additional bat species , scientists lack the data to know their status .
Overharvesting , persecution and habitat loss are the greatest threats that bats face , but they also suffer from their own novel diseases .
Since it was first documented in upstate New York in 2007 , the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans ( Pd ) , which causes white-nose syndrome , has infected 13 North American bat species , including two listed as endangered .
Nobody knows where Pd came from , but the fact that several bat species seem never to have encountered it before suggests that people probably introduced or spread it .
The fungus thrives in cool , damp places like caves .
It grows on bats while they 're hibernating , causing such irritation that they become restless , wasting precious energy during seasons when little food is available .
White-nose syndrome has killed millions of bats , including more than 90 percent of the bats in some populations .
Bats are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our world would be a poorer , duller and more dangerous place without them .
They need protection from the cruel treatment and wasteful exploitation that also threatens human health .
