Source : Santa Barbara County Sheriff 's Office  March 29 , 2020  Two Sheriff 's Deputies Test Positive for Coronavirus  Two Sheriff 's Deputies are recovering at home after testing positive for COVID-19 .

The deputy began feeling ill the following day , Sunday , March 22 , 2020 and was experiencing COVID-19 related symptoms .

The deputy was notified that the test results were positive for COVID-19 on Friday , March 27 , 2020 by Public Health .

The Sheriff 's Office initiated additional follow-up that included tracing back each of the deputies ' contacts with the public and coworkers in a pro-active effort to identify possible exposures .
No additional people have been identified or recommended for self-isolation protocol by Public Health .

13 Comments  First tested waited 4 days while second sheriff tested waited 1 day .
This demonstrates improvement in turnaround time .
Should this be expected to hold up ? Also , how are they feeling now ? Can they report back experience and process of healing ? As public servants this anecdotal information is very helpful to the public .
@12:18 pm - But we are the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has ever won like us .
Many people , the best people , have told us what great winners we are .
We are gon na win like no one has ever seen .
Tremendous winning will happen .
Our tremendous economy will win and be better than ever .
The best people have told us .
@10:09 pm -That does not answer my question .
You are simply repeating what we have already read .
When the officer had symptoms and was , tested why was n't the other officer , who had been in the patrol car two days earlier , also tested and quarantined ? This is the problem .
Why is n't the sheriff taking every precaution ? Why is n't PH and the BOS demanding it ?  Why did it take 5 days for the first deputy to receive test results and one day for the second deputy ? Are they prioritizing by risk of exposure ? That 's a big difference in turn around time .
Also if the first deputy was having Covid symptoms and went home sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an abundance of caution ? It seems really poor policy to test one and wait for it to come back before quarantining and testing the other .
Sheriff 's deputies are not just regular citizens .
They are front line first responders .
Way more important for them to be tested than average Joe citizen .
Other County employees have been self quarantining for lesser reasons .
That 's how it is going .
Symptomatic citizens , by and large , are NOT being tested unless they present with the most severe symptoms ( and a combination of them ) or can prove direct contact with another who has tested positive .
That 's why the numbers are so skewed - only the sickest are being tested and counted as confirmed .
