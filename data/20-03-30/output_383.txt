'  c/o Calodagh McCumiskey  Email icon  Facebook icon  Twitter icon  Linkedin icon  Flipboard icon  Print icon  Resize icon  Referenced Symbols  WEXFORD , Ireland -- The physical restrictions of living in a lockdown in the age of coronavirus have reminded me of my time spent living in Angola in the late 1990s when we had to watch where we drove ( and walked ) to avoid land mines and needed to permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only way in and out of Chicuma , a remote part of the province of Benguela where I spent six months living in a tent , was through World Food Program flights .
The pilots , too , had to use all of their skills in landing to avoid those land mines .
My former aid-worker career in disaster zones has prepared me well for situations of challenge and uncertainty and , of late , limitations .
" This is what I learned during my time as an aid worker : When you see the worst in life , you often see the very best in people .
"  During my time as an aid worker , I responded to both man-made and natural catastrophes .
I once visited a hospital with no water , so I am familiar with the skills required to survive and be resourceful in challenging situations .
This is what I learned during my time as an aid worker : When you see the worst in life , you often see the very best in people .
I saw that then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eswatini ( formerly Swaziland ) in 2008 , where life expectancy had been reduced by nearly two decades to 44 years of age because of HIV and AIDS , I witnessed the incredible work of the education commission and how it strived to motivate school children to study in what seemed like a hopeless situation as many of their parents and others in their communities fell ill with HIV .
I visited one homestead where an 80-year-old woman looked after two of her great-grandchildren .
All of the other members of their family were sick or dead .
The indomitable spirits of these people will stay with me forever .
It 's also worth remembering that AIDS had an almost 100% fatality rate , while the fatality rate for COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus , has been estimated at anywhere between 1% and 3 .
throughout the course of this pandemic , depending on the source .
There are things to be grateful for during this pandemic , and , for me at least , that is one of them .
With people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped in to sustain lives and livelihoods and care for the vulnerable in very difficult circumstances .
Similarly , we are now seeing new heroes like health-care and supermarket workers , and truck drivers , come to light .
I live in Ireland , where the government last week introduced a nationwide lockdown , forbidding people from going outdoors unless it was for food , health reasons or to exercise .
Social distancing seems like the one reliable method of trying to " flatten the curve " as the number of case rises , in the hope of stopping the disease in its tracks .
' People have slowed down -- and woken up '  As in U .
cities and parts of Europe , most businesses and stores in Ireland are now closed .
But these workers are willing to put themselves on the front lines in an effort to help the sick and make sure everyone has enough food .
Many people grappling with social distancing , relatives who may be sick from COVID-19 or fearful about this global public health crisis now appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend who usually works 14-hour days told me she is enjoying quality family time with her husband and two small children .
As a society , we are social distancing , but strangely we are also more connected , and it 's all because of this harrowing crisis .
Over the weekend , a neighbor talked excitedly about feeding the birds in his garden , and I chatted with his youngest son .
This would never have happened on a previously " normal " working day .
I care for my 80-year-old mother , and she is loving having me at home more .
People have slowed down and woken up .
John Casey , a friend who works in the construction industry in our hometown of Wexford in the southeast of Ireland , told me : " It is making people sit up and pay attention that this world we live in is so fragile .
It is getting people that usually have their heads stuck in phones to realize the reality around them is not a cybergame .
"  Another friend , Joanna Valea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she , too , has found that social distancing has brought her closer to friends who live far away .
" I have lived in five countries and seven cities , so I have friends all over Europe .
Before we kept in touch with a text or an emoji , a ' Happy Birthday ' wish , maybe , " she said .
" These terrible days made me realize the importance of actually talking to someone , hearing their voices rather than just skimming through some texts , " Joanna added .
" It 's like we have renewed the vows of our friendship .
I love it .

The friends of a 12-year-old girl in Sligo , in the west of Ireland , where my mum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate her birthday .
Friends and neighbors passed by her house in a line of cars , honking their horns , to wish her a happy birthday , as she stood in her driveway , radiating with delight .
As of Monday , there were 2,910 confirmed cases of the virus in the Republic of Ireland , an increase of 215 cases on the day before , and 54 people had died from the disease , an increase of 8 deaths , while just five have thus far recovered .
The virus is so far mainly affecting people in the capital city , Dublin , which has more than 50% of positive cases .
Worldwide , as of Monday evening in the U .
, there were 782,365 confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide , with 37,582 deaths .
Ireland is now in full lockdown , with nonessential trips banned .
There are police checkpoints on the roads to ensure people stick to these rules .
While there were many stories of people flouting the distancing rules in the last week while visiting scenic spots , this weekend people were adhering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way .
Initially , we are skeptical and even prone to ignoring authority , a habit that is perhaps inherited from previous generations and a time when Irish people were mostly tenants living under the cudgel of our British landlords .
Ireland has been a free state since 1922 , and , as the Easter Rising of 1916 showed , we will unite if the survival of our country is at stake .
Gatherings of more than one person in public places are now prohibited -- apart from people in the same household .
Only close family members of people who die from coronavirus can attend their funerals under strictly controlled conditions .
We are now in the calm before the surge .
We know it will come , as has happened elsewhere .
Testing capacity is being ramped up and temporary mortuaries set up .
It feels surreal , like we are sitting in a waiting room , but waiting for what , we do n't really know .
COVID-19 has so far been a bit like a game of snakes and ladders .
Every day has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first online meditation class last week .
Professionally , I have had to reinvent myself .
As a life coach , I feel lucky there is much I can do online .
Not everyone is so fortunate .
While many people feel their world is getting smaller , mine is getting bigger .
I am learning new skills as I work with Zoom ZM , -0 .
and use social media more frequently .
I found new clients from India , the U .
, England , Turkey and Ireland over the last 10 days .
I even managed to get my washing machine repaired by an online repairman who guided me through the process .
I have enjoyed richer and deeper conversations with almost everyone I have interacted with .
A chance encounter at the ATM with a man who works at a local business led to a 15-minute conversation .
When people are not caught up in the hustle and bustle , they can see and hear each other .
It seems like the virus has pushed us all to look at things differently and change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autopilot and away from our jaded conversational pleasantries and has shown us what matters most .
As my friend Shashi Dubey told me on Sunday morning : " This is the story of man and nature .
In this age of technology , we were moving so fast that we forgot our role and now need to rethink how we operate .
We are the horse , but Mother Nature holds the reins .
