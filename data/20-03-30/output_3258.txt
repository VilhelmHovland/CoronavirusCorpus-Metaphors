The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) published this week a study of 72,314 confirmed , clinically diagnosed or suspected cases as of February 11 .
According to the most extensive study done so far , the novel coronavirus was benign in 80 .
percent of the cases , " serious " in 13 .
percent and " critical " in 4 .
percent .
The remaining 0 .
percent was not specified .
According to the China CDC study , the mortality rate increased substantially with age , and those over 80 were most at risk with a rate of 14 .
percent .
Patients who already suffered from cardiovascular diseases were also particularly at risk , ahead of diabetics and those who suffered from chronic respiratory diseases or hypertension .
Global estimates of the mortality rate are risky however because we do not know how many people have actually been infected .
Other strains of coronavirus , such as SARS and Mers , have established mortality rates of 9 .
percent and 34 .
percent , respectively .
Specialists generally agree that each person who falls ill with coronavirus will infect between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher rate than a typical winter flu ( 1 .
) , lower than an infectious disease such as measles ( more than 12 ) , and comparable to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS ( 3 ) -- the last major virus that broke out in China , in 2002-03 .
Some experts warn however that we might be seriously underestimating the number of cases .
A study published Friday by the Imperial College Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said : " We estimated that about two-thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have remained undetected worldwide , potentially resulting in multiple chains of as yet undetected human-to-human transmission outside mainland China .
"  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus voiced concern on Friday about " the number of cases with no clear epidemiological link , such as travel history to China or contact with a confirmed case .
" Asymptomatic cases , where people show no symptoms , are another cause for concern .
The incubation period is estimated to be two to 10 days and has led to experts to decide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for people who have been repatriated from areas such as China 's Hubei province , the epicentre of the outbreak .
The virus is mainly transmitted by respiratory means and physical contact .
Drops of saliva expelled when an infected person coughs is a common example , and researchers believe that generally occurs over a distance of around one metre ( yard ) at most .
Health advisories emphasise measures such as washing your hands often , coughing or sneezing into the crook of your elbow or a paper handkerchief , and wearing a mask if you know you have been infected .
A secondary means of transmission might be diarrhoea .
WHO says : " Signs and symptoms include respiratory symptoms and include fever , cough and shortness of breath .
In more severe cases , infection can cause pneumonia , severe acute respiratory syndrome and sometimes death .
"  There are no vaccines or medications at present to fight COVID-19 so health officials can only treat the symptoms .
Some patients are given anti-viral medications , but their effectiveness has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have come from bats , but researchers think it might have spread to humans via another mammal species .
Chinese researchers suspect that might be the pangolin , a widely trafficked and endangered mammal .
The global scientific community deems that hypothesis plausible , but still awaits confirmation .
