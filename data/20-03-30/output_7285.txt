Search form  Venezuela and the Coronavirus : Another Path Is Possible  The international community should focus on humanitarian aid , and try to prevent a health disaster that could spread across much of Latin America .

Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/Getty Images  On March 26 , U .
Attorney General William Barr announced indictments of Venezuela 's authoritarian leader , Nicol ? s Maduro , and 14 senior current and former Venezuelan officials .
The indictments , including a $15 million reward for Maduro 's capture , represent the latest tightening of the screws aimed at toppling the regime or forcing it to accept free elections .
The sanctions came amid a looming public health catastrophe as the coronavirus races around the globe .
Venezuela is uniquely unprepared to treat or contain the virus , representing a threat to not only its own people but to public health in neighboring countries due to ongoing levels of migration .
As such , rather than take steps to try to isolate the regime further , the international community should mobilize to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This could help avert contagion inside the country and dramatically reduce the risk to other countries to which desperate Venezuelans are fleeing .
As of March 29 , Venezuela claimed it had 119 cases , out of a total of approximately 14,500 in Latin America and the Caribbean .
Both numbers may seem modest .
But in the absence of widespread testing , vast underreporting is to be assumed .
To try to contain the virus 's spread , the Maduro regime has imposed a strict lockdown .
The military and security forces now police the streets to enforce a nationwide quarantine , even as their chaotic blocking of roads has prevented the circulation of needed food , gasoline and other supplies .
The U .
indictments on March 26 , as with previous individual , financial , oil sector and secondary sanctions , focus the regime 's efforts on survival , giving even greater power to the hardliners who currently dominate decision making .
The timing could not have been worse .
To meet the unprecedented threat of the coronavirus outbreak , civil society organizations were aiming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborate in mounting a national response .
Opposition leader Juan Guaid ? called for an emergency coalition government to confront the outbreak .
But as the U .
government doubles down , getting the regime to cooperate even on issues of life or death look remote at best .
Venezuela 's vulnerability is difficult to overstate .
The Global Health Security Index , a project that includes the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security , gave Venezuela the worst score in the region , placing it among 20 lowest-ranking countries in the world .
A survey last year by the Venezuelan nongovernmental organization Doctors for Health found that 63% of hospitals had experienced electrical service failures .
Twenty percent did not have running water , and 70% received it only once or twice a week .
People in poor neighborhoods -- where food scarcity , power outages , and shortages of drinking water have been the norm -- have little access to soap , let alone running water to wash hands .
" Social distancing , " a staple of prevention in advanced economies , is impossible in densely-populated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the region where the poor face precarious living conditions .
But the deprivation faced before the coronavirus is uniquely acute .
For example , a World Food Program assessment published in February 2020 indicated that only 8% of Venezuelans are " food secure ; " 60% are " marginally food secure " and fully one in three " food insecure .
" The humanitarian agency Caritas estimates that two-thirds of children under five in poor neighborhoods have or are at risk of malnutrition , including 12% for whom malnutrition is already moderate or acute .
Those with access to dollars can buy goods , albeit at exorbitant prices .
Before the coronavirus pandemic , remittances from Venezuelans abroad were estimated to top $4 billion this year .
But as job loss and recession spread around the globe , that amount could be cut in half .
Meanwhile , those without dollars are left with Venezuela 's worthless currency .
According to the Caracas-based Center of Documentation and Analysis for Workers , the government-set minimum monthly wage is sufficient to buy less than 2% of the basic food basket for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to assist Venezuelan citizens now is both a humanitarian imperative and a requirement for regional stability .
Already some 5 million Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries in search of basic necessities .
The Maduro regime 's corruption , mismanagement , and gross incompetence had caused the Venezuelan economy to shrink by two-thirds since 2013 .
Now , the economy is in more rapid freefall as the price of oil , the country 's main export , plummets to $25-$30 per barrel , barely covering the costs of production .
The push factors behind migration have never been greater .
Although Colombia and Brazil have closed their land borders with Venezuela , they are incapable of controlling the hundreds if not thousands of informal crossing points that remain , many of them controlled by violent criminal gangs .
Desperate Venezuelans will continue to seek refuge -- in Peru , Ecuador , Chile , Trinidad and Tobago , and elsewhere -- regardless of formal migration restrictions .
A nightmarish spread of the coronavirus pandemic beyond Venezuela 's borders is not unimaginable .
Despite the Maduro regime 's longstanding unwillingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies have built up a significant presence on the ground .
Many work closely with other international and Venezuelan non-governmental organizations , including the Red Cross .
On March 17 , the Venezuelan government requested the UN 's help in responding to the coronavirus , something that gives the UN leverage in expanding existing operations of the Pan American Health Organization ( PAHO ) and UNICEF , among other UN agencies .
Just as important , the government 's request to the UN also gives it a unique opportunity to open up space for non-governmental organizations , who are demanding guarantees for the rights of healthcare and humanitarian workers to operate without threat or impediment , especially in Venezuela 's hard-hit interior .
Indeed , many in civil society are pushing the government and opposition to adopt a political agreement in order to fight the pandemic more effectively .
The U .
government has provided more than any other international donor to assist Venezuelan refugees outside Venezuela .
But U .
officials have needlessly politicized the humanitarian issue -- insisting , for example , in Feb .
2019 that a massive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid inside Venezuela be coordinated through interim President Juan Guaid ? .
The opposition has a role in expanding humanitarian aid delivery to Venezuela through neutral third parties , as does the international community .
Irrespective of what would be politically desirable , so does the Venezuelan government .
It controls the ministry of health and associated healthcare centers and has veto power over what enters the country .
Expanded aid needs its buy-in , not resistance .
After Venezuelan citizens , Colombia has the most to lose from a failure to act .
It is at the epicenter of the Venezuelan migration human tragedy , with some 1 .
million refugees arriving over the last five years .
Colombia 's public health system , already stretched to the limits before the coronavirus , could well be overwhelmed should the pandemic spread .
Colombian and Venezuelan officials have put aside deep antagonisms to open discussions over how to limit the spread of the coronavirus even while the border remains closed .
The United Nations has also taken action , distributing more than 2,000 diagnostic kits and 150,000 masks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve sanitation and increase access to clean water in the 45 hospitals designated by the government to receive coronavirus patients .
There are precedents for successful collaboration .
After the nationwide blackouts that began in March 2019 led to scores of patient deaths , international organizations like PAHO and UNICEF provided generators to hospitals , drastically reducing mortalities .
With PAHO 's support , health workers carried out a country-wide measles vaccination campaign that reached almost 9 million children , reigning in an outbreak that had resulted in over 7,000 cases .
While U .
sanctions technically exempt humanitarian aid , in practice they prohibitively raise the transaction costs of doing any business with Venezuelan entities .
Clarifying a sanctions exemption to provide funding to UN agencies and private aid organizations with " boots on the ground " is a vital aspect to address the current health emergency .
The Maduro regime bears responsibility for its wretched lack of preparedness to face the current global pandemic .
But the international community should spare no effort to assist Venezuela 's desperate population , along with Venezuela 's neighbors that continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failures .
