ALEX BRUMMER : Corporate leaders have chance to consign much resented ' fat-cat ' label to dustbin of history - they should show right stuff and do it  Coronavirus is taking the biggest toll on dividends in modern times , with more than ? 4 .
billion of payouts postponed or cancelled so far , and big distributors -- such as oil majors -- still to decide .
Preserving capital in times of strife is critical , particularly for banks , because of their key role in supporting the smalland medium-sized firms that are the backbone of the economy .
So far , however , the lenders are not having a good crisis .
With 5 .
small businesses in the UK , we can not be surprised that there are long delays in reaching account managers by telephone .
A step in the right direction : The high level of pay and bonuses among bosses has long been a national scandal and needs scrutiny  What is distressing is the message received when connections are made .
The demands for personal assets as collateral , when the Government is indemnifying most of the loan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses .
As well as axing dividends , boards need to go a step further .
The high level of pay and bonuses among FTSE350 bosses has long been a national scandal and needs scrutiny .
Among the top 100 bosses , the ratio of CEO rewards to ordinary workers is 167:1 .
With a few exceptions , such as BA-owner IAG 's chief executive Willie Walsh , and the boss of shoe company Kurt Geiger , Neil Clifford , there has been silence about changing salary and bonus arrangements .
If ever there was a moment for the upper echelons of British business to show that shareholders , employees and bosses are engaged in the battle against Covid-19 together , it is now .
It should be a condition of access to any loans through the Bank of England 's ? 330 billion Covid Corporate Financing Facility or the smaller corporate interruptions scheme , operated by the British Business Bank -- which allows firms to borrow up to ? 5m -- that the bonus slate is wiped clean of incentive plans .
Directors ' remuneration should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article  Share  Honourable CEOs should consider going even further .
There has been talk , from Boris Johnson and others , of turning a health emergency into an opportunity by creating a better society .
Britain 's corporate leaders have a chance to consign the much resented fat-cat label to the dustbin of history .
They should show the right stuff and do it .
Easy money  Stelios Haji-Ioannou is the ultimate activist investor .
The founder and biggest shareholder in Easyjet never loses an opportunity to unsettle management .
With the carrier now fully grounded and flight crews being offered to provide services for Covid-19 patients at the emergency Nightingale Hospital in London , Stelios may not have chosen the most opportune time to launch an assault .
In a rather ruthless technique , he is proposing to sacrifice a non-executive director every seven weeks at a series of rolling general meetings starting on April 1 .
There is something to the Stelios argument that this is not the right moment for Easyjet to expand its fleet by spending ? 4 .
billion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He argues the contract is unenforceable since coronavirus has effectively triggered ' force majeure ' , which technically allows contracts to be invalidated .
Courts might disagree .
Support for his advice might be greater if he had decided to redeploy some or all of the ? 60m dividend recently paid to him and his family to assist the company and its staff in its hour of need .
It is , of course , up to him how he uses his resources .
In this time of stress for management and workforce , the Easyjet founder might have been better advised to engage on the Airbus front quietly , rather than wasting time and money on noisy dissent .
Grand designs  Britain 's creative and design industries are often overlooked in the grand scheme .
So it is good to see that they are responding positively to the desolation all around .
Elton John and other high profile musicians are doing their bit to lift the spirits with the iHeart Living Room Concert for coronavirus charities .
There are large numbers of unsung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music ( the old Performing Rights Society ) is offering members ? 1,000 grants to help see them through the health emergency .
On a separate front , Britain 's newest creative hub , the Design District on Greenwich Peninsula in London , is pressing ahead with an opening later this year .
It will host 1,800 innovators , fashion designers and arts workers in affordable work-spaces in 16 buildings on a two-and-a-half acre campus .
Terrific to see industries which believe in self-help looking through the lock-down towards better days .
