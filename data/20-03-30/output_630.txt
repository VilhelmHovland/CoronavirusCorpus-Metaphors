US fashion brands having to make medical masks expose a failure of the health system  Across the US , clothing companies and legions of home sewers are churning out face masks as fast as they can to meet the critical shortage of masks available to American medical workers .
It 's a heartening and admirable effort by both companies and individuals to assist in a moment of national need .
There 's just one problem : Many of these masks are apparently being made from regular cloth textiles such as cotton , which research says offers little protection against infectious diseases such as the new coronavirus .
The situation is n't the fault of those trying to help .
Rather , it 's a sign of how unprepared the US health system was for an outbreak like Covid-19 , both in the number of masks it had available and its ability to make more in an emergency .
Making masks as a last resort  Manufacturers of medical masks use specialized materials ( pdf ) made of a synthetic fiber -- often polypropylene -- formed into a web of fine filaments using what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of filtering out microscopic particles , which is why it 's preferred for medical-grade masks , such as N95 respirators , that form a seal around the nose and mouth .
It 's also used for looser-fitting surgical masks , which are more for keeping the wearer from spreading disease and protecting them from sprays of liquid .
In California , the Los Angeles mayor 's office , in partnership with fashion retailer Reformation and under guidance from healthcare company Kaiser Permanente , is asking local manufacturers ( pdf ) to make masks from latex-free cotton or cotton-blend materials of specific weights .
Gap Inc .
is connecting California hospitals directly with vendors in its supply chain that it knows have personal protective equipment ( PPE ) available .
A Gap spokesperson said in an email the company is also working with its manufacturing partners to explore producing " fabric masks " and other protective gear , though it 's still working out details such as materials it will use .
These mask makers generally say they 're following guidance from federal or local health authorities and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical-grade .
Their hope is to free up the more effective N95 respirators and surgical masks for the workers who need them most .
Cloth masks , which could at least be laundered and reused , are a last resort for nurses and doctors in need .
Making them is also a way for clothing companies and anyone with a sewing machine to feel like they are helping .
But while there is some evidence that any face mask , even a homemade one , is better than nothing , cloth masks arguably do n't offer sufficient protection for workers on the front lines .
The World Health Organization , for instance , states in its guidance ( pdf ) , " Cloth ( e .
cotton or gauze ) masks are not recommended under any circumstance .
"  A 2015 study ( pdf ) of roughly 1,600 workers at hospitals in Vietnam found nearly 97% of particles penetrated the cloth masks , versus 44% for medical masks .
Workers who wore cloth masks also had higher rates of infection than those wearing surgical masks or those in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks retained moisture .
" I think health workers using cloth masks are not adequately protected , and there is a work health and safety issue in telling them to work in a bandana or t-shirt mask , " Raina MacIntyre , lead author of the study and an expert on infectious diseases at the University of New South Wales ( UNSW ) in Australia , said in an email .
" But what do we do ? Let patients die or force our health workers into a high risk situation where they too may die ? We need more acknowledgment of this question .
"  Signs of a systemic failure  MacIntyre recently wrote a post for UNSW about the lack of proper protective equipment medical workers have had to contend with during the coronavirus crisis .
She said the study she led is still the only randomized clinical trial to be conducted on cloth masks , and the conclusion was clear : " The most important point is that the paper does not say ' do not wear a mask ' -- the message was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as surgical masks instead of cloth masks , to protect their workers , " she wrote .
It 's conceivable there would have been a shortage of medical masks in the US regardless of any precautions just because of the unforeseeable extent of the coronavirus outbreak .
But it likely did n't have to be as acute as it currently is .
The US had developed a strategic stockpile of protective medical gear , now maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) , but used much of it during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic .
The public health system prioritized spending its inadequate budget on medicines and equipment for disasters and other disease scenarios , according to the Washington Post , and to keep costs down , skipped stockpiling masks in favor of relying on private companies with quick supply chains to react in an emergency .
But while the country could produce enough N95 respirators and surgical masks to meet demand under normal conditions , a 2017 analysis of its supply chain for personal protective equipment concluded it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis .
Most protective masks are now made offshore , it said , and might be unavailable to the US in an emergency .
Indeed , after the coronavirus crisis in China , which produces most of the world 's medical masks , the country was slow to resume exporting masks .
The US now finds itself with a fraction of the medical-grade masks it needs as its number of coronavirus cases spikes .
Everyone is rushing to fill the gap as best as possible .
Companies such as 3M and Honeywell that make N95 and surgical masks have quickly ramped up manufacturing .
And even companies not in the business of making medical materials are finding ways to contribute more than plain cloth masks when they can .
Outdoor company Eddie Bauer said it had shifted production to making protective medical equipment at vendors that usually make its technical outerwear and have the capability .
Nordstrom , which calls itself the largest employer of tailors in North America , is working with Kaas Tailored , a clothing manufacturer in Washington state , to sew masks made by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthcare organization asking for help making masks .
Nordstrom PR  Kaas Tailored is making masks from cut-up surgical wrap .
Possibly the biggest mask-making effort among apparel companies in the US is a coalition enlisted by the US government that includes Hanes , Fruit of the Loom , and several smaller firms .
" Once fully ramped up in four to five weeks , the companies expect to produce up to 10 million face masks per week in the United States and in Central America , " the National Council of Textile Organizations said in a release .
The coalition has been coordinating directly with the HHS and the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Parkdale Mills , a large manufacturer of spun yarns , is supplying raw material while Hanes worked with the agencies to develop the fabric according to their specifications .
Batches of the material and other components are already being sent to all the clothing makers to sew into masks , which are then sent back to FEMA to be distributed .
The material for the masks is made from three-ply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parkdale Mills .
It 's unclear how it compares with other materials in protecting medical workers from infectious diseases , though experts have have previously proposed integrating antimicrobials such as copper or sodium chloride into masks as sterilization agents .
The government agencies Quartz contacted directed the inquiry to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) .
The FDA did not reply to a request for comment by the time of publication .
We will update this story with any reply .
American Giant  The coalition 's face masks .
" Everybody 's put their own businesses far to the side trying to get this thing up and going , " said Bayard Winthrop , founder of American Giant , one of the clothing companies that 's part of the coalition .
He calls the work of all the companies to meet the demand for masks " humbling and inspiring .
"  Winthrop is among those who say the current predicament should be a wake-up call for government officials and for industries that have outsourced manufacturing of critical items to other countries because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is exposing how vulnerable and how fragile that system is , and what happens when suddenly we 're in a situation where we need stuff , like medicine and medical masks and hospital beds and ventilators , and we 're no longer able to make it in this country anymore , " he said .
" The country has gotten to a place where we have lost our ability to make the things we need .
The fact that we 've got 10 companies turning themselves upside down that make underwear and t-shirts to fix the medical-mask problem is crazy .
"  Meanwhile , medical staff caring for sick patients continue to put themselves at risk .
Recently a nurse manager at a Manhattan hospital died after contracting Covid-19 .
On social media , some colleagues blamed a lack of protective equipment such as masks .
