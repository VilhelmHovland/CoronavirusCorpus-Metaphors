Parents with children celebrating birthdays during self-isolation are getting inventive .
There can be no big parties or visits to their favourite places .
Maybe not even a kiss and a hug with their grandparents during the coronavirus crisis .
Gordon mum Misty Cook was facing just that dilemma as her son Noah turned eight on Thursday .

That obviously could n't happen with the NRL season cancelled and all non-essential travel interstate being discouraged .
And with students encouraged to stay home this week , Noah could n't even see his mates in year three at St Clare of Assisi Primary School at Conder .
