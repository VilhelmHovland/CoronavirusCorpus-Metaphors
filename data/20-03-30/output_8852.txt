The newest member of the mask sewing brigade amid the coronavirus pandemic is used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause and the state 's Assembly chambers closed , Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz of Summit has been putting her sewing machine through the paces .
" It is a small token of my appreciation for all that nurses , doctors , respiratory therapists and other health care workers are doing round the clock to treat the growing number of patients with COVID-19 , " Munoz said .
A registered nurse for more than 30 years , Munoz said public service is in her nature .
And sewing is in her wheelhouse .
" I 've always enjoyed sewing , but now I can use my skill to protect those who are battling the coronavirus on the front lines , which is a great feeling , " she said .
" Our health care workers are facing a dire shortage of personal protective equipment .

A highly transmittable virus , it is infecting thousands in New Jersey .
The disease may be transmitted by those not showing symptoms , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Still , it is believed the virus spreads best in droplets projected by cough or sneeze .
Masks are crucial as a result .
Experts advise against using handmade masks .
They are untested and unproven .
" The makeshift masks are for , at best , use in general public settings , not in the medical community for clinical care , " said Stephen Parodi , the executive vice president of the Permanente Medical Group .
On Tuesday morning , Deborah Coats of Ho-Ho-Kus , a member of the New Jersey Modern Quilt Guild , went down to her basement sewing room and joined what she said felt like part of an American Dunkirk -- the ad-hoc attempt by knitters and quilters to create homemade face masks amid a yawning shortage of supplies afflicting health care facilities .
Dipping into what quilters call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using her Janome sewing machine and a pattern downloaded from Pinterest , Coats produced three dozen masks by noon .
They were not , she hastened to admit , the surgical N95 masks most coveted by hospitals .
But she said that in some cases , the life of such masks might be extended by layering over the kind of mask she and her fellow quilters were making from simple fabric .
Her big question was what to do with them ; it was n't immediately clear which facilities needed or wanted this type of mask .
Coats , a retired social worker , said her group in the quilt guild , which includes about 60 quilters , was eager to contribute : " At least with this , you feel you can do something .
You feel so helpless otherwise .
' '  Munoz 's masks are destined for Atlantic Health System 's six-hospital network , which serves nearly 5 million in North Jersey .
Atlantic Health System 's Morristown , Overlook , Chilton , Hackettstown and Newton medical centers all have drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care provider 's website even includes a video and directions for making masks out of elastic strips and two types of cotton scraps .
Company officials said in a statement that the homemade masks will be used only in spaces where there is no direct known risk of exposure to the novel coronavirus .
The masks will nonetheless free up professional-level protective gear for health care workers at high risk of exposure .
