Coronavirus : UK will not ' return to normal ' for six months , deputy chief medical officer warns  Life in the UK will not " return to normal " for six months , deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has warned .
The UK is currently in lockdown after prime minister Boris Johnson ordered people to stay at home except to shop for essentials , do one piece of exercise a day , collect medicine or go to work .
Anyone going outside must also stay at least two meters away from others in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus .
Johnson said the effectiveness of the policy would be assessed in three weeks ' time to see if the measures could be relaxed .
But appearing at the daily Downing Street press conference , Harries said it would be " quite dangerous " for restrictions to be ended too early .
She said : " If we stop , then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak .
" So over time , probably over the next six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will see where we are going .
" We need to keep that lid on -- and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal .
" Three weeks for review , two or three months to see whether we have really squashed it .
But about three to six months ideally , and lots of uncertainty in that , but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal .
"  Meanwhile , the prime minister -- who revealed on Friday that he has tested positive for the coronavirus and is now self-isolating in 11 Downing Street -- has paid tribute to the 20,000 former NHS staff who have answered the call to go back to the health service during the crisis .
Johnson also revealed that 750,000 members of the public have now volunteered to help the NHS - three times the original target .
" One thing that the coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there is such a thing as society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed today that Johnson 's chief adviser Dominic Cummings self-isolating after experiencing coronavirus symptoms  Chief medical officer Chris Whitty is also self-isolating after reporting having symptoms .
A No .
source said Cummings began to feel ill over the weekend , but remains " in contact " with the Downing Street operation .
Cummings was filmed by broadcasters running out of Downing Street on Friday lunchtime , shortly before the PM 's positive test was announced .
The former special advisor to Michael Gove and Vote Leave campaign director will now have to spend at least a week in quarantine , according to the Public Health England guidelines .
Johnson has continued to lead the UK response to the pandemic since testing positive , and was seen taking charge of a meeting of his senior team via video link over the weekend .
He has also posted a video from inside the flat above Number 11 Downing Street , where he is self-isolating , saying Britain 's response to the crisis shows " there really is such a thing as society " .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff have so far answered the call to go back to work during the crisis .
Meanwhile 750,000 members of the public have volunteered to help the health service - three times the original target .
Johnson added : " It 's a most amazing thing .
And that 's of course in addition to the 750,000 members of the public who have volunteered to help us get through this crisis .
" We are going to do it .
We are going to do it together .
One thing I think coronavirus crisis has proved is that there really is such a thing as society .
"  The comments are a reference to Margaret Thatcher 's claim in a 1987 magazine interview that " there is no such thing as society " .
Johnson will this week write to every UK household setting out details of the government 's social distancing strategy and to urge them to stay at home , protect the NHS and save lives .
He will urge everyone to follow the rules to save lives and thank NHS staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to protect others .
