These entrepreneurs aim to disrupt the women 's intimate and hygiene space with a range of eco-friendly products  The Woman 's Company , founded by Anika Parashar and Roopam Gupta , entered the women 's intimate and hygiene space this year with six eco-friendly products such as sanitary pads , panty liners , tampons , menstrual cup , bamboo razor , and pee stick .
Every woman wants the best for her children , and Anika Parashar is no exception .
Her daughter was hitting puberty and she wondered whether the products available in the market were good enough for her .
A lot of questions arose in Anika 's mind .
" What products are good for her ? What products would be certifiably biodegradable , organic , soft , rash-free , and enable her to continue her level of normal activity even while she was on her period ? "  All these thoughts gave rise to the idea of starting up in this space .
And thus , in Anika 's words , The Woman 's Company was born " in trying to find solutions for lakhs of women who felt their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted their daughters and granddaughters to have long-term , and viable solutions .
"  For women , by women  The Woman 's Company was launched on International Women 's Day this year by Anika along with co-founder Roopam Gupta .
Anika has over 19 years of experience working with reputed organisations such as Fortis Healthcare , Mahindra &amp; Mahindra , The National Childbirth Trust , BSKYB , Channel 4 , and Old-World Hospitality , among others .
She had left her role as the COO for the Fortis La Femme hospitals due to personal issues , and shortly after , her mother passed away , which meant she moved into a natural sabbatical .
" Having two young kids and a brother who had his own struggles , as well as closing down my parents ' matters meant I had a full plate .
As time went on in this past year , I was clear I wanted to continue my trajectory of two decades in women 's healthcare and wellness -- I had ample time and experience in understanding the need gaps and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started looking at young businesses in the women 's health space that I might invest time and money in , and slowly some areas narrowed down , " she says .
Roopam started her career around a decade ago as a brand manager with retail brands like Marks &amp; Spencer and Bata India before she moved to Fortis La Femme to lead the brand under Anika 's leadership .
" After having worked on other projects with Anika , she offered me partnership and the role of COO for this new venture even when she heard the news of my pregnancy ! This is a very exciting phase in my life as I have just birthed my two favourites - my newborn son Riyom and The Woman 's Company .
My daughter Reet is a more manageable toddler , " she says .
Convenient and eco-friendly  The Woman 's Company currently offers six products in the women 's intimate and hygiene space - sanitary pads , panty liners , tampons , menstrual cup , bamboo razor , and pee stick , with a vision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women .
Roopam explains that one of their unique products is The Woman Stick -- a urination device manufactured in India to help every woman stand and pee .
" The TWC urination stand and pee stick is made up of recyclable kraft paper without any use of plastic or lamination .
The stick is ergonomically designed , comfortable , convenient , biodegradable , and environment friendly .
Absolutely mess-free , the product 's perforated sides are customised to fit around a woman 's parts , leaving aside any fear of backsplashes and spillage and thereby reducing infections contracted by using public toilets .
"  Another product is a specially designed soft ' Teenage Pad ' for young girls who have just started their periods , and want to feel free and confident during the five days of their menstrual cycle .
The company said it will be making the products available across pharmacies , hospitals , on the TWC website soon , and will shortly be available on Amazon , Flipkart , Paytm Mall , and a number of other online aggregators .
The products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The products are currently manufactured in India and abroad , and the packaging is done in the country .
The founders also emphasise on the sustainability of the products .
" All our products and packaging are biodegradable , sustainable , and environment-friendly .
We have invested a long period of time to carefully identify the ingredients that get into our products to touch the most sensitive and intimate parts of a woman 's body , and our background in healthcare gives us the experience to understand how to achieve this , " says Roopam .
The Woman 's Company has raised investments from the founders , external investors , and employee stakeholders , and is not looking for any more funding at present .
However , the startup claims its aim is not just to manufacture products , but to also have awareness sessions , especially on menstrual health and hygiene .
" Having been in the healthcare sector for so long , the connects and the network we have is phenomenal .
We have a panel of expert stakeholders on board to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women 's health -- not just menstrual health and hygiene .
We aim to be an information company alongside a product company , " says Anika .
The current downturn in the economy and the coronavirus pandemic both make this a very challenging time for the startup .
" But if there is one thing I have learnt about myself , it is that it takes a lot for me to be distracted off course -- I believe in The Woman 's Company , and I do believe we will make the impact that we envision , " she adds .
