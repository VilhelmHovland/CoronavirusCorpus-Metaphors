For the first time in Grey-Bruce , there 's evidence COVID-19 is spreading in the community , as health officials have been expecting it would .
Sunday 's daily situation report from the Grey Bruce Health Unit announced that a presumptive positive case , which was first announced Saturday , now provides " evidence of community transmission .
"  This case , pending confirmation of test results , is that of a woman in her 70s in Grey-Bruce .
She is self-isolating at home .
It was n't until Sunday that travel-related infection was ruled out , said Dr .
Ian Arra , the medical officer of health in Grey-Bruce , in an interview Sunday night .
Until this case , all local COVID-19 infections have been travel-related .
" It is not a shock , " Arra said of evidence the virus is circulating in the community .
" It was a matter of time , of how much social distancing we implemented .
"  He expects hospital protocols would be triggered by this community transmission case , including possibly more hospital staff would begin to wear protective masks .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were two new confirmed COVID-19 cases , bringing the total Grey-Bruce cases to 10 .
This included a man in his 40s with a travel history who tested positive , and , Arra said Sunday night , a woman in her 20s who caught the bug after close contact with a confirmed case from another health unit jurisdiction .

It was on March 24 that Chief Public Health Officer of Canada Dr .
Theresa Tam announced that overall in Canada , as many COVID-19 cases were travel-related as involved community spread .
Two early COVID-19 deaths in a Barrie hospital indicate the disease had been spreading in that community for weeks prior , Arra said .
The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said one death , on March 21 , involved a man who was being treated for COVID-19 , who was in close contact with another man with COVID-19 , who died March 11 .
Working back from the point of death to the period of symptoms and incubation , transmission for those cases happened in mid-February , Arra said .
" So if there is transmission in Simcoe Muskoka mid-February , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said on March 28 .
" This bug , COVID-19 , is behaving in a way in its spread similar to the annual flu -- in the spread , I 'm not talking about mortality -- mortality is probably a step up from the flu , " he said .
Most who get infected experience mild symptoms and recover within two weeks .
But a portion of people , including seniors , will be hit harder and so efforts to limit the spread are intended to avoid overwhelming hospitals , whose officials say they 're planning for the worst and hoping for the best .
Arra said people recognize you ca n't contain the annual flu either , but you can reduce community spread by following the health directives and orders .
These include staying two metres from people outside of your immediate family , hand washing and avoiding touching your face , remaining home unless it 's necessary to leave , self-isolating for those who are sick and following all orders from public health and the provincial and federal governments .
Ontario declared a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close non-essential workplaces , recreational programs , libraries , publicly-funded schools , private schools , daycares , provincial parks , churches and other faith settings , as well as bars and restaurants , except those that may only offer takeout or delivery .
" If we are going to stop the spread of COVID-19 now and keep our communities safe , we need to take extraordinary measures to ensure physical distancing , " Premier Doug Ford is quoted saying in the release on March 28 .
" I strongly encourage everyone to do the responsible thing and stay home unless absolutely necessary .
I can assure everyone that we will do everything in our power to stop this virus in its tracks .
