World will need new financial system after Covid-19  We need to avoid putting current system back together with sticking plaster  A man wearing a face mask takes a selfie at the Charging Bull statue near the New Stock Exchange .
Photograph : Angela Weiss/AFP  The world as we know it is about to change radically as a result of Covid-19 .
How we live our lives , how we work , how we socialise and how money moves will change -- and profoundly .
We 'll leave others to figure out the first three but in terms of how money moves around the world , we will need to find a new way of financing the global economy when this virus has passed .
And before you say it 's too soon , please remember that the Bretton Woods conference , which set out a postwar economic system , was agreed a year before the end of hostilities and only a month after D-Day in 1944 .
It established a new global exchange rate system tied ( in part ) to the value of gold , created the International Monetary Fund and the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US dollar would be the global reserve currency -- or the currency into which all other currencies should be exchangeable .
The world needs to start thinking about a New Bretton Woods now and not muddle through , hoping to put it all back together with sticking plaster over the next few years .
Capitalism suspended  Over the coming weeks , consumption will collapse , as will confidence .
The hospitality sector as we knew it will be over .
Most airlines will have ceased flying .
House-buying or selling will disappear and with it home furnishing and renovations .
No one will start a major new project and very few will be completed .
Broadly speaking , the economy will cease to function .
Even if they are proactive now and lend immediately to robust businesses backed by last year 's profits , banks will experience widespread default from unpaid loans , mortgages and overdrafts .
Capitalism will be suspended .
The most optimistic view is that we put the economy to sleep , inoculating it as best we can with massive injections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done if governments and central banks -- acting together -- deposit free money in businesses ' and people 's accounts , not so much to maintain spending as to prevent contagious mass default .
This monetary ' vaccine ' would best work alongside ( and not instead of ) governments taking on the wage bill for workers .
Helicopter money could be delivered without incurring significant debt but , intellectually , it would mean tearing up the central-banking rule book .
Although this is the most sensible thing to do , governments may well choose to raise the money ( unnecessarily in our opinion ) by issuing massive amounts of sovereign debt .
As Ireland is one of the most export-dependent economies in the world , it 's not unreasonable to assume that Ireland 's national income or GDP could sink by 10-25 per cent this quarter and next -- depending on how long this crisis continues .
The budget deficit ( or national overdraft ) could spike to 20 per cent of GDP .
Unemployment , even with the wage subsidy to dissuade employers from laying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent .
usual escape valve of emigration will not be open to Irish youth because nearly every developed country in the world will also be in recession with mass unemployment .
At the outset , politicians will tend to prefer maintaining the current system -- even though it will have been completely broken by Covid-19 .
Having taken the measures outlined above , debts will be crippling , but interest rates will remain on the floor .
Big central banks will create more money and use quantitative easing to fund this debt .
Globalisation , of which Ireland has overwhelmingly been a beneficiary , is predicated on travel , trade and the free movement of capital .
This will go into reverse .
The speed of any reversal will depend on the type of governments that emerge from the crisis .
There is a higher likelihood of more nationalist , protectionist and less cosmopolitan politicians emerging in countries traumatised by the virus .
If we want to preserve the liberal order , which has delivered relative prosperity for the past 40 years , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bretton Woods arrangement .
This disparate group includes major nations from all continents and the three biggest economic players : the United States , China and the European Union .
The UN is too cumbersome .
Before its first emergency meeting ( via Zoom or Skype ) , the G20 would have asked its brightest thinkers and economists to come up with some creative ideas to kick-start the post Covid-19 world .
Alas , these recommendations will inevitably be watered down once the politicians get their hands on them .
The US , for example , would probably demand that the dollar remain the global reserve currency but China simply would n't wear that and the Chinese might even be backed by EU governments .
Assuming the gravity of the situation forces politicians to come to a compromise , we could be looking at a brand new global reserve currency , which might be based on a basket of currencies including the yuan , euro and dollar .
This new virtual unit of credit ( eg the ' Globo ' or the ' Mundo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assets .
That could then restart supply and demand and might even lead to cash and coins being issued in the new clearing currency by a reconstituted IMF -- one which the old western countries would no longer control .
Debt  Apart from what kind of money we 'd all be using , the most pressing issue would be debt .
In the worst case , bankrupt western governments might have to print trillions of euro and dollars to give their citizens enough money to survive .
It 's not unreasonable to assume that they would consider nationalising vast swathes ( if not all ) of the economy -- especially those in travel , hospitality and essential services such as rubbish collection and banking ( again ) .
This is already under way in some countries .
That means sovereigns -- for a while -- would own hundreds of thousands of distressed companies , all their debt , all their assets and all of their wage bills which could then be leased or sold back in chunks to those who could afford it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this .
Unpalatable as it may sound , those who ran the National Asset Management Agency and the Treuhand ( which disposed of East German assets after the fall of the Berlin Wall ) would become the most sought-after consultants in the world .
In fact , " Nama-isation " could go into the global lexicon as the byword for returning distressed assets back to the private sector .
But even if none of these ideas is implemented or even debated , something urgent and drastic will have to be done .
Just as the calendar was bifurcated into BC and AD , the economic future will be delineated into two eras : ante-corona ( AC ) and post-corona ( PC ) .
