Soft fruit growers have seen a massive response to their national appeal for unemployed people to come and pick berries in Angus , Perthshire and Fife this summer .
The Arbroath-based Angus Growers cooperative received 648 applications in just 24 hours following their call for 3,000 pickers , and NFU Scotland 's dedicated online employment portal was viewed more than 4,600 times in four days .
Stewarts of Tayside finance director Doug Baxter said applications had come from across Scotland from people of all ages and backgrounds .
" It 's great that the applications are coming in , but one of the challenges is that people are looking for work right now and we 're not needing labour until mid-May onwards , " he said .
" There are logistical issues in the weeks and months ahead , but it is still our intention to proceed with planting as usual .
"  At Barnsmuir Farm in Fife , Tim Stockwell said most of the 50 responses had come from locals , and he would be taking people on .
" We need 300 to 400 pickers in the summer and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said .
" We 're planting as usual but looking at the situation day by day .
Making decisions is not easy at the moment .
"  Ringlink , the farm business cooperative based in Laurencekirk and Cupar , had also appealed for summer workers but they have withdrawn their advert after many of their temporary staff were laid off from non-essential work in quarries and forestry operations .
Managing director Graham Bruce said : " Things have changed significantly since last week and we now have a big workforce available and no work for them .
