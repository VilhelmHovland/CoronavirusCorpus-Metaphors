The U .
Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) approved a waiver to allow all Oklahoma students statewide two free meals a day amid the ongoing coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister announced Monday .
OSDE applied for the waiver on March 11 and March 25 in order to remove the requirement that school feeding sites be in high-need areas .
Before the approved waiver , districts could only provide free meals only if 50% of students at a school met the eligibility for free and reduced lunch , according to the Oklahoma State Department of Education .
" Amid such uncertainty and instability , we should not be asking our families or schools to worry over needless red tape , " Hofmeister said .
" This waiver means that , following a simple application , any district in the state can establish feeding sites for up to two free meals a day for every student who needs one .
