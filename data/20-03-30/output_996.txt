Audiences first fell in love with Sandra Oh in Grey 's Anatomy .
Thanks to the success of Killing Eve , her fanbase has grown and more accolades have come rolling in ( hello , Golden Globe ) .
Despite the high-pressure entertainment industry that sometimes stifled her greatness , she 's given " fewer f*cks " ( her words ) as she 's aged .
The actress , now 48 , feels even more confident than she did in her 20s .
" Aging is the greatest , " Sandra told InStyle .
With it 's come even more professional success ( but you already knew that ) and focus on self-love ( which you might have not ) .
For Sandra , beauty is twofold : mental and physical , per The New Potato .
The mental stuff -- or , being a compassionate person -- is something you 'll have to take up on your own .
But , you can adopt the other half of her beauty routine .

" Growing up and until my gosh , early-mid 30s , I had terrible , terrible skin , " Sandra told TNP .
" It made me feel ugly and insecure .
" She was dealing with eczema , asthma , and allergies that caused inflammation all over her face .
After her skin started affecting her routine on Grey 's Anatomy , Sandra turned to an acupuncturist who she still sees today .
" She changed my life , " Sandra added .
" This was not an overnight thing .
I saw her regularly -- sometimes twice a week -- for two years .
After four years , my whole being felt better , from the inside to out .
No creams , no inhalers but from a cellular level , my insides have changed , and it 's reflected on my skin .

" In the evening before bed , I 'll clean off my makeup with Neutrogena eye makeup remover ( non-oil ) then clean with Clarisonic and a gentle cleanser , " she told TNP .
Makeup remover does the work of breaking down the layer of product her face , while her second cleanser will kick out the dirt and gunk that 's built up in her pores throughout the day .
The Clarisonic exfoliator is n't a daily must , but it is an effective tool since it has the power to remove dead skin cells from the top layer of your skin , brighten your complexion , and help your other products " penetrate deeper into your skin , " Women 's Healthpreviously reported .
She adds a serum ( or four ! ) into the mix .

But they 're actually quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients than moisturizers and creams , for example , " Joel Schlessinger , MD , board-certified dermatologist and RealSelf advisor previously told Women 's Health .
The wide range of serums out there are formulated to treat a ton of skin concerns including wrinkles , dark spots , and acne .
She does LED light therapy , too .
Sandra will back up her serum-loaded regimen with LightStim -- a light therapy system used to treat the skin .

" And according to the experts , she 's right .
