In this time of global crisis , the world turns to its farming community , as it has done throughout history .
Both world wars and the Covid-19 pandemic have put huge strain on the economy and the social behaviours of the UK population .
The constants in both are first class medics and an efficient and adaptable agricultural industry .
On March 11 Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his first budget .
Contained within his speech were various measures which support farming , namely the increased agricultural buildings allowance up from 2% to 3% and the exemption from the removal of tax relief on Red Diesel .
With regards to staffing , the increased national insurance levels and additional ? 1,000 employer allowance will both help mitigate rising staff costs .
Fast forward three weeks and the budget is a distant memory , and Covid-19 's grip on the country is tightening .
While agricultural businesses are better placed than most to ride out the financial storm , there is support out there .
The various mechanisms offered by the government may look like they do n't apply to agriculture but for those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worthwhile .
Farmers with borrowing on variable rate loans will have seen indirect support with the historic cutting of interest rates by the Bank of England to 0 .
The ability to defer VAT payments due between March 20 and June 20 for business that have storage income or do farming contracting will assist cashflow further .
Self-assessment tax liabilities due in July 2020 can now be deferred until January 2021 .
The government have announced their plans for supporting all self-employed businesses , giving all farming partners who earn under ? 50,000 a year the ability to claim a taxable grant equal to 80% of the farms ' three years averaged taxable profits , payable for three months up to a maximum of ? 2,500 per month .
This scheme will be administered by HMRC who will contact businesses in June based on eligibility .
While at the time of writing the finer detail of the scheme and the eligibility criteria have not yet been released , it is our view that businesses may be asked to prove that Covid-19 has had a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area effected by Covid-19 should be aware that the government is supporting them through the Job Retention Scheme .
The scheme gives businesses the ability to furlough full-time or part-time employees who were on the payroll as at February 28 2020 .
It also covers those on flexible zero-hour contracts .
Furlough lasts for a minimum three-week period .
Farming businesses should seek HR or legal advice prior to progressing with a furlough claim .
With regards to calculating the claim , HMRC will send a grant to cover 80% of an employee 's regular wage subject to a maximum cap of ? 2,500 per month for an initial three-month period .
For those farming businesses that rely on tourism this may be enough to keep good staff during this period .
The Scottish Government have set out a ? 10,000 grant for businesses who receive the small business bonus or Rural Rates relief .
Therefore farmers who have non-agricultural activity on farm should check their businesses rateable values to see if they qualify .
Scottish farmers continue to play a vital role in keeping the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country only goes to show how much farmers are needed .
Given that public opinion generally took the industry for granted , perhaps public perception may be altered in future .
