When my beloved husband died , my friends were so helpful in supporting me .
I 'm not talking about just being comforting , bringing meals and inviting me to gatherings .
They were so helpful in sharing their experiences and letting me know about what I may expect coming up , and even in years to come .
For instance , I was talking to a dear friend a couple years after Baheej died and I told her how the grief was still with me .
She lost her husband ten years earlier when they were in their 50s .
She reassured me that she still had such feelings of grief and sadness even a decade later .
She said waves of grief come uninvited , taking you by surprise .
So that helped me understand what I may be in for in the long term .
And I started thinking about the implications of what I now call long-term grief , even though I did n't start writing about it for another three years .
A different dear friend alerted me about many practical problems one must handle after a death -- forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Of course , I had already been doing lots of that but she warned me it goes on for years .
For instance , you will get mail , emails and telephone calls for the spouse who died for years .
I still do !  So I was more prepared not to get all ruffled every time this happens .
I found that once a street address or email address is out there in cyberspace , there is almost no way to stop it .
No-call phone lists do n't seem to work .
So now I do n't get bent out of shape every time it occurs .
It 's annoying when the caller asks , " Can I speak to Baheej , " but I just hang up .
You ca n't get upset at every annoyance .
Even my banker friend advised me to keep Baheej 's name on one of the checking accounts because I would be getting checks in his name for years and will need some place to deposit them .
So true .
I received one recently , seven years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can help you with both emotional and practical matters .
Death and grief are so very complicated .
Of course , many parties , lunches and interest groups where we normally see our friends have been canceled because of coronavirus precautions .
So we do n't see as much of our friends these days .
But there is the phone and email .
I am using a lot of talk time and screen time with friends !  One of the problems in grief is wishing .
Be on guard because this happens often , and it is more tempting when one is home alone often .
I wish my dear Baheej could know and play with my sweet kitties .
He would enjoy them , even though he was raised in a traditional culture where cats were not allowed in the house .
He would love to have them sitting in his lap or cuddling next to him purring .
I often wish Baheej could enjoy the meal I am eating , especially when it is one of his favorites .
Or see the pretty sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these thoughts often hurt .
Wishing is another area where you need to put up your self-defenses .
We can only take so much .
I even get these wishful feelings when I go out to get the mail , because it reminds me of how he loved getting mail and how he checked it every single day .
I have photos of Baheej smiling by the mailbox .
The point is : If you are talking one-on-one with a friend who has had a great loss , whether a spouse , a parent or good friend , ask her or him for advice .
In most cases , they will be glad to talk to you about grief and share experiences and ideas .
You have to ask because most people wo n't bring the subject of death up in regular conversation .
I learned a lot by doing this .
And it helped .
