NFDC -- Look after your mental health  By Steve **31;740;TOOLONG  The United Kingdom 's National Federation of Demolition Contractors has stepped up its Coronavirus-related communications to members , including guidance on maintaining good mental health during the outbreak .
NFDC president Holly Price contacted members to outline the federation support that would be available during the Coronavirus  " Keeping calm amongst the chaos " -- which follows a letter from NFDC president Holly Price to members outlining federation support at this time -- is a five-point document on how demolition workers and their families can cope with the uncertainty that Coronavirus brings , and is part of a range of resources made available in recent days .
It advises maintaining physical distance but avoiding social isolation ; limiting time spent on news programmes ( and being wary of fake news being shared online ) ; creating a new routine ; focusing on what you can control rather than what you ca n't ; staying active ; and seeking help when you need it .
" The coming weeks and months will be difficult , and no one can say for certain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal , " said the NFDC .
" However , if we take good care of ourselves and look out for others we may emerge from the crisis with more resilience and greater mental wellbeing .
"  Other help available covers a mix of personal and professional and includes tips for remote working and home-schooling children as well as a letter of support for contractors to use as part of their communications with clients , information on the latest Construction Leadership Council Site Operating Procedures , and advice on training during COVID-19 .
