STEPS AT CITY HALL .
LET 'S LISTEN .
BYE , DR .
REX ARCHER OUR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH .
COUNCILMAN KEVIN O'NEILL .
IT 'S GOOD TO SEE YOU IN .
ERICA CARNEY OF OUR EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES .
WE 'VE HAD A FEW QUESTIONS AND RECENT DAYS ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS .
I WILL START WITH THE FIRST WHICH RELATES TO PARKS PARK SPACE WHAT FOLKS HAVE BEEN DOING AS YOU ALL KNOW OUR PARKS REMAIN OPEN IN KANSAS CITY AND WE ENCOURAGE IF YOU ARE AT OUR PARKS TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AMONG OTHER ITEMS , BUT THIS WEEKEND AND WE DID SEE SOME CONCERNS RIGHT FOLKS PLAYING ON BASKETBALL COURT SPOKES PLAYING ON PLAYGROUND EQUIPMENT TO ADDRESS THAT THE CITY HAS PUT UP CAUTION TAPE ON A NUMBER OF PLAYGROUNDS AND IN TERMS OF HOW WE ENFORCE FURTHER THE KANSAS CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT WILL BE INCREASING PATROLS IN OUR PARKS .
WE ALSO ENCOURAGE FOLKS IF YOU HAVE HEARD ABOUT HOUSE PARTIES OR ANY OTHER TYPES OF EVENTS THAT SEEM TO EXCEED THE 10-PERSON LIMIT TO CALL THE THREE ONE ONE LINE .
SO CALL 3-1-1 YOU 'LL BE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEPARTMENT WILL BE DOING FOLLOW-UP IN TERMS OF IF YOUR NEIGHBOR HAS BEEN THROWING LARGE HOUSE PARTIES OR IF THERE 'S BEEN SOME BUSINESS THAT HAS NOT BEEN FOLLOWING THE PROPER RULES AND REGULATIONS CALL .
3-1-1 WILL HAVE A KCPD COMMUNITY INTERACTION OFFICER OUT TO INVESTIGATE THEREAFTER AND THEPD PATROLS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY FEW OTHER NOTES THAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS FOR YOU YESTERDAY WE CERTAINLY HEARTENED TO HEAR THE PRESIDENT TOOK THE ADVICE OF MEDICAL EXPERTS AND OTHERS THAT THIS CRISIS WILL LAST LONGER THAN BEYOND EASTER SUNDAY , BUT WILL GO TO APRIL THE 30TH AT THIS TIME , KANSAS CITY IS NOT EXTENDING ITS EMERGENCY ORDER .
HOWEVER , WE WOULD NOTE AS WE DO CONSISTENTLY .
I TALKED TO OUR HEALTH DIRECTOR .
I TALKED TO OUR DIRECTOR OF EMS TO REVIEW HOW LONG OUR ORDER WILL NEED TO STAY IN EFFECT .
MY BELIEF IS LIKELY THAT IT WILL GO THROUGH APRIL 30TH .
AND I THINK THE REASON THAT WE 'RE NOT SAYING AND END DATE YET NECESSARILY AN EXTENDED END DATE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THINK THAT THERE IS A MAGIC DATE THAT COMES AND EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO NORMAL THE REAL STANDARD FOR WHEN THINGS GO BACK TO NORMAL AND AT LEAST THE DIRECTION THAT WE 'RE GETTING FROM OUR HEALTH DIRECTOR AND OTHERS IS THIS ONE WHEN CASES ARE NO LONGER SPREADING WIDELY IN THIS COMMUNITY .
THAT WOULD MEAN THAT NOT ONLY THE RATE OF NEW CASES IS FALLING .
BUT THERE ARE FEWER UNLINKED CASES RIGHT NOW .
WE STILL GET A NUMBER OF CASES THAT HAPPEN .
THEY SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT RANDOM IN SOME WAY .
WE DO N'T ALWAYS KNOW THE TYPE OF TRANSMISSION .
SO WE WANT TO SEE THE NEW CASE RATE NOT JUST FLAT LINING , BUT ALSO FOLLOWING FALLING BEFORE WE CHANGE WE ALSO WOULD NOTE THAT ANOTHER FACTOR OF WHEN THINGS CHANGE IS WHEN THE LOCAL HEALTH SYSTEM ITSELF IS STRONGER AND WHAT WE MEAN BY THAT IS THAT IT 'S CLEAR THAT WE CAN HANDLE A SUSTAINED LEVEL OF FOLKS WHO ARE COMING .
CARE NOT JUST RELATING TO COVID-19 .
BUT ALSO THE MANY OTHER HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT OUR COMMUNITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS THE TIME AT WHICH WE ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH TESTING IN THIS COMMUNITY .
AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAY OR THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY GOVERNORS AND OTHERS CONTINUE TO ASK A GREAT DEAL ABOUT IS WHEN WILL WE HAVE ADEQUATE TESTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 'RE ACTUALLY GETTING A GOOD SNAPSHOT ON THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS AND CASES FRANKLY IF WE KNOW WHAT THE LEVEL OF COMMUNITY SPREAD IS WHERE SPREADING AND WE CAN ACTUALLY HAVE BETTER ANSWERS UNTIL WE ACTUALLY HAVE THOSE ELEMENTS MEANT I WOULD EXPECT US TO CONTINUE TO LOOK TO A LOT OF ARE THE STEPS THAT WE 'VE TAKEN NOW TO CONTINUE .
I INCLUDE IN THAT OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING BUSINESS CLOSURES ETC A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS HAVE COME TO US DIFFERENT TIMES 1 IS ABOUT INCONSISTENCY IN TERMS OF ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES VERSUS NON .
I 'VE GOT A VERY SIMPLE RULE OF THUMB THAT USUALLY HAS GUIDED ME .
WHEN WE 'VE BEEN ASKED QUESTIONS IN MY OFFICE WHEN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT 'S BEEN ASKED TO OTHERS WHICH IS IF YOU HAVE TO ASK WHETHER YOUR BUSINESS IS ESSENTIAL OR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POINT .
IS THIS A CENTRAL DOES NOT MEAN VALUABLE .
I KNOW THAT EVERYONE 'S BUSINESS EVERYONE 'S WAY OF LIFE IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT .
ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES REALLY SPEAK TO THOSE BUSINESSES THAT KEEP OUR COMMUNITIES OPEN RIGHT THAT ARE ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF FOLKS HELPING BOTH COMMUNITIES SURVIVE AND PEOPLE SURVIVE REALLY GOING TO THAT LEVEL IS THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS IT OVER RECENT DAYS .
THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS ISSUED .
HUNDRED LETTERS ALREADY THAT IS 202 BUSINESSES THAT NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE ORDER .
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUSINESSES THAT NEED TO COMPLY LARGELY NEED TO SHUT DOWN .
AND SO WE HAVE THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ACTING I THINK IMPRESSIVELY BECAUSE THEY 'RE HANDLING A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES NOW AND CONNECTION WITH THIS CRISIS BUT TO MAKE SURE THOSE BUSINESSES ARE TAKING HEAT OF THE ORDERS IN OUR COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW ONE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD NOTE AND I NOTED THIS THIS OVER THE WEEKEND , IT 'S NOT LOST ON ME .
OUR NEIGHBORS IN KANSAS HAVE ISSUED A STATEWIDE ORDER .
I CONTINUED TO WISH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOUGH OUR KANSAS CITY AREA COUNTIES ARE SUBJECT TO THAT ORDER .
WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY SPREAD AND IT DOES N'T STOP AT THE JACKSON COUNTY LINE .
IT DOES N'T STOP AT THE CASS COUNTY LINE .
WHAT WE NEED IS ACTUALLY A CONCERTED EFFORT .
I THINK THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MISSOURI .
WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT TO THE GOVERNOR .
I KNOW THE HEALTH DIRECTOR A HIS PEERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF , MISSOURI .
FRANKLY AS PEERS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE TALKED ABOUT STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS THEIR LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE AND WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THAT 'S GOING TO BE KEY FOR US IN ADDITION PROVIDING MORE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IMPORTANTLY NOT JUST FOR HEALTH WORKERS FIRST RESPONDERS , BUT ALSO FRANKLY FOR THOSE IN GROCERY STORES THOSE WHO ARE DEALING WITH THE PUBLIC AT A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT RIGHT NOW .
WE DO N'T HAVE ENOUGH MASKS .
WE DO N'T AVE ENOUGH .
TAXI PROTECT A NUMBER THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPACTED .
I 'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS THAT ARE LISTED FOR ME THEN I 'LL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE HAVING CONCERNS AT THIS TIME .
WHO CAN YOU CALL WE 'VE SET UP A SPECIAL LINE AT CASEY BIZ CARE .
YOU CAN CALL EIGHT ONE SIX 5 1 3 1 1 2 0 THAT 'S 5 1 3 1 1 2 0 AND CONNECTION WITH RESOURCES .
YOU MAY NEED TO YOUR BUSINESS OPEN TO MAKE SURE THE BUSINESS .
SELF IS SURVIVING .
WE HAVE ANNOUNCED AND PASSED IT CITY COUNCIL A SMALL BUSINESS EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND WE EXPECT TO ANNOUNCE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND ON TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY OF THIS WEEK .
WE WILL FIRST LOOK TO BE PROVIDING LOANS TO SMALL LOCAL BUSINESSES .
THAT WILL BE KANSAS CITY , MISSOURI BUSINESSES WITH 20 OR LESS EMPLOYEES .
SO 20 OR FEWER EMPLOYEES AND WE 'LL LOOK TO ADDRESS BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS ORDER WILL ANNOUNCE MORE DETAILS ON THAT .
GRAHAM MIDWEEK , WE WOULD LOOK TO HAVE THAT FUND ITSELF SET UP AND READY TO HELP PEOPLE NEXT WEEK A FEW REMINDERS FOR INDIVIDUALS BUS SERVICE REMAIN RUNNING IN KANSAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WORK ESSENTIAL JOBS OR THIS IS THEIR ONLY WAY TO GET FOOD HEALTH CARE ETC .
SO WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT TERMS OF ZERO FAIR TRANSIT , ALTHOUGH THE CITY COUNCIL HAS PASSED FUNDING TO HELP SUPPORT THAT WE HAD NOT PLANNED PREVIOUSLY A ROLL OUT UNTIL THE 1ST OF JUNE TH MIGHT BE EVEN LATER THIS YEAR .
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A NUMBER OF ROOTS THE PROSPECT MAX CORRIDOR .
FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THERE ARE NO AFFAIRS REQUIRED BUT OUR BUS SERVICE CONTINUES IN KANSAS CITY AND WE WILL EXPECT IT CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS AS YOU WOULD NOTE .
WE ALSO HAVE UTILITIES THAT HAVE SUSPENDED SHUT OFFS BOTH CASEY WATER AT THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY MANAGER , BUT ALSO A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER UTILITIES HAVE AGREED TO WORK WITH THAT AND THEN RENT PAYMENTS IN TERMS OF RENT .
YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY BUT THERE WO N'T BE EVICTIONS IN ANY OF OUR KANSAS CITY AREA .
COUNTIES AT LEAST IN WHICH KANSAS CITY SITS ? WELL NOTE OTHERS ACTUALLY OFTEN CALL OUR OFFICE IN CONNECTION WITH UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND QUESTIONS IF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO TO KC MO DOT-GOV / CORONAVIRUS .
SO A FEW OTHER REMINDERS THAT I WANT TO NOTE AND THEN I 'LL GET OUT OF THE WAY .
ANY QUESTIONS ARE THIS CALL 3-1-1 FOR MOST OF YOUR NEEDS RIGHT NOW , IF YOU THINK THAT THERE 'S SOMEONE DOWN THE STREET WHO HAS NOT BEEN COMPLYING WITH THE ORDERS IF THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE HAVING LARGE HOUSE PARTIES THAT WE 'VE HEARD ABOUT BUSINESSES THAT ARE N'T IN COMPLIANCE .
YOU CAN CALL 3-1-1 YOU SHOULD ASK FOR A COMMUNITY INTERACTION OFFICER FROM THE KANSAS CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT .
WE HAVE THEM IN EACH OF OUR PATROL DIVISIONS .
THEY WILL GO OUT AND INVESTIGATE AFTER THE CALLS HAVE BEEN MADE .
WE 'VE ENHANCED OUR PATROLS IN THE PARKS AS WELL TO MAKE WITH THAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLYING WITH THE ORDERS .
WE ALSO NOTE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY IMMEDIATE HEALTH RISK RELATED QUESTIONS , YOU CAN CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT 'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH DIVISION AT EIGHT ONE SIX FIVE ONE THREE , SIX THREE ONE FIVE AGAIN .
THAT 'S FIVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EMERGENCY QUESTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ETC AND THEN MY LAST AREA AND THEN I 'LL STOP FOR ANY QUESTIONS AND THE DOCTORS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS AS WELL A NUMBER OF HAVE REACHED OUT TO US TO ASK WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR ? THE HOMELESS POPULATION ? WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MAKE SURE WE 'RE PREPARED IF THERE IS AN OUTBREAK AND ARE ON HOUSED COMMUNITY A FEW DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE 'RE EXPLORING NOW THE CITY HAS ALREADY SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT HOTELS APARTMENT ENTITIES AND OTHERS TO HELP CREATE A SITUATION FOR TEMPORARY HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY .
WE 'VE BEEN WORKING WITH REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR HOMELESSNESS IN OUR REGION TO WORK NOT JUST IN , KANSAS CITY , MISSOURI .
ACROSS STATE LINES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WILL HAVE POPULATIONS ABLE TO HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE IF THEY 'RE ACTUALLY RELATED WAITING FOR TEST RESULTS IF THEY 'RE SUBJECT TO QUARANTINE .
AND SO WE 'RE WORKING ON THAT .
WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL BE NEEDING THAT AS WELL .
WE 'RE PROUD TO WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS , LIKE RESTART HOPE AND FAITH MINISTRIES THE SALVATION ARMY AND OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 'RE READY .
WHEN AND IF THERE IS AN OUTBREAK IN THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY AND AS YOU MAY KNOW KANSAS CITY , MISSOURI ITSELF APPROVED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF FUNDING RECENTLY FOR RESTART AS PART OF THAT .
WE ARE NOW ASKING THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY 'RE TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CREATING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO MAY BE SUBJECT TO QUARANTINE AS WE GO THROUGH WITH THAT ALL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE .
PEOPLE W ARE HAVING HOUSE PARTIES .
I DO N'T BELIEVE IT 'S ORWELLIAN AT ALL .
IT 'S A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE .
I AM A LAWYER BY THE WAY , AND WE 'RE LOCAL GOVERNMENT POWERS AT ITS GREATEST IS WHEN YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT POLICE POWERS TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE AND HEALTHY THE HEALTH DIRECTOR HAS EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE STAY SAFE LARGELY EVERYTHING .
THAT I 'M DOING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
AND AND HERE 'S THE DEAL .
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE ANYONE 'S NORMAL WAY OF LIFE .
THERE WERE OTHER CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE ISSUED CURFEWS .
WE HAVE NOT TAKEN THAT STEP .
THERE ARE OTHER CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE DONE FAR MORE EXTREME STEPS INCLUDING EVEN IN THIS METRO WHERE YOU HAVE THE OLICE ACTUALLY ENFORCING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ORDERS WEAVE .
AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 'RE BEING DEFERENTIAL AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO THE PUBLIC , BUT ONE THING THAT WE WILL BE SURE OF IS SOME OF THE VERY COMMUNITY SPREAD CONCERNS THAT WE 'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS DO N'T OCCUR .
AND SO , YOU KNOW , IT DISAPPOINTS ME WHEN THIS WEEKEND .
I WAS IN SWOPE PARK AND SAW THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY , YOU KNOW , 50 KIDS AROUND A BASKETBALL GAME THE KIDS THAT ARE PLAYING AND THEN THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE STANDING AROUND AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT 'S WARM OUTSIDE .
THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO DO BUT THERE 'S A REASON THAT WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S KEEP THEIR PARENTS THEIR GRANDPARENTS AND SO MANY OTHERS SAFE .
I DO N'T THINK IT 'S ORWELLIAN IN THE SLIGHTEST INSTEAD .
I THINK WE FOLLOWED AND GONE THROUGH EXTENSIVE STUDY IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER CITIES IN OUR METRO CITIES IN THE MIDWEST AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO MAKE SURE WE 'RE FOLLOWING ORDERS THAT A ARE CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL BUT ALSO ONES THAT ARE NARROWLY TAILORED TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SAFETY A LIE .
YEAH , IN TERMS OF COMPLIANCE , I THINK BY AND LARGE I 'VE SEEN THAT MOST KANSAS CITY AND ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE ORDERS AND I THINK THERE ARE FEW WAYS .
YOU CAN SEE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE RARE IS IT THAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO HAVE A PRESS CONFERENCE HERE AND YOU SEE ALMOST NO CARS GO DOWN 12TH STREET DURING OUR ENTIRE CONVERSATION .
I 'VE BEEN PROUD OF KANSAS CITY BUSINESSES AND BUSINESSES FROM THROUGHOUT OUR REGION THAT I THINK HAVE COMPLIED WITH ORDERS RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE INDEED .
THAT 'S WHY WE WORK SO HARD TO PASS OUR SMALL BUSINESS EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND AS QUICKLY AS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT SAID THAT WE 'RE GOING TO DO OUR PART TO MAKE SURE WE 'RE CLOSING DOWN SO RESTAURANTS BARBERSHOPS , SO THE OTHERS THAT ARE FOLLOWING THESE ORDERS AND AND YOU KNOW , I THINK WE HEAR ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONS AND SOMETIMES THE BAD ACTORS , BUT I 'VE BEEN VERY PROUD AND I WOULD SAY , YOU KNOW , 90% OF KANSAS CITY BUSINESSES , AND I KNOW JUST FROM MY INTERACTIONS AND WHAT I SEE ONLINE , I 'M NOT GOING TO THESE BUSINESSES , BUT WHAT I HEAR IS THAT EVERYBODY IS LARGELY COMPLYING WITH THESE ORDERS AND I THINK THEY 'RE DOING IT KEEP COMMUNITIES SAFE .
YOU KNOW , I DO N'T I WOULD N'T SAY DISAPPOINTMENT .
THE GOVERNOR 'S GOT A BIG JOB , AND I 'M NOT THE GOVERNOR OF MISSOURI , BUT I CERTAINLY THINK THAT MISSOURI WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH A STATEWIDE STAY AT HOME OR WE 'VE SEEN TRAGIC DEATHS NOW IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COUNTIES , NOT JUST IN JACKSON , ST .
LOUIS COUNTY AND ST .
LOUIS CITY AND HAD A DEATH YESTERDAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONTINUE TO SEE SPREAD AND THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS THIS IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE VIRUS HAS IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AT DIFFERENT POINTS , RIGHT A FEW WEEKS AGO .
WE DID N'T SEE THE HUGE OUTBREAK THAT WE 'RE SEEING FOR EXAMPLE NOW IN NEW ORLEANS , I HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN NOT JUST FOR KANSAS CITY WHERE I MAYOR BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF MISSOURI THAT IF WE DO N'T TAKE THESE AGGRESSIVE STEPS NOW YOU WILL SEE THAT SORT OF ACT IN COMMUNITIES LARGE AND SMALL THROUGHOUT MISSOURI , AND I KNOW MUCH OF THE ANSWER THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS HAD OVER TIME HAS BEEN THAT WELL , YOU KNOW PLACES IN THE STATE ARE DIFFERENT , KANSAS CITY 'S DIFFERENT THAN POPLAR BLUFF , BUT FRANKLY , I THINK KANSAS ANSWERS THAT POINT TO OVERLAND PARK IS DIFFERENT THAN GOODLAND , KANSAS OR COLBY BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE SEE THAT THERE IS SOME NEED FOR CONSISTENT RULES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE 'S AND SO I WOULD ARGUE RIGHT NOW THAT I THINK IT IS EIGHT IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO THE GOVERNOR AND I SEE THAT THINGS HAVE CHANGED THROUGHOUT THIS CRISIS AND I HOPE THEY WILL RE-EVALUATE .
I KNOW THEY HAVE A DAILY PRESS CONFERENCE .
AND SO I HOP THEY TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY .
YOU KNOW , I THINK RIGHT NOW .
HE HAS A VIEW THAT THE STATE IS DIFFERENT IN HIS DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THIS IN DIFFERENT WAYS , AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT WILL BE HIS VIEW .
I GUESS .
MY GREATEST CONCERN IS KEEPING KANSAS CITY AND SAFE .
I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT SOMEBODY WHO DRIVES INTO KANSAS CITY FROM AN HOUR AND A HALF OR TWO HOURS AWAY , RIGHT AND SOME PEOPLE JUST COME IN FOR WORK FOR EXAMPLE TO DO THAT SORT OF STUFF A LOT OF OUR CONSTRUCTION SITES .
FOR EXAMPLE , THE KCI AIRPORT WERE DRAWING ON A WORKFORCE .
THAT IS NOT JUST FROM KANSAS CITY , MISSOURI INDEED ONLY 3% OF IT WAS FRO FROM KANSAS CITY A FEW MONTHS AGO .
AND SO FOR I THINK THE SIGN IS THAT THIS VIRUS IS FLUID .
JUST LIKE HUMANS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SURE THAT EVERY STEP THAT WE CAN POSSIBLY TAKE TO LIMIT COMMUNITY SPREAD WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ONE .
WELL , YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CITY MANAGER OUT HERE AND I KNOW HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THEY 'RE MORE RESPONSIVE .
WE HAVE AN ASSISTANT TO THE CITY MANAGER GENE LAWSON WHO HAS BEEN IN IMPORTANT MEETING ABOUT THIS .
AND SO I 'M CONFIDENT THE THREE ONE ONE IS READY AND ABLE TO HANDLE THE VOLUME OF CALLS THAT WERE RECEIVING IN CONNECTION WITH CORONAVIRUS AND THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 .
YOU KNOW , I I THINK THE CITY AND OUR CITY WORKERS ARE DOING AN IMPRESSIVE AND FRANKLY OUTSTANDING WORK RIGHT NOW AND TRYING TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE 'VE HAD DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PHASE AND SO I 'D BE CONFIDENT DIRECTING ANYONE TO CALL 3-1-1 NOW TO TO HAVE THE ANSWERS THAT THEY I MEAN THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS IF YOU 'RE IF YOU 'RE HAVING DIFFERENT ISSUES , DO N'T CALL 9-1-1 RIGHT CALL 3-1-1 IN CONNECTION WITH THAT HOUSE PARTY CALL 3-1-1 WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE MAKING SURE THAT OUR PSTAFF IS READY TO HANDLE IT AND I 'M CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL BE IN SUCH A POSITION .
YEAH .
YOU KNOW , I THINK THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FLATTENING THE CURVE SOCIAL DISTANCING FOLLOWING A LOT OF THE ORDERS THAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW ARE THE WAY THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THIS AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT .
BUT YOU KNOW , I 'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE PEOPLE OF KANSAS CITY .
I SAW SOME GRADE THE OTHER DAY .
SASSY , I GUESS I 'M A LIGHTER GREATER AND I WOULD GIVE US A SOLID B RIGHT NOW .
I MEAN , I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME AREAS , THERE ARE STILL CROWDS THAT BUILD UP I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT DIMINISH .
I ACTUALLY DROVE BY A BAR WHERE THE PATIO WAS STILL SEEMINGLY OPEN YESTERDAY THAT 'S LESS THAN IDEAL .
AND I KNOW THAT WE 'RE SOCIAL ANIMALS , BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 'RE ACTUALLY ADHERING TO THESE ORDERS BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT WERE MAINTAINING SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WE 'RE FOLLOWING THE ORDERS AND I DO N'T BRING UP NEW ORLEANS ACCIDENTALLY .
I MEAN IT 'S A HUGE TOURIST TOWN , BUT THE AMAZING THING IS THAT METRO AREA IS I THINK A LITTLE SMALLER THAN ARMS AND TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF CASES RIGHT NOW IS OVERLOADING THEIR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM .
IT 'S OVERLOADING BASIC SERVICES .
IT 'S HAVING THIS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON LOTS OF THINGS WHAT I DO .
NOT WANT TO SEE IS THE SAME SITUATION IN KANSAS CITY AND SO IN SOME WAYS WE MAY BE LUCKY .
WE 'RE WE 'RE GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED AND THAT WE DID N'T SEE THE HUGE EARLY SPIKE .
BUT ALL OF THESE STEPS WERE TAKING NOW ARE VITAL AND I MEAN THAT EVEN ON THE WORLD 'S MOST BEAUTIFUL DAY , RIGHT ? EVERYBODY 'S GOING TO BE ENCOURAGED TO GO TO THE SAME SPACE , BUT DO N'T WRITE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO GET SOMEWHERE ELSE TRY TO FIND A WAY TO NOT VIOLATE A LOT OF OUR SOCIAL DISTANCING RULES AND I WILL SAY THIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND OTHERS , YOU KNOW , I 'D ASK PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THEY 'RE MAINTAINING SPACE THERE .
WE DO HEAR ANECDOTALLY LOTS OF REPORTS OF HOW CROWDED THEIR STORES CAN GET OR LINES CAN GET EVEN IF THE STORE HAS N'T PUT DOWN SPACES FOR YOU .
IT 'S LIKE A TUMBLEWEED TIME FOR US BY THE WAY , BUT EVEN IF STORES HAVE N'T PUT DOWN THAT SORT OF SPACE FOR YOU JUST MAKE SURE YOU 'RE MAINTAINING IT YOURSELF BECAUSE THAT 'S I THINK THE MUCH BETTER WAY FOR US TO ADDRESS IT LONG TERM .
SO , YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I 'VE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY I 'LL MAKE WAY FOR DR .
REX ARCHER ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU .
THANK YOU MAYOR .
WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL LABS ARE STILL WAY TOO LATE IN GETTING THEIR SAMPLES BACK AND THE COST IN SOME CASES IS 300 OR MORE DOLLARS PER TEST .
SO WE ARE EVALUATING THAT ISSUE THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS IS YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE DISEASE DETECTIVES TO BE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FALL UP AND WE 'RE IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING 10 POSITIONS , AND WE DO KNOW THAT WE 'RE BEGINNING MONEY COMING DOWN FROM SEED .
SEEDS OF THE STATE THAT WILL HELP SUPPORT THOSE POSITIONS .
SO WE 'RE GEARING UP FOR THIS BUT WE 'RE NOT THE SUPPORT AND FOLLOW UP WHAT THE MAYOR WAS SAYING ? EVERYBODY HAS RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE CITY .
TO BE HELPING US WITH THIS BECAUSE WE 'RE DAMAGING SOME BUSINESSES THROUGH THIS ACTION RIGHT NOW , AND IF PEOPLE DO N'T COMPLY ON THE VOLUNTARY SIDE AND ALL THESE OTHER SETTINGS THAT WE CA N'T REMOVE THIS AS SOON AS WE 'D LIKE TO SO EVERYBODY NEEDS TO BE ENFORCING .
THIS IS THE SAME THING WITH SMOKING RIGHT NOW PEOPLE SELF ENFORCE THAT .
WE DO N'T HAVE TO GO OUT AND TELL PEOPLE NOT TO SMOKE IN THESE VARIOUS PLACES PEOPLE LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SELF AND OR SO WE 'RE ASKING PEER PRESSURE NOW DO N'T DO IT VIOLENTLY , BUT JUST ASK PEOPLE TO BE PRACTICING THESE SOCIAL DISTANCING COMPONENTS BECAUSE THAT 'S A CRITICAL PART @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOVERNOR WILL SUPPORT US THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT 'S THAT NINE OF US THAT COVER BASICALLY HALF OF THE POPULATION HAS SUBMITTD A COUPLE LETTERS NOW TO THE GOVERNOR REQUESTING MISSOURI HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THE MISSOURI OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS GROUP NURSES GROUP .
WE 'VE ALL COME TOGETHER ON LETTERS ASKING THE GOVERNOR TO TAKE THIS STAND BECAUSE IF WE IN KANSAS CITY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING .
BUT OTHERS THEN ARE N'T THEY CAN COME TO OUR HOSPITALS AND TAKE UP OUR SURGE CAPACITY .
SO WE NEED TO DO THIS STATEWIDE .
FRUSTRATED I AM I AM DISAPPOINTED .
THAT HE HAS N'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS YET .
I KNOW HE 'S GOT A LOT .
OF OTHER PRESSURES AS WE ALL KNOW WHENEVER YOU PUT FORTH A NEW REGULATION OR LAW OR SUGGESTION IF THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS ARE N'T ALREADY UNDERSTANDING IT WILLING TO COMPLY IT BECOMES A CHALLENGE AND IN SOME OF OUR LARRY HAS RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE N'T SEEN THE DEATH TOLL THEY HAVE N'T SEEN THE NUMBER OF CASES .
SO I MEAN I UNDERSTAND PART OF WHY HE 'S STRUGGLING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHERE THE PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PULLING THIS BACK AFTER 15 DAYS PROBABLY HAD A FACTOR IN THE FACT THAT THAT 'S BEEN EXTENDED SHOULD HELP US .
SO WE JUST HOPE THAT EVERYBODY WILL HELP THE GOVERNOR KNOW THAT HE 'S GOT THE SUPPORT FROM THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE RIGHT .
CARNEY DO ANYTHING TO DR .
CARTER .
HE 'S OUR DIRECTOR .
THANK YOU MAYOR .
THANK YOU .
ARCHER .
I AGREE AND SUPPORT BOTH OF THE STATEMENTS MADE BY BOTH MAORI .
AND DR .
ARCHER ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE AS THE REGION A MEDICAL DIRECTOR .
I 'M PROUD OF OUR REGION EVERY MAJOR HOSPITAL IN AGENCY COMES TOGETHER ALMOST DAILY DAILY TO DISCUSS WHAT OUR CAPACITY IS .
WHAT OUR RESPONSE IS AS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WORKING IN IN THIS RIGHT NOW ? I CAN TELL YOU GUYS THAT IT IS HERE AND THE DIRECTION GIVEN BY DR .
ARCHER IN THE MAYOR BOTH APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY .
SO OUR REGION IS LISTENING A DOING THE RIGHT THING .
IT 'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION .
SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RESOURCE THAT WE UTILIZE HERE IN THE TO LOOK AT .
YOU BEDS VENTILATORS .
IT IS SLOWLY BEING ADAPTED TO LOOK AT COVID RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY THE GOOD NEWS OVERALL IS IN HOSPITALS ACROSS THE BOARD .
THE CENSUS IS LOW , WHICH MEANS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE MAYOR AND THE HEALTH DIRECTORS STATEMENT TO ONLY GO INTO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IF YOU BECOME EXTREMELY ILL THAT BEING SAID WE ALL FEEL ON THE HEALTHCARE SIDE .
THIS IS POTENTIALLY THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM .
WE KNOW THAT WHENEVER WE GET THE TEST RESULTS BACK THERE ALREADY A COUPLE OF DAYS .
BEHIND JUST BECAUSE IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE TEST RESULTS BACK AND I CAN TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY AFTER WORKING IN THE COVID POTTED IT IS HERE AND THERE ARE PATIENTS WHO ARE SICK WITH THIS .
DI WRIGHT I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT TIME OF STRUGGLE FOR US THIS SPRING AND PROBABLY PROBABLY WELL THROUGH THE SUMMER .
WE ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT WE CAN AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL , BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE CAN PROVIDE THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE CAN TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE LONG-TERM ONE .
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A QUICK AND RAPID DEPLOYMENT .
