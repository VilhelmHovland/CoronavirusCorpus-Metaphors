People in Kent are being warned not to click on links sent to them in text messages claiming to be from the government about fines .
Police officials say fraudsters are ' spoofing ' the government 's address in order to access personal data and financial information .
Fake text messages have been sent out claiming people need to pay fines for leaving their homes  Some of the fake texts say people have been recorded leaving their homes more than once and need to pay a fine .
They are then urged to click a link for more information .
Steve Kelly from Essex &amp; Kent Serious Crime Directorate said : " The Government has only sent one text message to the public regarding new rules about staying at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19 .
" Any others claiming to be from UK Government are false .
" Criminals are able to use spoofing technology to send texts and emails impersonating organisations that you know and trust .
Watch how criminals in Kent are using the coronavirus crisis to scam the vulnerable .
" We would remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal or financial details not to click on the links or attachments , and do n't respond to any messages that ask for your personal or financial details .
