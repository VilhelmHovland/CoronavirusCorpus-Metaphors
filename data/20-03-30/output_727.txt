State Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said hospitals in Bergen , Essex and Hudson counties are already feeling the strain of cases and the state continues to work on models predicting when the peak will occur .
" We 've asked the hospitals and the healthcare providers in those counties to just be aware , " Persichilli said at the Trenton War Memorial during the state 's daily coronavirus briefing .
" There 's a good a possibility that they 're going to see a peak after that -- probably 21 to , it could be 60 days even , " Persichilli said .
" Our exponential growth rate based on the number of positive cases reported daily is similar in northern New Jersey .
"  New Jersey is second only to New York ( 30,611 cases ) in total number cases in the country .
As of Wednesday , Bergen County has 819 cases , Essex County has 381 , and Hudson County has 260 cases .
But Persichilli said " we expect that all of our mitigation strategies will reduce the impact on our state .
"  Of the 14,000 tests administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested positive for COVID-19 , the illness caused by the virus -- a rate of 29% .
The others have been negative .
To slow the spread of the outbreak , Gov .
Phil Murphy has ordered residents to stay at home and closed non-essential businesses in the state to help slow the spread and ensure hospitals have enough space to care for patients .
Murphy said Wednesday that he 'd be " the happiest guy " if he could start reopening businesses .
But he said data and science does n't show that will happen " in the near term .
"  The governor added that if the state tries to restart the economy before the curve of cases is flattened , " we only throw gasoline onto the fire .
"  " We 're gon na get through this , " Murphy said during an appearance on CNBC 's " Fast Money " later in the day .
" We 're New Jersey , after all , right ? But it ai n't gon na be unscathed , and it wo n't be tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get there .
"  Also Wednesday , officials said the first pop-up field hospital the federal government will construct in New Jersey will open up within a week at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus .
Two other sites -- in Edison and Atlantic City -- will open up with within a month , officials said .
The location of a fourth site is yet to be determined .
The four sites are expected to bring 1,000 more hospital beds to the state .
New Jersey currently has 18,443 acute care beds , including 2,000 critical care beds , officials said .
" These steps will allow us to expand hospital capacity in the short term " and " give greater flexibility " to the state 's health-care system to handle an influx of patients , Murphy said .
