REUTERS/Issei Kato  As much of the rest of the world has gone into strict lockdowns to fight the coronavirus , Japan has so far managed to avoid the kind of outbreaks that have ravaged parts of Europe and the United States and restrictions are only requests .
However , a spike in cases in Tokyo , along with the death of a beloved comedian on Monday , appeared to be driving home the potential risk .
A top doctor called on Abe to act now .
" If we wait until an explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too late , " Satoshi Kamayachi , an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association , told a news conference , in comments carried by broadcaster Nippon Television .
Throughout the development of the outbreak , Abe 's government has appeared resistant to declaring a state of emergency , with the government 's top spokesman on Monday squashing speculation it would take such a move on April 1 .
Only last Tuesday , the Japanese government and International Olympic Committee succumbed to intense pressure from athletes and sporting bodies around the world to delay Tokyo 2020 for a year because of the outbreak .
" The number of infections continues to increase from last week and we are at a crucial moment which will determine whether we can minimise the number of further infections , " Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told a news conference .
" Through April 12 , we are asking that residents refrain from going out in the evenings , and to refrain from all unnecessary outings at the weekend .
"  Koike last week appealed to Tokyo residents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But any lockdown in Japan would look different from mandatory measures in some parts of Europe and the United States .
By law , local authorities are only permitted to issue requests for people to stay at home , which are not binding .
Therefore , even if Abe were to declare an emergency , any lockdown would rely more on moral suasion and peer pressure than formal penalties .

Yoshihide Suga , the government 's top spokesman , told a news conference earlier : " It 's not true that the government is planning on declaring a state of emergency from April 1 .
"  Suga also said an expected telephone call between Abe and Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , the head of the World Health Organization , later on Monday had nothing to do with any decision on whether to call a state of emergency .
Fans lamented the death of comedian Ken Shimura from the virus , with many saying on social media it should serve to highlight what a major threat it actually is .
" It 's probably bad to say this , but I hope his death helps Japanese , who still do n't seem to be taking this virus seriously , start to change their attitude , " one tweeted .
