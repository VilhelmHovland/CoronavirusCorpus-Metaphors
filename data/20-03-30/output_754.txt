On March 18 , President Trump declared himself to be a " wartime president , " though he spent much of the coming week downplaying the lethality of the " invisible enemy " at hand .
Despite his self-assessment , Trump was late to take advantage of the great arsenal at his disposal by waiting to sign the Defense Production Act until March 27 , which allows the president to order companies like General Motors and Ford to build supplies deemed necessary for the nation -- in this case , responding to the great deficit of ventilators .
But while Trump continues to tout his wartime leadership and health workers toil on the front lines , he appears more focused on a pettier fight .
In his Friday press conference , Trump said he expected the nation 's governors to be more " appreciative " of his efforts and that he told Vice-President Mike Pence not to contact state leaders who have been critical of the administration 's response .
" I say , ' Mike , do n't call the governor of Washington , ' " Trump said , referring to Jay Inslee .
" You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , Trump reiterated his attack on Inslee , calling him a " failed presidential candidate " and a " nasty person .
" ) Of Governor Gretchen Whitmer , he said : " Do n't call the woman in Michigan .
" The night before , Trump dismissed New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 's requests for more ventilators : " A lot of equipment is being asked for that I do n't think they will need , " he told Sean Hannity .
" I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they are going to be .
I do n't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators .
You know , you go to major hospitals , sometimes they 'll have two ventilators .
And now all of a sudden they 're saying , ' Can we order 30,000 ventilators ? ' "  According to the Washington Post , that concerning rhetoric was followed up by a damning lack of action from the administration .
As states applied to access from the Strategic National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , ventilators , and other medical items -- some states with Democratic leadership did not get the aid they needed .
Then there 's Florida , where Trump resides .
Democratic-leaning Massachusetts , which has had a serious outbreak in Boston , has received 17 percent of the protective gear it requested , according to state leaders .
Maine requested a half-million N95 specialized protective masks and received 25,558 -- about 5 ? percent of what it sought .
The shipment delivered to Colorado -- 49,000 N95 masks , 115,000 surgical masks and other supplies -- would be " enough for only one full day of statewide operations , " Rep .
Scott R .
Tipton ( R-Colo .
) told the White House in a letter several days ago .
Florida has been an exception in its dealings with the stockpile : The state submitted a request on March 11 for 430,000 surgical masks , 180,000 N95 respirators , 82,000 face shields and 238,000 gloves , among other supplies -- and received a shipment with everything three days later , according to figures from the state 's Division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , according to the division , and is awaiting a third .
Florida -- one of the few red states currently managing a significant outbreak -- appears to be exempt from Trump 's directions to governors to " get supplies yourself " rather than treat the federal government like a " shipping clerk .
" Trump , however , contradicted his own advice , according to Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker , who said that the federal government was outbidding states for orders of protective equipment .
Baker 's frustration was echoed by Governor Whitmer , who said Friday that Michigan hospitals were not receiving shipments of personal protective equipment on time because the federal government was outbidding her state .
Though Trump has the resources of the federal government to activate or keep idle , governors have n't been afraid to push back .
When the president suggested on Saturday that he was considering a quarantine of the New York City area , Governor Cuomo said such an action was " illegal " and that if Trump followed through he would sue .
( Trump backed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Ohio , Mike DeWine fought and overrode an FDA limit on an Ohio company 's capacity for decontaminating N95 masks .
And Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer -- whom Trump called a " half-wit " and repeatedly attacked without mentioning her name -- has ignored the presidential harassment and stressed the importance of her partnership with FEMA and Vice-President Pence .
Trump is n't just sparring with governors anymore , either .
The president brought his conflict against local authorities to an even smaller level on Sunday , when he blamed individual hospitals for mask shortages : " Where are the masks going ? " Trump asked in his daily , overlong press conference regarding the coronavirus .
" Are they going out the back door ? " he suggested , also accusing hospitals of hoarding ventilators .
CNN Health : According to CNN Health 's tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems , there are at least 151,680 cases of coronavirus in the U .
; 2,781 people have died in the US from coronavirus .
