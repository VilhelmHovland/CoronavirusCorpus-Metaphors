This week marked a very sad chapter in the history of our democratic South Africa .
President Cyril Ramaphosa shunned ancient African healing knowledge , African medicine and traditional healers when he addressed the nation on the escalation of measures to combat the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic .
However , in the same breath he sent out a statement mourning the passing of iSanusi Mkhulu Credo Mutwa .
It would be comic had it not been hypocritical and gravely ironic that an African head of state from the governing ANC , which has no history of being led by a non-African , consulted with every sector of society except the traditional healers , but felt it necessary to express his " sorrow " that one of our own , Mkhulu Mutwa , had passed on .
One ca n't help but ask : What was Ramaphosa sorrowful about when ancestors and the God of our forefathers -- uSmakade -- decided it was time for Mkhulu Mutwa to rest .
What about the healers who need to frequent rivers , beaches , waterfalls and forests to stay healthy  This is because , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western medicine was prioritised .
Even those who wanted to jog with their dogs were considered but not patients who consult healers about their health issues .
And what about the healers who need to frequent rivers , beaches , waterfalls and forests to stay healthy ?  According to the World Health Organisation , traditional medicine is the first source of healthcare for about 80% of the people in developing countries .
And let me hasten to dispute the popular narrative that only rural and poor people are our patients -- that 's utterly incorrect as I practise in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg .
To those worthy of the president 's ear , may you pose these questions to him on my behalf please .
Who advises him ? Who writes his speeches ?  It 's difficult to fathom that any African employed in the highest office in the land could be so narrow-minded on spiritual matters to the point of presenting to the public a president who is blatantly disrespectful to his own forefathers .
Indeed , like millions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as isangoma -- I " understood the gravity of the situation " that warranted the total lockdown that began at midnight on Thursday to curb the spread of the virus in the country .
However , I never thought my sacred ancestral healing gift was so trivial to the point that Ramaphosa did n't see the need , not only to consult with our sector , but to even acknowledge that we exist .
It 's worth noting that the message being preached to the public , which was perhaps deemed to be beyond the intellectual capacity of healers , happens to be something we have been practising from time immemorial .
Not only do we wash our hands regularly with tap water , we often use water from waterfalls and oceans .
In his book , Umsamo : Amathongo Nemithetho Elishumi ka Nkulunkulu , Dr Velaphi " VVO " Mkhize clearly states that the water spirit we call noMhoyi is the most important of them all .
There was no virus when our ancestors decided that everyone who came to consult with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Also , before a patient receives any form of treatment , the first step is steaming ( ukugquma/ukufutha ) to eliminate viruses and cleanse the body .
Is steaming not one of the methods recommended to prevent Covid-19 because the heat kills the virus ?  I repeat , it is a sad week indeed for me as a healer because on March 25 2014 I walked into a hardware store next to a private clinic to buy a fluorescent light .
But instead I started weeping because I was experiencing excruciating pain .
I ended up in hospital , the seventh time that Western doctors wheeled me into theatre to cut me open then sew me back -- without a conclusive diagnosis .
But sir , by choosing not to consult with healers , thereby justifying not mentioning them in your address among those who provide essential health services , you have opened the door for us to be treated like the scum of the earth .
They were great , well-educated and experienced surgeons but I had an ancestral calling that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  From this week until the end of the national lockdown next month , how many patients are going to suffer the same fate or die because Ramaphosa has chosen Western medicine only to treat their ailments ?  As a good citizen I sent written enquiries to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize 's office .
But sir , by choosing not to consult with healers , thereby justifying not mentioning them in your address among those who provide essential health services , you have opened the door for us to be treated like the scum of the earth .
It was therefore not surprising that my enquiries to Mkhize 's office were neither acknowledged nor responded to .
Forgive me for asking : Why is the Suppression of Witchcraft Act of 1957 yet to be scrapped 26 years into democracy ? Does this mean the ANC government still regards traditional healers as subhumans ?  Mkhulu Mutwa , you told me to my face that I was not just a journalist but a healer like you .
I accept being treated like the scum of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healers take their rightful place in this country .
