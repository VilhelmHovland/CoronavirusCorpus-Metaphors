The dawning of America 's ' Post-Pandemic Age '  America will never be the same .
The coronavirus pandemic has had an economic and social impact on America that ranks with the Revolutionary War , the Civil War , either World War , or the Great Depression .
America never has been hit so hard and lost so much , so quickly .
It has put millions out of work , has cut several trillion dollars out of the market , and endangered the survival of hundreds of thousands of American companies .
In a very short period of time , it has been devastating and transformational .
The economic and social impact of COVID-19 has been the fastest and largest single shift in our lifetimes .
Many will lose jobs , incomes , homes , savings and retirement incomes , overnight .
America may go from the lowest unemployment rate in our lifetime to the highest , within weeks .
Which leads to the most important question : What will America itself be like in a few months as it recovers from the virus ? Americans should prepare for a " Post-Pandemic Age .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will die and tens of thousands of manufacturing , retail and service jobs will not return .
Many companies were on shaky financial foundations and will be shuttered forever .
Many of those businesses are being replaced during the shutdown .
Amazon alone is adding at least 100,000 to its workforce ; the pandemic has made the shift to online retail permanent and decisive .
Medical and legal professionals , bankers and nearly every other service sector have learned to work from home , suggesting a permanent , low-overhead model for many .
Distance learning will grow and there will be more focus on telemeetings , as the structure of work changes .
America unexpectedly has been sucked into a space/time wormhole and will emerge in a new economic and political galaxy .
But where ? The American market is too fast , too efficient , too ruthless for anyone to predict , but some general trends may be emerging .
A new domestic economy will emerge .
The market lost trillions of dollars of value in a few weeks .
Over that short time , the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided cover for opportunistic layoffs in many companies .
But , at the same time , it uncovered some huge opportunities .
As the stock market recovers , investors wo n't replace their previous investments in the same stocks and funds , some of which were undercapitalized and went under or were permanently damaged ; they will be gone forever .
Bottom line : Post-pandemic , the American economy will be fundamentally different .
Wealth has massively shifted across the country and a huge proportion of American capital ( and labor ) will be reallocated .
Some sectors may have changed forever .
In health care , a tremendously far-reaching pandemic response policy now allows doctors to practice across state borders .
Doctors had been licensed state-by-state , but that impeded the smooth flow and reallocation of medical resources across the country .
The new policy instantly creates a national , rather than regional , medical system and ushers in nationwide telemedicine and nationwide health delivery systems , making available the best medical advice to everyone in the country , instantly .
It brings potential for vastly better allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
That 's a huge step toward better health care delivery and lower prices .
A new global economic and geopolitical balance also will emerge .
The pandemic has exacerbated political and economic tensions between the United States and China .
Chinese confusion and some secrecy at the outbreak , China 's decision to expel U .
journalists , and the unfortunate threat from the Chinese foreign ministry to withhold lifesaving antibiotics from the U .
has created a predictable , bipartisan , nationalistic reaction in Washington that may lead to policies aimed at creating more secure , probably domestic , supply sources for critical pharmaceuticals , rare earth metals , 5G technology , or any other sensitive technology .
The result is that America may be shifting toward what Trump might call " nationalistic globalism .
" All of this , in the end , is a huge blow to U .
trade relations that , for the most part , have benefitted both countries .
Further , America 's view of foreign policy and security will change dramatically and , again , capital will flow in new directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of security will move to the fore , including cybersecurity , grid security ( EMP hardening ) , emergency response and communication systems , and dominating space .
From a survival perspective , it 's worth observing that COVID-19 laid bare the devastating impact that a planned bioterror attack might have , and the relative ease with which such an attack could be launched .
The objective of successful modern military attacks is not simply body count nor destruction of military capability -- it is decisive economic , political and social disruption .
If this had been an attack , it would have been the quickest and one of the most devastating military attacks in history .
In some military doctrines , the most successful attacks can be those where the target never realizes they 've been attacked at all .
Hopefully , America 's intelligence and defense systems will learn much from the pandemic .
And so , out of nowhere , like it or not , an entirely new , Post-Pandemic Age is about to dawn in America .
