We have previously discussed how NBC News anchor Chuck Todd uses questions to express extreme condemnations of President Donald Trump and his supporters .
While Todd realizes that he would be fired for saying outright that Trump supporters " just want to be lied to , " he can make the same point by asking another person if they " just want to be lied to .
" Todd returned to his feigned neutrality in asking presidential candidate Joe Biden if " there is blood on the president 's hands .
" Not to be undone , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has declared that " as the president fiddles , people are dying .
" At least Pelosi had the integrity to make the statement outright .
Todd has a reputation for using others to make such biased attacks .
In addition to Trump , he has been roundly condemned for his bias against Bernie Sanders .
As with his earlier comment on Trump supporters , he was criticized previously to quoting someone else to say that were part of a " digital brownshirt brigade .
"  For Trump and Sanders supporters , Todd 's record further erodes their faith in the media .
The bias shown in these interviews is clearly supported by the network .
It would be better to have hosts drop the pretense of such quotations or questions to ask least be open about the agenda or bias with viewers .
' The document detailed a March 14 incident in Midland , Texas , in which " three Asian American family members , including a 2-year-old and 6-year-old , were stabbed .
The suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese , and infecting people with the coronavirus .
"  ' FBI spokesperson Lauren Hagee said she could not comment on the document but stressed , " we do want to assure the public the FBI remains committed to ensuring national security and pursuing violations of federal law .
" '  Generally speaking , is it reasonable to expect the same people ( the Left ) that have been civically illiterate for at least the last 12 years , to suddenly be literate about the science of pandemics ? Not a chance .
If 1000 nurses ( say 2 hospitals in NYC ) treat 30 patients a day and change their masks per safety guidelines each time , that 's 30K masks .
Over a 10 day period , that 's 300K masks .
No conspiracy , just math .
Media is owned by the Salem Media Group which primarily operates so-called ' Christian ' radio stations .
Listeners of those stations are Evangelicals ; a group that overwhelmingly supports Donald Trump .
With regards to this " 10 Lies " article , every one of those instances has a large degree of truth .
But depending on how the ' lie ' is broken down , language can be parsed to create ' alternate facts ' .
If Trump was truly concerned about this crisis , there should be abundant media soundbites documenting his concerns .
But existing soundbites paint just the opposite picture .
Trump is consistently playing down the danger and questioning the experts .
Olly , let 's start with # 9 , ' Google is developing a national test site ' .
Here 's an excerpt from an article in The Hill that was published on March 17 : **41;84;TOOLONG .
Google is postponing the national rollout of a website with information about the coronavirus until later this week , an official told The Hill on Tuesday .
The launch of website -- and what exactly the website would do -- has been mired in confusion since late last week .
President Trump in a speech Friday claimed that Google was developing a screening website that would " be very quickly done .
"  Shortly after those remarks , Verily , another company under the umbrella of Google 's parent company Alphabet , said that it was " developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing " that was " in the early stages of development " for the Bay Area .
Google on Sunday announced it was in fact working on a nationwide site " dedicated to COVID-19 education , prevention , and local resources .
"  That national website launch had originally been scheduled for Monday .
Now the tech giant is delaying the launch to fill out features of the website .
" Verily launched a pilot website late Sunday to counties in the Bay Area , and is working with authorities to scale this effort further , " the Google official told The Hill .
Edited from : " Google Postpones Launch Of National Coronavirus Website Until ' Later This Week ' .
The Hill , 3/17/20 **37;127;TOOLONG .
truth is that a company owned by Google was developing a site for 2 counties in Norhern California .
Trump may not have been ' lying ' outright .
But he sure got his facts mixed up .
Just to be clear , you had the opportunity to select any of the 10 and you chose that one to prove he did n't have all the facts exactly correct ? Please tell us you chose the least provable alternate fact of the 10 and you are ready to drop the hammer on the most .
Because if that 's all you have , then you 're as pathetic as Chuck Todd .
Well what about that , Olly ? ? Google had no National Website ready for use .
Trump was n't telling a ' total lie ' , but he certainly got this wrong .
And that is most likely the case with every one of these 10 ' lies ' .
In most every case , Trump was probably referencing some level of truth , but got the facts wrong .
Olly , to begin with , ' who ' actually labeled these 10 references as ' lies ' ? The Washington Post ? The New York Times ? MSNBC ?  PJ Media just broadly claims that mainstream media calls these lies .
But there 's no mention of any specific source that compiled this list .
One imagines PJ Media is simply responding to Facebook memes compiled by whoever .
And this lack of specificity is part of PJ Media 's problem .
Quality news sources get specific on details .
PJ Media is doing what Fox News commonly does : they 're simply responding to some faceless liberal who supposedly represents all liberals .
As I noted before , there 's often some level of truth to claims Trump makes .
But all too frequently his claims require extensive clarifications .
That 's not good in a crisis situation .
No company would retain a CEO whose statements always require clarification .
And finally I repeat : ' If media soundbites exist of Trump expressing sincere concern regarding the pandemic before the stock market collapsed , feel free to post them .
But I do nt think they exist .
Paul , Natacha is probably referencing common Facebook videos that were widely shared last week .
They show Before &amp; After clips of Trump and Fox News personalities poo-pooing virus danger only to acknowledge .
And frankly those clips show Fox News people playing completely different characters .
Fox News and Trump dismissed the virus until stocks reacted violently .
Only when the markets crashed did Trump really pay attention .
Even hyenas laugh so proving that Anonymous the Stupid can find something funny and laugh is n't amazing .
I only respond to a few of your comments to me and seldom respond to your comments to others .
What I have noticed is that you post a lot and say nothing .
You might be one of the biggest posters on this blog .
I wonder what that means .
38 matches to Anonymous on this one page .

Seldom does Anonymous the Stupid say anything and most of the times when he says something it 's wrong .
The Trump administration is expected on Tuesday to announce its final rule to roll back Obama-era automobile fuel efficiency standards , relaxing efforts to limit climate-warming tailpipe pollution and virtually undoing the government 's biggest effort to combat climate change .
The new rule , written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation , would allow vehicles on American roads to emit nearly a billion tons more carbon dioxide over the lifetime of the cars than they would have under the Obama standards and hundreds of millions of tons more than will be emitted under standards being implemented in Europe and Asia .
Trump administration officials have raced to complete the auto rule by this spring , even as the White House is consumed with responding to the coronavirus crisis .
President Trump is expected to extol the rule , which will stand as one of the most consequential regulatory rollbacks of his administration , as a needed salve for an economy crippled by the pandemic .
The article goes on to note that even research conducted within the administration casts doubts on the logic of these rollbacks .
The auto industry itself is bracing for years of litigation it scarcely desires .
What 's more cost projections estimate that consumers could actually pay more in the long run while their vehicles create additional pollution .
on the plus greta thunberg and company must be overjoyed that the coronavirus is killing off so much commerce and people too , all that diminished CO2 from useless mouth breathers and cowfarts and idled trucks will help save the planet right  no seth actually if you ca n't specify to a useful certainty , what percent factor American auto emissions are in global warming , then it is just a big fat guess to what extent restricting them will be salutary and make up for the corresponding loss in economic activity  see there is no clearly proven model that identifies proportionately how much greenhouse gas emissions contribute to global warming , because the climactic systems are so complex .
i personally think they have some effect but i do n't know how much and so far I have not seen any convincing scientific authority that says exactly what proportionate share co2 is or methane or what have you  likewise they ca n't identify to what extent solar activity is a precise causal factor .
although it does nt take much " science " to understand that the big thermonuclear reactor that is Sol is the principal agent of heat in our solar system whatsoever .
and if that varies a lot , then , perhaps the climactic warming will vary a lot too !  now coming back to para 1 -- there is a cost imposed on economic activity by regulations .
just like there is a cause imposed by social distancing and shutdowns of everything .
the President is wise to consider such things and not just succumb to a panel of Democrat leadership designated " scientists " to tell him precisely what he is supposed to do at every turn .
perhaps you who cry wolf all the time and cast endless insults are part of the problem contributing to the recent failure to heed the epidemiologists who projected big danger from covid -19  thats about the only relevance i can see .
the endless politicizing makes everything seem like Lysenkoism , even when it 's not !  if you ca n't specify to a useful certainty , what percent factor American auto emissions are in global warming , .
emissions may play a big role in virus deaths  Northern Italy is a good example of where high pollution has made the death rate higher .
At the same time the virus has done an enormous amount to clean up the pollution everywhere in the world .
I myself do not believe that global warming is a problem but the reckless consumption of fossil fuel is most definitely a problem for numerous reasons .
The virus may be a blessing in disguise if it exposes that fact .
I am not clear on exactly what the tradeoff is between stricter CAFE standards which will adversely impact the economy versus what is to be gained from lower specific sorts of emissions .
i got a fast read before the paywall came up and seems to me that it 's not in the article but feel free to produce an exact answer from a qualified source Seth  or you can copy and paste it if you want people to be convinced .
im sure you 're too busy with more editorial or whatever , thats more fun eh  Seth , you 're correct in that Trump is unmoored for facts and science .
Like Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada does , TrumPutin ought to get out of the way so scientists ' can work .
Trump has no clue what that means .
The punchline of an old bawdy joke I heard some 3-4 decades ago , " the more he talked , the dumber he got .
" ( Perhaps you 'd heard it , too .
) TrumPutin is too dumb to realize that he 's too dumb .
Unmoored without an oar or sail boat .
jsn  Regarding the suggestion that Trump supporters might want to be lied to it seems that there are only three possibilities : 1 .
Trump never intentionally lies ; he may once in a while be mistaken ( like any of us ) and when he realizes he 's made an error he corrects it .
He lies and his supporters are n't astute enough to realize it .
He lies and you 're all in on the joke and support him despite his unwillingness/inability to tell the truth .
Which is it ?  If he had listened to Steve Bannon early on then he would have been out front of it all .
I notice you people are very gleeful that the President has made some mistakes .
Perhaps you should not be too happy about that considering we all have some shared karma in this national geographic space ?  As a person of a certain age with more than one underlying condition , I am not gleeful that the President is who and what he is .
I was hoping to get a straight answer as to whether or ne he constantly lies .
( If he is simply going along with his staff that makes him a whole different kind of stupid ) .
Or whether you know he lies and do n't care ?  Your definition of constantly could use an update .
He lies about damn near everything , big and small , repeatedly , and when caught in his lies .
he lies about that .
I know you to be intelligent enough to know he lies .
constantly .
I still do n't know why you do n't care ? He is n't just lying to his political foes , he lies to the coal miners who think the mines will re-open , to the towns that he tells the factories are coming back , to the people not receiving ventillators and masks , to those who were going to benefit from his big tax cut ( well he was n't lying to the rich people ) .
Pick a subject and he lies about it , not rhetorical , really pick a subject , I 'll document his lies and you 'll dismiss them .
Why ?  He never says anything of consequence that is truthful .
Under the worst of circumstances , he is indignant because he is n't being revered .
tRump has no business being at the daily briefing other than proving dark comedic relief unknowingly .
" For Trump and Sanders supporters , Todd 's record further erodes their faith in the media .
The bias shown in these interviews is clearly supported by the network .
" But that 's the crux of it is n't it ? It 's a pitiful scramble for eyeballs/ears which translates into ' ratings ' which ultimately generates revenues ! Whatever happened to the notion of Journalism 's goal to inform so that the **26;166;TOOLONG could evaluate and arrive at their own conclusions ?  Todd returned to his feigned neutrality in asking presidential candidate Joe Biden if " there is blood on the president 's hands .
" Not to be undone , Speaker Nancy Pelosi has declared that .
Bush , Obama , Biden &amp; Pelosi held office when we went down this path in the prior decade .
Additionally China delayed in taking action against 2019-nCoV considering they birthed and botched SARS-CoV in 2002 .
Another Decade , Another Coronavirus New England Journal of Medicine  For the third time in as many decades , a zoonotic coronavirus has crossed species to infect human populations .
This virus , provisionally called 2019-nCoV , was first identified in Wuhan , China , in persons exposed to a seafood or wet market .
The rapid response of the Chinese public health , clinical , and scientific communities facilitated recognition of the clinical disease and initial understanding of the epidemiology of the infection .
First reports indicated that human-to-human transmission was limited or nonexistent , but we now know that such transmission occurs , although to what extent remains unknown .
Like outbreaks caused by two other pathogenic human respiratory coronaviruses ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus MERS-CoV ) , 2019-nCoV causes respiratory disease that is often severe .
As now reported in the Journal , Zhu et al .
have identified and characterized 2019-nCoV .
The viral genome has been sequenced , and these results in conjunction with other reports show that it is 75 to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV and even more closely related to several bat coronaviruses .
It can be propagated in the same cells that are useful for growing SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV , but notably , 2019-nCoV grows better in primary human airway epithelial cells than in standard tissue-culture cells , unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV .
Transmission of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred to a large extent by means of superspreading events .
Superspreading events have been implicated in 2019-nCoV transmission , but their relative importance is unknown .
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways .
, transmission occurs primarily from patients with recognized illness and not from patients with mild , nonspecific signs .
It appears that 2019-nCoV uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV ( human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 hACE2 ) , so transmission is expected only after signs of lower respiratory tract disease develop .
SARS-CoV mutated over the 2002 -- 2004 epidemic to better bind to its cellular receptor and to optimize replication in human cells , enhancing virulence .
Adaptation readily occurs because coronaviruses have error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerases , making mutations and recombination events frequent .
By contrast , MERS-CoV has not mutated substantially to enhance human infectivity since it was detected in 2012 .
It is likely that 2019-nCoV will behave more like SARS-CoV and further adapt to the human host , with enhanced binding to hACE2 .
Given its close similarity to bat coronaviruses , it is likely that bats are the primary reservoir for the virus .
SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in wet markets , whereas MERS-CoV is transmitted from camels to humans .
In both cases , the ancestral hosts were probably bats .
Whether 2019-nCoV is transmitted directly from bats or by means of intermediate hosts is important to understand and will help define zoonotic transmission patterns .
A striking feature of the SARS epidemic was that fear played a major role in the economic and social consequences .
Although specific anticoronaviral therapies are still in development , we now know much more about how to control such infections in the community and hospitals , which should alleviate some of this fear .
Transmission of 2019-nCoV probably occurs by means of large droplets and contact and less so by means of aerosols and fomites , on the basis of our experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV .
Public health measures , including quarantining in the community as well as timely diagnosis and strict adherence to universal precautions in health care settings , were critical in controlling SARS and MERS .
Institution of similar measures will be important and , it is hoped , successful in reducing the transmission of 2019-nCoV .
if i understood what estovir wrote , it suggests that asymptomatic spread is unlikely or a small factor in spread .
i guess to really know that one might have to take a big sample of a specific local population with a known rate of infection ? and compare it at a later time ? but has there been enough testing here to do that .
also , not sure what the following is saying except that aerosol spread is possible  also , i wonder estovir is it possible that the amount of virus in the first contact matters , not sure what you call this , inoculum ? but the overall mass of virus transfered in the initial exposure of a person who comes down with the illness , could that be a factor in severity ?  in other words , perhaps asymptomatic spread is possible but might it lead to lower intensity infections ?  if i understood what estovir wrote , it suggests that asymptomatic spread is unlikely or a small factor in spread .
was the New England Journal of Medicine giving you wrong information .
That was what was believed 6 weeks ago .
It is pretty clear now that many ( most ? ) people who are spreading the virus are asymptomatic or develop symptoms days after they become contagious .
however , my point was , how much virus a person is subjected to at the point of initial exposure , may be a factor in the severity of the symptoms .
the other article i liked described how this is often the case with respiratory viruses .
i do not know if there is any evidence that happens with covid-19 as well , or not  perhaps you did nt read the link .
i will copy part which illustrates what i did not express well .
i think this is called " viral load "  " Prof Wendy Barclay , Action Medical Research Chair Virology , and Head of Department of Infectious Disease , Imperial College London , said :  " In general with respiratory viruses , the outcome of infection -- whether you get severely ill or only get a mild cold -- can sometimes be determined by how much virus actually got into your body and started the infection off .
It 's all about the size of the armies on each side of the battle , a very large virus army is difficult for our immune systems army to fight off .
" So standing further away from someone when they breathe or cough out virus likely means fewer virus particles reach you and then you get infected with a lower dose and get less ill .
Doctors who have to get very close to patients to take samples from them or to intubate them are at higher risk so need to wear masks .
" The fewer people in the room , the less likely it is than one person is coughing or breathing out infectious virus at any one time , so mixing with as few people as possible is the safest way .
" But there is no evidence for any suggestion that if everyone in a family is already sick they can they reinfect each other with more and more virus .
In fact for other viruses once you are infected it 's quite hard to get infected with the same virus on top .
" "  In general with respiratory viruses , the outcome of infection -- whether you get severely ill or only get a mild cold -- can sometimes be determined by how much virus actually got into your body and started the infection off .
It 's all about the size of the armies on each side of the battle .
that may play a role in why some people get very sick and some not so much .
How strong your immune system also plays a role .
I do n't think that is closely related to viral load .
Viral load refers to the amount that an infected person is producing that is available to be shed and infect others .
What is surprising is that people who are not showing symptoms have been found to have viral loads that are as high as people who are very sick .
however , my point was , how much virus a person is subjected to at the point of initial exposure , may be a factor in the severity of the symptoms .
sneezing and blowing your nose are symptoms of severe cases and those actions can be more likely to spread the virus in public , but beyond that it now appears that someone with no symptoms can be just as contagious as someone who is very sick .
For instance there are examples where one member of a household with no symptoms infected the rest of the household .
I know you are concerned about this .
You should be .
We all should be .
Not to harp on obesity but , when we lead unhealthy lives , these become co-morbid conditions , meaning they accelerate our death .
I have listed some comorbid conditions nearby and in previous months .
Today 's NEJM edition lists them as well as to who is dying with COVID .
If you have a clear health , if you do not have comorbid conditions , you are " safer " than those who have comorbidities .
Either way , your/our best to avoid COVID-19 is what you have already heard -- keep your distance from people for a bit longer .
Wash your hands with soap/water , and use common sense .
As for those who are succumbing to severe illness and/or death , most of them have comorbidities .
Those that do not are outliers .
We will get through this .
However , if you have comorbid conditions ( i 'm talking to you Mespo ) , you really should address them because you are not invincible , death comes for everyone , and your loved ones deserve to have you around longer than how you see your station in life .
Today 's special edition of NEJM has consistent findings with previous reports on those who present with COVID .
It 's a free link I believe .
I 'm overweight but otherwise healthy .
I 'm more concerned for the elderly .
poor diet and lack of exercise is at the heart of so many health problems , shows up in obesity , diabetes , heart problems , and more .
i have seen that regular exercise started by people late in life even the 80s can reduce bad conditions to manageable .
as for diet , now we should be cooking at home , which is cheaper and usually healthier , less salt and sugar for starters , and who knows what other goop they put in foods as preservatives and so forth .
here 's a great chance to make lemonade out of lemons , folks ! literally , lol  my last grocery run we stocked up on green leafys and fresh fruits while other people were hoarding TP .
clue to the fools out there : if you run out of tp then you can wipe your backside with a cloth and wash it .
but good luck finding sufficient vegetables , not even a garden will yield for months now , here up north  Estovir , I do not quite understand why targeted therapies are necessary .
Could the body 's own defenses be supported at the cellular or organelle level such that people 's own immune systems can effectively fight off infection as it was designed to do ?  For example , glutathione is effective at inhibiting viral replication .
It is produced by the body but requires selenium to work .
Some populations are deficient in selenium or at best suboptimal for various reasons -- would fixing such deficiencies potentially help people recover or prevent new infection ?  The science of immunology within the practice of clinical medicine is rather new .
Those of us over 50 recall family , friends or ourselves receiving " allergy " shots to inoculate people against various allergens ( e .
pollen , dander , peanuts , nicotine ) .
Since then immunology has taken off and the 1990s , thanks in large part to oncology , saw the start of using the immune system to overcome specific illnesses .
Using the immune system allows a physician to harness the various " cell messenger " cascades so as to combat tumor cells .
Part of the reason HIV was so late in being understood ( and still is today ) , is because we do not understand the many players within our immune system .
Your question is not as cut &amp; dry as you might think .
Likewise with treating COVID-19 .
As I mentioned in a recent NEJM article above , we have known about Coronavirus causing SARS since 2002 : Bush , Obama , Pelosi , Biden , all knew about it but did nothing .
So here we are today acting " surprised " and blaming Trump , but in reality we just did not want to do anything about it in the previous decade .
This certainly holds true about the WHO .
We are " late " in treating COVID-19 because we do not understand our immune system nor do we understand viruses .
Bacteria have been studied for decades .
Not so for Viruses .
There are 4 major types of pathogens that affect humans : bacteria , fungi , helminths ( worms ) and viruses .
Bacteria , Fungi &amp; worms are extracellular -- they are addressed in large part by what is called Innate Immune system ( Macrophages , Basophils , Neutrophils , etc ) .
Viruses are intracellular which is the domain of both the innate &amp; the adaptive immune system , e .
T cells &amp; B Cells .
T cells , particularly CD8 Cytotoxic T-Cells are responsible for stopping the replication of viruses .
Viruses are protein " filterable " agents .
They are vastly small .
They can not reproduce on their own like bacteria &amp; fungi .
However , once they attach to a host cell ( Coronavirus attaches to an enzyme in the lower pulmonary system , HIV attaches to the CD4 Helper T cells , etc ) , they use the machinery of the host to replicate .
Thus you can not " kill " viruses because they become part of the host .
To kill the virus means killing the host cells .
You are asking about our own defense system .
I already discussed which part of our defense system addresses viruses .
However , unlike how humans act in our culture today ( I think of Squeeky Fromme girl reporter with her cats and living/working alone ) , our immune system ( actually all of our systems ) are dependent on each other .
While Squeeky and most Americans relish practicing social distancing 24/7 , our cells can not .
They depend on cell communication in order to live , while we Americans crow about being an island .
Back to your question , CD8 Cytotoxic T Cells do not " kill " viruses on their own .
They must receive signals from various other cells ( dendritic cells , macrophages , CD 4 Helper T cells , etc ) that alert them to attack the virus .
The way the CD8 cell attacks the virus is via a molecule that " interferes " with the virus , ergo Interferon .
Type I Interferons ( INF ) are proteins synthesized by many cell types in response to viral infection , hence your answer .
Interferons come in various types but the relevant ones to our discussion are Type I INF-alpha &amp; INF-beta .
These 2 proteins have 3 major functions :  1 .
INF induce resistant to viral replication to uninfected cells by destroying the RNA of viruses that are required for replication 2 .
INF induce the expression of another protein ( MHC-I ) which cooperate with CD8 Cytotoxic cells -- they work together .
Again , no cell is an island , and hence CD8 cells depend on the cooperativity of MHC-1 3 .
INF activates another cell ( ours is a very busy world within our members ! ) called NK Cells , which selectively kill virus infected cells -- but not the virus per se  Interferon was once considered the " gold standard " of many viral infections , e .
Hepatitis B , HIV , etc .
We used to infuse INF into patients who had some specific type of viral infection ( it was the " it " drug in the 1990s for HIV ) in the hopes that the INF will do all of the things I wrote above this text .
The problem with INF and Viruses is that viruses replicate to inhibit INF .
Viruses are " intelligent " ( e .
SARS-Cv2 ) in that they evolve/ mutate to evade our natural " defense " system .
You see where this is going .
Our immune systems are powerful , intricate , beyond our current understanding and they can be overwhelmed .
HIV is the only disease that specifically targets the immune system in the hopes of vanquishing the host .
It does so by killing one of the most important immune cells in our body : CD4 T Helper Cells .
Coronavirus vanquishes the host pulmonary system and those affected hardest are those individuals who have illnesses that stress the pulmonary system like asthma , COPD , heart disease , heart failure , obesity ( obesity is a killer on many many levels ) , Type 2 Diabetes , etc  There is no thing as a " silver bullet " for fighting off infections , to answer your question about Zinc supplements .
If a silver bullet existed none of us would be sick and probably consuming massive amounts of that " silver bullet " .
What you heard about Zinc , I suspect , is some internet meme , perhaps a retired physician seeking relevance or attention in their elder years , a quackery site , or some other source that lacked evidence .
Evidence Based Medicine ( EBM ) was a paradigm adopted in medicine back in the 1990s that has been somewhat adopted by many physicians but not all .
I subscribe to it , and any physician worth his salt does as well .
If you ca n't find evidence about Zinc , or x , y and z , then do n't buy it .
You should always fall on the side of evidence when it comes to treatments .
Sadly we do n't have much evidence when it comes to COVID-19 hence our discussion  For those who wish to understand how vast this discussion truly is , check the many cell signaling pathways involved in immunology .
These were " discovered " in the past 20 years .
Most of it will be considered wrong and obsolete in another 20 years .
count on it  why do n't we have cures to viral illnesses ? pinpoint the pathway that leads to it and you 'll win a Nobel Prize and lots of money  Estovir , " NB : I am currently lecture on this topic to graduate students .
" I would like to be in your class ! ? ? Thank you for the excellent reply !  " Viruses are protein " filterable " agents .
"  If they are protein " filterable " agents , do they interact at all with the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi apparatus ? If so , do they induce the unfolded protein response ?  " Type I Interferons ( INF ) are proteins synthesized by many cell types in response to viral infection , hence your answer .
Interferons come in various types but the relevant ones to our discussion are Type I INF-alpha &amp; INF-beta .
"  Are these synthesized by the endoplasmic reticulum ? I am unclear about their origin .
" The problem with INF and Viruses is that viruses replicate to inhibit INF .
"  What if they could be prevented upstream from that ? Is that what may be happening here :  " There is no thing as a " silver bullet " for fighting off infections , to answer your question about Zinc supplements .
"  I agree that there is no silver bullet .
The body is an intricate system .
The moving parts within that system need many little building blocks to keep the ' cogs ' moving properly .
I also aim to back up my statements with legitimate sources .
If I have made any errors in my understanding , please help me correct my understanding .
I am an autodidact and may not be getting something .
? ?  I brought up zinc and selenium ( in relation to glutathione ) because of how they affect the movement of the ' cogs ' .
As I understand it , insufficiency or outright deficiency of either can induce the UPR in the ER , and , if unresolved , apoptosis ( J Cell Biol .

Selenium : its role as antioxidant in human health ) .
GSH , an antioxidant , needs a selenoprotein built with selenium to work ; GSH helps reduce ROS which , if unchecked , can induce the UPR .
ROS can induce TGF-B , which , if overzealous , can not only destroy cells , but also contribute to the development of fibrosis in the lungs .
Thus , both zinc and selenium , in appropriate levels , are crucial to effective cell function , and , since no cell is an island , the effective functioning of the organism overall .
Based on the papers I have read , I think I have these pathways correct , but please correct me if I have misunderstood something .
" Sadly we do n't have much evidence when it comes to COVID-19 hence our discussion "  Does the evidence have to pertain to the SARS-Cov-2 particularly , or can scientists extrapolate from evidence pertaining to coronaviruses or other viruses more generally ?  Oh , Todd is like you , Jonny , except you excuse Trump 's misstatements and mistakes and lies , try to find something good to say about him while focusing as much bad into as you can find on his rivals .

The same dynamic that has been noted about the current mob that wants to tear down everything , and lack the ability to build anything .
Now Turley is attacking Chuck Todd , accusing him of bias by suggesting that Trump has blood on his tiny hands .
How could he NOT have blood on his little hands ? The reasons are numerous , beginning with rejecting the pandemic playbook , dismantling the pandemic rapid response team , calling COVID-19 a " hoax " , saying that 15 cases would soon be 0 cases , anyone who wants a test can get one , that we 'd have a vaccine " very soon " , that there was a " game changing " medication available .
the list goes on .
In reliance on his downplaying of this calamity , the Governor of Florida refused to close beaches for spring break , and Mardi Gras went on as usual , spreading this virus across state lines .
How many school districts were slow to close schools ? How many states were slow to close down restaurants , churches , sports contests , public gatherings , concerts and other events drawing lots of people ? Do n't you think that if there had been some leadership saying that there was a pandemic coming and that social distancing was the only tool available to limit the spread so that hospitals would n't get overwhelmed , that this could have made a big difference in limiting the spread , especially if the public was told there wo n't be a vaccine any time soon , and that there is no approved medical treatment for these infections ?  While we probably can not scientifically quantify how many more people died as a result of Trump 's narcissism and lack of leadership talent .
we can not deny that his failures have made a bad situation much worse than it needed to be .
And , when Trumpy Bear says that no one could have predicted this , he 's lying .
A model showing the extent of spread and death tool without social distancing was released in January .
Yesterday , Trumpy Bear claimed it was the first he ever heard this .
That 's another lie .
Trump does have blood on those little hands .
It would be irresponsible to ignore this truth .
in fact , there has been discussion of Fox News possibly having liability for supporting the Trump talking points about COVID-19 being a " hoax " , downplaying the risks , accusing Democrats of politicizing this , etc .
The irresponsibility of Fox News for downplaying the risks and defending Trump , and the resulting failure of so many Americans to take seriously social distancing would be a far more relevant topic than trying to attack Chuck Todd for pointing out the obvious .
The main cause of the covid-19 illness is sars-cov-2 .
Natch thinks Trump is causing covid 19 .
One might say Xi mishandled the crisis , one might say Trump has made some errors , but the fanatic , screeching harridan Natch says Trump himself has " blood on his hands "  This is preposterous and inflammatory remarks .
Blood is where this can all end up and I do n't mean just people coughing out their lungs either .
I have seen for decades a phenomenon where the most strident voices are usually those which will be the least capable of managing open conflict once it comes .
One can see this in many different circles , not just politics .
It 's a phenomenon like " short guy complex .
" The loudest provocateurs are usually the weakest .
-Diagnostic testing &gt;&gt; D- ( up from an F as NY has made a huge testing move recently ; true , that 's Cuomo stepping up huge , but NY is part of the U .
after all )  -Doing the utmost to aid in Emergency Medicine &gt;&gt; D- ( there are people reusing masks and wearing garbage bags to work in Covid + wards and we will not have ventilators by the end of the week in Louisiana ; all those people screaming about death panels as a result of Obamacare ? ? ? Well , we will have that actively practiced by the end of the week in NY and Louisiana , that 's where we are )  -Using Defense production to broker for the states an adequate supply of PPE &gt;&gt; F ( We are in a logistics CRISIS as we speak , really it 's about shuttling ventilators around the country from one hot spot to the next ; this is real Hunger Games S**t and all Trump can see fit to do is use the DPA as a bargaining tool like it 's a NY real estate deal )  the China travel ban was timely yes good but then the concomitant failure to restrict italy and japan and korea was an early mistake  testing is a systemic problem more so than a trump problem ; could he have pushed harder to make it happen ? probably , .
so i will count that as a mixed responsibility but definite miss-step  I 'm not sure you mentioned this or not but lying about no need to wear masks , .
whereever that came from , was wrong and stupid , it is wise to wear a scarf or mask or anything to reduce spread of droplets and we need to do that now , posthaste , why is this complicated ?  defense production i would have ordered it a month ago , no idea why this took so long .
Conservatives , do not get sucked into this .
Do not fail to react to the virus with proper precautions , because provocateurs are wagging their tongues at you .
if it is wise then it is wise whether Democrats agree or not  and although i approve of social distancing and all that ; i also consider it part of the POTUS responsibility to reckon the effect on the economy and other consequences .
there are tradeoffs between social distancing and lost income which will affect some people very adversely .
the media sometimes paints this as if it were a simple equation but it is not , it is multifactored ,  also , i am not naive ; they WANT the economy damaged so that Trump 's reelection prospects are hamstrung .
maybe not all advocates of severe prophylactic measures , but yes , SOME certainly do have that in mind .
Conservatives , do not get sucked into this .
the Conservatives are doing what they believe .
The liberals are doing what they believe , also .
You seem to be saying the conservatives should abandon their beliefs .
beliefs are just that .
the virus has a certain epidemiological profile which is nasty .
SOME conservatives have been very reluctant to recognize this well grounded expert cautionary message .
why , i do n't know , that 's up to them to figure out .
liberals : I am not a liberal so I ca n't speculate too much .
liberals are no more one monolithic set than conservatives are , however .
so each may have his own thinking .
I can see from some ranting and raving however that they welcome any negative prospect which dims Trump 's reelection plans .
they will blame as much of this on him as they think they can get others to swallow .
even today we heard that it was all Trump 's fault , when actually , the main cause of covid-19 is a little virus named sars-cov-2 i think , and not Xi and not Trump .
However imperfectly the two of them reacted to it .
i urge people to get over the shyness and start wearing face masks if you have to go out .
right now people need to get with it , fast .
" New York 's Governor Andrew Cuomo ( D ) delivers an update on the state 's coronavirus response .
With the coronavirus death toll soaring in the United States and health experts warning that " no state , no metro area will be spared " by the outbreak , President Trump steeled the nation for an extended shutdown , dashing hopes of a quick resumption of normal life .
The announcement came hours after Trump was presented with a model showing that the novel coronavirus could lead to 100,000 to 200,000 U .
deaths , even with the current guidelines in place .
"  With this column Professor Turley becomes the pot calling the kettle black : " Todd returned to his feigned neutrality in asking presidential candidate Joe Biden if " there is blood on the president 's hands .
"  Talk about ' feigned neutrality ' ! For months Professor Turley has been running interference for Donald Trump ; making a concerted effort to distract readers from the latter 's inexcusable behavior .
Turley told us The Mueller Probe was essentially a ' deep state conspiracy ' and the quid pro quo was ' unworthy of impeachment ' .
Now Turley would have us believe that Trump 's response to this crisis has been perfectly earnest .
Only in the rightwing bubble could anyone make such a case .
Every day of this crisis Trump has managed to put out false and misleading statements .
One would think that even an uninspiring president , like Jimmy Carter , perhaps , could at least get their facts straight while deferring to experts when uncertain of specifics .
That 's not too much to ask of a president : ' Just get your facts straight and act like an adult ' .
We 've all known immature adults who were capable of sensible-sounding thoughts .
We 've all known alcoholics who can form astute observations however drunk they might be .
And we 've all known those low-potential types who surprise us occasionally with intelligent remarks .
Therefore it should strike everyone as suspicious that Donald Trump keeps putting out erroneous information .
Even a sociopathic narcissist should be capable of recognizing the seriousness of this crisis .
How tough could it be to stand at a podium expressing sincere thoughts ? Even second-rate actors can manage a few good takes on camera .
Not only does Trump fail to get his facts correct , he still has plenty of time for the Culture Wars .
Trump wasted a week trying to label this epidemic the ' Chinese Virus ' .
This sparked a mindless national arguement between Trumpers and everyone else .
Secretary of State Pompeo wasted a conference call with Group of 7 leaders attempting to get this plague recognized as the ' Wuhan Virus ' .
But the Group of 7 refused to play along .
Trump 's personal grievances still come first ; now more than ever ! His very recent attacks on " That woman governor in Michigan " are concrete evidence that Trump should have been impeached .
Whatever Trump might think of Gretchen Whitmore , this crisis is not the time for our president to be attacking governors .
Trump 's entire presidency only makes sense when one views him as a stooge for Vladimir Putin .
Only then do Trump 's relentless efforts to divide and confuse us really make sense .
No president could otherwise be so consistently obnoxious .
his comments about trump were immediately insulting and provocative .
the content was too thin for me to address and the conclusion that he is a putin stooge is preposterious and always was .
from the beginning it has been a vacuous slander and no amount of failure to prove the assertion has stopped some people from shamelessly repeating it again and again  Seth Joins the obnoxious Natch in attacking the website host Turley on a daily basis as dishonest shill for Trump .
this is pathetic .
If you think Turley is so dishonest then why grace his page every day with your august presence , Seth ? Move on to where your acidic pearls of wisdom are more appreciated .
it 's incredibly rude to someone who provides you with a comment platform , to insult them as dishonest so often .
if you disagree with Turley say so , just make your case .
Do n't attack him as disingenuous .
that 's uncivil , and poor thanks for giving you free space to rant on for years on end  " The president 's re-election campaign is threatening legal action against television stations in key battleground states if they continue to air a Priorities USA ad alleging Trump called the coronavirus a hoax .
Guy Cecil of Priorities USA discusses .
Aired on 3/26/2020 .
"  Blood on Trump 's hands ? This is a global pandemic .
It spread because Communist China allowed a live exotic animal market to continue after it had been warned they spread disease .
Then they arrested 8 of their own brave doctors who came forward to warn of this epidemic .
They were arrested for " disturbing the social order .
"  That was the culpable action responsible for deaths .
The CDC has egg on its face .
It released an assay that was slow , could only analyze 12 samples a day , and it was unreliable .
You never release an assay that has not pass rigorous QC testing .
But the CDC 's test was not accurate .
While they floundered , private industry came up with several variations of assays that could give same day results of tens of thousands of tests .
daily .
That 's the problem with government agencies that have slush funds .
They get lost in the weeds , getting monkeys drunk , without accountability .
The only major issue I have with Trump 's response is that I think he is over eager to get everyone back to work .
You do n't do that until the epidemic is on its way out , we have sufficient PPE for not only medical staff , but everyone , enough ventilators , a vaccine and medication , and enough medical personnel .
Waiting for a vaccine is not realistic , however , as that could take a year .
Health care workers are getting sick , as the number of patients rises .
That is the grim math of a pandemic .
My own asthma doctor is sick .
Karen , I agree with all your points , though you 're too light on Trump .
His " over eagerness " has led him to misrepresent facts multiple times and avoid taking appropriate actions early , while his constant bragging and self praise , coupled with finger pointing and threats to withhold federal aid , as well as his unwillingness to use the power at his disposal which governors do not and can not have , all add to his failure as a leader in a time of crisis .
As to America , one reason it spread so far and so soon was Trump 's lying : calling it a " hoax " , saying 15 cases would soon be 0 cases , lying about availability of a vaccine , lying about medical treatment , lying abut availability of testing , and trying to pivot blame somewhere , anywhere else .
Many states did n't think it was a big deal , so Florida beaches were open for spring break , Mardi Gras went on as usual , and many states were slow to close schools , churches , restaurants , etc .
, all of which contributed to the spread .
If he had not dismantled the NSC rapid pandemic response team and had not rejected the playbook left by the Obama Administration , we would n't be so far behind .
The national stockpile was woefully undersupplied , and masks and other PPE they did have were out of date .
What 's he been doing for 3+ years ?  As to the CDC , the WHO offered test kits , which Trump refused .
If the rapid response team had been left in place , we would n't be trying to play catch up with vaccine and chemotherapy development , supplies and testing .
This is the fault of Trump and his lack of leadership .
What appalls me the most is his lack of shame and his arrogance -- turning medical briefings into campaign ads .
Then , he creates a photo op by saluting the USNS Comfort , when he lied to get out of military service .
He is disgusting .
During Sunday night 's debate , while leveling criticism at President Donald Trump 's handling of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic , former Vice President Joe Biden said the Trump administration refused to get coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization .
" Look , the World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now .
We refused them .
We did not want to buy them .
We did not want to get them from them .
We wanted to make sure we had our own , " Biden said .
A similar claim about WHO test kits has also been circulating on Facebook .
The Biden campaign referred us to a Politico article that said the WHO shipped coronavirus tests to nearly 60 countries at the end of February , but the U .
was not among them .
That is technically correct , but it suggests that the United States would have been on the list under any circumstances .
The countries WHO helped are ones that lack the virology lab horsepower that exists across the United States .
The outreach work by the Pan American Health Organization is a case in point .
The group is WHO 's arm in the Americas .
It conducted trainings and sent materials to conduct tests to 29 nations .
The list included Paraguay , Bolivia , Argentina , Chile , Belize , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Honduras , Nicaragua and many others .
The group said it focused most of its efforts on " countries with the weakest health systems .
"  " No discussions occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States , " said WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris .
" This is consistent with experience since the United States does not ordinarily rely on WHO for reagents or diagnostic tests because of sufficient domestic capacity .
"  According to interviews with several infectious-disease experts , Biden 's statement leaves out context about how countries decided on which test they 'd use to identify the presence of the coronavirus .
WHO lists seven different approaches -- including that of China , the United States , Japan , Hong Kong , Thailand , France and Germany -- each one targeting different parts of the COVID-19 genetic profile .
There will no doubt be an investigation once this is over and everything and everyone that played a role will be looked at .
Now is certainly not the time to make conclusions over a war that is ongoing .
The MSM coverage reminds me of what I saw during the Vietnam War .
Body counts and opinion pieces centered on a war of our choosing .
However , we did n't choose this current war .
We did n't detect it on radar as it landed on our shores .
We did n't give it a visa to enter our country and train on flying into our communities .
The best example we have for modeling the response to this pandemic is the 2009 H1N1 pandemic .
And it took years to analyze everything about the H1N1 pandemic .
It will take years to analyze this one .
The politicization of this pandemic , less than 3 months in , will certainly be part of the after-action studies .
As it is highly likely the reporting out of China has been completely controlled by the government , it will be even more important to reaffirm the importance of a free press and their responsibilities that come from such a right .
The media 's response should be evaluated to determine how their coverage impacted our response .
The most irresponsible thing the media could be doing at this point is drawing conclusions without all the data .
Couple that with the Democrat 's despicable hog pile on the recent funding bill and one thing is abundantly clear ; they will stop at nothing to influence an election .
From what we 've seen over the last 6 months , Russia will certainly be rewriting their American election interference playbook .
They are amateurs compared with the Left in our own country .
Spoken by a true Fox News disciple : " you ca n't trust any media other than us .
" How pathetic -- setting the stage for eager receipt of Trump 's daily lies and discarding of anything contrary .
You know , no other media tells viewers , readers or listeners not to trust Fox .
BTW : Imperial College in London is the source for the estimated 1-2 million deaths if no containment measures were taken .
They probably lie , too .
Ask Hannity .
That 's certainly true .
And we have people giving out 1st quarter report cards as if it 's finals , on a subject matter no one had the correct answers to before the test .
This post is really the best example of what is measurable in real time and the professor has accurately graded the performance to date .
It 's actually past the finals : we are now in a logistics crisis until either herd immunity or a vaccine can be developed .
The only path forward now in the U .
to a ) do everything possible to deal with what within days will be a severe PPE shortage , a shortage of ventilators and hospital beds .
that 's days , not weeks .
The alligator closest to the boat now is logistics , ( There will be time to criminally prosecute the Trump administration for their refusal to be serious about the DPA act later on ) b ) call a nationwide social distance measure , and c ) do everything in your power to boost your own immune system .
Thank goodness Obama is n't President now .
He would still be formulating a task force to see what can be done to provide PPE etc .
The hospital ship would be delayed because he would want coverage that everything was done exactly the way intended so he could n't be blamed .
That would take a month .
he would make the ship go at quarter speed to save on power while reducing emissions .
By the time Obama got to half speed what is left us us would be wondering where to go on New Years Eve .
and he would 've instituted the NSC pandemic response plan , listened at intelligence briefings in late december when briefed on China and Covid 19 , not gotten himself impeached , aggressively tested for diagnostics , instituted a nationwide shelter in place and self quarantine plan early , activated the defense production act for real to massively produce the amount of PPE and ventilators needed complete with back up plans .
Fauci would 've literally lived in the oval office from december forward .
Empty poster or alias Paulie ( we have to separate the sock puppets from one another ) You neglected to tell us the guidelines of the pandemic team and how that would have changed things .
Meaningless generalizations is what one provides when they lack fact .
Perhaps we need to go back to those posts that you ran away from .
And a compliant media would be suggesting another Nobel prize for Obama .
It 's so disgusting that I believe we need laws to control their opinions expressed as facts .
Opinions can and will be partisan but MSM lost the definition of NEWS many years ago .
Americans have suffered as a result .
Since you mention the great one , President Barack HUSSEIN Obama II was the greatest President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces since Harry Truman .
Moreover , before his marriage he undoubtedly had " access " to the white women .
this is to " so why 'd you have to go on and all caps the Hussein ? " Kurtzie  And it would 've been helpful if the Trump administration had followed NSC pandemic guidelines , but it 's water under the bridge now .
The administration has presided over the worst national security screw up in U .
history -- but we have to play with the team we have now .
Effort is everything .
There is no longer time to make this a political issue .
Ideology is a luxury we just do n't have at this point .
There will be around 100k dead in a scenario that was entirely preventable with previously known information .
It 's definitely not time to keep head in sand .
We know the score , everything comes down to action .
It is easy to look up documents but after they were set up for a specific reason what did they do ? Did they attempt to develop new and faster techniques to provide drugs and vaccines .
Tell us .
Your overinflated ego leaves you without a voice .
The Chinese and WHO were saying different things from what we now know .
The big question is why Obama did n't replenish the masks during his term .
Another question is why did n't the pandemic task force see to it that we had adequate stocks ? Why did n't Cuomo buy ventillators when several years ago he was warned that he needed them ? Why are our supplies of needed medical things coming from abroad .
Trump has been advocating a change decades ago .
Democrats were against him on his attempts to stop so much outsourcing .
Lots of questions but the only one that acted was Trump and the Democrats pummeled him for any action he took .
Find a Democratic leader and blame him for the deaths we now see .
Democrats have blood on their hands .
The Democrats in the Senate , on Feb .
5th after being briefed by the administration on the Covid 19 status literally told them they needed to ask for emergency money for pandemic response and they either a ) did n't understand what the Dem senators were telling them , or b ) refused to admit is was a problem warranting any additional money .
Not exactly sure which belief was driving the administration .
, but both seem equally bad .
" The Democrats in the Senate , on Feb .
5th after being briefed by the administration on the Covid 19 status .
"  Why do n't you fill us in on these details with perhaps a name and a quote .
Your comment was unintelligable .
You said something having to do with needed " emergency money " .
You do know what the different branches of government do , do n't you ? You also know that Feb 5 was when the Senate dumped the House impeachment effort .
" Ca n't help you with your confusion , Allan .
You have to put in the work of learning your subjects .
"  The place where confusion exists is in your mind .
You think citing a source is the same thing as understanding what that source says .
That is a problem for you because sometimes the source you cite disagrees with you .
During this time period the Democrats were intent on impeaching the President not looking at any dangers to the country .
I think the Senate ended the impeachment Feb 5 , but during the Senate hearing Trump on Feb 2 started the Chinese Travel Ban .
I am sure when he did that in addition to calling him names for doing so some Democrats were probably wondering if they could n't impeach him for the travel ban .
The Democrats tied the hands of the country and people likely are dying because of the Democrats .
Trump was the first one in government to address the threat and in reality he addressed the non-specific threat years ago .
Kind of a hodge podge of a response there , not sure which part to address first .
Let 's start by tossing off the impeachment stuff because it has nothing to do with the process of vaccine development Let 's just say , Trump got impeached , he deserved to be impeached .
The trial in the Senate was happening concurrently to when things really began to heat up with Covid 19 .
But presidents have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time .
Trump did n't have to go to the trial , he should 've been acting as a president during those days .
Watching the trial on tv really is n't in his job description .
That aside : vaccine development .
The government is only loosely related .
NIH supplies grants for research , the CDC will be loosely related by staying apprised of where current research stands , academia and private pharmaceutical companies are where research and development happens .
Sure , as we saw Fauci confirm in the presser the other day , once a research entity tags on to something promising the government will supply funding through a partnership to bring the drug to market .
but we 're looking at a drawn out clinical testing process even after a drug or vaccine reaches that critical stage .
There really is n't much of a way to speed up the process without learning how to speed up human biology and physiology .
We 're working with a very deliberate process here .
Not only that , it 's putting ' the horse before the cart ' as far as pandemic response goes since it 's a long drawn out process .
As far as pandemic response goes , the Trump administration has really bungled the middle of the process .
Look at pandemic response like this : 1 .
isolation of pandemic origins&gt;&gt;block as much as possible transmission out of the area .
Trump administration response ? Chinese traveller ban .
Good job .
Much slower on response to Italy and South Korea travel bans .
Early diagnostic testing in the U .
&gt;&gt; abject failure by the Trump administration .
It 's getting better as of the last week , but it 's fully 10 weeks too late .
And really the only state that has become markedly better is NY .
By necessity because after Washington state , it 's the hot spot .
Take home point , in order to slow community spread of disease you have to know where it is .
That whole process was booted , and booted hard .
Interventional health care &gt;&gt; Abject failure of the Trump administration in what their responsibility here would be in activating the Defense Preparedness Act .
Trump says he 's done this , but has effectively only used it as a bargaining tool rather than using it as it was intended ; that being as a tool to acquire space , acquire materials , hire and put together the workforce and produce the product .
This is only to be used in emergencies .
Covid 19 is one .
The lack of the Trump administration to not accomplish is -- even as of this minute ! -- an epic fail .
This is especially critical with PPE and manufacture of ventilators .
Supply lines &gt;&gt; Given the shortage of ventilators needed , and the fact that we are fully 3 months behind in dealing with Covid 19 ; for the next 100 days or so until there can be a new influx of ventilators from manufacture ( beginning today ) , we 've got to deal with what we have .
Good news is that , not all areas will be hit at the same time due to some success with social distancing .
But , it is absolutely critical that the Pentagon is brought in to transport existing ventilators from area to area as critically needed .
No excuse .
If Trump does n't activate this immediately it 's tantamount to murder .
Manpower &gt;&gt; Xi offered Trump help last week .
Xi talks about this , Trump does n't .
There is absolutely no excuse not to hire Chinese doctors to come into the States to help manage this crisis because , a ) they 've already treated Covid 19 through the whole cycle , they are the world 's experts as a result , and b ) many of them got Covid 19 themselves and survived so have the degree of immunity necessary to get as up close as is required in urban hot spots .
The fact that Trump has proven incapable of entertaining this practice shows incredible short sightedness .
Establishing a national stay at home policy &gt;&gt; Some states have them , some states have n't .
Either way , it 's fallen to the governors to do it since the Trump administration refuses to .
They probably hoped the problem would go away .
Or as Trump said yesterday ' ride the bronco ' or whatever he said .
Bottom line : Being *fairly* quick on one travel ban , and *fairly* slow on two others and then focusing on chemotherapy development does NOT equal an effective pandemic response .
These areas of development I 've described are encompassed by the Pandemic Response plan of the National Security Council that the Trump administration **DID NOT PAY ATTENTION TO** .
Left to its own devices the Trump administration response has boiled down to ignoring Fauci until it 's too late at each stage , having to get talked down and reeled in by Fauci , and then grudgingly acquiescing to what he 'd been telling them all along and moving forward with no strategy and foresight .
So I basically wrote you a term paper .
We could go point by point and discuss this for months .
Basically , on the high side of this mess , it 's worthy of one of the biggest investigatory committee 's in the history of U .
government .
It will not look good on the other side for Trump and his administration .
, if Hillary Clinton had to testify for the deaths of 4 soldiers in Benghazzi , Trump absolutely will have to testify in the negligent and totally preventable deaths of 100-200 THOUSAND citizens .
There will be charges leveled .
It is n't , and wo n't be , pretty .
I think alias Paulie is trying to compete with Natacha .
Last time we had this type of discussion he could n't even finish round one before he ran away .
Let 's deal with this discussion one item at a time .
Quantity is not the same as quality .
" Kind of a hodge podge of a response there "  Do you mean establishing a time line is hodge podge ? The time line takes us through the important things having to do with what was known about the virus and how the country was ill served by trying to impeach a President instead of taking care of the problems they were supposed to take care of .
It also pointed out that Trump was the first one in our three branches to do something about the virus .
While he was under impeachment he instituted the Chinese Travel Ban .
Tell us what the Democrats did and explain how the above reply is a hodge podge .
Then we can go onto the next point .
Remember taking notes from what you read is not the same as understanding what was written nor the realities that exist in the world .
It 's impossible to deal with all your referrals that you have n't read and do n't understand .
so I refer you to the New York Public Library where you can get a lot of answers as to why you sound like an imbicile .
I 'm not saying you are an imbicile rather I am pointing out a source where you can find that information out .
You post a lot of sources without saying what it is that you are trying to say and why it is pertinent .
You are on the blog not the CDC .
You can Google but it appears you ca n't incorporate the data you Google .
The CDC is the one that should be answering a lot of questions .
The President has taken their advice along with the advice of a multiplicity of others .
He is not a scientist .
He is an executive that uses the talents of the people he works with .
What he accomplished in so little time is absolutely amazing .
FDR did similar things in war production when he was President .
He produced new planes but I do n't think he knew the technology .
I have /to leave for a bit .
Not playing the game anymore Allan .
Numerous times before you 've demanded source material .
I send it .
Then you cite some reason for not reading/trusting .
Then you accuse me of running/ being an imbecile/etc .
It 's important to spell correctly but it is more important to be able to think and understand what you read .
I 'm not the greatest typist , nor am I the greatest speller but I have a reasonable ability to think .
You have comprimised your ability to think by having a totally closed mind with limited abilities .
Take note of the word compromised that I typed wrong .
To you it looks really bad but I do n't worry to much about it as I put my energies into thinking .
I do n't even review what I write to you so I am sure that I have made many typing or spelling mistakes .
The spell check on this machine seems not to exist .
My typing and spelling , alias Paulie , has nothing to do with your lack of intelligent discussion .
I just responded to one of your replies that was incoherent .
That does matter because it demonstrates a lack of brain function .
The " press " includes scores of outlets , free of government control , and like in any human endeavor , mistakes will be made .
That does not absolve our one president from his obligation of acting responsibly , truthfully , and with the dignity required for true leadership during a crisis .
His happy talk misrepresenting of facts , failure to use the power he has to lead the nation , and now finger pointing ( with the infantile nick names ) belies his inability to meet the minimum standards for leadership and a personality transplant is not an option .
Hopefully he gets bored and stops showing up at his rallies .
I mean press conferences .
and lets the experts and Pence lead .
The " press " includes scores of outlets , free of government control , and like in any human endeavor , mistakes will be made .
That does not absolve our one president from his obligation of acting responsibly , truthfully , and with the dignity required for true leadership during a crisis .
The press have the luxury of reporting events that have happened .
The President and his team do n't have that luxury .
They have to work in real time and like any human endeavor , mistakes will be made .
We wo n't know for years what was the best this administration could have done .
You lack credible judgment on what passes for responsibility , truthfulness and dignity , given your assessment of the Obiden administration .
On the other hand , we can know today what the best the media could be doing .
If this is their best at reporting what has happened , then you deserve the angst you got .
