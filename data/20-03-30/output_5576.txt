NEW DELHI , Mar 30 : Availability of workers at factories and trucks for transportation has emerged as the biggest challenges for FMCG firms in ensuring steady supply of essential items during the lockdown , according to FMCG majors ITC , Dabur India , Parle Products , GCPL and Jyothi Laboratories .
The companies said there is a need for reassurance from authorities for workers to return and resume duties , while assuring that despite the manpower shortage , there would be steady supply of essential items with stocks adequate for up to two-three weeks .
Addressing of local issues in many states that have hindered movement of goods would certainly help in kick-starting the functioning of the supply chain , they said .
" Our inventory level is comfortable at this point of time and we have 2-3 weeks of stock with us and we are quite hopeful of production to resume if the situation on the ground comes back to normal .
Though we have certain concerns such as workers being stopped and migrated to hometowns due to lockdown , " Jyothy Labs Joint Managing Director Ullas Kamath told PTI in an e-mailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge supply chain -- from sourcing raw materials to transportation of goods from factories to warehouses , godowns to finally the retail market -- which requires massive manpower .
" Since most of them are immigrants from other states , they have already gone back .
The need for them to return is crucial and some assurance is required from the authorities for them to do so , " Kamath said adding that " once the situation eases , we are hopeful that the entire sector will pull up towards revival " .
Expressing similar views , Godrej Consumer Products Ltd ( GCPL ) Managing Director and CEO Vivek Gambhir said , " The number of workers reporting to factory/distributor locations is still very low due to social pressure and safety concerns .
Many difficulties are being faced in transportation , with a significant shortage of trucks .
"  He further said , " Companies will need to work closely with government authorities to ensure adequate availability of workers and trucks to put the supply chain back on track .
Alongside , the district authorities will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideally online .
"  Dabur India Executive Director ( Operations ) Shahrukh Khan also said the key issue that still remains is the availability of manpower and workers to run these operations .
" With most workers either leaving for their hometowns or staying at home during the lockdown , it would be a challenge to ensure smooth functioning , " he added .
Sharing similar experience , an ITC spokesperson said , " While we have progressively obtained permissions in some states , availability of trucks continues to be the biggest challenge at the moment .
Interstate and local truck movement has been severely impacted together with the challenge of shortage of manpower in factories .
"  Expressing similar views , Parle Products Senior Category Head Mayank Shah said , " The biggest challenge today is manpower .
The new challenge facing the companies now is how to continue running their plants in absence of labour .
"  Most of the labour in manufacturing plant are migrant workers .
With the moving back to native places , there is going to be a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies to produce to meet demand , Shah said that with 50 per cent of workers allowed , production is being managed through shift systems .
" Quantum of production would go down substantially but the idea is to ensure that at least there is food available on the shelves and at no point in time , there should be any panic in the market , " he said , adding that there would not be complete absence of food for 5-6 days , even if any shop runs out of stick it would be available the next day .
Commenting on how soon the situation is likely to stabilise , the ITC spokesperson said , " We believe it will take a few more days for the entire ecosystem and processes to be streamlined for movement of essential goods .
"  On the movement of goods , Khan said the situation has eased a bit with approvals for plant operations and movement of trucks coming in .
