Oil prices are languishing at 17-year lows as the coronavirus pandemic threatens a painful global recession that could further sap demand .
US President Donald Trump , a close ally of the Saudi crown prince , on Monday said he would soon be talking with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin about plunging oil prices and the impact on US producers .
Saudi Arabia , the world 's top oil exporter which already announced a sharp production increase for April , said it would add additional supplies to the global market , deepening a glut .
" The kingdom plans to raise its petroleum exports by 600,000 bpd from May , so total exports will increase to 10 .
million bpd , " said an official at the energy ministry , cited by the state-run Saudi Press Agency .
Saudi Arabia had been exporting around 7 .
million barrels per day under an output reduction agreement among a 24-member producers ' alliance known as OPEC+ which included Russia .
Its Gulf neighbour the United Arab Emirates has also pledged to pump at least one million bpd more from next month .
Riyadh said earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April after a production cut agreement among top producers flopped in early March .
OPEC+ failed to reach an agreement on further production cuts to shore up sagging prices as the coronavirus hit the global economy hard .
In an effort to grab market share , Saudi Arabia immediately announced a substantial increase in its production to 12 .
million bpd and exports to 10 million bpd at the beginning of April .
The energy ministry said it would secure the increase from two sources , by using natural gas in the domestic market to free up oil for export and also as domestic consumption drops because of the coronavirus .
-- ' Harder for renewables ' --  Saudi Arabia has shrugged off criticism that its aggressive strategy could bankrupt its oil-producing rivals , indicating it was no longer willing to play the role of " swing producer " that bears the burden of stabilising the markets .
Despite the oil crash piling pressure on the Saudi economy , analysts say its latest moves are part of a deliberate long-term strategy to capture greater market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman " has embarked on a policy of capturing market share rather than trying to set the price , " said Bernard Haykel , a Saudi expert at Princeton University .
" By keeping prices depressed , Saudi policy will not just drive more expensive forms of oil production out of the market ; it will also make it harder for renewable energy to compete with fossil fuels -- at least in the near term .
"  The price of oil struck its lowest levels in more than 17 years on Monday , with Brent North Sea crude tumbling to $22 .
per barrel at one point .
There are warnings that oil could sink even further as storage tanks around the world approach full capacity .
In a letter last week to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , a group of US senators accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of waging " economic warfare against the United States " .
" During this time of pandemic and global economic crisis , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has chosen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in the letter .
" Riyadh 's motivation may be multi-faceted -- to punish the Russians , to capture near-term market share , to destabilise long-term investment in American energy .
