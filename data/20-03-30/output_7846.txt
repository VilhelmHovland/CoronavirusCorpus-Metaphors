How ready is the bankruptcy system for the coming wave of distress ?  For small businesses , the prospects are bleak .
Thousands may be rescued by the funding available to individuals and small businesses under the Cares Act stimulus .
But most of those that wind up in bankruptcy will go under , even with new provisions Congress enacted last year to make it easier for small businesses to reorganize in bankruptcy .
The prognosis in chapter 11 for larger businesses is much better .
The corporate reorganization rules were created in and for times of severe economic crisis -- the railroad failures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- including nearly every major airline that went bankrupt in the 1990s and early 2000s .
Given this record of success , it is tempting to urge Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to let the biggest corporations fend for themselves in bankruptcy court , despite the $500 billion of lending authority he and the Federal Reserve have at their disposal under recent emergency provisions .
Many of our fellow business and finance scholars advocate this approach , as do progressives like Robert Reich , condemning any use of taxpayer money to bail out large corporations .
We were among the earliest critics of the ad hoc bailouts of 2008 , and we strongly believe investors , rather than taxpayers , should absorb corporate losses as much as possible .
When an individual corporation falls into distress , no matter how big or important , chapter 11 -- not a bailout -- is the best solution .
But chapter 11 has clear limitations .
The bankruptcy system is not well-designed for a complete economic shutdown .
Corporate reorganization depends on experienced lawyers and judges to manage its complexity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could easily be overwhelmed if entire industries file for bankruptcy .
If the courts are congested , cases become costlier and take longer , as shown by a recent study by Ben Iverson of Brigham Young University .
Absent federal assistance , corporate debtors might also be unable to obtain the funding they need to maintain their operations and protect current jobs during the case .
By providing cash to companies that suddenly have no liquidity , Mr .
Mnuchin may enable some to avoid bankruptcy altogether .
At least as important , the lending authority can be used to ensure that the companies that do file for chapter 11 are not forced to do so all at once .
By " flattening the curve " -- making sure the filings are staggered -- he can ease the pressure on the bankruptcy system .
Treasury could also adapt its administration of chapter 11 to suit the current crisis , much as the government helped transform auto companies into the " arsenal of democracy " during World War II .
Mnuchin could encourage some companies to file " prepackaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations and can be approved by a bankruptcy judge in as few as 30 days .
With larger companies , Mr .
Mnuchin could make bankruptcy a condition of receiving a federal loan .
Because bankruptcy enables an " automatic stay " on a company 's debt payments , it would provide more relief than a loan or grant outside bankruptcy .
Temporary debt relief would buy companies time to sell assets and minimize their need for taxpayer support .
Unfortunately , a curious provision in the Cares Act discourages regulators from making loans to " medium sized " companies with between 500 and 10,000 employees if they are in bankruptcy .
Ideally , this provision would be removed or replaced with new language that allows loans to any company in bankruptcy .
But as it stands , the provision would n't prevent a loan followed by a subsequent prepackaged bankruptcy .
For the bankruptcy system to work , it needs to be treated as a backup , not the front line .
The fewer and more carefully managed the bankruptcies , the better the system will function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and using the liquidity support authorized by the Cares Act to buttress the system , regulators can ensure that chapter 11 is ready for the essential role it will soon be playing .
