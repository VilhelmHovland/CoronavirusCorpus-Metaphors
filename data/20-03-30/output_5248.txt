We received that call last week .
Hours before our family in Ireland were due to pick up my father in law from an extended stay in hospital after surgery , they received a call and were informed that he had developed a slight cough and as a precaution .
They wanted to test him for COVID-19 before they would let him home .
This was our worst nightmare .
The following day we received the call that devastated everyone , he returned a positive result .
In the space of 24 hours , our family had gone from the high of thinking he was finally coming home to the realisation that this now might not happen .
My husband got a three minute FaceTime call that day with his father , he was in good form , even reminding him NOT to fly home and waste his money .
" Well , this worked out well then , " he replied with a chuckle .
As usual , he always had the last laugh .
Amazingly , the following day we were told he was stable and they felt he only had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be home in two weeks .
24 hours later they reported he had had a temperature overnight but was stable , but an hour later the family were called saying he was now in critical condition , they were to come to the hospital immediately -- this is how fast this virus changes .

Love Life  The Unexpected Silver Lining  Mamamia Out Loud  ADVERTISEMENT  The doctor informed our family that they should come to say their goodbyes .
The visit was under strict conditions , they could only see him one at a time , had to wear a full hazmat suit , mask , double gloves and absolutely no contact was allowed .

We were able to FaceTime one last time with him , he was on a ventilator , we could tell that there would be no great escape , he was dying and it was now only a matter of time .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness , to watch my husband ask his father to keep fighting .
They spoke about how proud they were of each other and told one another they loved them .
My distraught mother and sister in law were the only ones allowed in the room as he passed away .
Once again , they were in full hazmat suits , unable to touch him , give him a final kiss or my mother in law lay beside him one last time in the bed .
During times like this , you want to grab your loved ones , hug them tight , kiss them and comfort them and not let go .
When you are COVID-19 positive , none of these instinctively comforting things are possible .
All they could do was comfort each other with words , he passed away peacefully .
The cremation took place two days later , we watched via FaceTime .
Again , there were strict social distancing rules in place which meant they were unable to console one another .
My mother in law sat alone on a chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within two meters of one another around the coffin .
It is something I 'll never forget .
There was no eulogy , no loving stories , no grandkids or other family and friends allowed to attend and pay their respects .
It was over in 10 minutes .
All of our family are now in self-isolation , away from their families for 14 days , they do n't want to risk infecting any of their loved ones .
It means they are grieving alone , without their family or friends able to come to see them as are we here in Australia .
It is an impossible situation .
We consider ourselves lucky .
We got to say goodbye to my charming father in law Michael Glynn Snr ( aka Mick the Moan ) , taxi man from Dublin , father of six , grandfather of 12 , husband to his devoted wife .
He was only 78 years old and we would all do anything to get one more laugh , one more birthday , one more Christmas , just one more chat .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  ADVERTISEMENT  We are telling this very personal story for the nurses in the hospital that treated my father in law .
They asked the family to share their story on social media as they felt that not everybody was taking self-isolation as seriously as they should be in Ireland and it is the same here in Australia .
We can not put into words how supportive and amazingly brave all of the staff are in hospitals .
We have witnessed this first hand .
On a daily basis , they are risking infection or infecting their loved ones when they are exposed to increasing numbers of patients .
Working long hours , the feeling of helplessness when having to inform families there is nothing they can do , all takes a huge toll on them as well .
Think of them and what they are going through on a daily basis next time you decide to go outside when it is not really essential .
Stay home , practice self-isolation , be kind to one another , there will be plenty of time go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now .
