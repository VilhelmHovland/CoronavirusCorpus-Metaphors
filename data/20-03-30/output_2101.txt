Isolation : Old habits are proving dangerously hard to break  The City of Toronto closed all park amenities as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic ( CP/Rachel Verbin )  Canadians are increasingly likely to practice physical distancing as the Coronavirus pandemic continues to spread , new polling shows .
But despite repeated grave warnings from political leaders and public-health officials , many Canadians , especially younger Canadians , are still getting together with friends and family .
Two waves of polling , a week apart , by Toronto 's Innovative Research Group suggest more and more Canadians are taking the message of physical distancing as a way to slow the virus 's spread to heart .
When asked , " How much have you changed your day-to-day behaviour in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to others ? " 56 per cent said they 'd changed their behaviour " a great deal " in polling conducted March 24-26 .
That 's up 24 points from the 32 per cent who gave the same answer to the same question March 16-18 .
Innovative asked whether respondents have changed their habits " a great deal , " " quite a bit , " " very little , " or " not at all .
" Those who reported changing a great deal or quite a bit amounted to 84 per cent of the sample group , up from 65 per cent a week earlier .
Those who are changing their behaviour very little or not at all were only 15 per cent , down from 34 per cent a week earlier .
But that 15 per cent includes 22 per cent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 34 .
And Innovative found that when respondents were asked about specific behaviours , they were likelier to reply that they 'd done sociable things even when they were supposed to be staying alone .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or friend in their home in the past week ; 23 per cent had hosted a relative or friend in their own home ; and 15 per cent said they 'd gathered with a small group inside someone 's home .
The overall trend lines are encouraging , Greg Lyle , president of Innovative Research Group , said in a telephone interview .
Across age groups , the number of Canadians reporting they were playing fast and loose with urgent pleas to isolate fell by half in a week .
But the fact that some persist , and that more admit to individual categories of social behaviour even though they claim in general to have been keeping to themselves , suggests some are simply confused about what public officials are asking them to do .
" It does n't seem like people fully understand what the authorities mean when they say self-isolate , " Lyle said .
" It means never leave your home .
It means never let someone else come .
"  Innovative also polled on respondents ' perception of the economy .
The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less so about their own financial situation -- suggesting governments ' massive intervention to shore up Canadians ' finances may be having an effect on public perceptions .
The crisis is hitting home .
Some 47 per cent say their household has faced a negative financial impact from the pandemic , and 39 per cent say someone in their house is working fewer hours or has lost work entirely .
And 48 per cent say they believe the economy is headed into a " severe " recession , up from only 11 per cenrt a month earlier and the highest level ever in Innovative 's tracking .
For all that , respondents ' confidence in their own household finances is down only four points from last month , at 57 per cent .
The results of the Innovative Research Group survey are from an online sample of 2,411 adult Canadians , March 24 to 26 .
Results are weighted by age , gender and region to ensure that the overall sample 's composition reflects that of the actual population according to Census data .
