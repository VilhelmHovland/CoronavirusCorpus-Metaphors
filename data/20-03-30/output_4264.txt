JSE cautions on impact of new debt rating  Mar 30 , 2020  The decision by Moody 's on Friday ( 27 March 2020 ) to downgrade South Africa 's long term foreign and local currency debt ratings to ' Ba1 ' from ' Baa3 ' and maintain its negative outlook , was unfortunate though not unexpected .
This is according to a statement from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ( JSE ) , which points out that South Africa 's debt rating is now rated below investment grade by all three major ratings agencies : Standard &amp; Poor 's , Fitch and Moody 's .
The biggest impact of the downgrade , says JSE Group CEO Leila Fourie , would be in the bond market as South African government bonds will fall out of the FTSE World Government Bond Index ( WGBI ) , sparking an outflow of investment grade capital in the run up to and including the April rebalancing .
Foreign investors own 37% , or about R780-billion , of South Africa 's local-currency bonds , according to National Treasury data .
" While index exclusion is likely to force outflows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers could pick up the slack , limiting some of the net market fall out , " Fourie says .
" The world capital markets are efficient , and they have already priced in the sub-investment grade risk that South Africa reflects , which is a slight relief .
In fact , I believe we could see a partial bounce back after an initial negative reaction settle .
"  She cautions that markets would in the interim period more likely be punctuated by Covid-19 news flow : " Markets and people are not reacting the way they might have in the past because of the sense of panic and uncertainty .
" During a time of crisis , the information value from ratings agencies can be drowned out by other factors influencing market movements .
In fact , right now Covid-19 and the epidemiological forecasts outweigh Moody 's agency downgrade as they are better predictors of government action and economic growth .
"  Moody 's noted South Africa 's continued deterioration in fiscal strength and structurally weak economic growth supported its decision to downgrade .
The agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GDP and the government deficit to widen to 8 .
of GDP in the near term .
Moody 's announcement came at the end of the first day of South Africa 's 21-day lockdown period as part of the government 's bid to break the chain of transmission of the Covid-19 virus .
" Junk status will have major implications for us as a country and could fast-track structural reform in the country , accompanied by tectonic political and economic shifts , " says Fourie .
" There 's no doubt that navigating through this will require incredible courage and resolution , but South Africa is renowned for just that ; achieving it in 1994 and again in 2018 .
"  With regard to the impact on the real economy , she says : " There is no doubt that the downgrade will impact the cost of capital of our banks too , who wo n't be able to pierce the sovereign ceiling so the cost of borrowing for South Africans is going to increase .
" In President Cyril Ramaphosa , the country has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should fill everyone with immense confidence , " Fourie concludes .
