Ian Bancroft -- Chief Executive  Mark Pritchard -- Leader of the Council  Over the past two weeks we 've been forced to make lots of changes to our services in response to Covid-19 .
We 've made these changes to support UK Government measures , to help keep both you and our employees safe , and to make sure we can keep our most important ( ' critical ' ) services going .
the services that people really depend on .
We 've made a lot of the big changes we need to make , and -- as we all settle into this new way of life for the time-being -- we might have less to tell you each day , and we 'll only issue these updates when they 're needed .
But rest assured .
we 'll keep you informed about any changes to council services that might affect you .
Please keep following the Government 's social distancing instructions .
Stay at least two metres away from anyone you do n't live with , and only leave the house to :  Shop for basic necessities like food .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical need or care for/ help a vulnerable person .
Travel to and from work where it 's absolutely necessary .
Please continue to keep your distance from one another .
By staying apart , we 're saving lives , and helping to keep Wrexham as safe as it can be .
We 've put together the following information to help you understand the latest changes to council services .
Crematorium services  Last week -- to support social distancing -- we introduced a limit of 30 people at services at the crematorium in Pentrebychan .
We 're now reducing that limit to 20 attendees who are immediate relatives of the deceased .
We know this is a difficult time for families wishing to say goodbye to loved ones , and hope people understand that we 're bringing in these measures to help keep them safe and reduce opportunities for the virus to spread .
Parks , open spaces and play areas  Please remember to adhere to social distancing in parks and public open spaces .
The Government says people can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parks and open spaces can provide places for people to walk and exercise .
However , you should only use your local parks ( you should n't be jumping in a car to drive to parks in other parts of the county borough ) and you must adhere to social distancing -- staying at least two metres away from anyone you do n't live with .
We 've also asked dog-owners to keep their pets on leads .
to reduce the chances of people having to get close to each other ( for example , if two dogs start playing or fighting , and the owners have to get close to separate them ) .
So please keep your dog on a lead .
Finally , remember that all council-managed play areas are shut , so please do n't use them .
Gardening allotments  Our gardening allotments remain open , but the same message applies .
please stick to social distancing .
So if you own an allotment , stay at least two metres away from other gardeners when you visit your plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispose of any gardening waste at your allotment .
Waste and recycling  Reminder -- garden waste  We were due to implement a new garden waste collection service in April that residents would have to pay for each year .
We 're now suspending the introduction of that service , and will continue to collect everyone 's garden waste for free for as long as we can .
We 're unable to issue any refunds , but if you 've already paid the ? 25 you 'll get a full 12 months service from when the scheme begins .
so you wo n't lose out .
You do n't need to contact us , as we have a full record of customers who 've paid so far .
To help ease pressure on our Contact Centre staff , we wo n't be taking payments for the new scheme until further notice , and will only be handling enquiries for critical services .
If you have n't already paid , do n't panic .
We 'll start taking payments again when the emergency is over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new service .
Easing pressure on our Contact Centre staff is really important , as people with underlying health conditions will be receiving letters from the Government in the next few days , and some of them will need to contact us for support .
