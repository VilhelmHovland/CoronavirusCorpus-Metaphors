Former minister reacts as president orders lockdown of Lagos , Abuja , Ogun  Former Minister of Education , Oby Ezekwesili , has said that President Muhammadu Buhari 's nationwide broadcast will help to bring all the separate interventions into an integrated response strategy .
Newsmen recall that Buhari had , during a nationwide broadcast on Sunday , ordered a lockdown of Abuja , Lagos , and Ogun States , respectively , in a move to curtail the spread of Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) to other states .

Ezekwesili tweeted : " The speech @NGRPresident read was quite substantial and helped to bring all the separate interventions into an integrated response strategy to Nigerians .
" In regular times , a Leader is the Chief Coordinator and mobilizer-in-chief of society not to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take so much drama to get @MBuhari to speak to his Citizens .
" Hopefully next time when Citizens make germane demands to hear from a President who willingly took on the constitutional duty to serve , his courtiers will know not to be a nuisance to Nigeria .
" What remains unpersuasive in the @email protected#COVID19 Response Strategy is evidence of effective interventions that will help support the livelihood of the poorer segment of our population who are already bleeding from the loss of income because of  #StayHomeOrders .
" Capable individuals and organizations are already providing a lot of safety net support for the poorer segment of our population , but it wo n't suffice .
Governments -- Federal and State have the reach and scale to safeguard against Covid 19 loss of income &amp; livelihood .
" Regardless of how much orchestrated attacks courtiers of the FG launch against citizens who speak up to demand @MBuhari 's responsiveness and accountability , they must never be the reason you shut up .
Speak on -- best regard you 're being called names by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stories  Announcing this Monday night , the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) said 13 of the cases were from Lagos , four from the Federal Capital Territory ( FCT ) , Abuja , two from Kaduna and one from Oyo State .
