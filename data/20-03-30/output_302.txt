Last week , Giuliani photographed the doctors and nurses who are treating dozens of coronavirus patients at Pesaro 's San Salvatore hospital .
He was not psychologically ready , he told me , for what he saw there .
Two floors of the hospital had been entirely transformed into critical-care units ; patients on the second floor were unconscious .
Giuliani decided to set up his camera on that floor , hoping that the air would be " cleaner " with the patients breathing into ventilators .
A nurse cried in the hallway .
" They do what they usually do , but they know it does n't help , " Giuliani said .
" But they keep doing that because it 's the only thing they can do .
It 's very heavy to carry .

She cries every night when she comes home , she said , and has trouble sleeping through the night .
The day before we spoke , she had intubated the father of a friend .
" We are exhausted physically and emotionally but we must go on , " Silvestri wrote in an email after we got off the phone .
" People call us heroes but we do n't feel like heroes , we are medical doctors trying our best to do the right thing for our patients .
We are here to save everybody but as time passes we have understood that this is not possible due to the high number of cases and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless .
"  On Friday , a former colleague of Silvestri 's died in the San Salvatore ICU .
He was a retired doctor who had been working in a private clinic .
He specialized in respiratory medicine .
