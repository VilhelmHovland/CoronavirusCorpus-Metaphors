In this post , Virtual Immersive user experience director Saxon Dixon discusses how brands can turn their offline activity into digital experiences in the wake of the current coronavirus crisis .
The dizzying speed and scale of the coronavirus outbreak has led to unprecedented disruption of public life and business .
Saxon Dixon  Realistically , the effects of COVID-19 are going to be felt for the next 12 months and likely much longer than that .
As a result , brands will be looking at the current situation with uncertainty and potentially reduced marketing budgets .
Should we slow down our marketing spend or do we increase our online activity ? Do we focus on short term revenue generating strategies , or take the opportunity to deliver magic and value for our consumers with longer term brand building ?  It 's been proven that an increase in marketing spend during a recession can help a brand gain a long-term advantage .
During the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-2009 , the brands that continued to spend on marketing were those that remained strongest and recovered most quickly afterwards .
As consumers we are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less time spent in social environments with family and friends , and more time connected to the internet .
In times like these , people need some form of escapism and positivity .
We need something cheerful amidst the 24/7 bad news , and this can be delivered through fun and rewarding digital content experiences .
According to QuestMobile , the daily time spent with mobile internet in China rose from 6 .
hours in early January to 7 .
hours , when workers were placed in self-quarantine .
For brands and agencies COVID-19 should be viewed as an opportunity to rethink their online strategies .
In tough trading conditions there is a tendency for brands to stop brand building and focus on performance based advertising , in order to maximise sales .
This might deliver some short term revenue , but it is not a guarantee for success post crisis .
When the world recovers from the effects of COVID-19 , the way we live our daily lives may be changed forever .
Long-term effects come from delivering lasting impressions that can keep your brand relevant , trusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't necessarily have to drive an immediate sale , it can be experience driven .
Brands that have the bravery , ingenuity and creativity to think laterally and plan for the long term will be best placed to ride out the storm and come out the other side .
So how does interactive digital content work in a market turned upside down ?  We are currently working around the clock to help teams transition their offline activity , developing a variety of alternative digital experiences in some of the hardest hit industries such as retail , experiential and sport .
It is our job to bring the outside world digitally into the living rooms of consumers , and enable them to engage with brands , sporting teams , products , everything .
in a world of augmented reality there are no physical boundaries .
Experiential : Physical events , major conferences and exhibitions have been replaced with digital alternatives .
Apart from the obvious live streaming , or conferences being held in virtual reality , we are utilising a variety of real-time technologies to create immersive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gamification driven single and multi user collaborative content , is a very effective and engaging alternative to large scale physical exhibits .
Retail : Augmented reality is a way to create exciting online experiences as a replacement for high street shopping , now that bricks-and-mortar retailers have been forced to close .
With web based AR we can create virtual changing rooms so consumers can try on clothes , accessories and cosmetics .
For products with scale , size and design considerations such as furniture , white goods and cars , we can use product visualisation tools that allow users to view true to life versions of these products in their own space .
Social : Whilst self-isolating , it is important to keep in touch with our social networks .
Thankfully , technology enables us to do this with ease using platforms like Facebook , Instagram , Tiktok and Snapchat .
We are already seeing amazing creativity from people posting UG content through these platforms and brands can get in on the act too , by creating fun and authentic augmented reality effects for their campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 crisis , which is tragic for players , clubs and fans alike .
For brands that are invested into sponsorships , there is an opportunity for them to become the gate-way for fans to engage with their favourite players and teams .
English Premier League clubs have already opted to carry on their seasons on Championship Manager , and branded gamification can be used to connect clubs with their fans during this time of need .
Last Friday we saw AFL Sydney Swans coach , John Longmire , give his pre game speech for what would have been the Swans first home game of the season .
Delivered in his living room , to his less than impressed daughter , on social media .
Fans love those moments , a look inside the real lives of their sporting heroes .
There is an enormous opportunity for developing a deeper relationship between the fans and their sporting heroes when they feel that they are getting access to the ' inner sanctum ' .
We believe sponsors could be looking at fresh ways to engage fans with the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Travel : Although no-one can physically travel at the moment , with augmented reality portals users can literally walk into another world in full 360 .
The white sand and turquoise water of theMaldives , animals in a game park in Africa , the magic of snow covered Salzburg : users can experientially explore the world from their living room , and build amazing itineraries that can be realised when travel becomes possible again .
Real Estate : With in-person property viewings no longer possible , virtual walk throughs are an essential tool for real estate agents to showcase properties to potential buyers .
Via interactive 360 videos we can create digital versions of residential or commercial properties that allow buyers to experience the size , scale and layout in their own time .
We are certainly not downplaying the tragic human and economic cost of this pandemic , but at some pointhumanity will move on from a dark time changed .
In the face of this new reality , we are already seeing organisations respond with ingenuity , conjuring new ways to conduct business and preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable hardship and the big advancements from this outbreak remain to be seen .
For brands this is a time to recognise that new consumer behaviours and habits are already being formed .
Focus on the needs of the consumer and create authentic , meaningful and long term connections through digital experiences .
