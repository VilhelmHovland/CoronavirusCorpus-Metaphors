"  EU member states suspend airport slot requirements until Oct .
24  The European Council says EU member states have suspended airport slot requirements until Oct .
The move aims to ease the impact of the coronavirus crisis on aviation and help airlines adjust to the falling demand caused by the epidemics .
Under EU regulations , airlines are required to operate 80 per cent of their allocated slots for take off or landing at a congested airport at a certain time of the day .
If they do n't abide by this rule , they face losing their right to the slot .
" It seems clear now that this crisis will not be over very soon .
Waiving the use it or lose it ' rule until October will help mitigate the heavy economic impact on airlines and give them certainty over the whole summer season , " said Oleg Butkovic , the Croatian minister for the Sea , Transport and Infrastructure .

She says the drop was due to social distancing and confinement measures in place for the past two weeks .
The official says the main worry for the government now was the pressure on the country 's intensive care units because it could arrive 2 or 3 weeks after the infection .
Sierra says , " Reducing the pressure on the ICUs will be important for considering de-escalation measures .
