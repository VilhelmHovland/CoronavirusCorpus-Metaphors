airlines are asking for nearly $60 billion in direct assistance and loan guarantees , vastly dwarfing the $15 billion made available after the attacks of Sept .
11 , 2001 , as airlines worldwide continue to plea for government help from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak .
In addition , A4A asked for $29 billion in loans or loan guarantees , a rebate for some federal excise taxes collected from the beginning of the year through the end of March and a repeal of certain excise taxes through the end of 2021 .
A source with knowledge of negotiations said airports , themselves facing billions of dollars in losses , are expected to request $10 billion in federal assistance .
Also Monday , some 60 of the world 's air carriers , representing more than half of airline capacity globally , made an unprecedented and urgent plea for government assistance .
Their plea , made through the three biggest international airline alliances , which allow partners to share booking arrangements , urged " governments worldwide to prepare for the broad economic effects from actions taken by states to contain the spread of COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline industry during this unprecedented period .
"  They echoed previous calls to suspend " use-it-or-lose-it " rules that set a minimum level of service at capacity-constrained airports , or else airlines lose those " slots .
" The FAA has already done so at several U .
airports through May , but the alliances hope regulators will consider extending suspensions through the summer .
They also asked other parts of the industry for help -- specifically , they want airports to reconsider their landing charges and fees .
But airports are experiencing their own financial cliff , with Airports Council International-North America estimating losses at $8 .
billion .
Last week , Bloomberg reported that White House officials were talking about letting airlines keep ticket taxes or fees that are used to fund airport upgrades , among other things .
But airports are sure to fight hard against such a move , and it may not have enough support in Congress .
On Monday , the Air Line Pilots Association , the major union for pilots , wrote to President Donald Trump , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " unequivocal that any economic relief package must contain strong labor protections .
"  And Sara Nelson , the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA , on Twitter called for direct payroll subsidies to flight attendants , pilots , ground workers and caterers , among others .
" Absent payroll subsidies , mass layoffs and furloughs are inevitable , " Nelson wrote .
" This will have long-term consequences because nearly all aviation-related workers have to pass background checks and security and safety training requirements .
"  Separately , the consultancy the Centre for Aviation has argued that " most airlines in the world " could be bankrupt in less than three months .
" Coordinated government and industry action is needed -- now -- if catastrophe is to be avoided , " CAPA said , adding that " many airlines have probably already been driven into technical bankruptcy , or are at least substantially in breach of debt covenants .
"  Amid the crisis , " the government response has been fragmented -- and is being resolved along national lines , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , the likely tepid response to the airline crisis will equally be fragmented and nationally based .
It will consist mostly of bailing out selected national airlines .
If that is the default position , emerging from the crisis will be like entering a brutal battlefield , littered with casualties .
"  CAPA added that the major U .
airlines , specifically , " ( supported by unions ) will have the lobbying power to access government subsidies ; they are already working hard to achieve that .
"  But Judson Rollins , an industry consultant , wrote for the blog Leeham News and Analysis that U .
airlines are " not at imminent risk of bankruptcy , " even if domestic travel restrictions are put in place .
" US airlines have plenty of time for demand to recover -- or the US government to step in with emergency loans or grants , " such as what occurred after the Sept .
11 , 2001 attacks , " Rollins wrote .
" Every US carrier can survive at least three months -- and longer with capacity , staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Daniel Radcliffe and Erin Darke on Being the First Celebrity Coronavirus Hoax  As the ancient proverb dictates , no international pandemic is complete without an accompanying celebrity hoax .
In the case of our current global crisis , that honor was bestowed upon Daniel Radcliffe .
In mid-March , a Twitter account with the handle @BBCNewsTonight reported that the actor had contracted coronavirus , making him " the first famous person to be publicly confirmed .
" The tweet was shared hundreds of times before Twitter suspended the account , including by journalists at theNew York Times and Politico .
Another journalist , me , also thought the tweet was real for a split second and texted Radcliffe 's long-time girlfriend Erin Darke , who 's a friend , asking if she and Daniel were okay .
By the time my text had gone through , I realized that I was , in fact , an idiot whose non-existent journalism degree should be rescinded .
Soon afterward , BuzzFeed spoke to the people behind the hoax , a group of 33 anonymous people who said they did it because " it was funny , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lowering people 's IQ .
" They chose Radcliffe because " we needed someone who was famous but not famous enough to be unbelievable .
" Radcliffe himself good-naturedly joked about the rumor days later during a round of pre-scheduled press for Endgame , a play he was performing in across the pond until the pandemic shuttered it .
In one interview , he wondered if those behind the hoax had chosen him because he " looks ill all the time .
"  I was interested in hearing more , so I called up Radcliffe and Darke .
They talked about what it was like to be the unwitting subject of a celebrity pandemic hoax -- and years of unhinged gossip -- and how they 've been faring otherwise .
Where are you guys holed up ? Erin Darke:We 're in New York , at Daniel 's apartment .
We decided to be super-responsible and self-quarantine so we have n't stepped out of the apartment in .
11 days ?  Radcliffe : We got ta cross that off .
Darke : Laughs .
Oh yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prison checklist .
Are you keeping a log ? Radcliffe : We have a little Post-It on the wall that we 're keeping a tally on .
There was something about it that just made me laugh , immediately treating it like a prison film .
We 're both in the situation where we 've never been more grateful not to have a kid , or more annoyed that we do n't have a dog .
But generally speaking , compared to a lot of people , we are very , very much okay .
Daniel , where were you when you first heard that you had coronavirus ? Radcliffe:I was doing a play in London , which obviously had to finish a little early , but at the time we were still doing it .
The London theaters carried a week or so longer than most other plays .
We 'd done the matinee and I went into hair and makeup for the evening show , and the hair and makeup artist , a lovely guy called Rob , turned around with a sort of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got coronavirus .
" I was like , " What ? ! I 'm sure I do n't .
I just did a play .
" And he said , " Yeah , my niece just texted me .
She said , ' Oh , yeah , that dude 's got coronavirus .
' " It was very much like , " Watch yourself .
I do n't know if you should work with this guy .
He 's got coronavirus .
"  So I was immediately like , quite amused by it .
It 's not the first time I 've had something crazy written about me .
I do n't ever think there 's been a rumor about me that was so topical , that was pivoting off the news .
Most of it before has been random stuff that British newspapers have said .
So this one was slightly odd .
But then you end up having to text a bunch of people saying , " No , I do n't have coronavirus , I 'm fine .
"  Erin , when did you first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane back from visiting him .
As soon as the plane landed , I turned my phone on and I had all these texts like , " Tell me the internet 's wrong ! " " Is Daniel okay ? " I was like , " What the fuck is happening ? " And finally a couple people texted me , " Oh , it was a hoax , never mind .
" But I also had a text from Dan asking what he should do with the Invisalign that I accidentally left in the retainer when I left .
I was like , I think he 's okay ? Laughs .
When you first got all those texts , were you ever worried ? Darke : No , because I 'd just seen him that morning .
I was just very confused .
I was like , He seemed really okay this morning and he 's only texting me about my retainer , so if that 's his way of letting me know he has corona , we need to work on our communication .
When did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Darke : So you were already asleep when I 'd landed , so I did n't get to talk to you about it till the next day .
But I spent an evening texting people back , like , " I think he 's fine ! "  Radcliffe : Did n't I text you about it , being like , " There 's this thing going around ? "  Darke : Laughs .
No !  Radcliffe : Oh , sorry .
Darke : You literally only texted me about my retainer .
Radcliffe : I thought I 'd mentioned that .
I did know about it at that point .
Wait , so you already knew about the hoax but just did n't mention it to her ? Radcliffe : I think I was like , filing it under -- Erin and I have been together long enough that she also knows weird stuff gets written about me occasionally .
It was n't really until the next day , until I did a round of phone interviews , that it was like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should have .
" I spent the whole morning just having to tell journalists that I did not have coronavirus .
And it was maybe only a day later that Tom Hanks said he had it .
Darke : When I talked to you the next day I was like , " It 's a crazy hoax , partially because it could have been true .
At some point , someone will be the first famous person to have it .
" And it was like , eight hours later that Tom Hanks came out .
Radcliffe : The original tweet was something like , " Daniel Radcliffe becomes the first famous person to get coronavirus .
" And I was like , That 's such a weird distinction .
Surely the first person to get coronavirus is the first famous person to get coronavirus .
A good point .
: I also wonder if someone would do that now .
Even in the relatively short time since that happened , the gravity of the situation has sunken in a bit more .
I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erin saw the article about the people who 'd done the hoax , and they said they wanted to make a point in how easy it is to get people to believe things that are n't true .
I feel like we 've got that point .
Everyone is all too aware of that .
Also , at some point , I might get it !  Darke : Right , that 's the thing .
So many people will get it before this is over .
And I was like , The weird thing will be that he could get it now .
" Oh , it 's real this time , guys ! "  Radcliffe : The actor that cried coronavirus .
What did you say about one of the people in the group who did the hoax ?  Darke : One of them thought he was a celestial being .
I do also think that if you got it at some point and wanted to be public about it , you might have to do a video of yourself talking about it , because now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if people would believe it .
Radcliffe : I do n't know if I 'd do that .
Darke : Well , some people are publicly saying it just to take away the stigma of people having it .
That 's why Tom Hanks did it , I think .
Like , " A lot of people are going to get this , do n't freak out about them or at them .
"  Radcliffe : Right , right .
Who was the most random person to reach out to both of you ? Radcliffe : I do n't know ! I do n't think there was anyone particularly random .
I did have the producers of the play call me the next day like , " Hey , can we talk to you tonight ? " And it was actually about something totally different , but my first thought was that they had also believed it .
I was like , " I do n't have coronavirus ! "  Darke : That was what was funny .
It was n't as much random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all of our friends who temporarily got very worried .
Radcliffe : Did n't the New York Times 's Maggie Haberman retweet it or something ?  Yes .
: I feel very sorry for her about that .
I 'm sure the amount of news coming at her every day must be very hard sometimes to filter out the occasional crazy story .
And everyone piled on her on the internet .
Sorry , Maggie Haberman .
I love that you 're apologizing to her .
: It 's not like she printed something terrible , she just passed on something that was n't true .
And yes , everyone should be more careful about that , but if you 're spending your day overwhelmed by the news , it must be hard to pick out a crazy news story that also is fake .
Darke : And it was at that tipping point .
Our culture is so celebrity-obsessed that it felt like a weird thing that was about to happen .
It was weird , perfect timing for this bizarre thing .
Erin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it .
Your text back to me was like , " Ha ! This is so fucking weird .
" ? Darke : It 's key --  Radcliffe : -- if you 're going to be involved in my life , having a sense of humor about the weird shit happening to me .
Darke : Dating a famous person teaches you very quickly that shit is weird sometimes .
People are weird with fame sometimes .
Radcliffe : There 's no " right " reaction , but I credit a lot of my attitude to things toward my parents .
To give a tangential story , but Harry Potter was massive in Japan .
When I arrived in Japan when I was 12 , there were thousands of people at the airport .
It was this crazy crowd , a hundred security there trying and failing miserably to hold them back , as these young girls and old women piled through these guards .
We got through the crazy crush and we got in the car , and my mom and dad just started laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .
"  And that 's honestly the most helpful reaction that you can have .
I 'm glad to hear Erin reacted like that .
That 's why I did n't feel the need to text you on some level , like , " Oh , you 'll see this and recognize it as bullshit .
"  Darke : We 're at the point now where I 've seen my own wedding reported several times .
You do start to dismiss things you read about your partner if you 're pretty sure they 're not true .
I spent a week once having to text all my family members being like , " I promise if I 'm getting married , you will find out from me and not Us Weekly .
" At first I assumed it was a weird tabloid story rather than a deliberate hoax .
Outside of this , what 's the weirdest thing you 've seen written about you ? Radcliffe : At least three different times , somebody has written that we 're getting married and Emma Watson is gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my best man , and we 're getting married on a lake in Michigan .
Darke : It 's always very detailed , and with things that would never be true if you 've ever met us .
Clearly they 're like , " What are the four things we know about these people ? Okay , these are their co-stars , and this is where she 's from .
Okay , that 's their wedding ! " Laughs .
Radcliffe : I 've had a bunch of really weird ones .
And this is all , by the way , not Twitter hoaxes but newspapers .
There was one thing that I 'd hired former SAS soldiers to walk my dogs .
There was a rumor that I 'd had a full-sized nude statue of myself made and put in my house .
There was a rumor that I had special beer made for myself from a monastery with Belgian monks .
And there was a really weird one at one point : The logic was that I 'm too famous and important to hold an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iPad to read scripts , so I sent my assistant to like , hold it up behind me in a mirror while I was having my makeup done .
Would n't even work because I 'd be reading it backwards .
Laughs .
But as I 've said , they 're more normally weird , idiosyncratic , and unrelated to what 's going on in the world .
This was my first time getting dragged into a news cycle .
Darke : Mostly , they 're very uninterested in me , except where it concerns the two of us and whether or not we 're getting married .
That sounds about right for the tabloid industry .
: I 'm okay with their lack of interest in us .
Darke : We 're boring to them .
Ninety percent of the paparazzi photos of us are getting coffee .
Radcliffe : Or getting yoga mats .
Darke : Or going to the grocery store .
We 've been photographed twice waiting for an Uber .
Dan is not the most exciting celebrity .
Radcliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paparazzi out of following me .
The last interaction I had with a paparazzi , actually -- I was walking home from getting coffee and he followed me for ages and I saw him jumping out from behind a car .
Because I 'm so not used to them being around me at the moment , I was like , I assumed there must be somebody else around where I lived that he was waiting for .
So I was like " Come on , you 're not here for me .
Who are you here for ? " And he just looked at me and gave this weird creepy smile and went , " It does n't matter .
" Other than that , we 're very left alone .
Darke : You can only sell so many photos of two people waiting for an Uber .
Why do you think you were selected as the first celebrity pandemic Twitter hoax , perhaps ever ? Radcliffe : I think most of it , and they said as much , was that I 'm not on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond to it quick enough to flatten it , so it 'd get a few hours of time to germinate before anyone was able to shut it down .
Darke : Also I think it 's because you 're not a dramatic celebrity .
You 're not in the news for crazy shit .
So it feels more believable when there 's something dramatic .
Radcliffe : Maybe , but I feel like it could 've been someone like Charlie Sheen and still been a massive story .
Darke : I love that Charlie Sheen is where you went for " dramatic .
"  Radcliffe : My mind went to other places first but I did n't want to say .
He 's someone everyone can agree is dramatic .
Do you think part of it was a heartstrings thing , because you were a big part of people 's childhoods ? Radcliffe : Maybe ! Laughs .
That 's pretty shitty , if it was .
That also makes sense , that it would be somebody who was a part of people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus .
Well , I 'm glad neither of you have coronavirus .
: For now ! Who the fuck knows ?  Radcliffe : We 're going to keep isolating and try and stave it off .
Are you going to stay in New York ? Darke : I think so .
At this point , I do n't really know where we 'd go .
I also love this city so much , I do n't want to leave her when she 's down .
Radcliffe : It 's scary here right now , but it 'll be scary in a bunch of other places , too .
Darke : I also think it sounds like the safest , most responsible thing we can do is stay in this apartment as much as humanly possible .
So that 's what we 're going to try and do .
Okay guys , stay safe .
Let 's grab a drink or a coffee in one year .
: Absolutely .
