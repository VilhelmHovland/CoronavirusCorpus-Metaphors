EFFECTS of the coronavirus pandemic on world kayaking will be felt long after people come out of lockdown , Poverty Bay Kayak Club coach Alan Thompson says .
" I can see things taking a long time to return to normal , " he said yesterday .
" The under-23 canoe sprint world championships have n't been cancelled yet , but they will be .
" Alicia ( Hoskin ) and Quaid ( Thompson , Alan 's son ) would have gone .
" Last week was all about the Olympic Games being postponed .
The under-23 champs were going to be just a couple of weeks before Tokyo ( in Brandenburg , Germany , from July 16 to 19 ) .
I think they 've just been waiting for Tokyo to be put to bed .
" All the world cup regattas have gone already .
You 'd have to say anything that was scheduled for the next six months will be gone .
"  Thompson , a double gold medallist at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics , said he could not see international competition resuming immediately after nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the risk of reinfection until the virus is eradicated everywhere or a vaccine is developed .
" I can see us going to Europe again next year , but only if we are completely clear or people have access to a vaccine .
It could be a while .
"  While the New Zealand Olympic Committee last week welcomed the news that qualifying spots already earned would be retained for the Games in 2021 , Thompson said the situation was not clear-cut for kayaking .
In Olympic qualification events in Sydney last month , Gisborne 's Quaid Thompson qualified a boat by winning the K1 1000-metre qualification race .
However , Curtis Imrie and Max Brown qualified a K2 1000m boat as well , and New Zealand can send only two paddlers as a result of the Oceania Qualification , as prescribed by International Canoe Federation rules .
New Zealand 's international ranking is higher in the K2 than in the K1 over that distance , so Thompson would be likely to miss out .
His best chance of making the Olympics then would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that has been postponed , with no word yet on when it will go ahead .
Also racing in Sydney last month were Danielle Watson and Gisborne 's Alicia Hoskin , seeking a Games spot in the K2 500m .
They did not qualify .
Since then they have taken part in trials for the K4 seats that were qualified by the New Zealand paddlers through the world championships .
The women 's K4 team members have yet to be announced .
