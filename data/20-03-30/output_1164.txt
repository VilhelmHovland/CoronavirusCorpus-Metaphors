The family have also indulged in home decorating and gardening , including a little vegetable patch .
However , 50-year-old Emma admits to feelings of guilt .
" In the last week I 've been showing them how to cook and bake and knit and crochet -- all the things I used to teach them but , with our busy lives , it can be hard to find the time to factor these in .
" It has made me feel bad about no longer being a stay-at-home mum -- and about the future .
I 'm not saying we will be living on beans and toast and ? avoiding takeaways once all this is over , but we are trying to use the opportunity to get back to home life in any way we possibly can .
"  Roy and Emma 's daughter Alice , 21 , who is employed in a retail warehouse , is still working , as is Sophia , 27 , a carer for a visually impaired woman and her family .
" Just feeding everyone three meals a day is a challenge , but we 're managing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food as we always have plenty in the cupboards anyway .
but I have popped to Tesco a few times and did wonder what happens if we need more of something that 's restricted , because there are so many of us ? " she said .
