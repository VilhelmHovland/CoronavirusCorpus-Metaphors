It 's illegal to ask for a hair or spa appointment at home during the pandemic  If you 're looking for a hair stylist or a massage therapist to provide salon or spa services at your home during the statewide order , do n't .
State officials say it 's illegal and could put you and the service provider in deep trouble .
Since all salons and spas have closed , officials say some providers have been offering or getting requests to make house calls .
Lynda Elliott , Executive Director with the N .
Cosmetic Arts Board , said , since people working in the industry are hands on with the client , there 's no way to keep six feet apart .
Providers who make house calls are at risk of losing their license and being charged with a Class II misdemeanor .
" What happens if you are the person that ends up spreading COVID-19 and individuals die because you were n't adhering to that social distancing ? I think people are not understanding what could happen or the severity of it , " Elliott said .
