NEW HAMPSHIRE .
LET 'S LISTEN IT TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS ALL WEEKEND .
I KNOW STATE OFFICIALS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS WERE WORKING HARD NOT JUST MANAGING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF WHAT WE 'VE PUT INTO PLACE OVER THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS , BUT ALSO LOOKING AT INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND BRINGING SOME SOLUTIONS TO THE REAL FRONT OF THE TABLE FORCE .
SO AGAIN AS WE 'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS AS WE 'RE MOVING FORWARD .
WE 'RE BEING RESPONSIVE TO WHAT THOSE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS ARE REALLY AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL .
WE WANT TO THANK THEM I WAS ON THE PHONE CALL THIS MORNING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT MAYOR 'S I WAS ON A CALL THIS MORNING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT HOUSE MEMBERS .
I 'LL JUST GIVING FEEDBACK OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY 'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND .
MAYBE SOME OF THE THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO STILL ADDRESS .
THESE ARE UNPRECEDENTED AND TIMES THAT WE 'RE GOING THROUGH AND AGAIN , WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE 'RE BEING RESPONSIVE TO THOS INDIVIDUALS .
BUT TODAY 'S WE WANT ANNOUNCED .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FIRST BEING WANT FOLKS TO KNOW THAT TODAY .
I 'LL BE INFORMING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SPECIFICALLY THAT STANDARDIZED TESTS WILL NOT TAKE PLACE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THIS SEMESTER AND WHILE REMOTE LEARNING HAS GOTTEN OFF TO AN INCREDIBLE START WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR APPROACH TO EDUCATION AND OWNERS STANDARDIZED TESTS FROM WASHINGTON .
I THINK DEFINITELY SEND THE WRONG MESSAGE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE FAMILIES WHO ARE ALREADY WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO IDENTIFY .
TO THIS NEW LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COLLEGE BOARD TO CREATE ACCESS FOR STUDENTS WANTING TO TAKE THE SATS THIS SUMMER OR IN THE EARLY FALL AND NEW HAMPSHIRE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL ALSO WORK WITH ALL NEW HAMPSHIRE SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP OPTIONS TO HELP GAUGE STUDENT PERFORMANCE , AND WE 'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH TEACHERS SCHOOLS AND FAMILIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE ASSESSMENT MATERIALS FOR REMOTE INSTRUCTION FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS .
SECONDLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL CARES ACT THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED .
WE ARE INCREASING BENEFITS FOR THOSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM WILL IN MOST INSTANCES BE SHIFTED TO THE FEDERALLY FUNDED PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM .
AND FOR THOSE ON THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE , WE 'RE INCREASING THE WEEKLY MINIMUM BENEFIT FROM THIRTY TWO DOLLARS A WEEK TO A HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT DOLLARS A WEEK THEN STARTING NEXT WEEK .
WE 'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL $600 PER WEEK PER INDIVIDUAL TO THEIR WEEKLY BENEFITS ALL 100% FEDERALLY FUNDED .
WE 'RE EXTENDING THE LENGTH OF AT THE TIME A PERSON CAN RECEIVE BENEFITS BY 13 WEEKS FOR UP TO 39 WEEKS , WHICH AGAIN WILL BE FEDERALLY FUNDED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
IT 'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY DRAWING FROM UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WILL NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY NEW OR ADDITIONAL STEPS .
YOU SHOULD JUST CONTINUE TO FILE AS YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE STATE CHANNELS THIS OPPORTUNITY .
REALLY BUILDING ON THE FACT THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE WAS ABLE TO BE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN THE COUNTRY TO OFFER .
THIS IS THE EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS AND THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS COME IN COME IN BEHIND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AROUND THE STATE .
ON THOSE SAME NOTES .
I JUST WANT TO ALWAYS EXTEND A BIG THANKS TO EMPLOYMENT SECURITY COMMISSIONER GEORGE CAPATAZ ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER RICHARD LAVERY THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL BILL JUST PASSED A FEW DAYS AGO AND THE CARES ACT AND THAT THEY 'VE BEEN WORKING TO HELP ENSURE THAT THESE BENEFITS CAN BE ACCESSED IMMEDIATELY AS EARLY AS TODAY AND JUST A REAL TESTAMENT TO THEM AND THEIR TEAM WORKING WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND ALL THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
I ALSO WANT TO JUST ONE FINAL POINT THAT ALSO KIND OF GOES TO THE FACT THAT WE STARTED THIS PROGRAM SO EARLY , YOU KNOW , NEW HAMPSHIRE HAD THE HIGHWOMEN TO INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BETWEEN THE TIME OF MARCH TO 14TH , MARCH 21ST ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY , BUT AGAIN , IT WAS REALLY BECAUSE WE HAD OPENED UP OUR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE FACT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'S HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOSE BENEFITS WILL PROVIDE A LOT OF FOR INDIVIDUALS ACROSS , NEW HAMPSHIRE THIRD WE WILL BE ANNOUNCING LATER TODAY THAT THE STATE WILL BE EXTENDING THE BUSINESS TAX PAYMENT DEADLINE TO JUNE 15TH FOR APPROXIMATELY 98% OF NEW HAMPSHIRE .
BUSINESSES AS MANY CONTINUE TO ADAPT TO THESE UNFORTUNATE NEW REALITIES OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS .
THE STATE WILL ALSO BE EXTENDING INTEREST IN DIVIDENDS TAX PAYMENT DEADLINES TO JUNE 15TH FOR AGAIN APPROXIMATELY 98% OF THE INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS TAX PAYERS AS WAS DISCUSSED LAST WEEK CONGRESS AS WE KNOW PASSED AND THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE CARES ACT BUT AS A RESULT OF THIS BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION , WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE BILL AND WE HAVE CONFIRMED TO HAMPSHIRE HAMPSHIRE NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL BE RECEIVING AT LEAST 1 .
BILLION DOLLARS IN COVID-19 RELIEF .
IT 'S AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF RELIEF FOR THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE .
GIVEN THE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES IN THE SEVERE NEEDS FROM FAMILIES EDUCATION BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS THERE IS GOING TO BE NEED ALL THE WAY AROUND .
SO WHILE THIS IS A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IS BEING ALLOCATED AND DEDICATED TO A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION CREATES THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM WHERE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN GET 100% FORGIVABLE LOANS TO COVER THE SALARIES AND BENEFITS OF THEIR EMPLOYEES MORTGAGE INTEREST RENT AND THESE FOR UP TO EIGHT WEEKS AGAIN A REALLY INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES OUT THERE .
THERE 'S ALSO SUPPORT FOR THE CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FINANCIAL SUPPORT WERE FUNDS CAN GO TOWARDS OUR DAY CARE INITIATIVE THAT WE ANNOUNCED JUST LAST WEEK .
SO A LOT OF THE SUBSIDIES AND SUPPLEMENTS THAT WE PROVIDED IN OUR CHILDCARE AND DAY CARE INITIATIVES AGAIN ARE GOING TO NOW BE BACKED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT , WHICH IS VERY EXCITING .
THEY 'LL BE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION .
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THROUGH CERTIFIED COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL CLINICS IN ADDITION TO THE 50 MILLION DOLLAR HEALTH CARE RELIEF FUND THAT WE SET UP VERY EARLY ON IN THIS PROCESS .
THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GRANTS TO HOSPITALS AND NONPROFITS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL PROVIDERS TO HELP COVER THE UNREIMBURSED HEALTH CARE COSTS OF THIS COVID-19 CRISIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPERATIONALIZE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND WILL CONTINUE TO DIG INTO THE DETAILS SO THAT WE TRULY CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STATE ALLOCATION WILL BE WHAT RESTRICTIONS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY HAVE PLACED ON THEM .
AND AGAIN , JUST HOW BEST TO USE THESE FUNDS FOR THE CITIZENS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE .
WE WILL AS ALWAYS CONTINUE TO UPDATE THE PUBLIC AS WE EXPLORE MORE OPPORTUNITIES AND KNOWING THAT THE IN WORKING WITH OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION .
THIS IS THE THIRD SUPPLEMENTAL ENHANCEMENT DEALING WITH THE COVID-19 CRISIS .
THERE WILL LIKELY BE A FOURTH PROBABLY IN A MONTH OR SO IS WHAT THE HOPE IS AND SO ANY OF THE COALS ARE THE GAPS IN THE SYSTEM THAT NOT BEING COVERED BY THE CURRENT FUNDS .
WE ALWAYS WILL HAVE ANOTHER SHOT TO GO BACK AND WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS IN A BIPARTISAN WAY WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP AGAIN PROVIDE SOME OF THESE FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO FILL THOSE GAPS AND RESPOND TO THE CITIZENS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND LASTLY TODAY .
I WANT WE WANT FOLKS TO KNOW THAT WE ARE REQUESTING TODAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOVERNMENT AND IN DOING SO IT WILL ALLOW A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES , BUT ONE IN PARTICULAR OUR NATIONAL GUARD TO BE FULLY REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT .
SHOULD WE ENACTED TITLE 32 STATUS TO MOBILIZE OUR STATE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN AND WOMEN TO HELP RESPOND TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS IN A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT STAFFING REALMS THAT THEY POTENTIALLY COULD BE COULD BE CALLED UP FOR I 'M NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DR .
BENJAMIN CHAN WHO WILL COME UP AND GIVE US A UPDATE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH , DR .
CHAN .
GREAT .
THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOVERNOR AND GOOD AFTERNOON .
LET ME FIRST START BY PROVIDING SOME UPDATES ON THE NUMBERS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE 'RE SEEING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR TESTING AND DIAGNOSIS OF COVID-19 .
SO TO DATE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS THERE HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 5,700 PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TESTED FOR COVID-19 AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE 314 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED CONFIRMED WITH COVID-19 .
THAT 'S AN INCREASE OF ABOUT FIFTY SIX INDIVIDUALS FROM YESTERDAY .
SO OVER THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH WITH COVID-19 .
THE MORE THE MAJORITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE PEOPLE WITH MORE MILD INFECTION WHO ARE AT HOME AND SELF ISOLATING AT HOME ABOUT 45 OF THESE INDIVIDUALS ABOUT TO CLOSE TO 15% I HAVE REQUIRED SOME HOSPITALIZATION DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR ILLNESS AND UNFORTUNATELY THREE INDIVIDUALS HAVE PASSED AWAY AS A RESULT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AS A RESULT OF THEIR INFECTION ALL THREE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE OLDER THAN 60 YEARS OF AGE AND HAD MULTIPLE UNDERLYING CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS , WHICH IS EXACTLY THE AGE GROUP THAT IS MOST AT RISK FOR SEVERE COMPLICATIONS FROM COVID-19 .
AND SO OUR SYMPATHY AND OUR THOUGHTS ARE WITH THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS .
SITUATION IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES AND I WANT TO ALSO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE THE POPULATION OF RESIDENTS IN OUR STATE WHO WE WANT TO PROTECT ESPECIALLY FROM FROM COVID-19 .
AND SO I THINK WE ALL HAVE A ROLE IN PLAYING TO TO DO THAT AS COVID-19 SPREADS BOTH GLOBALLY AS WELL AS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES .
WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEW HAMPSHIRE .
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IT SAID AND I WILL REPEAT HERE THAT THE UNITED STATES IS IN THE ACCELERATION PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC FOR COVID-19 .
AND SO WE ARE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT INCREASING NUMBERS OF CASES IN THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE OVER THE COMING SEVERAL WEEKS .
WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASING NUMBERS OF CASES WITHIN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE 'RE OBVIOUSLY ACTIVELY MONITORING , BUT WE 'RE NOT JUST SITTING BACK AND WATCHING THE NUMBERS WERE ACTIVELY OUT INVESTIGATING PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 TO IDENTIFY A POTENTIAL SUSCEPTIBLE CONTACTS WHO WE REACH OUT TO AND RECOMMEND EITHER GO ON QUARANTINE IF THEY ARE WITHOUT SYMPTOMS MEANING STAY AT HOME EVEN WITH A LACK OF SYMPTOMS OR IF THEY ARE SYMPTOMATIC HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STAYING AT HOME POTENTIALLY TESTING FOR THOSE THAT ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF POTENTIAL OF POTENTIALLY TRANSMITTING COVID-19 WITHIN OUR WITHIN OUR RUDY 'S WE 'VE GOTTEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS ABOUT WHERE THIS VIRUS .
IS IT SPREADING AND THEY 'RE IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES .
WE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVE NO SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS IDENTIFIED MEANING THEY MAY NOT BE IDENTIFIED CONTACTS OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH COVID-19 MAY NOT HAVE TRAVELED AND SO WE BELIEVE THERE ARE INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WITH COMMUNITY-BASED TRANSMISSION OF COVID-19 .
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE KEY MESSAGES , NOW IS THAT THIS VIRUS IS OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES .
IT IS CIRCULATING AND SO EVERYBODY NEEDS TO TAKE STEPS AND PRECAUTIONS AGAINST NOT ONLY GETTING INFECTED THEMSELVES , BUT ALSO SPREADING INFECTION TO OTHER PEOPLE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY CERTAINLY THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE .
I WANT TO MAKE QUICK MENTION THAT THERE IS AS I 'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THERE 'S INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE CAN SPREAD THIS VIRUS BEFORE THEY MAY HAVE SYMPTOMS WHAT WE CALL PRE-SYMPTOMATIC TRANSMISSION THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF STUDIES THAT HAVE COME OUT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS LOOKING AT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS LIKE THE DIAMOND PRINCESS CRUISE SHIP AND CERTAIN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY POPULATIONS FOR EXAMPLE IN WASHINGTON STATE AND WHAT SOME OF THESE NEWER STUDIES HAVE SHOWN US IS THAT OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE TESTED POSITIVE ? ORGANIZATIONS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORE HAVE POTENTIALLY SHOWN VIRUS TESTED POSITIVE FOR THIS VIRUS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THEY SHOWED SYMPTOMS AND AND I SAY THIS TO HIGHLIGHT A POINT THAT IT 'S NOT JUST PEOPLE THAT ARE SYMPTOMATIC IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO STAY HOME TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES .
THIS IS THE REASON FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND SOCIAL DISTANCING IN GENERAL AND SO EVERYBODY IN OUR COMMUNITIES NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT EXPOSING AND PASSING ON THIS VIRUS TO OTHER PEOPLE WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES .
SO IF PEOPLE DO N'T NEED TO GO OUT URGENTLY , PLEASE STAY AT HOME IF PEOPLE ARE OUT FOR EXAMPLE AT A GROCERY STORE OR NEEDING TO GO INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR AMPLE SOCIAL DISTANCING RECOMMENDS MAINTAINING AT LEAST SIX FEET OF DISTANCE BETWEEN ONESELF AND ANOTHER PERSON .
SO WE ASK THAT EVERYBODY IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHETHER THEY 'RE EVEN IF THEY 'RE NOT HAVING ANY SYMPTOMS AND OTHERWISE FEELING WELL TO PLEASE ABIDE BY THESE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STAYING HOME IF GOING OUT IS NOT NECESSARY AND FOR MAINTAINING AT LEAST SIX FEET OF DISTANCE BETWEEN BETWEEN PEOPLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STORE .
THAT INCLUDES WAITING IN LINES OR OTHER EVEN WALKING OUTSIDE , YOU KNOW , PLEASE TRY AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCE BETWEEN BETWEEN OTHER PEOPLE .
I WANT TO ALSO PARTICULARLY MENTION THAT THOSE WHO ARE 60 YEARS OF AGE .
OLDER PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS AS I 'VE ALREADY MENTIONED ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS OF COVID-19 AND POTENTIALLY REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION POTENTIALLY EVEN DYING FROM THIS INFECTION .
AND SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY WE RECOMMEND TRY AND GET MORE STRICTLY STAY AT HOME THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEED TO HAVE A 30 DAY SUPPLY OF NEEDED MEDICATIONS AT THEIR HOMES MAINTAIN A SUPPLY OF FOOD AND GROCERIES AND I THINK ALL OF US IN OUR COMMUNITIES NEED PROTECT THOSE MORE VULNERABLE GROUPS BY UNFORTUNATELY AVOIDING CLOSE CONTACT WITH PEOPLE THAT THEY MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO SERIOUS INFECTION THAT COULD THAT COULD CAUSE A LOVED ONE TO END UP END UP IN THE HOSPITAL .
SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR AND TRACK THE SITUATION THERE HAVE BEEN REQUESTS FOR MORE INFORMATION POTENTIALLY AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL .
WE ARE GOING TO BE RELEASING MORE INFORMATION ON OUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF CASES .
IS AT THE TOWN LEVEL WE HAVE HEARD THE REQUEST AND THE NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION NOT ONLY FROM THE PUBLIC BUT FROM LOCAL HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS , SO WE WILL BE RELEASING MORE INFORMATION ON THIS IN THE NEXT DAY OR SO , BUT I WANT TO STRESS AGAIN THAT EVEN IF YOU LIVE IN A TOWN WHERE A MAP MAY NOT SHOW THAT COVID-19 HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE CIRCULATING THAT YOU KNOW , WE WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT COVID-19 IS CIRCULATING IN YOUR COMMUNITIES , EVEN IF THERE HAS NOT BEEN SOMEBODY OFFICIALLY DIAGNOSED .
TO TAKE THE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS TO MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING TO STAY AT HOME IF IT 'S NOT NECESSARY TO GO OUT IN ORDER TO NOT ONLY PROTECT YOUR OWN FAMILY AND FRIENDS , BUT PEOPLE THAT MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OLDER PARENTS GRANDPARENTS NEIGHBORS THAT THAT MAY BE OF AN OLDER AGE OR CERTAINLY PEOPLE LIVING IN LONG-TERM CARE OR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES .
SO , THANK YOU VERY MUCH .
WELL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUESS WE CAN OPEN IT .
FOR QUESTIONS , IF FOLKS LIKE DO I THINK THE GRANITE STATE NEEDS TO DO BETTER AT STEAD LOOK ? NO .
I WELL LOOK WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER RIGHT BUT I GOT TO SAY I THINK THE GRANITE STATE HAS DONE A VERY VERY GOOD JOB .
SO I GUESS THAT 'S MY PREEMINENT STATEMENT .
WE SAW A LOT OF FOLKS OUT AND ABOUT THIS WEEKEND .
THEY WERE OUT EXERCISING THEY WERE OUT GETTING THEIR GROCERIES .
THEY 'RE DOING THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO OR THAT ARE ALLOWED TO DO UNDER THE STAY-AT-HOME ORDER AND THEN THERE WERE HEADED HOME .
WE SAW A LOT OF FOLKS IN IN THE PARKING LOT .
MOUNT MAJOR AND OTHERS WHERE THEY WERE HIKING BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT CROWD CONTROL , THAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING ON THE OUT WHILE PEOPLE WERE HIKING OR AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN WE HAVE WE HAD STAFF UP THERE LOOKING AND VERY FEW INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE REALLY NOT MANAGING THE SOCIAL DISTANCING .
I THINK PEOPLE ARE TAKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MYSELF AND PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY WALK ON ONE SIDE OF THE AISLE AND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE THE TRYING TO KEEP AS MUCH SPACE BETWEEN THEMSELVES .
SO AND THEY 'RE REALIZING THEY CAN DO THAT WITHOUT REALLY HINDERING THEIR ABILITY TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING ACTUALLY DO THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE OR AT WORK , OF COURSE , SO NO , I THINK THE GRANITE STATERS IS DONE .
I 'VE DONE A GREAT JOB , BUT WE 'RE IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL WE NEED STAMINA .
WE NEED DISCIPLINE WE NEED TO DO THIS NOT THIS WEEK BUT NEXT WEEK AND NEXT MONTH AND PROBABLY THE MONTH AFTER THAT AND SO BUILDING THESE THESE PRACTICES NOW AND SEEING HOW THEY WORK IN IN THE IN THE REAL WORLD .
SO TO SAY IT 'S GIVEN US A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION .
I THINK ILL INDIVIDUALS A LOT OF BETTER INFORMATION AND HOW WE SEE EACH OTHER .
ACT RIGHT ALSO , I THINK HELPS US SAY WELL BOY , THEY 'RE DOING IT .
I GOT TO DO IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RISING IF YOU WILL OF THIS IDEA OF NOT JUST SOCIAL DISTANCING .
I THINK IT WOULD KIND OF EVOLVING THAT TERM TO MORE PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING , RIGHT ? WE WANT PEOPLE TO SOCIALIZE USING TECHNOLOGY WANT PEOPLE TO SOCIALIZE WITH AN ELDERLY PARENT OR RELATIVE .
THAT MIGHT BE IN A NURSING HOME THAT RIGHT NOW CA N'T HAVE VISITORS .
WE WANT THAT COMMUNITY CONNECTION USE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THAT .
CONTINUOUS PHYSICAL DISTANCES , SO I GUESS THAT 'S A VERY LONG WAY OF SAYING I THINK WE 'RE DOING A GREAT JOB , BUT WE NEED THE DISCIPLINE IN THE STAMINA .
WE CAN ALWAYS PROBABLY FIND INDIVIDUAL MOMENTS WHERE WE CAN DO BETTER .
I FOUND MYSELF IN THE OFFICE TODAY .
I RARELY COME CLOSER THAN SIX FEET WITH THE MOST ANYBODY NOWADAYS .
I 'M INCREDIBLY CAREFUL MYSELF , AND I FOUND MY STAFF , YOU KNOW , EVEN MAKING SURE THE LIMITED STAFF WE HAVE OF THE STATEHOUSE EVERYONE 'S KIND OF STAYING IN THEIR AREA , YOU KNOW WAITING TO FOLKS .
ARE YOU ONLY ONE PERSON GOES THROUGH A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT ONCE .
THEY 'RE TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY .
SO WE NEED TO BE COMMENDED FOR THAT .
GUESS WELL SURE .
SO THE QUESTION REALLY REVOLVES AROUND THE THINKING BEHIND THE SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUESTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE QUARANTINE REQUEST OF OUT-OF-STATERS .
THE THINKING IS JUST FRANKLY COMMON SENSE THE FACT IS THAT MOST STATES HAVE A MUCH HIGHER PREVALENCE OF COVID THAN WE DO RIGHT .
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE COMING SPECIFICALLY OUT OF MASSACHUSETTS , OR MAYBE EVEN THE NEW YORK REGION WHERE THE PREVALENCE IS INCREDIBLY HIGH IF YOU 'RE COMING HERE FOR AN EXTENDED STAY YOU NEED TO REALLY BE SELF QUARANTINING FOR 14 DAYS AND PRACTICING THOSE SAME SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAD IN YOUR STATES .
WE TAKE THOSE VERY SERIOUSLY JUST BECAUSE WE 'RE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
WE DO N'T HAVE AS HIGH OF A RIGHT NOW THAT SURGES COMING AS DR .
CHAN POINTED OUT WE ARE IN AN ACCELERATED PHASE .
OUR NUMBERS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE .
EVERYONE HAS THAT RESPONSIBILITY OF TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY IF YOU 'RE COMING FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SELF QUARANTINE .
YELLOW SURE .
YEAH , WE 'VE HEARD THE CONCERN ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE TO BE SURE .
THE CONCERN IS A COUPLE FOLD THE CONSIDERED AS WELL .
WE 'RE BEEN VERY VERY AGGRESSIVE AND SUCCESSFUL IN OUR STATE BUILDING OUR SURGE CENTERS RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE XS BED CAPACITY .
I THINK THIS IS A CONCERN THAT IF OTHER STATES AROUND US DO N'T HAVE THAT SAME CAPACITY IF THEIR SURGE COMES FASTER AND HARDER THAN OURS HERE .
YOU COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE FOLKS FROM MASSACHUSETTS COMING OVER TO USE OUR HEALTHCARE FACILITIES , RIGHT ? AND SO AGAIN , WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT REGIONALLY ALL OF OUR STATE PARTNERS ARE ALSO IN THAT SAME BOAT BUILDING BUILDING THAT SURGE CAPACITY .
SO ONE STATE IS OVER HANDLING THE POTENTIAL HEALTH CARE SURGE OF ANOTHER THERE 'S FOLKS UP IN THE NORTH COUNTRY THAT AGAIN .
THAT 'S WHERE A LOT OF THESE SECONDARY HOMES FOR FOLKS OUT OF MASSACHUSETTS .
MIGHT MIGHT BE AND SO THERE 'S JUST A NATURAL CONCERN THERE FROM LOCAL OFFICIALS .
I SAID IT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I DO N'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT .
I KNOW GOVERNOR HAS THE POWER TO DO THAT , BUT WE JUST HAVE TO MAINTAIN A VIGILANCE AND A GOOD STRONG COMMUNITY MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE FROM OUT OF STATE .
YOU DO NEED TO SELF QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS .
WELL , WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO REACT AT A MOMENT 'S NOTICE AND KNOW THAT WE CAN DO SO WITH THE FEDERAL BEHIND US .
SO AT SOME POINT .
POINT WILL IT GET TO IT ? WILL IT WILL WE GET THERE AT SOME POINT IT COULD FOR EXAMPLE , MASSACHUSETTS CALLED UP SOME OF THEIR NATIONAL GUARD FOR THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF FILLING IN THE GAPS WITH FIRST RESPONDERS FIREMAN FIREFIGHTERS THOSE THAT MIGHT BE QUARANTINE BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE COME IN CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY WE FIND WE 'RE FINDING A LOT OF FOLKS ON THE FRONT LINES ARE BEING QUARANTINED AND THEN THOSE FRONTLINE STAFFS ARE GETTING DEPLETED .
SO THAT WAS ONE REASON THAT HE DID IT OR STATES .
I TALKED TO GOVERNOR 'S ALL OVER THE COUNTRY .
THEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SO WE DO N'T KNOW EXACTLY WHY WE MAY TO DO IT .
MY SENSE IS AT SOME WE WILL WE JUST WANT TO HAVE THE READINESS AND KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'S GOING TO BE BEHIND BEHIND US WHEN WE DO .
YEAH , THAT 'S A GREAT QUESTION .
LET ME PULL UP MY NOTES HERE .
SO TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE ACCURATE NUMBERS HERE .
SO CORRECTED 314 PEOPLE DIAGNOSED IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH WITH COVID-19 .
AND AS OF TODAY , WE 'RE AWARE OF AT LEAST .
36 OF THOSE THAT HAVE WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED AND RECOVERED AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19 HAVE NOT REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION .
AND SO WE 'RE WE 'RE COMMUNICATING WITH INDIVIDUALS ABOUT HOW LONG THEY NEED TO STAY HOME FOR AND IT 'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST SEVEN DAYS FROM WHEN THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS POSSIBLY LONGER DEPENDING ON HOW THE SYMPTOM PROGRESSION CONTINUES BUT THE MAJORITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL BE COMING OFF ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WILL BE COMING OFF HOME .
RELATION IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RECOVERED .
IT 'S ALWAYS HARD TO KNOW THE REASON FOR THEIR NOT BEING DIAGNOSED CASES AND A PARTICULAR AREA .
AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER , I THINK WE ALL NEED TO OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT COVID-19 IS IS POTENTIALLY CIRCULATING IN OUR COMMUNITIES .
THAT INCLUDES TOWNS IN SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE .
THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD ANYBODY DIAGNOSED WITH 19 IT ALSO INCLUDES THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR STATE AND COHAS COUNTY SOME OF THE REASON FOR THEIR NOT BEING DIAGNOSIS COULD BE , YOU KNOW MORE MILD ILLNESS THAT 'S NOT BEING TESTED AND CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND AND LABORATORY DIAGNOSED , BUT I THINK THAT GIVEN THE WAY WE 'VE SEEN THIS VIRUS SPREAD AND HOW EASILY IT SPREADS BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW , THE ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT IT 'S CIRCULATING AND AND MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE .
I THINK PARTLY WHAT YOU 'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AGAIN , THE MAJORITY OF CASES THAT HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED ARE IN ROCKINGHAM BY HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY .
AND THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE THE AREAS OF THE STATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU MENTIONED THOSE AREAS OF THE STATE ARE CLOSER TO THROUGH WAYS FOR PEOPLE POTENTIALLY TRAVELING UP FROM MASSACHUSETTS , BUT THERE 'S ALSO I KNOW A PROBABLY A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT MIGHT TRAVEL DOWN TO MASSACHUSETTS TO WORK .
SO WE 'VE CERTAINLY SEEN INSTANCES OF YOU KNOW , CROSS-BORDER TRANSMISSION WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING UP FROM ANOTHER STATE , BUT ALSO PEOPLE , EXCUSE ME THAT LIVING ROOM THAT GO DOWN TO WORK OR INTERACT WITH FAMILY IN DIFFERENT AREAS .
AND SO THAT 'S CERTAINLY A RISK FACTOR AND I THINK LIKELY REFLECTS THE THE NUMBERS THAT YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT WHERE THE GREATER NUMBER OF CASES ARE IN ROCKINGHAM IN HILLSBOROUGH COUNTIES .
SO , I GUESS I WANT TO STRESS .
YOU KNOW , THIS IS A VIRUS THAT WE KNOW IS CIRCULATING IN OUR COMMUNITIES .
SO SO IT 'S SPREADING BETWEEN PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRAVEL CONTINUES TO BE A RISK AND AS I 'M SURE MANY ARE AWARE OVER THE WEEKEND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION RELEASE SOME TRAVEL ADVISORY GUIDANCE AROUND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RISK FOR CARRYING UP FROM ONE PART OF THE UNITED STATES FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER STATE AND SO THAT 'S THAT 'S CERTAINLY A RISK FACTOR , BUT I WANT TO STRESS AGAIN THAT ANYBODY WHO MAY BE COMING INTO OUR STATE FROM THESE HIGHER AREAS OF INCIDENTS NEED TO SELF QUARANTINE FOR 14 DAYS THAT HAS BEEN THAT IS ADVICE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED BUT ALSO ADVISE PUT OUT BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AND AS A GENERAL RULE PEOPLE NEED TO EVEN IF THEY 'RE OUTSIDE HIKING ON A TRAIL NEED TO MAINTAIN A DISTANCE OF AT LEAST SIX FEET BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT A LIMIT TRANSMISSION OF THIS VIRUS GIVEN HOW EASILY CAN SPREAD PERSON-TO-PERSON NO , NOT SO MUCH OF FOLKS DEFINED THE ODOR .
I THINK WE 'VE HAD A LOT OF NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES USE OUR WEBSITE TO REQUEST SOME SORT OF EXEMPTION .
WE HEARD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO GOLF AND WE CAN APPRECIATE THAT AND I GUESS THAT 'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT DOWN THE ROAD , YOU KNOW , ONE OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ APRIL WERE SHOWN THE SHOULDER SEASON FOR A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT CAN THAT WERE N'T EXPECTING A WHOLE LOT OF BUSINESS .
ANYWAYS , I THINK THE FEAR IS THAT YOU KNOW , WHERE WE GOING TO BE IN MAY OR COME MEMORIAL DAY IN JUNE AND JULY AND OBVIOUSLY , WE 'RE NOT QUITE SURE .
I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SURGE IS STILL COMING .
IS IT TWO WEEKS AWAY THREE WEEKS AWAY FOR WEEKS AWAY .
NOT SURE BUT AGAIN OUR JOB IS JUST TO BE PREPARED AS WE CAN YOU THEN MIX IN NOT JUST ON THE BUSINESS SIDE , BUT YOU KNOW , WE TALKED ABOUT TESTING IN THE FACT THAT WHEN WE WERE FIRST STARTED THIS THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO .
WE WERE DOING A HUNDRED OR HUNDRED FIFTY MAYBE EVEN TWO HUNDRED TESTS A DAY NOW .
WE 'RE RAMPING UP TO CLOSE TO FOUR FIVE HUNDRED TESTS A DAY AND HOPEFULLY AS SOME OTHER ADDITIONAL LABS AND OTHER TESTING CAPABILITIES COME ONLINE FOR OTHER HOSPITALS AND FACILITIES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE .
THAT 'LL KEEP RAMPING UP AN ESCALATING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP AGAINST THE PRESS THAT VIRAL SPREAD THAT SORT OF THIS IS ALL ABOUT SO WE DID N'T HEAR SO MUCH OF FOLKS TO FIND THE ORDER BUT ONE THING I CAN TELL YOU IS WE HAD A LOT OF BUSINESSES CALL AND SAY WELL CAN WE CAN RETAILERS DO CURBSIDE PICKUP RIGHT IF THEY 'RE NOT INTERACTING WITH CUSTOMERS IF WE 'RE JUST DOING CURBSIDE PICKUP .
NO CASH TRANSACTIONS , NO TRANSACTIONS AT THE WINDOW YOU CALL AHEAD OR YOU GO ONLINE AND BUY BUY THE PRODUCT AND YOU SHOW UP IN YES , I WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT AND WE ARE PROVIDING THOSE EXEMPTIONS IF YOU WILL BECAUSE THAT 'S WE WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO CHALLENGE THEMSELVES TO CHANGE THEIR MODEL RIGHT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PHYSICAL DISTANCE THING .
SO IF ANYTHING .
WE 'VE HEARD GOOD STORIES .
I THINK OF PEOPLE TRYING TO CHANGE THE MODEL UNDERSTANDING THEIR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS , BUT WE 'LL DEAL WITH ISSUES ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS .
SO THOSE REQUESTS WILL BE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEY HAVE A SMALL GROUP THERE AND ALONG WITH MYSELF THAT YOU KNOW , IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT RISE TO THE LEVEL WHERE THE INSTANCES OR BUSINESS DYNAMICS THAT WE DID N'T ANTICIPATE THAT MIGHT HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY THAN WE THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PHYSICAL DISTANCING MORE .
I THOUGHT OR JUST THE OPPOSITE MAYBE WE HAVE THERE ARE ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES WITH THAT WERE REALIZING ARE STILL CREATING A SOCIAL DYNAMIC THAT IS N'T ACCEPTABLE A PHYSICAL PROXIMITY .
THAT IS N'T REALLY ACCEPTABLE IN THE MODEL .
WE COULD GO HARSHER AS WELL AGAIN ALL UNCHARTED TERRITORY FOR A LOT OF US .
I 'M WE 'RE SHARING OUR IDEAS AND WHAT WE 'RE SEEING WITH OTHER STATES AND SEEING YOU KNOW WHAT THEY 'RE DOING ABOUT CERTAIN CERTAIN INSTANCES ONE THING .
I 'LL BRING UP WITH THE BEACHES OR A GOLF COURSE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGING PARTS OF THAT IS IF THE STATES AROUND US ARE N'T OPENING THEIR BEACHES IN THEIR GOLF COURSE , TH WE OPEN IF WE EVEN FIND A UNIQUE MODEL ALL THESE FOLKS ARE MASSACHUSETTS AND MAINE AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES , WHICH AGAIN IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AND COUNTERACTIVE TO WHAT WE 'RE REALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE DO WHICH IS STAY IN YOUR OWN HOMES WHETHER YOU 'RE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND MASSACHUSETTS STAY IN YOUR OWN HOMES .
WE WANT FOLKS TO STAY IN THEIR STATE AND STAY IN THEIR HOMES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO WE DO N'T WANT TO EVEN IF WE HAVE A CREATIVE WE HAVE TO BE LISTEN TO WHAT OUR PARTNERS AROUND NEW ENGLAND ARE DOING SO WE DO N'T HAVE A RUN O THE SYSTEM FROM OUTSIDERS .
OH SURE .
NO NO , LOOK IT ONE THING THAT WE ARE SHOULD BE EVERYONE IN STATE SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF HIS THIS HAS BEEN A TEAM EFFORT ALL ALONG SO I MEET WITH WHERE 'S PERRY PLUMBER LORDSHIP IN AT , DR .
CHAN A GENERAL CONWAY .
WE WE HAVE OUR SENIOR TEAM THAT REALLY IN AND PROVIDES A LOT OF THE KIND OF FINAL CHECK OFF ON A LOT OF THE DECISIONS THAT WE 'RE MAKING AND ALSO WHEN WE GET SOME CONSTITUENT ISSUES THAT COME UP WHETHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEVEL INDIVIDUAL LEVEL .
THOSE ARE ALL FLOWING THROUGH A SINGLE CHAIN OF COMMAND AS WELL .
SO THE COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN VERY VERY GOOD AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE WE 'RE MAKING WE 'RE ALL ON THE SAME BOAT ON THE PICTURE .
WE HAVE N'T LOOKED AT THE ONLY I MADE A UNILATERAL DECISION , BUT NOW , YOU I SHOULD N'T SAY UNILATERAL AND TALK .
TO THEM .
WE JUST MADE THAT DECISION ON FRIDAY .
I BELIEVE WE MADE TWO DECISIONS ONE WITH REAL ESTATE THE REAL ESTATE ASSOCIATION AND BROKERS HOW THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO TRANSACTIONS AND WE LOOKED AT THE LANGUAGE AND STIPULATIONS THAT WERE GIVEN IN OTHER STATES TO DO THAT AND PROVIDE THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY AGAIN SIMILAR TO OUR NEIGHBORS THE OTHER ONE BEING THE CURBSIDE THAT MADE PERFECT SENSE .
I WAS TALKING TO SENATOR SUE SEE ABOUT THAT ABOUT SOME OF THE BUSINESSES IN SOME OF HER DISTRICTS THAT WERE CALLING AND ASKING IF THEY COULD HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND KNOWING THAT YOU KNOW , THERE WAS GOING TO BE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEY JUST AND GOT RID OF A LOT OF THEIR EMPLOYEES .
WE WANTED TO PROVIDE THAT FLEXIBILITY , BUT GOING FORWARD .
WE 'LL TAKE THEM ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS .
THAT 'S ONE OF THE BENEFITS WE HAVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES AND THEIR NEEDS YEAH .
RIGHT NOW WE 'RE NOT IN THE POSITION TO PROVIDE THAT KIND OF RELIEF ONE THING .
WE ARE LOOKING TO SAY LOOK YOU DO N'T HAVE TO PAY YOUR PROPERTY TAXES OR WE 'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW , CUT THEM IN HALF OR ANYTHING .
THAT 'S REALLY A LOCAL DECISION .
BUT ONE THING WE CAN DO IS POSSIBLY CREATE A PATHWAY .
SO FOLKS DO N'T GET THE INTEREST AND THE PENALTIES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AGAIN , SO WE 'RE NOT PENALIZING FOLKS THAT CAN NOT PAY EARLY ON .
WE 'RE ALLOWING THEM TO DEFER MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL .
WE DO N'T WANT TO CREATE A AN OPPOSITE SITUATION WHERE YOU TAKE EVERYTHING AWAY AND YOU 'RE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COULD SO IT 'S ABOUT REALLY STRIKING THAT RIGHT BALANCE WITH COMMUNITY .
SO FOLKS ARE PAYING WHEN THEY CAN BUT ALLOWING SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE A BIT IN SOME ECONOMICAL CHALLENGED TIMES RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW .
NO , I 'D SAY THAT WE ARE WAVING STANDARDIZED TESTING .
FOR THIS SCHOOL YEAR THE TESTING THAT WE REFER TO THAT MIGHT COME BACK IN THE SUMMER .
THE FALL WOULD BE LIKE THE COLLEGE BOARD 'S AND THE SATS , BUT NO , I THINK WE 'RE GOING TO STRAIGHT STRAIGHT WAVE THE TESTING FOR THIS YEAR BECAUSE COME THE FALL .
THEY 'LL KIDS WILL BE IN THE NEXT GRADE AND MOVING ON TO TO THAT CURRICULUM FOR THOSE TESTS .
ABSOLUTELY .
NO , LOOK .
IT 'S VERY TOUGH TO BALANCE .
I MEAN THE QUESTION REALLY ABOUT IS THERE A MIXED MESSAGE THAT WILL WE DO N'T THINK THERE 'S A MIXED MESSAGE BUT THERE 'S A BALANCE IN THE MESSAGE RIGHT ? THERE 'S THE BALANCE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT WHERE WE SAY LOOK YOU CAN GO OUT , YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GO GET SOME GROCERIES OR WHATEVER IT IS , BUT IF YOU DO N'T NEED TO BE DOING ONCE ONE OF THOSE THREE OR FOUR STIPULATIONS THAT WE 'VE OUTLINED YOU GOT TO BE AT HOME .
THAT 'S THE ORDER YOU REALLY DO NEED TO BE AT HOME , BUT WE WANT PEOPLE TO AGAIN NOT JUST , YOU KNOW BE OUTSIDE FRIVOLOUSLY .
THAT IS AN IN THEIR BEST INTEREST OF THEIR HEALTH .
THERE 'S JUST NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY , SO IT 'S NOT A MIXED MESSAGE AS MUCH AS IT IS KIND OF A BALANCING ACT OF SAYING LOOK THIS IS WHERE WE 'RE COMING DOWN IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNMENT .
THAT 'S A VERY TOUGH CALL TO MAKE AS A GOVERNMENT AND THE LIVE FREE OR DIE STATE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND WE DO N'T TAKE ANY OF IT LIGHTLY AT ALL , BUT IT 'S ALSO THE PART OF THE THE BENEFIT OF THIS IS ELEVATING THAT MESSAGE .
WE WANT FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS IT IS THAT WE ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INDIVIDUALIZED WITH THEIR WORKPLACE WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FAMILIES .
THAT 'S REALLY ONE OF THE THE UNDERLYING POINTS HERE IN TALKING TO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEM .
THAT WAS ONE OF THE POINTS THEY MADE VERY LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WE WANT THIS MESSAGE TO BE ELEVATED UNDERSTAND ITS IT IS UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY HERE FOR THE LONG-TERM LONG-TERM BEING WEEKS TO MONTHS AND THEN WE 'LL SEE SOMEONE ASKED ME TODAY .
WHAT ARE THE METRICS TO UNDOING A LOT OF THIS ? WHAT ARE THE METRICS TO PROVIDE A MORE FLEXIBILITY ? I WISH I HAD A GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT , WE 'RE NOT THERE YET IN .
WE 'VE NEVER SEEN THE MODELS ON THE BACK END .
WE 'VE NEVER SEEN ANY COMMUNITY IN THIS COUNTRY .
COME ON THE DOWNSIDE OF THIS IN TERMS OF HOW HOW THEY COME OUT AND PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY .
I CAN TELL YOU THIS .
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE GREATER IN PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY THAN IT WAS IN PROVIDING THE RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE WHAT YOU DO N'T WANT IS TRULY THAT MIXED MESSAGE .
WE 'RE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STILL WE WANT PEOPLE TO TAKE THE SOCIAL RESPONSE AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITIES VERY SERIOUSLY AS WE SEE NUMBERS GO DOWN .
AS WE CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY , BUT WE DO N'T WANT TO DO IT SO FAST THAT WE SEE ANOTHER SURGE ON THE BACK END AND THAT IS GOING TO BE I THINK ONE OF THE MORE CHALLENGING DECISIONS THAT WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE AND WE 'RE ALREADY STARTING PLANNING FOR THAT DO N'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE METRICS WILL BE WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES BUT AND SEE WHERE OUR DATA IS , BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT 'S ONE OF THE ONES THAT REALLY WEIGHS ON OUR MIND THAT IT 'S GOING TO BE THAT 'S GOING TO BE A BIT OF A BALANCING ACT FOR FOR ALL OF US .
I THINK .
YES , SIR .
FROM THE MEDICAL EXAMINER 'S OFFICE .
I ASSUME RIGHT .
SURE , RIGHT RIGHT .
SO FIRST I 'M GOING TO TALK TO CHANDLER COME UP TO TALK TO YOU SPECIFICALLY HOW WE HOW WE DETERMINE THE NUMBER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ASK FOR A LITTLE BIT CLARIFICATION OF YOUR QUESTION , ARE YOU ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT A BACKLOG OF PEOPLE WHO DIED AT THE MEDICAL EXAMINER 'S ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT AT THE FUNERAL HOME ? BECAUSE BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY I MEAN PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY ARE PASSING AWAY AND STATE AND OTHER STATES ALL THE TIME .
MMM YEAH , SO I 'M NOT AWARE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED THAT HAVE THAT ARE AWAITING TESTING WITH I SAID , WE MAY NOT BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO KNOW IF SOMEONE HAS PASSED AWAY AND IS BEING TESTED FOR COVID-19 .
BUT AS I HAVE AND AS I 'VE MENTIONED BEFORE THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CASES OF IN THE STATE IN THE COMING DAYS .
WEEKS CERTAINLY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HOSPITALIZED AND THAT INCLUDES UNFORTUNATELY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ALSO DIED OR PASSED AWAY FROM FROM COVID-19 .
SOMETIMES THERE CAN BE A LAG TIME BETWEEN WHEN SOMEBODY PASSES AWAY AND WHEN A TEST RESULT CAN COME BACK BUT AS TESTING CAPACITY INCREASES , HOPEFULLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , BUT BETWEEN THAT BETWEEN THAT WAITING PERIOD THAT MAY NOT DIRECTLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION , BUT I THINK PART OF THE PART OF THE DECISION MAKERS ON WHO GETS TESTED IN THE EVENT OF DEATH OR NOT ONLY TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS , BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY THE MEDICAL EXAMINER 'S AND SO IT 'S HARD TO GIVE AN EXACT ANSWER , BUT I 'M NOT AWARE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED THAT WAITING COVID-19 TESTING .
YEAH , I THINK IT I THINK IT PARTLY .
THE QUESTION FOR THE MEDICAL EXAMINER , BUT OFTENTIMES TESTING CAN BE DIFFERENT IN SOMEONE WHO HAS WHO HAS PASSED AWAY FROM A DISEASE , ESPECIALLY IF IT 'S UNKNOWN THE REASON FOR THE CAUSE FROM BEING PASSED AWAY , BUT CERTAINLY WHETHER SOMEONE 'S YOU KNOW IN THE HOSPITAL OR HAS PASSED AWAY THE SAME KINDS OF SAMPLES LIKE NASAL SWABS THROAT SWABS CAN BE RUN IF THERE IS QUESTION REGARDING THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH THERE THERE COULD POTENTIALLY BE MORE EXTENSIVE TESTING THAT IS PERFORMED AND SOME OF THAT TESTING MAY NEED TO BE DONE THROUGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION .
SO IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION AND THE THE EVENTS SURROUNDING A PERSON 'S DEATH IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH TESTI DONE .
THANKS .
YEAH .
YEAH , SO WE WE ARE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES HAS WERE HAVE WORKED THROUGH THE MAJORITY OF OUR BACKLOG .
I CURRENTLY PENDING .
THERE 'S ONLY ABOUT 60 TO 70 TESTS THAT ARE PENDING AT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY .
SO THAT 'S CERTAINLY DOWN FROM THE MIDDLE OF LAST WEEK WHEN WE HAD EIGHT OR NINE HUNDRED TESTS PENDING .
I THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK MEDICAL CENTERS TO THANK FOR THAT WHO TOOK SOME OF OUR SAMPLES AND AND WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE BACKLOG THAT WE HAD .
I THINK WE 'RE HEARING THESE REPORTS AS WELL OF YOU KNOW , PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAVE WAITED A WEEK OR MORE FOR TEST RESULTS TO COME BACK NOW THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY .
WORK THROUGH THE BACKLOG THAT WE HAD TESTING AT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES SHOULD BE MUCH MUCH LESS , YOU KNOW WITHIN THE ORDER OF A DAY OR TWO .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAMPLE , BUT I AM AWARE OF OTHER TESTING CENTERS COMMERCIAL LABS , FOR EXAMPLE , THAT ALSO HAVE BACKLOGS WHERE THE TURNAROUND TIME HAS GREATLY LENGTH AND GIVEN THE DEMAND FOR TESTING AND SO I THINK IT 'S IMPORTANT TO FOR PROVIDERS THAT ARE WAITING ON TESTS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR TESTS ARE GOING AND MAY NOT BE COMING TO THE HEALTH LABORATORIES , THEY MAY BE GOING TO A COMMERCIAL LAB OUT OF STATE .
AND SO WE ARE HEARING THAT THERE ARE BACKLOGS BUT AT LEAST OUR PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , WE WORK THROUGH THE BACKLOG THAT WE 'VE HAD AND HAVE A MUCH MORE REASONABLE TURNAROUND TIME NOW .
THANKS .
YEAH , THAT 'S A GREAT QUESTION .
AND YOU KNOW , I THINK IN THE IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD DO AS MUCH TESTING AS WE 'RE ABLE TO SORRY PROVIDERS WOULD DO AS MUCH TESTING AS THEY 'RE ABLE TO ESPECIALLY IF THAT 'S COMBINED WITH CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY EXPOSED SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM CONTINUES TO DO THOSE CONTACT INVESTIGATIONS ON THE 314 PEOPLE AS THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO KEEP UP WITH WITH THOSE TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS , WHICH CAN BE VERY TIME CONSUMING .
SO AS WE 'VE AS I 'VE MENTIONED BEFORE , YOU KNOW , IT 'S NOT IT 'S NOT TEST KITS THEMSELVES THAT ARE THE LIMITATION WITH TESTING HERE .
IT 'S THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN FOR THE TESTING PROCESS THAT INCLUDES THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT .
THE PROVIDERS NEED TO WEAR TO DO THE TESTING THE SWABS WERE SAMPLING THE THE TRANSPORT SOLUTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED TO TRANSPORT A SWAB FROM THE SITE OF COLLECTION THE LABORATORY .
SO MANY OF THOSE KEY PIECES OF SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT STILL REMAIN A LIMITATION WERE ACTIVELY WORKING TO TRY AND INCREASE SUPPLIES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND THE SWABS AND THE REAGENTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR TESTING AND I THINK AS WE HAVE INCREASED CAPACITY TO TEST WE WILL CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE PROVIDERS TO TO DO TESTING ON PATIENTS , BUT GIVEN THE THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NATIONALLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS CERTAINLY IN PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT IN SOME SAMPLING .
WE CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE TESTING FOR THOSE WHO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT CAN INCLUDE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FIRST RESPONDERS PEOPLE THAT LIVE OR WORK AT LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES , FOR EXAMPLE , THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE OR WORKING WITH MORE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS , BUT I WANT TO ALSO STRESS THAT , YOU KNOW , TESTING AND PUBLIC HEALTH INVESTIGATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO TRY AND SLOW THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS .
BUT WE CA N'T TEST OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC WRITE THIS THIS VIRUS SPREAD SO EASILY AND WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR PEOPLE SHADING AND TRANSMITTING VIRUS EVEN BEFORE THEY MIGHT HAVE SYMPTOMS REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED THAT YOU KNOW , YES TESTING IS IMPORTANT AN IMPORTANT TOOL BUT ONE OF THE KEY WAYS TO SLOW AND PREVENT SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS IN OUR COMMUNITIES REALLY ARE THE SOCIAL DISTANCING STEPS THAT WE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND PEOPLE TAKE DID PEOPLE TAKE TO PREVENT THE CLOSE CONTACT ? THAT 'S THAT 'S REQUIRED FOR THIS VIRUS TO SPREAD BETWEEN PEOPLE .
THANK YOU .
OKAY .
WELL , THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AGAIN .
WE 'LL JUST KIND OF KEEP BRINGING UPDATES TODAY WAS I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOT OF RELIEF IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING IN BACKING UP SOME OF THE INITIAL PROGRAMS THAT WE GOT STARTED HERE .
IT 'S ALL ABOUT PROVIDING THAT ANDY BUT ALSO MAINTAINING THAT SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT PHYSICAL DISTANCING WITHIN OUR HOME AND OUR WORKPLACE AND OUR PRIVATE LIVES THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE IN THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE .
SO WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY 'S PATIENCE .
WE 'RE IN THIS FOR .
