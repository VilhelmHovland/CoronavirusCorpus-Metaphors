Fauci : US can expect more than 100,000 COVID-19 deaths , millions of cases  On CNN 's State of the Union Sunday , the leading U .
authority on the COVID-19 pandemic made some grim predictions about the course of the novel coronavirus as it rages through communities within the United States .
Anthony Fauci , the longtime director for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and emerging face of American leadership in the fight against the virus , estimated that the U .
may see between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths from COVID-19 , the deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
A deeply-respected authority on viral diseases , Fauci assisted in guiding the federal response to SARS , MERS , Ebola and now the novel coronavirus .
Fauci cautioned that these estimates are based on models and a model is only as accurate as the assumptions that go into building it .
An extreme worst-case situation in which the coronavirus causes millions of American deaths remains " not impossible but very , very unlikely .
"  " Whenever the models come in , they give a worst-case scenario and a best-case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Generally , the reality is somewhere in the middle .
I 've never seen a model of the diseases that I 've dealt with where the worst case actually came out .
They always overshoot .
"  Fauci believes that the U .
is likely going to have " millions of cases " but broadly cautioned against relying on modeling estimates while still stressing the extreme risk the virus poses .
" I just do n't think that we really need to make a projection when it 's such a moving target that we could so easily be wrong and mislead people , " Fauci said .
He added that outbreaks in New York , New Orleans and other areas with " serious problems " remain worrisome , indicating that the data at hand is plenty of cause for concern .
As of Sunday morning , 2,197 people in the U .
have lost their lives fighting the virus , with 125,313 confirmed cases in the country to date according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
The number of actual cases of the virus on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble some parts of the country and many mild or asymptomatic cases go untested .
