? v=rIeTNCsBThc **2688;1061; ' Everyone must calm down and focus on what is possible '  Teachers should not have to deliver full timetables of distance-learning during the coronavirus lockdown , writes the joint general secretary of the NEU teaching union .
Instead they should be concentrating on caring for one another , and for their students  We are all having to get used to new ways of working in the time of the coronavirus .
Schools are closed for the vast majority of pupils .
Those who are still attending school are not being taught by their usual teacher , not learning with their normal classmates .
They are not following anything like their previous timetable .
Nor are they grouped in their normal classes .
Schools are adapting to the new circumstances we are in and organising their provision in different ways .
Such sense seems , however , to have departed from some schools where there appears to be a belief that we can recreate a normal school experience in every child 's home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to submit a full timetable of lessons .
In some cases teachers are being instructed to send out assignments for pupils to complete .
In others teachers are being told to send a detailed summary of their day 's distance-teaching in a format they have never been trained in .
Unworkable demands  Schools who are requiring such activities have clearly forgotten some very important things .
They have forgotten that :  Distance-learning activities take far , far longer to prepare because so much that would be covered by teacher exposition in the classroom has to be written down .
The workload of producing a distance-learning plan for every lesson would be enormous and undoable .
It would be completely unreasonable to expect teachers to do this , and it would be completely unworkable .
Many pupils will have very limited -- or no access -- to the internet .
Teachers have different levels of expertise when it comes to IT .
They can not transform themselves into experts at online learning , using platforms they are unfamiliar with , without any support and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many other worries and concerns .
Many teachers working from home will themselves be juggling childcare with working .
Pupils have parents -- some of whom will be highly anxious that their children do not fall behind , while other parents will be highly nervous that they are not able to support their children 's distance-learning activities .
So it is very important , in this time of crisis , that we are sensible .
We have not got to let the best be the enemy of the good .
We have to consider , carefully , what is possible .
We must understand that it is not reasonable to expect that all children will be working remotely for five hours a day .
We must understand that teachers simply can not deliver their normal timetabled lessons remotely .
We must plan for the longer term in a sustainable and manageable way .
NEU guidance  The National Education Union has today issued important guidance for leaders , primary and secondary school teachers , guidance which should underpin how schools approach their communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasises that teachers working from home can only carry out a reasonable workload and that this should be discussed with them , not imposed upon them .
For pupils , a maximum of two to three hours ' work a day is plenty , keeping minds active and enthusiastic .
Flexible tasks that cover different areas of the curriculum , allowing pupils to choose those tasks that interest them , will make it more likely that they will complete them .
If this seems blindingly obvious , I can only say that it is not obvious in some schools , which appear to believe that they can carry on as though their pupils were still in school and in lessons when they manifestly are not .
Some of what is driving the unrealistic demands being placed on teachers is a general anxiety about how GCSE and A level and BTEC grades will be determined .
Teachers and leaders are understandably anxious that , with the exams cancelled , there is enough evidence to support the awarding of a particular grade .
Ofqual is working quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far about their proposals for pupils in England .
For most qualifications , including GCSEs , AS and A levels , teachers will be asked to submit their judgements about the grades that they believe each student would have received if exams had gone ahead .
These judgements will take account of , but not be based upon , the grades pupils achieved in their mock exams , but also on a range of wider evidence , including classwork , coursework , controlled assessment and practical pieces .
Ofqual has made it clear that teachers do not need to set new work for their pupils to complete at home for more evidence to support grading .
The reasons for this should be clear .
Without direct access to teachers , and with very different levels of parental support and learning resources , any work done would be much more a result of pupils ' home circumstances than their ability .
So , if I can make one heartfelt plea to the profession , to school leaders and teachers , it is this : calm down .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Taking this sensible , pragmatic approach is not letting anyone down .
It is not lowering standards .
It is , rather , accepting that we are in a crisis .
And in a crisis the best thing we can do is care for one another and care for our pupils .
If we achieve this we will have worked wonders .
