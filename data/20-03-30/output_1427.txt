" In some of the schools we 're working in , more than 50 per cent of kids are on free school meals .
And for some of them , it 's the only hot meal they 'll get in a day .
We 're determined to keep this going .
" Of course , when you have chefs who know their stuff they can make food which is incredibly tasty .
"  Some schools have been unable to carry on supplying free school meals , partly due to illness or because caterers have pulled out following the pandemic , said Ms Glavin .
That is despite schools remaining partially open for vulnerable children and those of key workers fighting the pandemic .
More than a dozen chefs have so far volunteered to help in the scheme .
They include chefs from London 's Ottolenghi restaurants such as Nopi , in London 's Soho , as well as the River Cottage and Jamie Oliver chains .
The project is also feeding children eligible for free school meals who are not in school , whose parents can collect the food from " hubs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wahaca and Natoora have also donated food for the project , currently in London with plans to expand nationwide .
Any chefs or companies who can offer help , or any schools which need help or which could offer their site as a hub , should visit the Chefs in Schools website .
