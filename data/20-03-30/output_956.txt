Like those on college campuses across the country , the Whitworth fields and courts are all but empty these days .
With competitions shuttered for the rest of the spring , Pirates teams disbanded early , their seasons cut short by national efforts to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic .
The Division III Administrative Committee canceled all spring national championships on March 12 ; the next day , it granted an extra season of eligibility for spring sports athletes .
Division I will vote on whether to afford its spring athletes an extra season on Monday .
At the time , Whitworth 's baseball team , 11-5 overall , was preparing to host a three-game series that weekend at Merkel Field .
The women 's tennis team was 4-4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Conference meets .
And the track and field team had just begun its outdoor season .
All those seasons were suspended on March 12 and canceled officially four days later .
For college seniors the sudden end was particularly difficult -- and especially so for D-III athletes .
For them , there are no scholarships , and the promise of an extra season of eligibility , while an affordance they appreciate , is not something everyone can take advantage of .
" The challenge is , if you were set to graduate , what are you gon na do in the fall ? " said Whitworth athletics director Tim Demant .
" I do n't anticipate many of our seniors coming back .
"  Many have jobs lined up already .
Some had already graduated in December and were taking one or two classes while they took advantage of their final season of eligibility .
Some do plan to return next spring , Demant said , and if they enroll at another school someday down the road , they still will have that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Whitworth 's spring athletes , one thing is certain : This is not at all how they expected their college careers to end .
Sarah Cool : Running with a new purpose  " It 's weird to have to exercise and do things on my own , " she said after a midday run at the Timberlake High School track in Spirit Lake , Idaho .
" Now I 'm exercising for my health , and not for competing for anything .
"  After the track and field season ended , Cool moved to Spirit Lake , where her mother moved when Cool first graduated from Ketchikan High School .
Cool hoped to play soccer collegiately , and she did for a year -- as a sophomore -- at Whitworth .
But she found success as a cross-country runner and as a track and field athlete in various events , including the heptathlon .
But the summer before her junior season in 2018 , she suffered " a lot of tears and fractures " in her knee and was n't back to competing until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meets .
She has coped with the season 's conclusion in various stages , she said .
" First it was a lot of anger and denial , " Cool said .
" I felt like I had worked so hard to get to that point , and to have it taken away from me felt like I had been robbed of two years of athletics .
"  But lately she has reflected on it differently , holding that everything happens for a reason .
" Maybe the reason was I was gon na re-hurt myself , or maybe I was not gon na perform like I wanted , and it would have torn me down in an emotional way , " she said .
" So I 'm really trying to look at it from the aspect of ( there 's ) not much I could do , and I 'm not the only one , and I have to move forward .
"  Cool plans to enroll in a physical therapy graduate program at the University of Montana in the fall .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't yet accustomed to speaking about her tennis career at Whitworth in the past tense .
" I think that 's the first time I actually said it correctly the first time , " she said .
" It 's been like , ' I play , ' and I 'd catch myself and have to change it up .
It 's definitely been hard .
"  Lee was the lone senior on the Pirates ' women 's tennis team , which started -- and ultimately ended -- Northwest Conference play with a 3-1 record .
Individually , Lee was 2-4 on the season as the team 's No .
1 singles player and 5-2 with No .
1 doubles partner Avery Liening , a junior .
" This is true for pretty much every athlete at Whitworth : Tennis and sports , it was pretty much my life at Whitworth , " Lee said .
" I was already mentally prepared to say ' bye ' to it in April .
"  But the abrupt nature of the season 's cancellation was difficult , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , so ever since then every day is : Go to school , go to practice , do homework , and there 's my day , " Lee said .
Technically Lee already graduated , though she hopes there can be a spring commencement so she can walk then .
Unlike some Whitworth seniors , Lee has n't gone home during the stay-home order .
She is still working at a Starbucks near campus .
She continues to play when she can , though when the indoor tennis bubble was closed last week " that was another hit , " she said .
Currently , Lee is enrolled in classes online to get a degree as a veterinary technician and eventually intends to go to veterinary school .
She plans to stay in Spokane for now , she said , and whenever adult tennis leagues start up again , she intends to join one .
" I was never gon na give it up , " she said .
Kalista Fourre : Two bonus seasons  A basketball and softball player in high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  But then Whitworth started a lacrosse program , and Fourre figured there was no harm in trying out .
During the 2019 season , her first year playing the sport -- not just collegiately , but competitively at any level -- Fourre earned second-team All-Northwest Conference as a defender .
" At first it was really terrifying , " she said , " but I really liked the challenge that it brought .
I also did n't realize how much I missed the competition aspect of playing a team sport and the camaraderie of your teammates .
It filled a hole in me I did n't know I had .
"  The Pirates only got in three matches before the season was canceled , going 1-2 with a 19-5 victory over Whitman on March 11 .
Fourre said she is likely done and has a gap year planned after she graduates this spring .
Her goal is to enroll in a master 's program after that to pursue a career in cancer research .
Though she counts the two years as a bonus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fourre said it was hard to see the season cut short .
She estimated she spent at least 12 hours a week with her teammates -- even more with best friend Hannah Meador , who persuaded her to try out in the first place .
" You get really used to seeing them all the time , and that becomes for me the highlight of my day , " she said .
" I feel like I can step onto the lacrosse field and be there with my teammates , and I can forget about everything else in my life and focus in on that one thing .
I miss that .
"  Nick McGill : One more season to go  Nick McGill was in North Carolina preparing to compete in the D-III Indoor Track and Field Championships when news about cancellations flooded in .
" It went from being family and coaches only , to coaches and athletes only , and that was the status quo at practice , " McGill said of the ever tightening restrictions on fans .
Those announcements came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled to begin .
By late that afternoon , the whole competition was canceled .
McGill , his wife and his parents changed their flights and returned to Spokane .
McGill was one of 20 heptathletes scheduled to compete at nationals ; a year earlier , McGill finished ninth in the event and set a Whitworth record with a 4,900-point performance .
He beat his own record by 34 points at the Portland Indoor in February .
" It was kinda numb for a while .
It just did n't really set in until we got back , " McGill said .
" It still has n't completely .
"  For McGill , though , this will not be the end of his competitive career .
His plan is to enroll in a graduate program next year so he can take advantage of the extra season of eligibility given to Division III spring-sport athletes .
McGill , who also plays football for the Pirates , has a job lined up already , one he has been working at this week .
They have been flexible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like , he said .
" One thing after the dust had settled a bit , there was some excitement because I 've never had the fall and summer season to train for track , " McGill said .
" It 's always been football through the summer and the fall , so that 's a little bit exciting .
That was the silver lining .
There 's more time to train for next year , and there 's still an opportunity to compete .
