Letter to the Editor : Government needs to lead on virus response  Share  I was impressed with the column " State must do more against virus " and the struggle the writer went through in making his decision to close his business .
The writer followed his conscience and closed his business .
Others made different choices .
It was therefore heartening to read the headline in the Portland Press Herald on Thursday , March 19 , " Governor Tightens Restrictions , " a step in the right direction .
Government , with its arsenal of health care professionals and science experts has a role .
When these decisions affect the population , they should not be optional .
Government can and should speak with a clear voice , requiring the collective conscience to behave in a way that is necessary for the survival of all , not left to whim , or to conscience or lack thereof .
Businesses should comply with definitive guidelines set by those who know for the safety of the public .
The day will come when COVID-19 will be a memory , stories of the selfish and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did without ; of those who practiced " social distancing " and those who continued going out ; of those business owners who shuttered for the greater good , hoping to ride out the storm or to rebuild , and those whose businesses remained open to the public .
Government has access to the science and to the experts for our best chance to stop this spread , and to reduce confusion through uniformity .
The least government can do is to be clear , to be decisive , to be uniform , and most of all , to lead .
