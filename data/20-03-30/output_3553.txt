The government must delay a wide-ranging defence and foreign policy review that began at the beginning of this year , a former head of the Foreign Office and national security adviser has said .
announced plans at the end of last year for an integrated review of foreign policy , defence , security and international development , which is expected to be published alongside a comprehensive spending review this summer .
But Lord Peter Ricketts , who as the government 's national security adviser oversaw a similar review in 2010 , said neither the integrated review nor the spending exercise were likely to go ahead as planned as departments scrambled to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak .
" It 's a very big and detailed and important strategic review , and it ca n't be completed between now and July , in my view , " Ricketts told CSW .
Ricketts , who spent four years as permanent under secretary of the Foreign Office before becoming Britain 's first national security adviser in 2010 , said he did not expect the review to be completed until early next year .
" It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but this crisis until the mid year , probably .
And so it would be sensible to give themselves another six months , nine months .
They need n't be precise about a time when they delay it .
But I think they now need to be making clear there will be a delay and new timings will be agreed , " he said .
During his two years as national security adviser , Ricketts oversaw the 2010 National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review and set up the National Security Council , which will decide how the next review 's findings are implemented .
It is also unlikely the government will be able to carry out a full spending review by this summer , given the civil service 's stretched capacity during the pandemic , according to Ricketts .
" You ca n't possibly , I think , do a sensible job on that between now and July , " the crossbench peer said , adding that any future review would need to take account of the " vast additional spending " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses .
" So it may be that they need a one-year spending review settlement in July , to keep things going for a year , and then come back to both the strategy review and the spending review in the early part of next year .
"  Ricketts said there would be " no shame " in making such a choice .
" There 's no reason the government should be criticised for it , it seems to me to be the absolutely obvious thing to do , " he said .
Brexit transition extension ' inevitable '  Ricketts also said the government would need to request an extension to the Brexit transition period " fairly soon " , as it would be impossible to complete all the negotiations needed to define the UK 's future relationship with the EU by 31 December .
" I 'm absolutely clear that it needs to be delayed , the end of the transition period .
I do n't see how in the current extreme crisis that we 're in -- because I think it is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can possibly find the bandwidth to negotiate these extremely detailed , difficult , controversial agreements on future relationship , there 's no way we can do it , " Ricketts said .
Last week Sir Simon Fraser , who succeeded Ricketts as FCO perm sec in 2010 , said the government must not rule out an extension in light of the coronavirus crisis , as it was looking increasingly unlikely the UK and EU would hammer out a comprehensive deal by December  He told CSW it would be " irresponsible " to end the transition period under circumstances that created more uncertainty for businesses , given Covid-19 had already created a " major economic crisis " .
" It seems to me it would be irresponsible , frankly , if we come out of this crisis in autumn to then present business with a whole new set of uncertainties around a very significant change in the status of our economic relationship with Europe , either through no deal or through a very thin deal at the end of the year , " Fraser , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innovation and Skills , said .
Ricketts went further , saying the government would need to " face the inevitable " and call for an extension within the next month or two .
The withdrawal agreement the prime minister signed last year allows for an extension of up to two years , but this must be signed off by 1 July .
" I know it 's difficult for the government to accept , but since half the negotiators on both sides seem to already have the virus and now ministers as well , it feels to me it 's the time fairly soon to just accept that it should be delayed , say for another year , " he said .
" I do n't think anybody would be surprised or outraged by that , if they think about it .
It does create some problems about budgets and so on , but it seems to me just impossible that we can do a good job of negotiating something as difficult as that in this current crisis .
"  Over the weekend , Boris Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Health secretary Matt Hancock is also among a handful of ministers to have contracted the virus .
This came after EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier tested positive for Covid-19 earlier this month , and a day later his UK counterpart David Frost began self isolating after showing symptoms of the virus .
