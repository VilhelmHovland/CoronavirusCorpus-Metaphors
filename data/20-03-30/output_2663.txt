While there is a lot of uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic , one thing is certain : the effect on Calgary 's restaurants will be profound .
As many restaurants close their dining rooms to ensure social distancing , local business owners are trying innovative ways to keep Calgarians fed while generating at least some revenue .
For the most part , that means take-out .
Calgary is already set up with many ghost kitchens ( i .
restaurants that exist only for take-out ) and places that rely on delivery outfits like Door Dash and Skip the Dishes , but many of our renowned independent restaurants have previously resisted joining the delivery craze because their food does n't travel particularly well .
But times , of course , have suddenly and quite drastically changed .
The Mburger at Modern Steak .
Calgary  Modern Steak has found itself in a unique position in that it was already planning to launch its MBurger take-out service this week , long before COVID-19 was a concern .
Owner Stephen Deere did n't want to ruin the integrity of his premium ranch-specific Alberta steaks by packing them in to-go boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that reflected his restaurant 's level of quality and execution .
Sourced from Benchmark Angus , the burger patties are made of a blend of short-rib , chuck and brisket and go for a very reasonable $7 .
( $10 .
for a double and $13 .
for a triple ) .
The short menu also includes veggie burgers ( $8 .
) , wagyu hot dogs ( $7 .
) , traditional sides and milkshakes ( $6 ) .
MBurger is available through both Door Dash and Skip the Dishes or via pick-up at the Stephen Avenue Modern Steak location ( 100 8th Ave .
) if you call ahead at 403-244-3600 .

You ca n't belly up to the bar at Dandy Brewing Company right now , but they will deliver their craft beers to home customers or you can stop by to pick up some ale .
Postmedia filesCourtesy , Dandy Brewing Company  But not all local restaurants have the infrastructure in place to pivot to take-out so easily , though it does n't mean they are n't trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2003 11th St .
) is delivering its beer directly to home customers and while it is n't doing food delivery at this time , chef Merritt Gordon is keeping his kitchen open so customers can grab a to-go snack if they stop into the tasting room to pick up beer themselves .
Again , Gordon was concerned about how well his regular menu would travel , so he 's focusing on easily packed comfort foods like his very popular hot chicken sandwich on white bread with gravy and peas ( $16 ) , lentil and roasted garlic soup ( $10 ) , and an elk spaghetti Bolognese ( $19 ) .
The team at Bar Von Der Fels ( 1005A 1st St .
) has a similar problem in that their regular menu is almost impossible to pack up and they do n't have experience running a take-out business , but owner Will Trow is charging forward and figuring things out as he goes .
Chef Doug King has developed an entirely new small plates menu with items like grits with snow crab and grilled peppers ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brie salad ( $12 ) that can be ordered a la carte or as part of a family-style meal that includes a whole nine-piece menu ( $70 for two people ) .
Bar Von Der Fels is also facilitating take-out with its pop-up partner Pizzaface , with pizzas ranging from $22 to $26 .
Both menus will be delivered within a 5-km radius and are also available for pick-up ( wine is also available with pick-up ) .
Note that the kitchen 's capacity is quite small , so it is best to call well in advance .
Sauce Italian Market owner Jenna Bazzana is one of many local food shops and restaurants creatively trying to manage through the closures .
Postmedia filesDarren Makowichuk / DARREN MAKOWICHUK/Postmedia  Naturally , these are just a few of the restaurants launching delivery or curbside pick-up operations , in addition to the hundreds of local spots that have always had take-out .
As of press time , Charcut , Flores and Pine , Cassis , Cravings , Una Pizza and Wine , Annabelle 's Kitchen , Brasserie Kensington , Market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daily Brett , Sauce Italian Market and many other restaurants are experimenting with what works best for them and their customers .
Naturally , each restaurant 's offerings are subject to change , so check with them ( Instagram seems to be the medium for take-out announcements ) before planning your dinner and exercise patience , as many of these restaurants are doing their best under extraordinary circumstances .
***  Not all restaurants are opting for alternative business solutions ; many are choosing to temporarily close as they wait out this crisis .
But with rent to pay and payrolls to honour , those restaurants also need an immediate injection of cash , which is why many are asking loyal customers to purchase gift certificates for future use .
Nights and Weekends , for example , is running a gift certificate campaign with half of all proceeds going directly to temporarily laid-off staff ( and a 20 per cent discount offered when gift cards are eventually redeemed ) .
To help facilitate the call for gift card sales , the teams behind Shelter , Fine Food Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Eat Later , a directory of restaurants looking to sell gift cards during the COVID-19 crisis .
Restaurants can add themselves to the directory so that customers can shop for gift cards in one place .
