The preventive measures against COVID19 could not be taken in the Bodoland Territorial Council ( BTC ) region due to the restrictions of the Model Code of Conduct ( MCC ) , said Rajya Sabha MP Biswajit Daimary .
On Sunday , Daimary wrote a letter to Alok Kumar , the Assam state election commissioner , drawing his immediate attention and pleading for relaxing the MCC restrictions in the Bodoland Territorial Areas District ( BTAD ) .
" From the time of the declaration of the BTC election , the BTC authority could n't take any decision to take the measure for the protection of the Coronavirus ( COVID19 ) which is financially involved , " said Daimary .
" Even ministers , MLAs , political leaders are also not allowed to announce any financial assistance/payments out of discretionary fund and for the same .
That is why the BTC government is not being able to take steps to fight with Coronavirus /COVID-19 , " he added .
Daimary further wrote : " 15,000 migrant workers and people living outside BTC are coming back since March 2020 .
"  " So , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected person .
Thus , if that happens it will be meaningless to whatever the Assam government has done to tackle the virus , " the Rajya Sabha MP said .
The letter also said : " It is not possible to ask permission and clarification on every works and every moment during this emergency period .
"  Daimary also prayed to the Assam state election commissioner : " Allow us to take all the preventive measures so that protection of Coronavirus in BTC can be done in the line of the other parts of Assam .
"  The BTC election was scheduled to be held on April 4 and the process of nominations also started .
However , due to the sudden outbreak of Coronavirus in the nation , it was postponed for an indefinite period by the Assam state election commissioner on March 20 .
