While the solution for hospital supply shortages may be to ramp up production , a finite number of nurses and specialists stretch short staffs even thinner .
Laurie Kuypers , a registered nurse , reaches into a car to take a nasopharyngeal swab from a patient at a drive-through COVID-19 coronavirus testing station for University of Washington Medicine patients in Seattle , on March 17 , 2020 .
( Elaine Thompson / AP )  The Texas Center for Nursing Workforce Studies in 2016 projected that Texas would have an unmet demand of 60,000 registered nurses by 2030 .
In 2017 , the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis projected the state would have the second largest shortage of registered nurses in the country by that same year , behind only California .
Those familiar with nursing and specialist staffing agree that hospitals were already feeling the effects of personnel shortages , characterized by longer hours , heavier caseloads and exhaustion of staff .
These experts say that unlike supplies such as beds , hospitals ca n't rely on a second wave of health care providers to become available , especially as some staff members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have plenty of beds ; we 'll have plenty of ventilators , " said Britt Berrett , former president of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and former CEO of Medical City in Dallas .
" The supplies will not be the shortcoming , it will be personnel .
"  ' If you ca n't breathe , nothing else matters '  Berrett , currently director for the Center of Healthcare Leadership and Management Program at UT Dallas , praised Abbott 's waiver but said he is especially concerned about the lack of respiratory therapists and hoped such staff could be granted similar waivers .
The most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2017 shows that there are about 2,000 respiratory therapists in the Dallas-Plano-Irving metro area , or about 40 for every 100,000 residents .
Comparatively , there are 41,000 nurses , over 800 for the same number of residents .
These respiratory specialists perform diagnostics and therapy on patients with breathing issues and operate breathing equipment such as ventilators , which have become increasingly in demand for COVID-19 patients .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough respiratory therapists to manage the patients , Berrett said .
Idichandi Idicula , respiratory care program coordinator at El Centro College in Dallas , said it is hard for him to attract applicants to his program because most students interested in the medical field do n't have respiratory therapy on their radar , despite the specialists playing a vital role in rehabilitating patients with breathing problems .
Last year , only 15 students graduated from his program .
" If you ca n't breathe , nothing else matters , " Idicula said .
There is a push from some organizations to move a respiratory therapist degree from an associate 's degree to a bachelor 's degree , Idicula said , but he fears a longer program will create a barrier for entry for future applicants .
Idicula believes if students were allowed to get some form of limited license before they graduate , allowing them to be hired by employers earlier , they could help alleviate pressure on hospital staff if there is a shortage , even if they were n't managing the neediest patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Cindy Zolnierek , CEO of the Texas Nurses Association , said she was pleased to see Abbott 's nursing waivers , one of which allows retired nurses to get back into the workforce .
" Retired nurses want to help , " Zolnierek said .
" It 's a calling .
"  Zolnierek hopes that Abbott 's office will also waive restrictions on advanced practice registered nurses , such as nurse practitioners , that would relieve them from physician supervision .
Zolnierek said it 's a requirement that creates unnecessary red tape during a crisis like COVID-19 .
Another waiver Abbott put into place allows students in the final year of their nursing programs to satisfy more of their required clinical hours virtually or in a lab rather than in person .
Since hospitals began admitting COVID-19 patients , nursing students have been prevented from completing their required clinical hours in person .
Rosalie Mainous , dean of the College of Nursing at Texas Woman 's University , commended the decision , saying it would allow students to continue their training and enter the workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mainous said that even before their licensure , current students are an untapped resource .
She believes senior nursing students could relieve nurses who are on the front lines by taking care of less sick patients in hospitals , helping with screenings or at drive-by testing centers .
Currently , nursing students are not considered essential personnel under Dallas County 's shelter in place order , though Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins could lift that restriction .
Once that barrier is removed , Mainous believes it would take a conversation among deans of nursing colleges and chief nursing officers to figure out how nursing students can best alleviate a staffing shortage if -- or when -- hospitals become overburdened .
