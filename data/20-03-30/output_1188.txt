Letters : The BBC licence fee is an anachronism  Coronavirus predictions  Sir : While precautionary advice regarding the coronavirus should be followed , Ross Clark is right ( ' Feverish imaginations ' , 29 February ) to urge an open mind on the doomsday predictions which are edging us towards panic .
In 1996 the then government 's chief scientific adviser , Professor Kenneth Calman , predicted that 500,000 people could die within a few years from the human form of BSE .
Another official adviser , Professor Richard Lacey , described the disease as ' the time bomb of the 20th century , equivalent to the bubonic plague ' .
In the event , the reported death toll was 177 , while the scare cost the UK an estimated ? 7 billion .
In 2005 the then government 's chief medical officer , Sir Liam Donaldson , warned that avian flu could kill 50,000 people in the UK .
There is no public record of a single death .
In July 2009 he told the NHS to plan for 19,000 to 65,000 deaths from ' swine flu ' during that winter .
The actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with 60 million doses of Tamiflu vaccine , which are said to have cost taxpayers around ? 500 million .
Maritz Vandenberg  London SW15  Licence to gripe  Sir : I am afraid Rory Sutherland misses the point in defending the licence fee ( Wiki Man , 7 March ) .
It has nothing to do with BBC content that we may or may not want .
It is the fact that to watch any programmes on a TV , we have to pay for the BBC in its entirety , even if we watch none of it .
In no other media is this the case .
It is an anachronism -- and sending people to prison for not paying Gary Lineker 's obscene salary is a disgrace .
John Watson  Crowborough , East Sussex  Exonerate Heath  Sir : An independent report by the former high-court judge Sir Richard Henriques into the Metropolitan Police documents in horrifying detail the malpractices which meant that ' the names of Leon Brittan , Lord Bramall and others were dragged through the mud ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though Sir Edward Heath was also cruelly traduced , the government has rejected the calls I have made in the Lords , in association with Lord Armstrong of Ilminster and Lord Butler of Brockwell , former cabinet secretaries who were his close confidants , with unanimous support across the House for an independent review of Operation Conifer , the widely criticised investigation by the Wiltshire police into the allegations against him .
The biased chief constable , Mike Veale , who was ' 120 per cent ' certain of Heath 's guilt , was only mildly censured by internal review before moving to Cleveland Police , from which he was forced to resign a few months later .
The Home Office , which paid most of the ? 1 .
million cost of Operation Conifer , has the power to establish an inquiry .
That is needed to scrutinise the seven allegations left open at the end of the investigation , almost certainly to save the face of the police .
The taint has been removed from the reputations of other leading public figures .
Sir Edward Heath KG should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  House of Lords  Drink Scotch  Sir : The contents of Rod Liddle 's prepping store ( 7 March ) are eerily like that of my own .
However , I take issue with him on the inclusion of four bottles of Jack Daniel 's .
Firstly , four bottles is surely insufficient for two weeks of self-isolation .
Secondly , given the esoteric cooking ingredients and practices to which he ascribes the rise of Covid-19 , one wonders if it is wise to imbibe a stiffener produced in an area of the world where roadkill fricassee is still popular ? It would be better to partake of the superior alcoholic distillation from Scotland , where food hygiene standards are so high that they deep-fry Mars bars before eating them .
Jim Corbett  Cork , Ireland  Cleanliness and godliness  Sir : Charles Moore is taking the National Anthem at a hell of a lick in order to cram it into a 20-second hand-washing session ( Notes , 7 March ) .
I find managing this requires a tempo in excess of 120 crotchet beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bringer of War ' ( Gustav Holst ) or ' Girls Just Wan na Have Fun ' ( Cyndi Lauper ) .
Singing it like this is stressful , not to mention irreligious .
Nevertheless , employing the National Anthem as a guide in hygiene practices is a tremendous idea and is healthy for the body and soul alike .
Thank you , Charles .
Jonathan Quaintrell-Evans  Newcastle upon Tyne  Mussolini madness  Sir : Nicholas Farrell ( Italian Notebook , 7 March ) writes that Mussolini banned the handshake , believing it to be unhygienic and bourgeois , encouraging instead the Roman salute .
As Farrell undoubtedly knows , Mussolini also tried to ban use of the word Lei , the formal and polite form of ' you ' singular , and replace it with Voi , a capitalised version of ' you ' plural .
He believed Lei to be a barbarism of Spanish origin .
Seeking to make Italy self-sufficient , he unsuccessfully tried to ban pasta , thinking Italians should eat homegrown rice instead .
He had huge support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Patrick West  Deal , Kent  Appalled  Sir : Regarding Dot Wordsworth 's ' Behaviours ' ( 7 March ) , my husband and I were discussing Brexit with our teenage grandchildren , one of whom -- knowing that we had voted to leave the EU -- accused us of ' ruining our futures ' .
I was as appalled by her addition of ' s ' to a collective noun as she was by our decision to leave .
