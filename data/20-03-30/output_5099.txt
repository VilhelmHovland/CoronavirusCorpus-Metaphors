What do the East Timorese defence force , " clean coal " , women 's empowerment , and Kevin Rudd 's first-term government have in common ?  The answer is the year 2020 .
Back when 2020 felt like a halcyon time far-far away , this was the year that , respectively , the Government of Timor-Leste , the International Energy Agency , and the United Nations nominated as being either an end point or key waystation for their ambitious , transformative plans , road maps , and goals .
Rudd marked this year as the one to think big towards in his Australia 2020 summit , held in Canberra in 2008 .
All the plans are weighty .
The Timor-Leste defence blueprint Forca 2020 ( complete with covetous pictures of helicopters and surface-to-air missiles ) runs to 148 small-font pages .
While the IEA 's 2009 Technology Roadmap is a bantamweight 52 pages , the Beijing Plan for gender action a whopping 277 , and the Australia 2020 summit report exceeds them all , coming in at 405 .
One can only imagine the forgotten bureaucratic sorrows endured in producing these documents : multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intricate monitoring and report frameworks , translation headaches .
None of these plans ( or any of the myriad that also feature 2020 ) are likely to feature high on The Interpreter 's " quarantine reading list " .
But they are sitll worth labouring through , especially at a time when Covid-19 is sweeping away so many loudly proclaimed planned government certainties from last year , and decimating all plans for this one and next .
Reviewing these documents should make us think about the actual practical value of that default governmental recourse : the long-distant end-goal .
When we get through this present crisis , let 's not plan for futures we do not intend to meet , to produce long-term fig leaves for business-as-usual , plans written at such a level of generality that avoids responsibility , promising faulty futures that we know we will never see .
For sure , planning is important .
Goal-setting is a vital part of long-term government planning .
It can inspire hope , mobilise resources , and create political space for actions that did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning is not the principal purpose for these particular documents , and governments have sought to scope out such scenarios elsewhere .
But to another extent , magnified exponentially by these last few weeks , there seems something both absurd yet strangely comforting about feeling emboldened enough to guess a course for endpoints years away .
The planning documents are proof-positive of that old Yogi Berra maxim that the most difficult thing to predict is the future .
By 2020 , Timor-Leste would be starting to develop its own air force ; there would be 100 carbon capture storage projects globally , mainly for coal , and 12 broad goals for gender action meaningfully progressed .
And for what ? No-one mentions the Forca 2020 plan in Dili nowadays ; the concern there now is the aftermath of devastating floods , as well as Covid-19 .
Failed carbon capture and storage pilot projects litter the world .
How many times have we been promised by the coal industry that emissions from coal can be safely captured and stored away in the not too distant future ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic " ( similar to what Greg Earl has already noted ) .
The Beijing platform for action mentions the word seven times but each time it is with reference to HIV/AIDS rather than a Covid-19 style super-virus .
Covid-19 has kyboshed all meetings this year , including those intended to " tackle the unfinished business of empowering women through a new ground-breaking , multi-generational campaign " .
The public-health components to the Australia 2020 visioning make for eerie reading in the cold light of the present day .
" There is .
potential to leverage from Australia 's science knowledge , applying biowarfare technology to tackling the challenges of a pandemic " avers the Australia 2020 scribe , while emotionlessly noting that while " Australia prides itself on a willingness and ability to respond quickly in the event of a regional crisis .
in the event of a pandemic , this would not be possible .
"  We are four Prime Ministers distant ( excluding his own return ) from the Rudd years .
Hands up who thinks there will be unforeseen events that will ensnarl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on .
First , obviously we need to plan , but let 's not do so pretending the future is predictable .
When we get through this present crisis , let 's not plan for futures we do not intend to meet , to produce long-term fig leaves for business-as-usual , plans written at such a level of generality that avoids responsibility , promising faulty futures that we know we will never see .
By all means set long-term plans .
But better to know what concrete actions you will do this year and then the next to get there .
Second , just maybe , in an oddly counterintuitive but comforting way , the return of all those loose , saggy , convoluted planning documents will be one of those ineffable signs that the governments and institutions of the world as we know it are settling back to their normal rhythms .
If that 's so , we 'll be on the first plane to any gauzily focused planning plenary going .
