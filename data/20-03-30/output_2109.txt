Penny Sutcliffe , Medical Officer of Health with Public Health Sudbury &amp; Districts , addresses the media at a press conference at the health unit in Sudbury , Ont .
on Wednesday March 11 , 2020 .
Sutcliffe confirmed the first positive case of COVID-19 in the Sudbury and Manitoulin districts .
John Lappa/Sudbury Star  With one new case of COVID-19 reported in the Sudbury-Manitoulin area on Monday , local health organizations are preparing for still more .
So far , the Sudbury area has recorded 11 cases of the virus , most of them in the past week .
" I do n't think we 're able to say at all that we are on the downward , " said Dr .
Penny Sutcliffe , medical officer of health with Public Health Sudbury and Districts .
" We 're still in the midst of this and everyone , not just us but all our partners in health care , is at the ready for more illness to come .
"  Health Sciences North said Monday it still has no admitted patients with coronavirus but has nonetheless taken steps to free up room for an expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hospital said it has been able to shrink occupancy from 529 patients to 350 , and is looking to more than double the number of critical-care beds available .
" The cancellation of elective surgeries and procedures has been the main driver to help reduce the number of patients admitted to HSN , " said Jason Turnbull , spokesperson for the health centre .
" Our plans are to grow , as required , the critical-care bed capacity from the current 41 to 102 to care for COVID-19 patients , " he added .
" This is made possible by the fact that our current number of admitted patients is down by 179 compared to our March peak .
"  Turnbull said HSN is also exploring ways to accommodate patients at other sites .
" We will be confirming later this week our plans to create hospital surge capacity outside the Ramsey Lake Health Centre , " he said .
HSN currently has 62 ventilators across its units , with more on order and the ability to access more ventilators from the province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same : stay home as much as possible , wash your hands , curtail contact with others .
" We know our health-care system ca n't handle an explosion , so we have to do everything we can to avoid that , " said Sutcliffe .
The medical officer said she worries about complacency or impatience setting in as the weeks go by with the same messaging , and no huge spike in Sudbury 's tally .
" I 'm concerned about fatigue -- people saying they do n't want to do it anymore , we 're not seeing any new cases anyway , maybe we 're overreacting , " she said .
" But that 's the whole point -- we 're not seeing huge increases in cases because we are taking these actions right now .
"  The number of infections in the Sudbury area is relatively small compared to many southern communities , and roughly on par with its regional neighbours , said Sutcliffe .
" I know across the North we are tracking similarly to others , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although there are also disadvantages that will become more clear over time , the PHSD head cautioned .
" We have some protection in terms of less density of population and not having as much international travel coming through our airports , " she said .
" We get a bit of a warning and time to prepare , but it 's both a blessing and a curse , because once an infection is introduced here , it 's very difficult to manage with our remote communities and smaller health-care capacity .
"  Sutcliffe said demand for resources such as ventilators and masks will likely keep growing in more populous centres , making it all the more important for Sudbury to conserve its supplies and limit the spread of the disease .
" There will be a bigger burden in southern parts of the province and the health-care system will need to respond to that , " she said .
" There 's only so much to go around , so we 're not going to be able to look elsewhere for support .
We really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping that curve as flat as possible .
"  So far all of the local cases of COVID-19 have been related to travel , or close contact with someone who caught the virus elsewhere , but Sutcliffe said residents should n't take too much comfort in that as the disease is likely circulating more randomly at this point .
" It 's not like we have widespread testing to really know about whether or not we have community spread , " she said .
" I assume we do have community spread and that 's why we are taking all the actions around social distancing and the closures ( of businesses , playgrounds and other gathering places ) .
"  Tests are being carried out in Sudbury and if there is a positive result " we are laser-focused on the case to understand what their exposure could have been , who their contacts are , and making sure their close contacts are also taking measures to isolate , " Sutcliffe said .
Labs wo n't refuse any test , she said , but priority is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , who live or work in a long-term care home , and symptomatic people who live in remote communities .
"  Samples taken in Sudbury have so far been sent to a public health lab in Toronto but Sutcliffe said there is a good chance that a facility located in Sudbury , or elsewhere in the North , could be analyzing the swabs in the near future .
" I do understand there is a lot of work underway to increase the capacity of the laboratory system and the swabs in the region , so hopefully that wo n't be so limited going forward , " she said .
" If there are labs that can do that in the North , that will be faster .
"  Between the lag in test results coming back , and the time it takes for someone to show symptoms in the first place , it 's hard to gauge how pervasive the virus is right now in the city .
" What we are seeing today is a reflection of infections that occurred at least a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week and next week is a critical time , with the snowbirds and people coming back from March Break .
"  That means Sudburians need to stay vigilant , she said , and continue to self-isolate and keep their distance from one another .
" If we can bite the bullet and keep it up a bit longer , with this intensity , we will be doing ourselves a favour , " she said .
