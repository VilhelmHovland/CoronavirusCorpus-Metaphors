Are smokers more vulnerable to COVID-19 ? Here 's what doctors say  When , on March 21 , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , Director-General of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , took to Twitter to share general health guidelines to follow during the times of the novel coronavirus , he urged people to stop smoking as " it can increase the risk of developing severe disease , if one becomes infected with COVID-19 " .
Two days before that , the UK secretary of state for health , Matt Hancock , said in the House of Commons , " It is abundantly clear from the research into previous coronaviruses that smoking makes the impact of a coronavirus worse .
" At the same time in the US , the New York State Academy of Family Physicians ( NYSAFP ) announced that they are calling for a ban on the sale of all tobacco or vaping products during this pandemic period .
The hashtag #QuitforCovid which calls on all smokers to give up on cigarettes has been gradually gaining traction across the world even as a number of publications come out with research that supports the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi , deputy director , Center For Cancer Epidemiology at Tata Memorial Center in Mumbai , who is also an anti-tobacco activist , quotes the findings of a study published in the Chinese Medical Journal which undertook research among patients affected by the coronavirus .
" It found that those with a history of smoking were 14 times more likely to develop pneumonia than who did not smoke at all , " he says .
" Early evidence shows us that the ACE2 gene expression which the novel coronavirus uses to infect cells , is significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers , thereby suggesting a higher susceptibility among smokers .
Therefore , the entire cellular alteration that happens because of chronic smoking predisposes the body to infection and subsequent mortality .
"  The mode of transmission of the COVID-19 infection is through the respiratory epithelium which is the lining of our breathing tract , explain experts .
This breathing tract is lined by a certain barrier called the ciliary epithelium which is known to get damaged in chronic smokers .
" Now , when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry into body 's circulation leading to infection and subsequent damage , " says Chaturvedi .
However , Dr Prashant Chhajed , head of department , respiratory medicine , at Fortis Hospital in Mumbai believes that it is wrong to say definitively that smokers are at an increased risk of getting the COVID-19 infection .
" The COVID-19 is a new disease and so , we can not say definitively that smokers have an increased risk of getting the infection .
Of course , there is no denying the fact that smokers who have caught on to the virus will face more complications .
"  But experts agree that as WHO mentions , people who smoke are likely to touch their fingers to the lips and , therefore , the risk of transmission from the fingers to the mouth is high .
Also , if a person already has a smoking-related disease such as the COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , then the chance of developing COVID-19 is also high .
" Also , the fact remains that smoking is an established risk factor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immunological response which a person can otherwise surmount against any virus infection , " says Chaturvedi .
It causes a large amount of inflammatory changes leading to mucous formation that makes it difficult to clear the lungs .
This , along with the immune-compromised state , leads to a greater risk of viral and bacterial infections .
Even though there is no real data to back up an association of vaping with increased COVID-19 rates , preliminary data shared by the CDC shows that young adults under the age of 44 years - the same population known for vaping - makes up a large part of the COVID-19 hospitalisation in the US .
Dr Mukesh Goel , cardio thoracic surgeon , heart and lung transplant , Indraprastha Apollo hospitals , concurs with Chaturvedi : " The fact is that a person who smokes is always more susceptible to catching the COVID-19 infection because there is always a considerable damage and inflammation in the respiratory tracts of a chain smoker which makes them vulnerable to infections .
