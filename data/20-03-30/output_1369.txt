Hours before the United Kingdom went into coronavirus-enforced lockdown , a couple managed to fast-track their wedding and tie the knot - with just four people in attendance .
Sensing their original wedding day would be lost in the swathe of cancelled and postponed events across the world , the bride-and-groom-to-be set about a daring mission to bring their big day forward by many months .
In just a few frenzied days , they secured the venue , registrars and a wedding dress before saying ' I do ' shortly after 1pm on Monday , March 23 .
Later that evening and sat on their sofa at home as newlyweds , Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered more stringent measures that banned gatherings of more than two people .
Living hour by hour  " I rang our venue , Mythe Barn , and they were absolutely fine with us bringing it forward , " said Aarti , a teacher at Walsgrave CofE Academy in Coventry .
The beautiful bride Aarti , who managed to pull a wedding together in a matter of days  " The Leicestershire registrars offered us dates on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would do the Monday ( 23rd ) , as we were living from day to day .
Being a teacher , we were living hour by hour , is it school open ? Is it closed ? Everyday come 5pm , we were watching the updates .
I just felt that we had to take the closest one .
" The registrars were free , they gave me the time , I had to speak to my boss at work , obviously I was meant to be at school .
They said it was all okay .
We were n't even sure if I would be at school , would I not .
It all kind of happened from there .
On Wednesday the 18th , it was booked ! "  So , the venue was locked in .
Well , as much as it could be in the rapidly-changing world around them .
What about that all important dress ?  ( Image : Lee Glasgow Photography )  " I felt extremely anxious , " added the 27-year-old .
" I 'd already ordered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only booked the original wedding in December for May , which is a short amount of time .
That was n't going to come in time for the new date .
" I went onto ASOS and ordered some quick next-day delivery dresses .
The ironic thing is the postman did deliver it on the Friday , but because I was n't in he took it back with him .
So I was thinking ' great , I ca n't even try it on ' .
When it came on the Saturday I managed to try it on .
Of course these things do n't fit you perfectly .
My mum was having to stitch it , tweak it , make it fit .
"  Venue and dress ticked .
Even when Aarti was having her make-up applied at 7 .
, she was frequently calling the venue to make sure it was n't all in vain .
" The decision was n't down to us , it was in someone else 's hands .
The registrar could 've been ill .
"  Dad watched on from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone was in place .
Jonny waited by the registrars before his parents , suited and booted .

She walked down the aisle with Jonny 's dad , rather than her own father , for a poignant reason .

" With his job and making sure he was n't exposed to a lot of people , we took the decision ourselves to FaceTime him for the ceremony , because he was n't there .
" We still know we will get our wedding when we get it and all of our family and friends will be there , this was the legal ceremony for us .
Of course , we would 've loved for our dad to have been there and part of our day , which we still feel he was .
The registrar still included him , acknowledged that he was on FaceTime .
" But we will get our day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Surreal  Recalling the moment his bride breezed her way through a largely empty room , Nuneaton-born Jonny said : " It was surreal .
It was incredible .
Of course I never , ever expected the day to unfold as it did and when it did .
"  Aarti ordered he dress from ASOS and received it only two days before the wedding  " Despite the circumstances , we did n't really build it up or expect too much of the day , but it was amazing and it turned out to be a really nice day in the end .
She looked beautiful , absolutely beautiful .
"  Like any good wedding , there were surprises and wonderful gestures .
Aarti 's sister provided a crucial loan of her Jimmy Choo shoes while the venue went ' over and beyond ' what was expected .
" Mythe Barn arranged Lee Glasgow Photography to capture the wedding , so a massive shout out to them , " said Aarti , who grew up in Bedworth .
" The staff could n't have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and speak to them , they were more than happy to reassure me .
To talk to me about anything we wanted to ask them .
They 'd also organised a bouquet for me and button holes for Jonny so it matched .
They really went over and beyond .
