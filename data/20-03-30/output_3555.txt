" From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction : you must stay at home , " he said in a televised address .
" Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households .
That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes .

The government has been sending out text messages to citizens this morning with links to the guidance .
