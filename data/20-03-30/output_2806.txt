Montreal Alouettes quarterback Vernon Adams Jr .
wo n't be heart-broken if training camp is pushed back due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
Camps are scheduled to open May 17 but the league continues to discuss contingency plans because of the novel coronavirus outbreak .
That includes a later start to camp , and by default , the proposed June 11 regular-season kickoff .
Adams Jr .
is anxious to build upon Montreal 's stellar ' 19 season .
The Alouettes ( 10-8 ) registered double-digit wins for the first time since 2012 and mad the playoffs for the first time since 2014 .
But Adams 's wife is expecting their first child May 21 .
" That 's the tough thing about it , " Adams said during a telephone interview from his home in Tacoma , Wash .
" In a way I 'm kind of hoping training camp is pushed back just a bit so I can be there for the birth .
Adams played a big role in Montreal 's resurgence , thriving under rookie head coach Khari Jones , himself a former CFL quarterback .
Montreal promoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week before the regular season after Mike Sherman was fired .
The Alouettes opened 0-2 under Jones , then reeled off two wins before GM Kavis Reed was terminated .
But Montreal rallied behind Jones to finish second in the East Division to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats ( 15-3 ) .
The Alouettes ' promising season ended with a 37-29 home loss to Edmonton in the East semifinal .
Adams began the year backing up Antonio Pipkin but went under centre when Pipkin was hurt .
The five-foot-10 , 200-pound Pasadena , Calif .
, native never looked back , passing for 3,942 yards with 24 TDs while rushing for 394 yards and 12 touchdowns -- all career highs .
Montreal signed Adams through 2022 in January .
Jones also received a new deal in a busy off-season that saw the Alouettes also secure new owners ( Ontario businessmen Sid Spiegel and Gary Stern ) , a new president ( Mario Cecchini ) and GM ( Danny Maciocia ) .
For the first time since entering the CFL in 2016 , Adams will head into a training camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real work begins now .
" At the end of the day , winning is all that matters , " he said .
" I do n't care about my stats -- obviously I 've got my personal goals -- but winning games is what matters most to me .
"  And to achieve that , Adams is trying to evolve as a quarterback .
" I 'm just taking those next steps as a leader , as a professional quarterback , " he said .
" At first last year , and even in years before , I did n't say much .
but I feel now guys are trusting me to be their leader , their guy .
" It 's not going to be whatever Vernon says , goes .
I want to hear what everybody thinks and I think they want to hear what I think and we 're going to come together .
I think that 's what the good teams do .
I 'm going to work on my leadership and keeping my composure and not letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ricky Ray calm , cool and collected .
"  Adams ' path to success has been twisted .
The former Oregon Duck contemplated retirement after stints with Montreal ( 2016 ) , Saskatchewan ( 2017 ) and Hamilton ( 2018 ) , which tried converting Adams to receiver .
But Adams says he has matured a lot since then .
" I remember when I was a rookie and not taking football as seriously and I was n't doing my job , " he said .
" I was n't watching film , I was n't lifting weights , I was n't doing anything , really , as a rookie in the off-season because I was just a scout-team player and I did n't help the team much .
" When you have that mindset , it brings everybody down .
I had to learn that and I know some of these young guys have to learn it as well .
I 'm trying to instill it into them right now and let them know , ' I 've been through this .
I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes to be successful and if we 're all on the same page , we 're going to be straight .
"  Adams credits Jones for his success .
" Getting Khari back was huge for the team and my personal growth , " Adams said .
" There are many former players who 're coaches now but he 's that quarterback , that cool guy , that laid back-type coach who took care of us as a team and always had his quarterback right .
" Khari and I have so much in common being shorter ( quarterbacks ) and African Americans .
I think he 's just a perfect fit for us all .
"  An admitted home body , Adams .
has had no difficulty complying with current social-distancing protocols .
Instead of working out with a group of players , Adams either trains alone or with his wife in the gym they built in their garage in February .
" I 'm motivating myself right now , " he said .
" I just ordered a quarterback net because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use that for now and go from there .
"  While there 's uncertainty surrounding the CFL season , Adams Jr .
said his job is to ensure he 's ready when camps open .
" I 'm staying ready so I do n't have to get ready , " Adams said .
" That 's what I 've told our guys : Stay ready and do what you do .
so when we get that call , whether it 's at the start of the summer , mid-summer or end , we 're ready .
"  As Adams sees it , now 's the time for Montreal to resume its winning ways .
From 1999 to 2012 , the Alouettes topped the East Division nine times and played in eight Grey Cups , winning three .
" Many of us are young guys .
we do n't want to wait until we 're in our 30s to win a Grey Cup , " Adams said .
" We want that old Montreal destiny , 2009-10 ( when Alouettes won consecutive titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to do it because we have such a good team , good chemistry , good bond , good coaches , everything .
I know everybody can say that about their team but when you look at our games last year we were within 14 points in all except one ( a 41-10 loss to Hamilton ) .
I think that showed how good we can be .
