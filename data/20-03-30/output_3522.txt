Rachael Robathan : ' We face an enormous challenge in a city like Westminster to keep distributing the services which we need to the most vulnerable in our society '  HUNDREDS of Westminster residents have signed up to a new volunteering scheme to help with the coronavirus fightback .
Council leader Rachael Robathan said she felt " humbled " by the numbers of people offering to help maintain services and supporting the vulnerable .
Westminster 's Labour group has also this week raised serious concerns about whether the council can continue to provide full services if many workers are taken ill .
Volunteers can , via the council 's website , get involved through a new scheme called Westminster Connects .
They will be vetted with relevant database checks before being enlisted to help shopping , delivering food , picking up prescriptions , phoning lonely people , walking dogs , transport and teaching basic digital skills .
Cllr Robathan said : " We face an enormous challenge in a city like Westminster to keep distributing the services which we need to the most vulnerable in our society .
" I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We have set up a platform called Westminster Connects to bring volunteers and community organisations together with those that need help .
So far we have had over 1,000 people register on our website .
We have a dedicated team of officers going through it so we have a team of volunteers who are ready and to help in whatever way they can .
"  The Labour group has warned that foodbank stocks are dwindling and suggested the council fund them directly .
It also called for hardship payments and payments for volunteer expenses .
Many charities have become so " hollowed-out " that they will need help " absorbing volunteers " , Labour said .
Better support was needed for the homeless and there was a " risk of a surge in serious youth violence " .
Councillor Adam Hug , leader of Westminster Labour group , said : " We absolutely appreciate the unprecedented nature of the pressures the council faces in responding to the many challenges of the Covid-19 epidemic .
" We give our full support to the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taken to safeguard the most vulnerable .
