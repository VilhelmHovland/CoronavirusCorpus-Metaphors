UN aid chief says Syrian COVID-19 cases are tip of iceberg '  Workers disinfect the streets to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Qamishli , Syria , Tuesday , March 24 , 2020 .
( AP Photo/Baderkhan Ahmad )  TANZANIA , Tanzania -- The U .
humanitarian chief warned Monday that the 10 cases of COVID-19 and one death confirmed in Syria are just " the tip of the iceberg , " and judging from other countries " a devastating impact " can be expected on vulnerable communities .
Mark Lowcock told the U .
Security Council that " all efforts to prevent , detect and respond to COVID-19 are impeded by Syria 's fragile health system , " noting that only around half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully functional at the end of 2019 .
He said efforts to prevent and combat the virus are also impeded by high levels of population movement , challenges to obtaining critical supplies including protective equipment and ventilators , and difficulties of isolating in crowded camps for the displaced with " low levels of sanitation services .
"  With the Syrian conflict entering its 10th year this month , Lowcock said , over half the population has been forced to flee their homes , more than 11 million people in the country including nearly 5 million children need humanitarian assistance , almost eight million people do n't have reliable access to food , over 20 per cent more than last year , and 500,000 children are chronically malnourished .
He said humanitarian needs in Syria " remain enormous , " with data showing clear evidence of deteriorating conditions since December , including increased rates of stunting -- " a consequence of child malnutrition , from which it is rarely possible fully to recover .
" In the last rebel-held stronghold in northwest Syria , he said , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five are stunted .
special envoy for Syria Geir Pedersen told the council that " after terrible violence , an uneasy calm prevails on the ground -- and now , Syrians face a new potentially devastating threat in COVID-19 .
"  He echoed U .
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ' call for an immediate global cease-fire in all conflicts to tackle the coronavirus , warning that " Syria is at high risk of being unable to contain the pandemic .
"  In northwest Syria , he said , " there has been a significant decrease in violence , especially in aerial attacks and ground operations .
Sporadic incidents continue , involving all sides .
" And in the northeast , he expressed appreciation that arrangements between key parties including Russia , Turkey , the United States and Syrians , " also continue to broadly hold .
"  " But in both the northeast and northwest , there is a real risk of hostilities resuming , " Pedersen said in a video briefing to the council .
" If that happened , the pre-existing dangers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would spread like wildfire , with devastating effects for the Syrian people -- humanitarian , societal and economic .
It could rebound across international borders .
"  He urged all countries to avoid this scenario by cementing existing arrangements into a nationwide cease-fire .
Pedersen said the U .
is engaging concerned countries to put aside all hurdles and ensure humanitarian exemptions so critical items can be moved into Syria urgently to combat COVID-19 .
" I welcome the initial engagement by the United States with us in this regard , and stress the need for utmost urgency .
" he said ,  He gave no details but the U .
State Department said $16 .
million of nearly $274 million that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Friday in emergency health and humanitarian aid to 64 of the world 's most at-risk countries in response to the pandemic would go to Syria .
Ambassador Kelly Craft strongly supported a sustained cease-fire , " not another tactical pause that allows Syrian forces and their Russian and Iranian allies to rest before resuming their campaign of terror in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-border operations , criticizing Russia and China for blocking a crossing in the northeast that has prevented badly needed medical aid and equipment from getting into the area .
The Security Council meeting by video conference was closed , but a number of speeches were released by the U .
and some council nations .
The council issued a press statement after the meeting expressing concern at the humanitarian situation in Syria and the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and called for unimpeded humanitarian aid deliveries and " a sustained period of calm " throughout the country .
