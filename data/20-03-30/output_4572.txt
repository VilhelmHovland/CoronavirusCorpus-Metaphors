The coronavirus has revealed some disturbing conflicts and unpleasant traits in the national Australian character as Australians find themselves under pressure at home and abroad .
Australians have prided themselves on their resilience , mateship , adventurous spirit and rugged individualism .
These traits were displayed with pride in the recent bushfire crisis which now seems a distant memory .
Yet it is disturbing in the current crisis to see these qualities recede to an equally distant past .
Australians are a travelling nation of individuals .
Around 1 million of us live permanently abroad .
Last year Australians took more than 11 million trips overseas .
They are seeking adventure in far-flung places .
Older people are travelling more ; younger generations are also taking advantage of cheap airfares to exotic locations .
Mostly , this is an immensely positive experience .
Trapped far from home  There are currently almost 700 Australians in various parts of Peru , a number of whom desperately want to come home .
Most travelled there for adventure and a foreign experience .
The rapid escalation of the COVID-19 virus has seen closed borders , banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those travellers , who no doubt pride themselves generally on their rugged individualism and resilience , now seek government assistance to rescue them from an impossible situation of their own creation .
Gone is the resilience ; in its place are cries for help , along the lines of " where is the helicopter to get me to Lima " ; " where is the government-sponsored Qantas flight to get me home ? " , and " why should I pay more to get out of here " ?  " The Australian embassy ( in Lima ) is closed .
The embassy has been no help , " one tourist is reported to have complained from Peru .
Worse , some Australians boarded cruise ships after explicit government advice on March 9 against cruise travel , particularly for older travellers with health issues .
Borders were closed on March 15 to international cruise arrivals in Australia .
We all know what happened then .
There is to be no repeat of the Ruby Princess ; we wo n't allow sick cruise passengers to disembark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Australians on ships abroad .
One foreign-flagged cruise ship , the Norwegian Jewel , was allowed to dock in Honolulu , after Australia worked furiously with friendly countries to negotiate with US authorities to override American port closures .
The Australians on board have now flown home on a chartered Qantas flight .
And that is just one of the 20-odd cruise ships carrying more than 2,500 Australian leisure-cruisers currently at sea .
It 's impossible to help everyone  With so many Australians living and travelling abroad , it is literally impossible to repatriate each one of them in such a crisis , as Foreign Minister Marise Payne has warned .
There is no magic wand , and in some cases there is little the Government can do .
Yet the government , and its Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade , has not stopped trying .
It recognises Australians are facing real hardship far from home , and is doing everything it can to help , regardless of ill-timed decisions to travel .
According to senior officials , the department has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its power to assist even those who have travelled against explicit government advice .
It has activated its emergency call centre fielding thousands of calls ; put staff on night shifts to " shadow " struggling diplomats attempting to operate in different time-zones with hobbled offices .
Spare a thought for those officers who heeded their employers ' advice and sent their families home while that window remained open to them .
They are now alone , some of them sick , unsupported by family , facing health dangers themselves in places where the crisis is at its most acute , working extended hours in self-isolation with locked-down offices .
Your questions on coronavirus answered :  Our footprint is n't big enough  The pressures are compounded by Australia 's thinly-distributed diplomatic network .
We are a wealthy nation and the size of our economy is ranked 13 the world , but we have the 27th-largest diplomatic network , smaller than those of Belgium , Portugal or Chile .
Many of our missions are tiny , with very few staff .
Lima , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Peru , is one of them .
If a staff member at an embassy or consulate gets sick ( and some have ) , the self-isolation rules and remote working constraints are crippling .
Back at headquarters in Canberra , remote working is limited because of the security requirements for the department 's communications systems ; many staff remain at work , practising social distancing in the office .
Several years ago these issues were raised in a Lowy Institute policy brief to government .
The brief highlighted the vicious cycle created by steeply rising numbers of Australian travellers , escalating expectations of the assistance government could provide , and the political pressure to over-deliver on helping Australians in trouble abroad .
The department , and then foreign minister Julie Bishop , helped to break that cycle by sending clear messages to Australians ( and to the media which stoked their expectations ) of what the government can and can not do to help them .
Some progress had been made .
But this crisis is reactivating that cycle and that is not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has produced an " every man for himself " mindset when it concerns stocks of toilet paper and pasta , and the degree of care individuals bring to the imperative of social distancing .
There has been little of mateship on display .
But this " every man for himself " attitude crumbles in the face of adversity abroad .
Now , it 's " I ca n't do it myself " .
Our resilience is not what it used to be .

Here are some tips and hacks that may help .
