Among the drastic actions also being considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test positive for COVID-19 in separate facilities , including some that would have to be re-opened .
The state has at least 20 nursing homes with at least one coronavirus case , authorities said Monday , and an assisted living facility in Ridgefield has been connected to six deaths .
Federal agencies are working in Connecticut to expand hospital overflow space including a 250-bed emergency facility at Southern Connecticut State University .
The Connecticut National Guard , which had already set up field hospitals in Danbury and Hartford , will begin converting SCSU 's Moore Field House on Tuesday .
David Pytlik , the guard 's public affairs officer , said soldiers will unpack and install medical equipment , which is arriving from the U .
Department of Health and Human Services .
The National Guard is also working on converting Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport and Western Connecticut State University in Danbury into minimum-care hospital facilities .
Separately , the U .
Army Corps of Engineers is in Connecticut scouting out two major locations for health facilities expansion : the Mohegan Sun resort and the Connecticut Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for patients , " Lamont said Monday afternoon .
" We 're looking for beds .
" He noted that in downtown Hartford , doctors and nurses tending patients in the convention center on the riverfront could stay and dine in nearby hotels .
The state is planning for a mid-April peak of the need for hospital beds , depending on the success that social distancing may have on the spread of the virus .
" Look if we 're crowded in the south , maybe we 've got some capacity in the northern part of the state , and it could be just the opposite in three or four weeks , " Lamont said .
One of the sites planned for an patient-overflow location is the Tully Health Center in Stamford , a medical office , gym and general purpose building operated by Stamford Health .
The idea would be to open beds at Tully for discharged patients who need infection-free places to stay during the crisis .
Overall , there are about 9,000 hospital beds in the state 's 27 acute-care hospitals .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to COVID-19 , " Stamford Health said in a written release after Lamont announced the location , " we are working with state authorities regarding relocating and consolidating services , and we will communicate with our patients and the community as our plans solidify .
"  The developments came on a day when another 578 people tested positive for the COVID-19 virus , bringing the total to 2,571 , a 29-percent jump from Sunday as the infection spreads more into New Haven County , Lamont said .
The Department of Public Health reported two more deaths statewide , bringing the total to 36 .
Meanwhile , at the White House , United Technologies Corp .
CEO Gregory J .
Hayes announced Monday night that the company is producing personal protective equipment , including face shields , and working with the U .
Air Force to evacuate people sick with coronavirus from certain areas .
" We stand ready to help in any way we can , " Hayes said , standing next to President Donald Trump in the historic Rose Garden .
" We do n't need the Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been under criticism for not using the act to force companies to assist in the manufacture of equipment as the coronavirus spreads .
Last week , Farmington-based UTC donated about 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) to the Federal Emergency Management Agency .
Next week , the company will have nearly a million more pieces to donate .
The company started production of face shields on Monday and will have 10,000 ready in the next month , said Hayes , who appeared at the White House with the CEOs of Proctor and Gamble , Honeywell , Jockey and My Pillow Inc , which are helping produce medical supplies .
Hospital chiefs in Hartford  Sitting in a State Capitol meeting room with heads of the state 's large hospital chains , Lamont said during a 37-minute news conference that he was encouraged by their expertise and cooperation .
" There 's what we control and there 's what we do n't control , " Lamont said , affirming the importance of state hospitals .
" I think in terms of what we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " Lamont said , adding that he and other governors around the nation held a video conference Monday with President Donald Trump .
" Right now we 're ahead of the curve and I 'm doing everything I can to stay ahead of the curve .
"  Marna Borgstrom , CEO of Yale-New Haven , said that in Greenwich Hospital , there are currently 85 to 90 COVID-19 patients and another 150 in New Haven .
" We are running through PPE at a pretty fast clip , " she said .
" If this virus spikes we will not have enough staff to take care of patients , " she said , adding at the current rate , there are up to two weeks of PPE left in New Haven .
The average hospital stay has been 13 days , and there are currently 517 people hospitalized in Connecticut with hundreds more anticipated in the short term .
Norwalk Hospital confirmed six new cases Monday morning , said Dr .
John Murphy , CEO of Nuvance Health , which operates seven hospitals in Connecticut and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease range between 1 and 2 percent .
However , the mortality rate is 17 percent for those over 80 ; about 8 percent for those over 70 and about 4 percent for those over 60 .
" But if you get on a ventilator and you 're over the age of 80 , there is a significant mortality associated with that , " he said .
The convention center and Mohegan Sun would be part of the state 's surge capacity expansion but it 's still unclear exactly how they would be used .
They could be for patients or for safe housing for health care workers .
Both locations are able to provide high-volume food service .
" We 're first doing the site analysis and decisions regarding usage will come soon , " said Max Reiss , spokesman for Gov .
Ned Lamont .
The Army Corps will not oversee any new construction at Mohegan Sun or the Connecticut Convention Center , which is on the Connecticut River in downtown Hartford .
Rather , Reiss said , the engineering brigade is looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how to install nurses ' stations and waste removal logistics .
Hospital groups have made their own arrangements for added capacity , for example Bridgeport Hospital , part of Yale New Haven Health , would use Webster Bank Arena for overflow , and Hartford Hospital would use a Trinity College athletic center .
Lamont said there is a concerted effort in state nursing homes to provide separate residential facilities for those who are COVID-19-positive , including opening facilities that are currently vacant .
" They can be petri dishes in terms of transmission of the virus , " Lamont said .
" We got a little heat about this .
No visitation there .
Yes , we 've had incidents where people have tested positive in many of those centers now .
The good news is we 've got capacity in there .
So we have empty wings where we can move people if they have to be quarantined in a separate area .
We actually have a number of nursing homes that are unoccupied at this point .
With a modest upgrade we can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nursing home in total and get them in a separate place where they can be quarantined .
"  Lamont said there is also plan in place to address crowded conditions in state homeless shelters .
" People living in very close proximity , we 're getting them a smaller group , hotels and other facilities where we can move folks and certainly anybody 's who 's been tested or has been in contact with somebody who 's been tested , we 're getting them separated , " Lamont said .
" It 's just dangerous as can be for those folks not to be thoroughly quarantined and taken care of in a separate facility .
"  First positive test for an inmate  Also on Monday , the state Department of Correction reported that a 32-year-old man at the Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Center in Uncasville has become the first inmate to test positive for the COVID-19 virus .
" As soon as it was suspected the offender had symptoms consistent with the COVID-19 virus he was isolated from the rest of the population , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was confirmed , he was placed in a negative pressure isolation room .
The negative pressure room , which allows for air to flow into , but not escape from the room - thus containing airborne contaminants within the room , is located in the Corrigan building of the correctional facility .
"  Other inmates in the same housing unit will be isolated from the rest of the prison population for 14 days , and a review is being made of staff members who might have been in proximity to the man , whose identity is being withheld .
On March 21 , a staff member at the facility tested positive for the virus .
" Since that date , all offender transfers in and out of the Radgowski building have been suspended , " the DOC said .
" In addition , staff temperature checks have been increased from one to two times per shift .
"  In other pandemic action on Monday , Greenwich First Selectman Fred Camillo said he agreed that it 's time for police in his town to enforce the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concerted effort in state nursing homes to provide separate residential facilities for those who are COVID-19-positive , including opening facilities that are currently vacant .
" They can be petri dishes in terms of transmission of the virus , " Lamont said .
" We got a little heat about this .
No visitation there .
Yes , we 've had incidents where people have tested positive in many of those centers now .
The good news is we 've got capacity in there .
So we have empty wings where we can move people if they have to be quarantined in a separate area .
We actually have a number of nursing homes that are unoccupied at this point .
With a modest upgrade we can use them for say , COVID patients to get folks out of the nursing home in total and get them in a separate place where they can be quarantined .
"  Barbara Pearce , president of Connecticut Hospice in Branford , said the 52-bed facility , which is a licensed acute-care hospital , would accept non-hospice patients from other hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our hospice patients to one wing , " she said .
But empty beds in that wing could be used for non-hospice patients as well .
Patients sent to Connecticut Hospice would not be positive for COVID-19 .
" I would imagine that most of the patients we get will be near the end of life , " Pearce said , who would choose Connecticut Hospice because no positive cases of coronavirus have been recorded there .
