Coping With Anxiety in the Age of COVID-19  Five steps to managing anxious thoughts .
THE BASICS  We are living in a time of unprecedented anxiety .
We have constant access to news of outbreaks and economic turmoil .
We are experiencing social disruptions .
We have lost social supports and routines .
The future is uncertain , but it will likely get harder before it gets easier .
It is the perfect recipe for anxiety .
If you Google the definition of anxiety , you will find this : " Anxiety ( noun ) : a feeling of worry , nervousness , or unease , typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome .
"  Are you facing any imminent events in your life right now ? Any uncertain outcomes ? I think we all are .
Newsflash : It is perfectly normal and understandable to be feeling anxious in the age of COVID-19 .
In fact , anxiety is a healthy reaction to unfamiliar , possibly threatening circumstances .
It can prompt us to pay attention , plan ahead , and keep ourselves safe .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anxiety into decapitating lashings of panic .
Since COVID-19 is " too close to home , " I will use another example to illustrate how this can happen :  Imagine you have a big test coming up .
It is very important to you that you do well on this test .
Yet when you sit down to study , you find that studying is the last thing you want to do .
It makes you feel uncomfortable .
You feel overwhelmed by all of the information in front of you .
You doubt your ability to absorb it .
You are concerned that you will not do well .
Maybe you are experiencing shortness of breath , tightness in your chest , or a pit in your stomach .
You get swept up in thoughts of all of the terrible , horrible things that could go wrong .
Those possible future catastrophes quickly become inevitable facts in your mind .
They go something like this :  I will fail the test .
I will fail the test after that .
I will fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college/graduate program/profession that I want .
I will be stuck in some job that I hate for the rest of my life .
I will die , alone and friendless .
By now , your heart is racing and you feel close to hyperventilating .
You stop studying for the test .
That small , uncomfortable feeling of anxiety was supposed to prompt you to pay attention , study hard , and perform well on the test .
However , the anxiety quickly spiraled out of control in your body and mind .
It caused you to freeze up , freak yourself out , and avoid preparing effectively .
Thankfully , there is a way you can capitalize on your anxiety so it works for you rather than against you .
I will break it down into five steps :  1 .
Recognize your anxious feelings and thoughts .
Until you can pause and notice what you are feeling in your body and thinking in your mind , you are at the mercy of your anxiety .
Once you notice where anxiety is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my stomach .
And -- yep -- there is that thought that I will lose my job ! " ) , you are actually in a position to decide how to respond .
This first step is simple , but not easy .
Be patient with yourself as you practice it .
I hope you would not expect yourself to instantly become proficient in speaking another language or playing a new sport or musical instrument .
You should know that these things take patient , persistent practice .
The same is true for noticing anxious feelings and thoughts .
Slow down and " press pause .
"  Do not run away from the feelings and thoughts you are noticing .
Stay with them for a minute .
This is where deep breathing can be really helpful .
Take slow breaths in through your nose for 3-4 seconds , hold your breath for 1-2 seconds , and breathe out slowly through your mouth for 3-4 seconds .
Find a pace that feels right for you .
Make sure you are taking deep breaths from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep this up for at least 30 seconds to fully settle into the pattern , and see if you can " get comfortable " noticing your feelings and thoughts while you do so .
Pro tip : Expect that the more anxious you feel , the longer you will have to stay on this step .
If you are experiencing a full-blown panic attack , it might be 5-10 minutes before you can really slow your breathing down and get it under control .
That is okay .
Pull up a deep breathing app as your guide , or call a supportive friend to walk you through it .
Ask yourself if these feelings and thoughts are helpful right now .
You are now in a better position to evaluate whether the anxious feelings and thoughts are helping you act effectively and get you where you want to go , or whether they are taking you in an unhelpful direction .
If they are seeming helpful , then hold onto them ! A mild to moderate amount of anxiety can help you face challenges more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  But if your anxious thoughts and feelings seem to be taking you in an unhelpful direction .
Step out from under the anxiety spiral .
Take a break .
Go for a walk , if safe and possible .
Have a conversation with a loved one .
Eat something healthy .
Exercise .
Then get back to doing the things that are important and necessary .
As you engage in these activities , keep your focus fully in the present moment .
Do not try to distract yourself from your anxiety .
Rather , continue to be open to and aware of your feelings and thoughts .
If you notice anxiety building up to an unhelpful place again .
Repeat steps 1-4 .
Maybe this seems like a never-ending anxiety loop .
Some days , it might feel that way .
Yet as you continue to practice , you may notice that your anxiety holds less sway over you .
Your anxiety may gradually transform from a tyrant that controls you to a companion that helps you .
