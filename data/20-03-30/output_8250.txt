Figures  Abstract  The changes in host lipid metabolism during leprosy have been correlated to fatty acid alterations in serum and with high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) dysfunctionality .
This is most evident in multibacillary leprosy patients ( Mb ) , who present an accumulation of host lipids in Schwann cells and macrophages .
This accumulation in host peripheral tissues should be withdrawn by HDL , but it is unclear why this lipoprotein from Mb patients loses this function .
To investigate HDL metabolism changes during the course of leprosy , HDL composition and functionality of Mb , Pb patients ( paucibacillary ) pre- or post-multidrug therapy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Mb pre-MDT patients presented lower levels of HDL-cholesterol compared to HC .
Moreover , Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry lipidomics of HDL showed an altered lipid profile of Mb pre-MDT compared to HC and Pb patients .
In functional tests , HDL from Mb pre-MDT patients showed impaired anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress activities and a lower cholesterol acceptor capacity compared to other groups .
Mb pre-MDT showed lower concentrations of ApoA-I ( apolipoprotein A-I ) , the major HDL protein , when compared to HC , with a post-MDT recovery .
Changes in ApoA-I expression could also be observed in M .
leprae-infected hepatic cells .
The presence of bacilli in the liver of a Mb patient , along with cell damage , indicated hepatic involvement during leprosy , which may reflect on ApoA-I expression .
Together , altered compositional and functional profiles observed on HDL of Mb patients can explain metabolic and physiological changes observed in Mb leprosy , contributing to a better understanding of its pathogenesis .
Author summary  Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae , which causes lesions on the skin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune response and have a disseminated infection ( multibacillary , Mb ) .
Mb patients have lipid accumulation in infected tissues that is important for microorganism survival .
High-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) is composed of proteins and lipids and is produced in the liver .
It removes excess of lipids from peripheral tissues and presents anti-inflammatory activity ; however , these activities are not being properly performed in leprosy .
To understand more about HDL metabolism on leprosy , the chemical composition and functionality of HDL from leprosy patients were analyzed before and after treatment with antibiotics ( multidrug therapy , MDT ) .
It was observed that HDL has an altered lipid composition in Mb patients before MDT , which may lead to an impairment of its functions .
Apolipoprotein A-I ( ApoA-I ) , the main HDL protein , seems to be highly affected during infection .
These functions can be slightly recovered after MDT , but not in the levels of healthy individuals .
Our data open new perspectives to elucidate the modulation of lipid metabolism in leprosy and consequently to prevent disease complications .

Introduction  Leprosy is a human disease characterized by a spectrum of clinical manifestations that occurs due to a wide range of immune responses against Mycobacterium leprae , the causative agent of the disease .
This illness mainly affects the skin and peripheral nerves and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multidrug therapy ( MDT ) , leprosy still affects approximately 200,000 people globally 1 .
To favor diagnosis and treatment , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) sorted leprosy patients into two groups based on the number of lesions and their bacillary load : paucibacillary ( Pb ) and multibacillary ( Mb ) 2 .
Pb patients display a strong specific cellular immune response against M .
leprae , presenting few skin lesions and negative bacillary index ( BI ) in skin or lymph smear while Mb patients present systemic manifestations and a positive BI with more than five skin lesions since the immune system is unable to control the multiplication of the bacilli 3 -- 5 .
Lesions of Mb patients usually exhibit lipid-loaded macrophages , known as foam or Virchow cells .
Previous works from our group demonstrated that Virchow cells found in dermal lesions of Mb patients are highly positive for adipose differentiation-related protein ( ADRP ) , a classical marker for the cellular organelles called lipid droplets 6 .
These data indicated that at least part of the foamy phenotype in Virchow cells is due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nerve biopsies of Mb patients and in vitro cultures infected with M .
leprae that , besides macrophages , Schwann cells displayed a great number of lipid droplets 6 , 7 .
Furthermore , the accumulation of lipid droplets is induced by M .
leprae , favoring its own survival 7 , 8 .
The majority of lipids present in these organelles are derived from the human host , which is in agreement with the work of Cruz et al .
9 that revealed a higher expression of genes involved with the metabolism and synthesis of lipids in skin lesions of Mb subjects 6 -- 8 , 10 , 11 .
It was also shown that high bacillary loads of M .
leprae increase the uptake of LDL-cholesterol ( low-density lipoprotein ) and induce the biosynthesis of cholesterol via the upregulation of the expression of LDL receptor and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase , respectively 8 , 12 , 13 .
Additionally , Cruz et al .
9 findings indicated that high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) from Mb patients is not functional .
This possibly favors the accumulation of oxidized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reverse transport of cholesterol , phospholipids and non-esterified fatty acids from peripheral tissues to the liver 14 -- 16 , being able to reverse the formation of foam cells and reducing the volume of atherosclerotic plaques 17 .
Together , these results suggest that the dysfunctionality of HDL is related to the formation of Virchow cells .
However , it is unclear why HDL from Mb patients loses its function .
Changes in the functional and compositional profile of HDL particles are mainly caused by apolipoprotein A-I ( ApoA-I ) deficit and were shown to be linked to the inflammatory response in several contexts 18 -- 21 , including systemic inflammation triggered by infections , together with hepatic involvement 22 -- 24 .
In the present study , we propose that cellular lipid accumulation observed in the systemic M .
leprae infection of Mb patients may also be due to HDL dysfunctionality , which would be related to altered ApoA-I levels and lipid composition of HDL particles .
To test this hypothesis , the composition and biological activities of HDL isolated from Mb patients before ( pre-MDT ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients were included as controls .
The capacity of M .
leprae to modulate the biosynthesis of ApoA-I in hepatic cells infected in vitro was also analyzed .
Methods  Patients and healthy volunteers  The present study comprised 39 voluntary participants ( Table 1 ) : 12 healthy controls ( HC ) , 8 leprosy multibacillary patients before MDT ( Mb pre-MDT ) , 6 leprosy multibacillary patients after MDT ( Mb post-MDT ) , 6 leprosy paucibacillary patients before MDT ( Pb pre-MDT ) and 7 leprosy paucibacillary patients after MDT ( Pb post-MDT ) .
Leprosy patients were classified according to WHO criteria , where all those with positive bacterial index ( BI&gt;1 ) were classified as Mb leprosy , while those with negative BI were assigned as Pb 25 .
The clinical specimens of the Pb pre-MDT and Mb pre-MDT groups were collected before the beginning of treatment , while the clinical specimens of Pb post-MDT and the Mb post-MDT were collected immediately after the end of treatment .
Pb post-MDT patients correspond to those who were treated with 6 doses , and Mb post-MDT patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria established by WHO 26 , 27 .
Both Mb and Pb patients included in pre-MDT or post-MDT groups are different individuals .

and ***p&lt;0 .
indicated statistically significant differences .
Lipidomics  Equal amounts of protein ( 200 ? g ) from purified HDL samples were used for lipid extraction , as described 34 , and submitted to UPLC-MS ( ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ) to compare the lipidomic profile of HDL purified from leprosy patients and HC .
Data were obtained in positive ionization mode with a Xevo G2 Q-TOF MS ( Waters , MA , USA ) under the command of the MassLynx v4 .
( Waters ) .
UPLC Injection .
Lipid samples were separated by reversed-phase chromatography on a C8 column ( Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 ; 1 .
? m particle size , 1 .
x 100 mm ) using solvent A ( 89% water , 5% acetonitrile , 5% isopropanol , 1% 500 mM ammonium acetate ) and solvent B ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formate ) .
Each sample ( 1 ? L ) was injected in 100% of solvent A for 0 .
Then , solvent B ( 40% ) was applied during 0 .
min , followed by 10 min of linear gradient of solvent B ( 100% ) , which was held by 3 min and then returned to starting conditions over 0 .
min , and then re-equilibrated for 5 .
min ( 20 min of total run time ) .
Flow rate ( 140 ? L/min ) and column temperature ( 50 ? C ) were held constant throughout the experiments .
Mass spectral data were collected in centroid mode and in MSE mode as described 35 .
Electrospray ionization was achieved using a capillary voltage of 3 kV .
Other MS parameters used : gas temperature , 350 ? C ; drying gas flow rate , 800 L/min ; sample cone , 30 V ; extraction cone , 2 .
V ; and 130 ? C of source temperature .
Processing and statistical analysis of UPLC-MS data  The converted raw LC-MS files ( supplemental methods ) were processed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retention time values ) detection , retention-time correction and chromatogram alignment through XCMS 36 in R software as described 35 .
The raw intensity value of each MF was normalized by the quantile method 37 .
After normalization , the MFs were grouped into spectra based on the co-elution and covariance across the full dataset by RAMClustR 35 .
Through this approach , a compound group ( named " compound " ) is assigned to spectra that include adducts , isotopes , and monoisotopic mass .
The intensity for each " compound " represents the spectral intensity , which was obtained through a weighted mean function of the MFs intensities that were clustered in a " compound " .
The spectral intensity of each " compound " from a biological sample was summarized by the average of duplicate values , converted to log2 and compared between the groups under study ( HC , Mb pre-MDT , Mb post-MDT , Pb pre-MDT , and Pb post-MDT ) through linear models approach with t-statistics having an empirical Bayes moderation , implemented in the R package limma 38 , 39 .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " compound " with log2 fold change ( log2FC ) =1 .
and p&lt;0 .
were considered statistically significant and selected for further identification .
Principal component analysis ( PCA ) was also conducted on scaled and centered spectral intensity values of all " compounds " through prcomp function in R .
Putative identification of the " compounds " in the Human Metabolome ( HMDB ) and LIPID MAPS databases  Spectra built by RAMClustR analysis for each " compound " with log2FC=1 .
and p&lt;0 .
were used to determine its putative identity in the HMDB 41 and LIPID MAPS 42 .
For the search , the adducts M+H+ and M+Na+ were mainly used .
However , for some other " compounds " different adducts like +ACN , +K and NH4 were also considered .
A mass error tolerance of +/- 20 ppm was used ( see S3 Table ) .
Results  HDL-cholesterol is reduced in multibacillary leprosy patients  HDL-cholesterol levels are an important predictor of systemic quantitative alterations in this particle since cholesterol on free or esterified form accounts for 40 and 10% of the total HDL lipids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M .
leprae infection 6 , 8 , 12 , 13 , the cholesterol content of HDL from leprosy patients and HC was investigated .
Total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels were enzymatically measured in plasma and compared among untreated Mb and Pb leprosy patients ( pre-MDT Mb and pre-MDT Pb ) and HC .
Plasma samples were also collected from patients immediately after the conclusion of MDT ( post-MDT Mb and post-MDT Pb ) to more clearly link the potential changes found during M .
leprae infection .
Mb pre-MDT patients did not show a significant difference on total cholesterol levels when compared to HC ( Fig 1A and Table 1 ) .
When analyzing HDL-cholesterol , the differences observed between Mb pre-MDT patients and HC were higher , suggesting that the slightly but not significant difference detected in total cholesterol results from differences in cholesterol content in HDL fraction .
HDL from Mb pre-MDT patients showed about a 50% reduction in cholesterol content when compared to HC group ( Fig 1B and Table 1 ) .
The observed HDL-cholesterol levels in Mb pre-MDT patients were 31 .
( 21 -- 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were 62 ( 55 -- 74 ) mg/dL median(min-max) with a p&lt;0 .
( Table 1 ) .
Interestingly , HDL-cholesterol levels of Mb patients returned to normal , baseline levels closer to those observed in HC after MDT conclusion .
On the other hand , no difference in HDL-cholesterol levels was observed between Pb patients ( pre- and post-MDT ) .
Next , a lipidomics approach was used as an exploratory tool to assess differences in the composition of HDL obtained from HC and leprosy patients .
Enriched HDL fractions were obtained from plasma by gel filtration chromatography as illustrated in Fig 2A .
The chromatographic pattern based on protein estimation and cholesterol content of the fractions allowed to indicate that fractions 52 -- 57 were enriched in LDL , and the fractions 68 -- 84 contained HDL and albumin , according to the inversely proportional ratio of protein/cholesterol content 44 .
Analysis by native-PAGE ( Fig 2B ) showed the presence of a major protein with a molecular weight corresponding to HDL size ( 150 -- 360 kDa ) in fractions 68 -- 75 .
An additional analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed with an antibody against ApoA-I , the specific HDL protein ( Fig 2D ) , confirmed that HDL is a major constituent of these fractions .
As described , the HDL separation needs to be performed in a carefully and longstanding manner , to prevent endotoxin contamination or protein oxidation .
HPLC was preferred over ultracentrifugation because HDL fractions obtained by this method had higher purity , and better integrity compositional to perform lipidomics and functional assays 45 , 46 .
A total of 7012 molecular features were detected in positive ionization mode by XCMS and then grouped in 1260 " compounds " through ClustalR .
A PCA was performed based on the intensity of the " compounds " and it was revealed that Pb pre-MDT , Pb post-MDT , and Mb post-MDT did not cluster away from HC ( S1 Fig ) .
Also , Pb pre-MDT group could not be distinguished from Pb post-MDT group ( S2B Fig ) .
On the other hand , Mb pre-MDT patients were separated from HC as well as from Pb pre-MDT patients ( Fig 3 ) .
However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mb post-MDT groups .
Statistical analysis revealed that only the comparisons HC vs Pb post-MDT ( vs , versus ) , HC vs Mb pre-MDT and Pb pre-MDT vs Mb pre-MDT displayed few " compounds " with significantly altered intensities ( log2FC=1 .
and p&lt;0 .
) ( see S1 and S2 Tables ) .
The other comparisons did not show any " compounds " with log2FC=1 .
and p&lt;0 .
More specifically , the " compounds " C83 , C200 , C209 , and C543 were significantly increased in Mb pre-MDT patients in comparison with HC ( S2 Table ) , while C200 , C209 , C563 displayed a higher intensity in Mb pre-MDT when compared to Pb pre-MDT patients .
Furthermore , C273 , C608 , C774 , C835 , C1062 , and C1065 were lower in Mb pre-MDT group than in the Pb pre-MDT group .
Unexpectedly , when HC with Pb post-MDT patients were compared , it was observed that the levels of C83 , C102 , C127 , C162 , C543 , and C999 augmented in Pb post-MDT patients , while the levels of C1020 were reduced .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be defined by using this lipidomic approach , our data indicate that HDL from Mb pre-MDT patients presents differences in its lipidomic profile in comparison with HC and Pb pre-MDT groups .
HDL of multibacillary leprosy patients is dysfunctional  Since plasma concentrations of cholesterol and ApoA-I were altered in Mb pre-MDT patients , the next step was to test the functional properties of HDL .
Assaying the antioxidant function of HDL by a classic protocol using HCAEC cells , HDL from Mb pre-MDT showed a significantly lower capacity to decrease the propagation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) chain reactions induced by H2O2 , unlike HDL from HC ( Fig 4A ) .
Interestingly , the antioxidant capacity of HDL was at least partially improved after Mb and patients concluded the MDT regimen ( Mb post-MDT ) , although no significant differences were observed ( S3A Fig ) .
HDL from Pb patients did not present significant differences when compared to healthy donors ( Fig 4A ) .
The anti-inflammatory activity of HDL from leprosy patients was assessed by two methodologies .
Firstly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) in endothelial cells was analyzed 21 , 47 ( Fig 4B ) .
In contrast to HDL from HC , HDL from Mb pre-MDT patients was unable to significantly decrease the expression of MCP-1 in HCAEC cells , having almost 50% of HC 's HDL performance .
HDL from Mb post-MDT retained the same behavior , although a tendency to recover this function was observed ( Fig 4B and S3B Fig ) .
On a second inflammatory assay , HCAEC cells were previously sensitized with LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) , a TLR4 ( Toll-like receptor 4 ) agonist , and IL-6 production in the presence of HDL was measured .
The levels of IL-6 expression were significantly higher in the presence of HDL from Mb pre-MDT , in comparison with HDL from HC .
In this assay , HDL from Mb post-MDT patients recovered partially the anti-inflammatory activity observed on HDL from HC ( Fig 4C ) .
Finally , the reverse cholesterol transport activity , which is the major HDL function , was measured in enriched HDL fractions .
HDL from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity compared to the HC group ( Fig 4D ) .
HDL from Mb post-MDT also showed diminished reverse transport activity , but a tendency to recover this function was observed ( S3C Fig ) .
No significant differences were observed between Pb patients and HC 's HDL performance ( Fig 4D ) .
Plasma ApoA-I is highly reduced in multibacillary patients  Changes in the function of HDL particles are mainly caused by ApoA-I deficit .
Then , as a next step , the plasma levels of ApoA-I were measured in leprosy patients .
When measured by EIA ( Fig 5A , Table 1 ) , plasma ApoA-I levels were approximately two half-fold lower in Mb pre-MDT compared to plasma from HC .
No statistically significant difference was observed between Pb pre-MDT and HC ( Fig 5A ) .
Of note , MDT treatment allowed the recovery of ApoA-I plasma levels in Mb ( Mb post-MDT ) patients ( Fig 5B ) .
The plasma levels of paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) , an enzyme mainly associated with HDL , were measured by EIA ( Fig 5B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cholesterol efflux-stimulating activities .
In plasma , it is exclusively associated with HDL after being expressed by the liver 48 -- 51 .
Although PON1 has an important role in the structure and functionality of HDL , no significant differences were observed on its expression between plasma samples of patients and HC .
To gain further insight into the origin of dysfunctional activity of HDL in Mb patients , the next step focused on investigating if M .
leprae can modulate the expression of ApoA-I in hepatic cells since the liver is responsible for ApoA-I biosynthesis and reports are indicating hepatic alterations in leprosy 52 , 53 .
Firstly , it was checked the hepatic involvement in a liver autopsy from one Mb patient .
Photomicrographs of liver sections showed hepatic parenchyma with preserved architecture , vascular congestion ( stars ) , foci of macro and microvesicular steatosis ( black arrows ) , extended portal space with ductal proliferation ( arrowheads ) , unobtrusive fibrosis and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate containing lymphocytes and vacuolated macrophages ( white arrows ) ( Fig 6A ) .
These vacuolated macrophages presented AFB ( granular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stars ) , which were found both in the inflammatory infiltrate ( Fig 6B ) and in hepatic sinusoids ( Fig 6C ) .
Taken those data together , the next step focused on an in vitro exposition of hepatic cells to M .
leprae bacilli to check ApoA-I expression by immunoblotting .
It was observed that M .
leprae was able to associate with HepG2 cells ( Fig 6D ) .
Moreover , this association was able to decrease ApoA-I expression in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig 6E ) .
When comparing the unstimulated control with M .
leprae-treated hepatic cells , it is possible to see an average reduction of 50 to 70% on Apo-I expression at MOI of 25:1 and 50:1 .
Discussion  In Mb leprosy , M .
leprae modulates host lipid metabolism both in infected cells and systemically to evade the immune system and facilitate its survival 8 , 9 , 12 .
Previous data have shown an accumulation of cholesterol and other host-derived lipids inside M .
leprae-infected macrophages and Schwann cells resulting in a foamy phenotype 6 -- 8 .
However , the molecular basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz et al .
9 suggested that HDL from leprosy patients is dysfunctional , showing a lower capacity to act in the removal of oxidized lipids and to perform the reverse transport of cholesterol from the peripheral tissues , which are considered major functions of this lipoprotein in lipid metabolism homeostasis .
Since the chemical composition of HDL influences its function 54 , in the present study the lipid profile and protein levels of HDL from Mb patients were investigated to verify the influence of these factors on its defective phenotype .
Our findings suggest that HDL from Mb has an altered lipid composition and decreased ApoA-I , which are partially reverted by MDT treatment .
Moreover , our data suggest that M .
leprae can directly affect ApoA-I biosynthesis in the liver since hepatic cell cultures treated with live bacteria showed lower levels of ApoA-I .
It was also confirmed that Mb HDL presents impaired reverse cholesterol capacity .
Additional assays were performed , which indicated lower antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacities assessed by its decreased ability to suppress ROS propagation , and IL-6 and MCP-I production in endothelial cells .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least partially recovered after MDT conclusion , establishing a direct link between the observed alterations and active multibacillary leprosy .
Initially , it was observed that Mb pre-MDT patients ( n = 8 ) compared to healthy controls ( n = 12 ) presented reduced HDL-cholesterol concentrations with values varying between 21 -- 39 , min-max mg/dL .
A worrying fact , since the Brazilian Longitudinal Multicentric Study of Adult Health ( ELSA Brazil ) 55 classified as desirable levels of HDL-cholesterol =40 mg/dL for men and =50 mg/dL for women .
These data are in agreement with recent findings from Silva et al ( 2018 ) and Negera et al ( 2018 ) , which also observed lower levels of HDL-cholesterol in Mb patients compared to Pb and HC 56 , 57 .
Other studies on serum lipids in leprosy also described lower levels of HDL-cholesterol in Mb patients 58 , 59 .
However , older studies reported higher HDL-cholesterol levels in Mb patients 60 -- 63 , probably due to different analytical methodologies and populations .
Low levels of plasma HDL are considered as a risk factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main features the lipid accumulation in tissues due to an inefficient lipid efflux activity 64 like atherosclerosis 65 .
There are studies reporting autopsy findings in leprosy ( both paucibacillary and multibacillary ) where atherosclerosis and plaque calcification were observed in all cases 66 , 67 , whereas one study reported a low incidence of atherosclerosis in leprosy cases 68 .
A Brazilian study observed atherosclerosis in 193 from 209 autopsies in leprosy patients 69 .
Considering the more recent reports describing lower levels of HDL-cholesterol , as well as the presence of atherosclerosis on autopsies from leprosy patients , the relation between leprosy and atherosclerosis should be studied in more depth .
Beyond HDL-cholesterol data , UPLC-MS-based lipidomics data suggested that the lipid composition of HDL was altered in Mb pre-MDT patients .
Considering that lipids were detected as " compound " groups , database search allowed the annotation of the compound POVPC on C273 , in both protonated and sodiated molecular ions .
POVPC ( **44;1052;TOOLONG .
was found in lower levels in Mb HDL , mainly when compared to HDL from Pb pre-MDT .
POVPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commonly found in atherosclerotic lesions and oxidized LDL 70 .
Indeed , POVPC has also been shown to accumulate in leprosy lesions 9 .
Altogether , the lower levels of HDL-cholesterol and apparently of POVPC reinforce the idea that HDL from Mb patients is dysfunctional , being unable to mediate the removal of cholesterol and oxidized phospholipids from peripheral tissues .
Furthermore , comparative functional assays performed in vitro confirmed that Mb HDL exhibits a lower ability to promote the cholesterol efflux in comparison with HC 's HDL , agreeing with previous studies 9 .
Cholesterol efflux is attributed to the HDL-associated protein ApoA-I 71 .
ApoA-I occupies 70% of HDL structure and performs most of its functions ( reviewed in 43 ) .
A drastic decrease in ApoA-I levels was observed on Mb pre-MDT patients , correlating with the lower capacity of HDL to mediate cholesterol efflux in Mb patients , which seems to be also lowered in plasma of Mb leprosy patients when compared to HC and Pb patients .
Further functional analyzes showed that HDL from Mb pre-MDT has also a lower antioxidant activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HDL from HC .
This is also possibly linked with the lower amount of ApoA-I , since previous works showed that the prevention of oxidative stress by HDL is mainly performed by ApoA-I and PON-1 72 , 73 and data showed no differences on PON-1 plasma levels between patients and HC .
When evaluating the inflammatory activity of HDL , it was revealed that this lipoprotein from Mb pre-MDT patients increased the expression of IL-6 upon LPS stimulation compared to HDL from HC , but it was unable to modulate the basal expression of MCP-1 on endothelial cells .
ApoA-I can prevent the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the binding of LPS with TLR4 74 -- 76 , and by reducing the activation of NF- ? B ( nuclear transcription factor- ? B ) through its interaction with SR-B1 ( scavenger receptor class B type 1 ) 77 , 78 .
Together , the data presented here indicate that low ApoA-I content on HDL structure is responsible for the downregulation of its functions in Mb pre-MDT patients .
Considering the important role of ApoA-I on dysfunctional HDL seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elucidating the source of plasma ApoA-I deficit .
Normally , plasma alterations of ApoA-I are caused by an imbalance between its synthesis and catabolism 79 -- 81 .
In acute inflammations triggered by infections , high levels of serum amyloid A ( SAA ) can catabolize ApoA-I in HDL , which is commonly seen on cases of sepsis 81 , 82 or erythema nodosum leprosum ( ENL ) , where high levels of SAA are associated to low levels of HDL-cholesterol 58 .
Also , it has been shown that ApoA-I can be covalently modified by reactive carbonyls , namely malondialdehyde ( MDA ) 83 .
MDA is a peroxidation product of polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) produced during oxidative stress 84 , 85 and can be associated with low HDL-cholesterol and ApoA-I levels in metabolic syndromes where elevated oxidative stress is observed 86 .
MDA-modified HDL is susceptible to internalization by scavenger receptors , leading to degradation in lysosomes of sinusoidal liver cells 87 .
Recent findings indicate that Mb patients have high plasma levels of MDA compared to Pb patients 88 -- 90 .
These data are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ApoA-I due to its damage by MDA .
On the other hand , by an anabolism perspective , modulation of ApoA-I levels in leprosy may be correlated to a hepatic involvement , as APOA1 gene is mainly expressed by hepatocytes .
Histological examination of Mb patient 's liver indicated alterations on vasculature and morphology of hepatic parenchyma with granulation tissue containing bacilli .
Focal liver inflammatory infiltration is common in Mb patients 52 , 91 , 92 and in some cases , hepatocytes with high fatty content ( steatosis ) and vacuolar degenerative profile can be observed 92 .
Hepatocyte damage is commonly triggered during inflammations promoted by chronic exposition to cytokines like TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ) 93 , 94 .
TNF is a typical pro-inflammatory cytokine released by Kupffer cells in hepatic granulomas induced by BCG ( M .
bovis Calmette-Gu ? rin ) and M .
tuberculosis , to keep their morphological structure in the hepatic environment 95 , 96 .
High levels of TNF and IL-1 ? in hepatic environment can negatively regulate APOA1 gene expression via nuclear receptors LXRs ( liver X receptor ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a ) in hepatocytes 97 -- 99 , and maybe leading the modulation on ApoA-I expression in leprosy patients .
Modulation of ApoA-I expression in liver by M .
leprae seems to be complex and should be approached by different hypothesis .
The chronic disease observed on leprosy patients creates an environment of constant inflammation and , because of the presence of M .
leprae in the blood of multibacillary patients 100 , maybe exposing hepatic cells directly to M .
leprae .
To test this hypothesis , the direct exposition of hepatic cells ( HepG2 ) cells in vitro to live M .
leprae was performed , and a down-regulation on ApoA-I synthesis was observed .
Normally hepatic cells own all the machinery necessary to act as an activated innate immune cell and promote the killing of invasive bacteria by secreting pro-inflammatory mediators like IL-6 , IL-22 , IL-1 ? and TNF 101 , which would explain the modulation of ApoA-I expression .
Taking into account the systemic balance between catabolism and synthesis of ApoA-I in leprosy , the present work opens a new perspective about ApoA-I modulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aim of future studies .
A major limitation of our study concerns the low number of cases analyzed , mainly due to the complex process to purify HDL samples .
However , despite the small sample size , our data strongly suggest lower levels and dysfunctional HDL in Mb patients , which points to the necessity to explore the pathophysiological consequences of HDL dysfunctionality in leprosy in the future .
Of note , the alignment between this study and the literature may direct a new perspective on the use of medicines which can reverse HDL dysfunctionality , favoring patient recovery , together with better efficiency of MDT .
