German Medevac Transports Patients In Special Isolettes  German helicopter air ambulance service DRF Luftrettung will begin transporting Covid-19 patients in " EpiShuttles " this week to protect patients and crew .
Costing approximately $44,000 each , the EpiShuttles resemble over-sized neo-natal isolettes and allow patients to be connected to a ventilator via airtight access while being monitored and treated at the same time .
They also allow patients to be transported more quickly as helicopters need not be disinfected between transports using the EpiShuttle .
Because of the Covid-19 crisis , " more and more people need an intensive care ventilation place as quickly as possible , but are currently mostly only transported on the ground , which takes time and can thus endanger life , " DRF said .
The need to airlift more Covid-19 patients is expected in the coming weeks as the virus spreads and ever more patients will need to be transported greater distances to secure available medical ventilation .
Airlifting Covid-19 patients with traditional stretchers poses a distinct danger to aircrews .
But the EpiShuttle largely ameliorates that risk .
DRF notes that in traditional transports " the pilot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the patient and are at risk of becoming infected .
" DRF will begin the service with two EpiShuttles and will ramp up to eight in the coming weeks .
