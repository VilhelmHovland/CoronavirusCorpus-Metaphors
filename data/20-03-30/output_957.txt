The winter that just ended was the sixth-warmest on record in the contiguous United States , according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
And one feature of that winter was a strong zonal , west-to-east flowing polar vortex .
Wait , what ?  Usually when we hear about a polar vortex , it 's in news stories about frigid temperatures enveloping the U .
The winter was the sixth-warmest on record across the contiguous United States .
( Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times )  Advertisement  " Polar vortex " became a weather buzzword back in 2014 , but it 's not the strong polar vortex that brings Arctic cold down into southern latitudes of the continental U .
It 's the unstable , wavy one .
A strong , stable polar vortex has been described as a spinning bowl of low pressure over the Arctic region .
The edge of that bowl is defined by the jet stream , kind of like salt on the rim of a margarita glass .
The polar jet stream consists of strong , upper-level winds in the mid-latitudes that blow from west to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the rim of this bowl , it confines the frigid air to the Arctic .
The jet stream tends to remain farther north than usual in this scenario , with warmer air to the south .
That 's what happened a lot during the winter of 2019-20 , resulting in warm temperatures for the continental U .
The U .
Southeast was unusually wet , in part because of the subtropical jet stream .
( Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times )  Advertisement  The jet stream and this cold bowl are in the troposphere , the lowest , densest layer of the atmosphere -- roughly the first 6 to 12 miles above the Earth 's surface -- where nearly all the weather happens .
There 's also a polar vortex in the stratosphere , the next higher level of the atmosphere , which is also edged by another , higher-altitude jet stream .
This stratospheric vortex and its winds spend their time essentially making concentric circles around the pole .
( These polar vortexes also occur around the South Pole , affecting the Southern Hemisphere .
) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong this winter , but we 're mainly concerned with the tropospheric polar vortex here , the one that 's in the layer closest to the surface of the Earth .
How can we measure the strength of this polar vortex ? One way is the strength of something called the Arctic Oscillation ( AO ) .
The Arctic Oscillation is a measure of the stability or instability of the polar vortex .
Twice in the month of February , the AO index reached all-time daily highs for strength and stability .
The AO for the December-February period was the second-highest since 1950 .
Such a strong AO means the polar jet stream stays farther to the north , and it is " tight , not wavy , " as climatologist Bill Patzert describes it .
This configuration resulted in a colder-than-average winter in Alaska and northwestern Canada , and contributed to a warmer-than-average winter in the contiguous United States , said Patzert .
" The frigid polar air is locked in the Arctic .
"  Farther to the south , the subtropical jet stream works hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jet , the subtropical jet stream shifted farther north this year -- into northern Mexico , north-central Texas and the northern portions of the Southeastern U .
, Patzert explained .
Typical locations of the polar and subtropical jet streams this winter .
" Most of the winter looked like this , " said Patzert .
" Strong Arctic Oscillation , dry and warm over much of the U .
"  ( Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times )  " This is a preview of global warming .
In a warming world , these patterns shift north , " said Patzert .
" The subtropical jet stream , which comes out of Southeast Asia and usually peters out around the international dateline , also is a little more active and moves farther north .
This year it behaved somewhat like in an El Ni ? o year , " Patzert said .
" In an El Ni ? o year , it shifts even more to the north .
"  This winter , the subtropical jet stream behaved more like it might in an El Ni ? o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  Advertisement  El Ni ? o , also called the El Ni ? o-Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , is a periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean .
Since the Pacific is so big , it 's like the 800-pound gorilla of global weather , and such a warming phase affects the whole planet , including , usually , causing a reduction of hurricanes in the Atlantic .
It often -- but certainly not always -- spells a wet winter for California .
El Ni ? o 's opposite , the cooling phase , is La Ni ? a .
Even though this year was neutral -- not an El Ni ? o or a La Ni ? a -- the subtropical jet plowed into northern Mexico and continued on into the Southeastern U .
, where heavy rain was accompanied by tornadoes and flash flooding .
This is behavior that 's more like an El Ni ? o .
An example of a strong El Ni ? o when the subtropical jet shifted north is the 1997-98 season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Downtown Los Angeles received slightly more than 31 inches of rain -- more than twice the average rainfall .
The 2015-16 season was also a strong El Ni ? o year , but Los Angeles got only 9 .
inches .
What happened ?  " That El Ni ? o had all the prerequisites .
Based on previous years , it should have been a no-brainer " that L .
and California would have a wet year , said Patzert .
As happened with this year 's subtropical jet stream , moisture in 2015-16 streamed to the south toward Mexico .
By all appearances , the setup looked like it would be a wet year in California ; instead , the rain went deep into the heart of Texas .
" It was the wettest winter and spring in Texas history , " said Patzert .
The latest U .
Drought Monitor data , released Thursday , show dry conditions in the West but an absence of drought in the Southeast , which had an extremely wet winter .
( Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtropical jet stream pattern seen this winter .
Drought conditions are widespread and expanding up and down the rain-deprived West Coast -- even including interior Washington state .
The 2019 Southwest monsoon season was one of the hottest and driest on record , according to the National Weather Service , and there 's now severe drought in the Four Corners region , which is part of the Colorado River watershed .
But there 's a swath of drought-free territory through central Texas into the Southeast , even as drought conditions have worsened in south Texas , through the Rio Grande Valley , along the Gulf Coast and into much of Florida .
As Brad Rippey of the U .
Department of Agriculture put it in the most recent Drought Monitor , " The Southeast remains a tale of two landscapes : wet to the north in recent weeks , except in some locations across the coastal plain and along the Atlantic Coast , but dry along the Gulf Coast and in Florida .
"  The 2019-20 winter season was on-again , off-again .
It started out promising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jay Lund of UC Davis writes , midwinter turned into a " Flatline February " followed by a " Meh March .
" He adds , " With the near-end of its wet season , California 's 2020 water year is and will be dry .
"  While the subtropical jet settled in south of the border this winter , high pressure established itself in the eastern Pacific , blocking the storm track and routing storms into the Pacific Northwest or southern British Columbia , then channeling them down into the Rockies .
The systems that managed to come down from the Pacific Northwest farther to the west and closer to the coast were over land , and were dry " inside sliders .
"  A classic setup as an upper low drops out of the Gulf of Alaska and taps into a moist subtropical flow .
( Paul Duginski / Los Angeles Times )  When high pressure is n't blocking storms from the Gulf of Alaska , as was the case right after Thanksgiving , the classic pattern sets up for low-pressure systems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power it into the California coast .
Another way to look at it is viewing the upper-level low and the moisture plume , which is usually congruent with the subtropical jet stream , working together .
" All wet winter storms have some of that , " said Eric Boldt of the National Weather Service in Oxnard .
" They work in concert .
" He likened the interplay to a river , where a little eddy near shore moves out into the channel and joins another strand of the current .
But a blocking high did set up , and in early January meteorologist Jan Null of Golden Gate Weather Services in the Bay Area had begun compiling data comparing midwinter dry spells .
A March 10-11 storm featured a cutoff low coming down the coast that was forecast to tap into an atmospheric river and hose down Southern California .
The atmospheric river shifted south into Baja California , but the low still managed to pull in some moisture .
Hopes of a " March Miracle " were dashed again .
If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a foretaste of things to come with climate change , it does n't paint a promising picture .
As Patzert points out , the " snowpack comes later and leaves earlier , which has implications for our water supply .
"  If the subtropical jet stream shifts to the north and feeds into California , it will be warm and will usually provide precipitation in the form of heavy rain -- which will mostly flush out to sea without being captured because it comes so fast .
In addition , warm rains will melt any snow on the ground in higher elevations .
With such a shift , there will be fewer cold storms that arrive on a polar jet stream from the Gulf of Alaska .
Such cold storms bring snow , which is stored in the state 's " biggest reservoir , " as Patzert calls the Sierra Nevada .
That allows snowmelt to run off gradually , filling reservoirs and streams throughout the warmer months .
" As for this rain and snow year , the polar vortex seems to have been a spoiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for that in April , " said Patzert .
