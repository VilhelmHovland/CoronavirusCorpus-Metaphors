A disorganized web of city , county and state facilities , as well as a growing number of private for-profit labs , are conducting tests .
Officials have struggled to keep tabs .
The best available tally comes from the state 's public health department .
As of Monday the total was 83,800 , after the tally took a sudden downtown due to an overcount at private testing lab .
Total reported tests by day  California Department of Public Health  What is closed or restricted ?  Gov .
Newsom has ordered all Californians to stay at home , placing mandatory restrictions on the lives of all 40 million residents .
No time frame was set for when the order would end .
Here 's what we know so far about statewide restrictions :  State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 58 county health agencies as well as the three run by cities .
Those figures are ahead of the totals periodically released by the state 's Department of Public Health .
State officials acknowledge that their tallies lag behind the updates posted by local agencies throughout the day and do not dispute The Times ' method .
The Times switched to using this method on March 18 , leading to increases over what it had published previously using state data .
The tallies here are mostly limited to residents of California , which is the standard method used to count patients by the state 's health authorities .
Those totals do not include people from other states who are quarantined here , such as the passengers and crew of the Grand Princess cruise ship that docked in Oakland .
Closures and restrictions are drawn from an on-going Times survey of county governments .
