One of the things that is giving people goosebumps right now is looking at the hungry faces of stray dogs .
With restaurants shut down and people not venturing out to feed strays in their streets , the furry friends are in a sad state .
However , there are some animal welfare activists from the city such as Teja Panneeru , who are making sure dogs around the city are fed .
" We are feeding dogs in areas including Nallakunta , DD Colony , Osmania University , Kachiguda , Barkatpura and Narayanguda .
The cops are also very cooperative in this matter , " says Teja who is also delivering pet food such as Pedigree at people 's doorsteps .
" We are getting almost 40 orders each day , " he informs .
Then there are also women like Swathi Bhagavatula , who cooked and distributed mango rice to the Hyderabad Traffic Police as they are working day and night amid the Corona virus outbreak .
She shared photos in the group Foodies of Hyderabad and wrote , " My first ever post in the group .
