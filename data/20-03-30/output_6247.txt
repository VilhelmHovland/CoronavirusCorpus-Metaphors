New Delhi : Saturday was supposed to have been the last day for Sayantan Pal in the Indian Army 's facility after two weeks of quarantine .
But , now their 14-day quarantine has become an extended stay of at least a month .
Pal was among the first batch of people to be airlifted from Milan in Italy , the country which has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe .
For the past few days , he had been in a state of uncertainty about whether his quarantine would end on March 28 , the 14th day after his return .
" We were not getting clear answers from the doctors ( who come daily to the quarantine centre ) .
Some said that they will recommend extending our quarantine , others said that we will be left at railway stations and airports , " he said .
Twenty-year-old Pal 's family , like most others in the quarantine facility in Manesar , live outside Delhi .
With the lockdown snapping all domestic transport links to stop the spread of the coronavirus , it would have been impossible for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delhi on their own .
Clearly , this is a conclusion that the Indian government has also reached .
" No other way but to extend their stay till 14 April , " Indian army public relations officer , Colonel Aman Anand told The Wire , confirming that those quarantined will have to remain in the Army facility .
Khusbhu Manohar Patil , who was studying in Venice , remembers that when the Indian government announced the lockdown , one of the first thoughts that ran through her mind was how she can travel to her family in Vadodara .
" I had packed most of my items over the past few days , but since we did n't know for sure what the plans were , I did n't finish it , " she said .
Asked about her thoughts on the extension , Patil was stoic .
" We do want to be with our families during this period , but there is not much choice .
"  Rishi Srivastava , another student from northern Italy , says he has not yet received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have only heard informally from doctors , but not officially , " he said .
In the Army facility in Manesar , the Indians who came from Milan are being kept separately from those who arrived subsequently from Rome .
While those evacuated from Milan are on the fourth and fifth floors , the others are on the lower floors .
" The doors have been sealed , so there is no contact between the two groups .
"  The residents of the facility that The Wire spoke to had no complaints about the amenities .
" We have been looked after well , " said Pal , adding , " except the boredom , nothing bothers us .
"  Once the quarantine period of two weeks ends , a second test is done to confirm that they do not have the coronavirus infection .
If they are not infected , they are released with a certificate and instructions for further home quarantine .
The second test for the batch whose quarantine would have ended on Saturday will be conducted on Sunday .
Incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested positive for the infection in the medical test conducted after their arrival .
The person was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital .
In the past week , more people were evacuated from Italy and Iran .
The quarantine period for these passengers will also end before the three-week lockdown .
Many passengers in the other evacuation flights were taken to the Army Wellness Centre in Jaisalmer , ITBP 's facility at Chhawla in Delhi or the Indian Navy 's quarantine facility in Ghatkopar .
Vedant Kadam from Maharashtra was brought back to India on a special Air India flight from Tehran on March 18 .
He was also worried about when he would be released from the quarantine .
" The doctor had informed us that they will take samples again on March 31 , the results of which will come by April 2 .
We do n't have any more information , " he told The Wire from Jaisalmer .
