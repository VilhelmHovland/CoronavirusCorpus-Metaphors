A Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria who visited Oba Market , New Benin Market and Agbado Market , among others , observed that only traders selling foodstuffs and vegetables were allowed to display their wares .

" Only those selling consumables like food stuff are allowed to sell in the market .
" NAN reports that at the ever-busy New-Benin Market , traders were few , while many of the shops were under lock and key .
At Benin Market , Emeka Urji , a dealer in lace materials , expressed regret for coming to the market .
Urji said : " I know Coronavirus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" If I do not sell , how will I feed them ? " That is why I am here , even though we are not allowed to open shop today .
" It is obvious that I made a mistake , thinking that the ' stay at home ' order by government would not affect me .
" Also , Grace Edosa , who came to Agbado Market to repair her gas cooker , said nobody was available to do the repair .
