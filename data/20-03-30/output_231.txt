Rain gives farmers hope  Heavy weekend rain , in the lower eastern half of the North Island , will start to turn things around for farmers who have been facing a desperate situation with drought .
More rain is expected in the next 24 hours .
Dairy farmer Ben Allomes , who farms near Woodville in the Tararua District , says the rain will ease the situation on his and other farms .
Allomes described the situation , prior to the rain , as tight with supplementary feed in either short supply or very expensive .
He says in the past week , he 's managed to get a few more cull cows off the works which has eased the pressure .
However , Allomes points out that more rain is still needed to improve the feed situation going into winter .
President of Federated Farmers for Wairarapa , William Beetham , says some parts of his region received up to 200 millimetres of rain , which he says has come at the right time .
Beetham says with sunny weather and the soil still warm the grass should now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very tight with baleage almost impossible to get -- although supplies of straw and grain were available .
Beetham says with Covid-19 the closure of the sale yards has made it hard for farmers .
He has three properties and employs six fulltime staff and has put in place a whole set of protocols to protect staff to allow them to work .
Beetham says his workers have also been issued with letters , designed by Fed Farmers , which state that staff are working in an essential industry and have to travel between farms to carry out their work .
