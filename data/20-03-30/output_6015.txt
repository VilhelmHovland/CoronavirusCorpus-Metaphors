But there are many instances of altruism , random acts of kindness too .
Turns out , we 're not so bad , after all .
Kindness begins in the communityKindness in times of the coronavirus has even got its own word -- caremongering .
Digital marketing professional Mahita Nagaraj , who rolled out Caremongers India on March 17 was first approached by a friend from the UK , requesting Bengaluru-based Nagaraj , to help her elderly parents living in the city .
Nagaraj realized that there were many elderly parents living on their own who needed help during the lockdown , that she started an initiative to ask people to begin caremongering instead of scaremongering .
In a short span , the group has 11,000 members of which she estimates , there are close to 3,000 volunteers in the city itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now moving to a different model , " Nagaraj said , even as she was on her way to deliver essentials to someone .
" We have created a database of those who need caremongering and our volunteers will call them for their requests which will be delivered once a week starting Monday .
This way we are minimizing the number of times volunteers step out and adhering to the lockdown as well .
" Even though Nagaraj fields at least 400-450 calls a day , she is sure that once the lockdown is over and life returns to normal , caremongering wo n't stop .
" The world needs kindness all the time .
"  The sentiment is echoed by Madhumita Kalauny , founder of H .

An Individual EffortIndividuals too have pitched in .
Filmmaker Pawan Kumar spent the ' janata curfew ' by going on Insta live throughout the day , talking to film actors and urging his 27,000 followers to donate money towards a fund for daily wage workers of the Kannada film industry .

Not only has he started a chain of altruism , his movement 's show of faith in the goodness of others is heartwarming .

The psychology of kindness " In the time of isolation , acts of generosity give a sense of participation and being connected , " says Anitha Rajnarayan , a psychologist and hypnotherapist .
" Giving something that you have to someone who needs it makes you feel less helpless .
" Institutions which were generous earlier , she noted , will give even more now because this is the time to ' give back ' to their consumers .
Pawan Kumar talked of his fundraising effort as a way to step up as a community .
" We could have raised the money between a few of us but I felt this is a community activity , an exercise for the public to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed it to " human spirit " but there could be another simple reason .
Whatever people do is mainly driven by the fact that they can .
" Altruism is driven by this simple truth as well , " Rajnarayan said .
