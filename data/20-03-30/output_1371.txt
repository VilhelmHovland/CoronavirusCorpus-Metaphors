Renishaw joins ventilator manufacturing consortium  The Renishaw headquarters near Wotton-under-Edge  Renishaw , which has sites in Gloucestershire and South Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology and engineering businesses from across the aerospace , automotive and medical sectors , that will produce medical ventilators for the UK .
It is contributing manufacturing services from both its sites  Will Lee , Chief Executive said :  I am proud that Renishaw is part of a consortium that will be supplying ventilators to the UK 's National Health Service as part of a global effort to increase the supply of this vital equipment .
The full statement reads :  A consortium of significant UK industrial , technology and engineering businesses from across the aerospace , automotive and medical sectors , has come together to produce medical ventilators for the UK .
The VentilatorChallengeUK Consortium ( " the consortium " ) is led by Dick Elsy , CEO of High Value Manufacturing Catapult , a group of manufacturing research centres in the UK .
Over the past week the consortium has been working hard to investigate production of a range of ventilator design options to meet a high-level specification for a Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator System  ( " RMVS " ) developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " MHRA " ) .
The consortium has evaluated all requirements to design , manufacture , assemble and test components , as well as finished medical ventilators .
Companies in the consortium have now received formal orders from the Government in excess of 10,000 units .
The consortium will now accelerate production of an agreed new design , based on existing technologies , which can be assembled from materials and parts in current production .
The device combines existing proven clinical equipment and is the clinicians ' first choice for the RMVS .
The regulator has been involved throughout and we anticipate a straightforward and very prompt regulatory sign off after the final audit .
The consortium is now working at full speed to take the necessary steps in order to increase production of this design .
Production will begin this week .
The consortium also includes another producer of medical ventilators and it will provide them with additional manufacturing support and assembly facilities in order to scale up production of a second existing ventilator design which has full regulatory approval .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients , there are a range of other projects aiming to increase ventilator production .
The VentilatorChallengeUK consortium is committed to playing its role in delivering both medical ventilator designs to the required specifications and , in conjunction with these other companies , organisations and groups , aid the delivery of additional ventilators to the NHS .
The companies involved have taken many of their people from key company projects to do this and serve the national need .
Dick Elsy , the High Value Manufacturing Catapult 's chief executive , said : This consortium brings together some of the most innovative companies in the world .
Every day , their highly-skilled staff collaborate to create solutions that help millions of people , and this project is no different .
They are working together with incredible determination and energy to scale up production of much-needed ventilators and combat a virus that is affecting people in many countries .
I am confident this consortium has the skills and tools to make a difference and save lives .

By delaying the spread of the disease we can reduce the pressure on our NHS , and that 's how we hope to save many thousands of lives .
"  National  ' Rate of Covid-19 slowing down '  Professor Neil Ferguson , of Imperial College London , said the slowing of the spread of Covid-19 was the result of the social distancing measures brought in by the Government .
He told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme :  " In the UK we can see some early signs of slowing in some indicators -- less so deaths because deaths are lagged by a long time from when measures come in force , .
" But if we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions , that does appear to be slowing down a bit now .
