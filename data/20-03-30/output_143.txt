Life in Lock Down : Day 5  Woke up still in darkness .
Alarm had n't gone off .
Turn to radio clock ; it 's a few minutes after 6am .
I lie there in the dark , waiting to drift off to sleep .
but it ai n't happening .
Clock ticks over to 6 .
and RNZ snaps on to the voices of Gyles Beckford , Corin Dann , and Susie Ferguson .
Latest updates on covid19 ; thankfully no one else has died overnight .
I waken more and more as the stories unfold .
TDB Recommends NewzEngine .
Medical staff from Canterbury are heading to the West Coast to help after 21 health workers from Greymouth 's hospital had to go into isolation .
They had been treating the 70-year-old woman who yesterday became the country 's first Covid-19 fatality .
New Zealand has 514 cases of Covid-19 , with one death and 56 recovered .
University of Auckland Professor Shaun Hendy speaks to Corin Dann .
The Easter Trading Laws could be amended to let supermarkets stay open on Good Friday and Easter Sunday , days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Jacinda Ardern told Susie Ferguson it depends on whether supermarkets need the time shut to restock shelves , but the government will be talking to them directly about the issue .
The Director-General of Health is expecting more cases of community transmission to come to light this week .
That 's despite a dip in the number of new cases reported yesterday .
A Wairarapa farmer says heavy rain that fell over the weekend will be a " gamechanger " for the drought-stricken region .
It 's going to be a new day in several ways .
Staff/client rosters have been radically changed to reduce the number of clients in our " bubbles " .
Mine is still bigger than I would like , but we do the best we can with the tools we have .
At least three people are removed from my " bubble " , which makes things marginally safe for them and me .
Quick breakfast with first two coffees of the day ; feed the cat ; prep home-made lunch ( cafes are a luxury from how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gear I need for the day and out the door I go .
I 'm an hour earlier than I normally am but it 'll give me extra time to take notice of things on my way into Wellington and travelling through the city .
This is n't just a routine drive to work , but also scrutinise how things are progressing in our lock-down world .
First thing I notice , the Park N Ride carpark is virtually empty .
An ashphalt field built for several hundred cars now holds just .
two ; .
Before turning from my suburban road onto SH2 I notice a police car parked on the side of the road .
First one for the day ?  On the motorway , traffic is again almost non-existent .
Perhaps " heavier " by one or two cars .
But then , this is supposedly " peak hour " and instead of three of four vehicles in my field of vision , there are six or eight .
I do n't think traffic was this sparse since 1920 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road which I doubt are " essential " .
A heavy truck , painted fiery red , with " Coca Cola " emblazoned over it .
Soft drinks ? When did that become a staple , essential food ?  A few minutes later , a Firewood truck .
The vehicle is a light truck and covered .
I have no idea if they are delivering firewood or not .
If so , and if the driver is coming into contact with clients .
Note , in a weird coincidence , at 10 .
as I write this , a friend txts me to describe her day in lock-down and mentions having firewood delivered next week .
So it seems they are operating in the lock-down .
Then a C &amp; M Transport heavy-duty truck built for gravel , rock , soil , and similar materials drives down from Horokiwi Rd , onto the motorway .
Is that an essential service when the building industry is practically at a stand-still ?  At least two trucks lugging shipping containers .
I hope those containers are filled with foodstuffs for supermarkets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks .
A Chubbs van .
A chemdry van .
When did carpet cleaning become " essential " , FFS ? !  Is there ANY business that IS N'T open and operating as per normal ? !  At the old MoT stop on the Hutt Road a police car pulls over a driver heading in the opposite direction to me .
Wellington is as deserted today as it was last week .
Hard to tell if there are more or less cars .
At the Basin Reserve roundabout a bicyclist riding her bike on the footpath passes within a metre of a pedestrian .
Even in saner times , it looked an unsafe passing manouver .
But driving up the Mt Victoria tunnel showed The Quiet Earth the city had become .
At nearly 9am , the tunnel was .
empty .
I pulled over ( yes , illegally .
but since I was The Last Man On Earth .
) to snap this image ; .
Eerie .
like something out of an episode of The Twilight Zone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was waiting for me to enter .
Once through the tunnel , a quick drive into the eastern suburbs .
More joggers .
At 9am , the car park at Miramar New World was full .
Queues of well-spaced shoppers waited patiently , in their own two-metre bubbles , respected by others .
At Kilbirnie Pak N Save the carpark seems about half ( ? ) full .
I park my vehicle in the underground carpark , which is almost empty .
Upstairs , shoppers again queue outside the main doors , with yellow strips conveniently marking two-metre spaces .
Everyone is waiting patiently .
At the line I woman remarks how well New Zealanders are doing , considering how we have a " thing " for strong independence and not liking being told what to do .
I reply I made a similar point yesterday in something I wrote for a blog .
Another of those curious acts of synchronicity that marks our lives .
Inside , there is signage everywhere , imploring people to act responsibly ; .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes only a few minutes to realise something : it 's harder to keep two metre spaces from other people than I thought .
Most people -- two thirds ? three quarters ? -- reciprocate the need to maintain safe distances .
Some do n't .
They either do n't understand what two metres is ; have forgotten to respect the new boundary ; or , simply do n't care .
It 's irritating .
In effect , one person standing at , say , the cereal section , commands two metres in radius around her/him .
You have to wait till they move on .
Like I said , most respected the new norm .
A few did n't .
One guy in particular not only ignored the two metre " bubble " but passed close enough to me to raise strong discomfort in me .
And the prick knew .
His eyes met mine .
He saw the expression on my face .
This carried on for another two aisles .
F**k it , I thought , if he does it again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dad 's Army " kind-of-voice croak at him ,  But he scurried off to check-out .
Inconsiderate prick .
I hope his position in Hell is in a very warm spot .
Curiously , the toilet paper section was remarkably well-stocked ; .
Has the " Futures Market " for bog paper collapsed ?  Not so the baking section .
Human locusts had been through the section and left not even a chocolate chip or speck of wholemeal flour , .
At the checkout , more yellow tape marked off two metre intervals .
It seemed to be respected by everyone that I saw standing in line ; .
Equally important , to safeguard the workers , plexiglass shields had been erected in front of them ; .
One checkout operator was heard saying to a customer she wished the shields could stay up permanently .
And just when I thought things could n't possibly get any weirder , well they just did .
Two men ( ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective goggles appeared at the supermarket entrance .
One did n't want to be photographed -- the other did not mind .
Sign of the times ; .
Once the groceries have been dropped off , each and every packaged item had to be individually wiped down with a cloth soaked with antiseptic .
Fruit and veg -- washed .
Because there was no way of telling who had handled any of the items and what micro-organisms they had left behind on steel cans , plastic wrappers/bags , cardboard cartons , and fresh produce .
The future is well and truly upon us .
The drive home at 8pm tonight was quiet .
Once I hit the motorway , traffic all but vanished .
There were moments when I was literally the only person on the road in either direction .
I phone my partner .
It 's now eight days since we 've laid eyes on each other .
We joke that after the next three ( four ? five ? ) weeks , we 'll have to get re-acquainted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is smaller than mine , but she 's so much safer .
Meanwhile , throughout the day , we heard stories of fools flouting the protocols not to socialise with people outside their " bubble " ; of money-hungry businesses whining that they were " essential " ; of tourists deciding that self-isolation did not apply to them .
Ok then , let them all open .
Every single business .
Then , when we have 10,000 deaths , maybe those same politicians will start to think , " Hmmm , maybe this was n't such a good idea after all .
? "  Some people only take a crisis seriously when the body count goes double or triple digits .
When it comes to the safety and well-being of everyone in the community and when it comes to a few selfish dicks who put their own desires ahead of everyone else , I have zero hesitation in advocating going full throttle law'n'order on their asses .
In fact , I have the perfect sentence for those convicted of flouting the stay-home edict : home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month long lock-down .
) It makes perfect sense when you think about it .
Ironic is n't it ? How the Right are always bleating on about personal responsibility ; law and order ; and maintaining society .
I heard an item on Morning Report business news this morning .
Crude oil has dropped to its lowest price in nearly 20 years .
So why are a lot of us still paying more than $2 a litre for 91 octane petrol ? The government should be investigating price gouging by the fuel companies .
MoBIE are supposed to be setting up a website so the public can dob-in alleged price gougers .
Does n't seem to be up and running yet , ca n't even find any references to it on their website .
It would be nice if TDB provide a link for us when it happens .
Seymour is right and although I 'm loathe to admit it , so is Collins ( although I doubt National would behave any differently if they were in office ) .
Why indeed are local suppliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from supermarkets .
More catering to the big end of town which seems to be the way in NZ govt ? Also concerned about the lock down on a lot of media that is not the MSM .
These publications are an alternate voice that keep the govt accountable .
I 'm surprised too at the figures : 589 to date .
To put that in perspective Hon Kong has 642 cases .
Ba ha ! I thought the sign over that tunnel read " Mount Viagara Tunnel " .
I do n't care about toilet paper , I do n't care about rice or potatoes but I 'm fucked if I run out of wine and viagara .
What a horrible thing ? To be forced to take life seriously ? Kilo 's of garlic , non stop funny videos and film and get pissed etc as often as needed .
The silly , wanky , little virus wo n't stand a chance .
And no .
I 'm not talking about Big mike hoskings .
Crony capitalism ? When we 're exporting , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't always follow that when exports are constrained , domestic prices drop .
More likely producers try and make up their export losses by fleecing the domestic market .
By the way , dairies are still getting knocked over in the early hours of the morning -- Miramar Penninsula/Kilbirnie  Keep up the good work Frank .
You are committing to type and images , the daily experiences similar to many .
You may resemble a sandwich by the end though , as will others on this regime ! Fortunately I have usable lettuce , chillies , spring onion , mandarin , feijoa ( tiny this year ) , and many herbs in garden , and jar grown mixed sprouts to add to the mix .
No more food wasted at least .
