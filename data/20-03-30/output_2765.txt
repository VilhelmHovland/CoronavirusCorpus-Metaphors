Three COVID-19 cases reported in pair of Edmonton seniors ' homes  Three new cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed at two Edmonton seniors ' residences .
Deena Hinshaw , Alberta 's chief medical officer of health , said on Wednesday that two of the patients live at Shepherd 's Care Kensington Village in north Edmonton .
The facility 's long-term care , designated supportive living and independent living areas have been closed to all visitors .
Additionally , another case was confirmed on March 21 at Rosedale on the Park in downtown Edmonton .
" I know that many Albertans are concerned about these cases and about the spread of COVID-19 , " Hinshaw said .
" I am concerned as well .
"  Hinshaw said there are now a total of nine COVID-19 cases among staff and residents at seniors ' facilities throughout the province , including six at the McKenzie Towne Continuing Care Centre in southeast Calgary .
Rosedale on the Park 's website states the resident who tested positive for COVID-19 is no longer at the facility .
One concerned family member told CBC News that her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Friday and has been tested for coronavirus .
She is awaiting results .
CBC News sought comment from Rosedale on the Park on Wednesday , but did not receive a response .
The president and CEO of Shepherd 's Care Kensington Village was interviewed by CBC News prior to Dr .
Hinshaw 's announcement .
Shawn Terlson said they first suspected one of their residents had tested positive on March 16 .
At that point , staff took steps to isolate nine other people who had come into contact with that person .
The facility 's first COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 20 .
" This individual was admitted to hospital and subsequently discharged and is recovering at home in isolation , " Terlson said .
" We also confirmed from public health that this individual acquired COVID-19 through community transmission from their grandchild , not from other residents at Shepherd 's Care Foundation .
"  Craig Ryan/CBC  On March 23 , one of the nine people who was asked to self-isolate also tested positive for COVID-19 .
Terlson said that person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
New , stringent measures were put in place at Kensington on March 23 .
No movement is allowed between buildings and all external visitors are banned .
Terlson said special measures are in place for mealtimes including staggered seating and ensuring residents are at least six feet apart .
They 've also been told they ca n't congregate or touch each other .
" Most seniors are immune-compromised in some way because of age , medication or just general condition , and we have to do our level best to protect them at all costs , " Terlson said .
He admitted they 've had some pushback from some of the residents ' families .
" Some of our family members , 95 per cent understand .
But you get the individuals that want to take mom out of a safe environment , take them home for dinner , exposing them to grandchildren and various other things , " Terlson said .
" We ca n't stop them , but if you take your loved one out of the facility , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility .
"  Terlson said they 've taken steps to make sure staff are healthy when they report for work , but he 's worried about supplies running short for masks and other personal protective equipment .
" We 're doing our best to try to source from all over the world stuff that could help our staff and our residents , " he said .
Mark Joffe , Alberta Health Services ' vice-president and medical director for northern Alberta , said on Wednesday that most Albertans who acquire COVID-19 will be treated in place .
" They 'll stay home , they 'll stay in their usual place of residence , and the same thing would hold true for those in long-term care facilities or continuing care facilities , " Joffe said .
He said it would be up to staff and physicians who supervise care at the facility to determine whether they think an individual would benefit from a transfer to hospital .
AHS has not issued any direction not to transfer patients to hospital , Joffe said .
" Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no specific therapy that would be offered if an individual arrives at hospital , " Joffe said .
" What we can do is support with life-support systems if individuals require it , and ultimately if they would truly benefit from that care .
