Yinxuan Huang  March 25th , 2020  Coronavirus and Chinese Christians in Britain : Three Vignettes  Some incidents of racist abuse against Chinese people in the UK have been widely reported in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak .
This has been no different for the Chinese Christian community , writes Yinxuan Huang .
He has also observed how Chinese Christians in the UK have reacted to and internalised developments in China and Hong Kong .
There has been solidarity with China 's whistleblowing doctors as fellow victims of Beijing repression , while coronavirus has also served to further stoke tension and resentment between Christians from Hong Kong and those from mainland China .
As a regular churchgoer , it is my experience that nothing in the past two decades has had a broader and deeper impact on the 100+ Chinese Christian congregations in Britain than the coronavirus outbreak .
I recently reached out to 12 Chinese Christian leaders in nine cities ( London , Manchester , Cambridge , York , Coventry , Bristol , Milton Keynes , Cardiff , and Edinburgh ) , including directors of national mission organizations as well as ministers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their experiences , thoughts and insights on how the Chinese Church is coping with the coronavirus .
Their answers , presented in three vignettes in this article , illustrate an unprecedented image in the history of Chinese Christianity in Britain .
The First Vignette : The Battle against the Coronavirus -- and Racism  It strikes me that the Chinese Christian church was perhaps one of the first in Europe to react to the coronavirus .
Most Christian leaders in Britain started communicating with colleagues across the nation and in other European countries regarding a possible battle against the coronavirus in mid-January 2020 -- nearly two weeks before the first case was reported in York .
By the second week of March , most Chinese churches , particularly those in London , had taken proactive measures complying with NHS advice to prevent the spread of virus .
These included moving Sunday services and other meetings online , updating news and information on their websites and social media , providing anti-bacterial hand wash and wipes on church premises , and tracing the travel history of participants and urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese church in London live streamed on YouTube .

Apart from health and hygiene , the Chinese Church has been dealing with the issues of xenophobia and racism related to the coronavirus .
The media has covered xenophobia and stigmatization experienced by Chinese living in Britain and members of Chinese congregations have indeed reported increasing levels of racial abuse , particularly in schools and in public transport .
A few churches are now providing counselling and prayer meetings for those who have experienced racial discrimination .
" We feel an institutional response to racial discrimination is necessary .
The media has reported some incidents .
But there are many more invisible cases here in Manchester , " says an elder of a Chinese congregation in the city .
" We are now organizing counselling sessions to support our members and meetings to teach young children and their parents how to get support from their teachers , school managers and the police .
"  The Second Vignette : A Great Awakening ?  The church leaders with whom I spoke agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , including themselves , to think twice about the role of Christianity in their lives and in mainland and overseas Chinese societies .
Chinese preachers have been composing and revising sermons to teach their congregations about Christian responses to disasters and crises .
Biblical messages regarding salvation , fear , and love have been shared repeatedly in the past two months .
For some , however , Christian faith presents not only an answer to the coronavirus , but also a way forward for mainland Chinese society .
When I asked my interviewees which event strikes them most , every single one of them mentioned the whistleblowing Chinese doctor Li Wenliang .
His death was met with immense outrage and frustration across China and sparked an unusual demand for freedom of speech on China 's social media .
It is perhaps not unexpected that these Chinese Christian leaders , most of whom were born in mainland China , showed much empathy for Dr Li -- his story triggered too many of their painful memories and their thirst for religious freedom .
As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule has become even stricter .
Over the past few years , the authorities have been trying to create a unique , " Chinafied " version of Christianity .
Recently , hostility towards the Church has clearly risen with the implementation of a set of new Administrative Measures for Religious Groups and the sentences of prominent Christian leaders including Pastor Wang Yi .
Li 's death appears to have somehow activated these memories amongst Chinese Christians in Britain and motivated them to speak out for Christian values and religious freedom in mainland China .
Importantly , an increasing number of non-believers have also started to advocate the role of Christianity in Chinese society .
" A number of newcomers in our fellowship said to me that they felt the Chinese society severely lacks virtues , social responsibilities , and civic-minded people , " a student fellowship leader in London told me .
" And after they read an article about Christians sharing the love of Jesus in a coronavirus hot zone , they started to believe that Christianity is the cure .
" He continued , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light and the salt of the world .
"  The Third Vignette : Divisions and Paradoxes  After the first case of coronavirus was reported in the UK , and before the nationwide lockdown was imposed earlier this week , the Chinese Church was immediately struck by a dramatic two-week-long shrinkage in attendance .
Church members were forced to choose between the congregation and security -- sadly , they simply can not coexist .
Although more and more people came to refill the church since mid-February , about 50 to 60% of regular participants still chose to stay away from Sunday services .
The coronavirus crisis is also revealing a deeper crisis within the Chinese Church in Britain .
Confrontations between Hong Kong-born Christians and their mainland Chinese peers became much more visible during the 2019-2020 Citizen Amendment Bill protests , when intense political arguments between pro-democracy Hong Kong members and mainland Chinese members became common and soon led to cold wars within congregations .
Paradoxically , notwithstanding greater demands for freedom in both mainland China and Hong Kong , the coronavirus has not helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Rather , it has created new sources of tensions , especially across the church 's younger generations .
While Cantonese-speaking Christians tend to accuse the Chinese government of being inhumane in its measures to contain the coronavirus , many Mandarin-speaking Christians often criticize their views for being extreme and overkill and tend to quote Romans 13:1-7 as biblical support for submitting to governing authorities .
Ten of my 12 interviewees have witnessed arguments in person or on social media .
In the past two months , collective activities in response to the coronavirus have only rarely merged the two sub-congregations .
The clash between political values has been elevated by the coronavirus and continues to tear the Chinese Church apart .
" I have been in a difficult position because both sides wanted me to support their political views , " a Norwich-based minister said .
" Even in their prayer meetings , Hong Kong members would pray only for the wellbeing of Hong Kong , and Chinese members would only pray for the wellbeing of China .
"  The coronavirus pandemic is silently upending religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chinese Church illustrate that the coronavirus may have an immense impact on every aspect of religion : numbers , faith , organization , culture -- the list goes on and on .
The Chinese Church offers only one facet of a potentially significant religious change amidst the pandemic .
As the coronavirus has become a global issue , its reshaping of religious landscapes in different parts of the world deserves more attention .

I recognise that after the 1970s , China was desperate to recover from famine .
However , it appears that the inhuman attitude of Chinese governments has produced a total disregard of animal welfare and animal rights .
The grievous ill-treatment of wild and farmed animals for food is the reason that this virus has crossed over into the human world .
This is how far we have come from the Garden of Eden .
The Bible will teach the Chinese Government and the Chinese people that each individual is precious and equal and that animal deserve to be loved , valued and given dignity .
