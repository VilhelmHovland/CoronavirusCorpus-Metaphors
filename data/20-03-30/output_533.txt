For decades , Dr .
Anthony S .
Fauci has been known as the hardest worker in Building 31 -- the first scientist to arrive at the sprawling National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda , Maryland , in the morning and the last to leave in the evening .
" He 's even found notes on his windshield left by co-workers that say things like , ' Go home .
You 're making me feel guilty , ' " President George W .
Bush said in 2008 when he awarded Fauci , the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 79-year-old infectious disease expert 's schedule has gotten more grueling as he works on the government 's response to the COVID-19 pandemic : squeezing in three to five hours of sleep between supervising work on a potential vaccine , making hospital rounds , attending meetings of the coronavirus task force and speaking at White House news conferences .
On Sunday , he predicted that the United States might eventually see 100,000 to 200,000 deaths from the pandemic .
" The thing I worry about is he looks tired , " said Victoria A .
Harden , a medical historian and former director of the Office of NIH History .
" He 's being run ragged .
"  While the frank and straight-shooting New Yorker has won widespread acclaim for explaining complex medical information to the public calmly , without exaggeration or understatement , some fear that his willingness to contradict President Donald Trump 's rosier messages may lead to his ultimately being fired or pushed aside .
Every time Trump approaches the White House podium to brief the public on the COVID-19 pandemic without Fauci , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being sidelined by the administration .
" It will not shock me if , at the end of this process , he is chewed up and spat out , " said Peter Staley , a longtime AIDS activist who has known Fauci for decades .
" At that point , we 're all screwed , " he added .
" He 's got a special skill set that is perfectly matched for this crisis .
He 's more experienced with epidemics than probably anybody on the planet .
"  Appointed director of NIAID in 1984 , under President Ronald Reagan , the veteran scientist and HIV/AIDS researcher has spearheaded the nation 's approach to preventing , diagnosing and treating epidemics for nearly four decades , advising six U .
presidents .
As a clinician , Fauci made significant breakthroughs in understanding how HIV destroys the body 's immune system and helped develop strategies to bolster immune defenses .
Later , he was a key architect of George W .
Bush 's President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief , a program that now operates in more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing world .
His latest challenge involves confronting his worst nightmare : a respiratory illness that easily spreads from person to person and has a high degree of morbidity and mortality .
It also means dealing with a mercurial president who has , at times , underplayed the seriousness of the virus and chafed against the advice of public health experts .
Last week , Trump expressed a desire to end government shutdowns of businesses before Easter in an effort to kick-start the economy .
At the White House , Fauci has not shied away from veering from Trump 's message .
When Trump urged the public to relax and said the new coronavirus was " something that we have total control over , " Fauci was more somber .
" Bottom line , " he said , " it 's going to get worse .
"  When Trump touted the possibilities of an anti-malarial drug in combating the virus , Fauci stepped in .
" The answer is no , " he said when asked if there was any evidence that the drug might work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being fired , Fauci told Science magazine that Trump listened , even if they at times disagreed .
" He goes his own way , " he said .
" He has his own style .
But on substantive issues , he does listen to what I say .
"  Asked why he did n't speak out when Trump said things that were factually incorrect , Fauci said : " I ca n't jump in front of the microphone and push him down .
"  Still , as a civil servant who reports to the NIH director , Fauci has more leeway than presidential appointees .
" He 's not so easily gotten rid of , " said Harold E .
Varmus , a Nobel Prize-winning scientist who was director of the NIH and Fauci 's boss in the 1990s .
Though Fauci could be excluded from coronavirus briefings or task force meetings at the president 's whim , experts say , he is not so likely to be fired or asked to resign .
" In any case , I do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" He 's been forward in gently correcting the president without inviting political retribution .
He makes it clear that there 's a difference of opinion , and that 's good because the public needs to hear that .
"  Amid the tension , Trump has praised Fauci as a " major professional star .
" Even after Fauci gave the critical interview to Science magazine , Trump commended him at Tuesday 's White House 's briefing for doing a " great job .
"  The grandson of Sicilian immigrants , Fauci was born in 1940 in Brooklyn and grew up in an apartment above his father 's pharmacy , helping the family business by delivering prescriptions by bike .
Early on , he set his sights on being a physician .
At Regis High School , an exclusive Jesuit school , his teachers drilled students on moral foundations and the importance of communicating scientific principles clearly without going off on tangents .
Fauci went on to graduate first in his class at Cornell University Medical College .
" He has his basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He understands , as a physician , that human lives are what it 's about .
"  " He 's not the snooty Harvard professor , " said Staley .
" Even though he 's talking very highly complex scientific issues , he 's got a knack for not talking down to people in a room .
You 're talking to him , you realize he knows more than you , he 's brighter than you .
But he puts you at ease .
He starts pulling you up .
that learning curve .
"  In 1981 , Fauci was a senior investigator with NIAID when he read reports about a mysterious immune disorder among gay men .
At the time , he was one of the few researchers devoted solely to human infectious diseases .
Most young scientists were told that the field was a dead end after the conquering of polio and tuberculosis .
Recognizing early on that the new illness could be a global disaster , Fauci assembled a small group of scientists to study the emerging disease and devoted his whole lab to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of NIAID and continued his laboratory and clinical research , in addition to his administrative duties .
He also led efforts to persuade Congress to dramatically increase funds for AIDS research , work that he has said made him feel like the Lone Ranger .
As AIDS claimed the lives of thousands of gay men in the 1980s , Fauci drew the ire of activists frustrated by the government 's slow response .
But early on , Fauci differed from other scientists by inviting the activists into his office .
Every nine months or so , he invited the activists to wine-fueled dinner parties at his deputy 's house on Capitol Hill .
" We adored the guy from Day One , " said Staley .
" He was n't afraid of us at all .
We were pushy .
willing to confront .
The entire scientific establishment was scared to death of us .
With him , there was just no homophobia .
"  The activists were so smitten that they resolved to meet only with Fauci in groups of three or four .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , they would strategize on what information they would try to extract and what tactics they would use .
" After three hours of the Tony Fauci charm machine , with alcohol , we 'd get back in the car a little swooning and quickly dissect and compare notes , " Staley said .
" I think we stayed tough on him , but I 'm not sure we could have done that if it was one-on-one .
"  Tension came to a head in 1990 , when the activists could not persuade the experts to give them a seat at the table for the scientific communities in the AIDS clinical trial groups .
After making little headway over a long dinner , the activists organized a massive demonstration outside Fauci 's office wearing Grim Reaper masks and hoisting coffins .
More than 60 protesters were arrested .
But within a few months , the activists had seats at the table .
As the epidemic spread , Fauci lost more patients than most doctors in the country , including his former deputy and close friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day in the early ' 90s and broke down , telling Fauci he had gotten a diagnosis of HIV .
No , Fauci told them .
He was still running every day and his post-run heart rate was better than when he was 50 .
He thought he had another 10 years in him .
He really wanted to be there when they found a functional AIDS cure .
" He is here for this pandemic now , because he wanted to finish the work we all started in the ' 80s , " Staley said .
