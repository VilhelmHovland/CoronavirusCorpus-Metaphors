PTI New Delhi March 29 , 2020 6:08 pm  Representational Image ( Photo : iStock )  A loss of smell and taste may be the early symptom of COVID-19 infection , according to a latest report by a leading American professional association of medical specialists .
Currently , there have been reports of taste and smell disorders related to COVID-19 from multiple countries around the world as well as within the US , said James C Denneny III , MD , executive vice president and CEO of the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery ( AAO-HNS ) .
In light of the reports of these symptoms , AAO-HNS has proposed adding loss of smell and taste anosmia and dysgeusia to the list of available screening tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- which provides daily internal medicine and primary care news -- that typical causes for loss of smell are allergies , sinus infections or a common cold , and if loss of smell occurs without the presence of any of these conditions , " this symptom may be an additional identifier for COVID-19-infected patients who may require testing and/or self-isolation " .
However , he explained that the timing of the onset of these symptoms has varied , with some patients with COVID-19 reporting loss of smell or taste as one of their initial symptoms , and others reporting that these symptoms developed later in their illness .
" There is clearly work to be done in compiling the data from around the world to measure frequency , as well as relationship to the disease itself .
Until that is fully established , it makes sense to use this as a potential additional identifier of patients having the virus , " he said .
To collect more data on these symptoms in COVID-19 , the AAO-HNS Infectious Disease and Patient Safety Quality Improvement Committees developed the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare providers of all specialties can confidentially report loss of smell and taste related to COVID-19 .
The tool assesses whether the source of COVID-19 infection is identifiable , risk factors for infections , onset of anosmia and dysgeusia and what other symptoms started at the same time as anosmia and dysgeusia .
" The value of adding unexplained anosmia as a potential official symptom of COVID-19 .
would allow earlier detection and isolation of potential carriers and improve safety for healthcare workers , " Denneny added .
