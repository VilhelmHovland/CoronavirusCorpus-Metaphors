Dollar may be set for another damaging bout of strength  LONDON ( Reuters ) - If the 2008 financial crisis is any guide , world markets - which have barely had time to recover from the dollar 's 9% surge in mid-March - may be set for another damaging bout of strength in the greenback .

REUTERS/Alexey Pavlishak/File Photo  In the 10 days from March 9 , the dollar leapt against almost every other currency as companies and banks bought it to pay their creditors , trade partners and suppliers .
Money market funding rates jumped and share prices plunged as those desperate for the U .
currency liquidated investments .
Such a spike in the dollar - the currency of choice in global commerce and investment , used in up to 90% of all FX transactions - is bad news , as it rapidly tightens financial conditions , exacerbating the very problems that policymakers are striving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has faded , as the U .
Federal Reserve cut interest rates again , injected trillions of dollars into the financial system and opened swap lines with other central banks to ease dollar strains overseas .
Currency swap rates have calmed down and equities are rallying again .
But what if this is just a pause rather than a halt to the dollar 's upward path ?  Brown Brothers Harriman strategist Ilan Solot , who worked at the Fed in 2008 as a currency trader , is among those expecting another bout of dollar strength .
" Policymakers understand the funding shortage problem well from the previous crisis and they have rushed to solve that , but this crisis could very well see a real economy shock , " he said .
Central bankers have repeated the stimulus playbook of 2008 , but " this is a liquidity shock to the real economy , and we do n't know how that will play out , " Solot added .
PLAYBOOK  Like many analysts , he suggests looking at the 2008 crisis .
Through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell steadily as hedge funds ramped up short positions despite growing unease over U .
subprime mortgages and the collapse of Bear Sterns .
But from March to November 2008 , the dollar rocketed 24% thanks to overseas demand .
The respite was brief , however .
The currency took off again , and rose another 15% before peaking in March 2009 .
That allowed equities and emerging markets to bottom out .
The uncertainty this time is that the twin demand and supply shocks caused by the virus could last indefinitely as millions more are sickened across the world .
Companies and individuals trying to stay afloat are likely to hoard cash dollars .
A move higher now would also fit with the so-called Dollar Smile theory .
Put forward by former Morgan Stanley strategist Stephen Jen , it holds that the greenback strengthens in tough times as investors rush for safe , liquid assets .
It then falls as U .
growth flags , forcing Fed rate cuts - the bottom of the smile - before rising again as the U .
economy leads the global growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital , expects the U .
economy to stage a full recovery by the end of the year , while Europe will reclaim end-2019 GDP levels only towards the end of next year .
" We were on the left side of the dollar smile , but for much of the second half of 2020 and in 2021 , I expect us to move to the right of the dollar smile , " he added .
And even after large rate cuts , dollar assets offer higher yields - the interest rate gap between three-month U .
and German bills offers a 1% return on an annualised basis .
Meanwhile , despite its retreat , the dollar is near the highest since 2002 against trade partners ' currencies , reviving speculation of Treasury intervention to rein it in .
But the turbulent times make that unlikely .
" The historic rally is not quite over , " Goldman Sachs said , adding that in a further equity drawdown , there could be another 3%-5% upside to the trade-weighted dollar from recent highs .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained U .
banks ' ability to lend dollars .
But the currency 's role in international transactions has n't lessened , and that has led to a dollar funding gap - the difference between non-U .
banks ' dollar assets and their liabilities .
This imbalance may amount to $1 .
trillion a year , according to International Monetary Fund estimates .
Parts of the swap market reflect the unease - three-month dollar-yen swaps are at an elevated 44 bps versus an average 20 bps in 2019 .
The FRA-OIS gauge of bank funding costs is at levels not seen since the financial crisis .
Market players say that rather than interbank problems , its surge suggests unprecedented demand from companies that are drawing down credit lines and seeking to borrow more from banks .
Ariel Bezalel and Harry Richards , fund managers at Jupiter Asset Management , reckon the global economy is about to enter a period of persistent dollar shortages .
" There are simply not enough dollars going to the outside world at this critical juncture , " they wrote .
Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swaplines with foreign central banks will help .
But it may be running to standstill .
The dollar was involved in 90% of currency transactions globally in a $6 .
trillion daily market , BofA noted , adding : " The reality is that the Fed is incapable of equilibrating supply/demand mismatches .
if there is a rush to hold U .
dollars .
"  They predict the dollar index will rise eventually to 120 from the current 102 , although they gave no time frame .
