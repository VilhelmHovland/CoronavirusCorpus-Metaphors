GTC postpones 2020 season and calls on SA motorsport fans to join the fight against Covid-19  Related Links  Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa , the start of the 2020 GTC Championship and inaugural GTC SupaCup is being suspended .
On Sunday ( March 16 ) , President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a State of National Disaster due to the increase in infections of the novel coronavirus .
This was followed the following morning by Motorsport South Africa ( MSA ) and the Extreme Festival suspending all events until after the Easter weekend ( April 10-13 ) .
Extended suspension  The initial announcement did not directly influence the start of the 2020 season ; therefore , GTC management did not release a statement at the time .

" I have been in contact with various stakeholders and management team members throughout the week , and we agreed that the best course of action would be only to postpone once we are directly affected .
As the situation is being monitored and advised upon regularly by the powers-that-be , we do n't want to provide any concrete dates for now .
" At present , South Africa is still in the second phase of the virus spreading ; so we do n't want to commit to any dates just yet .
