Poems have a way of finding me at the right time .
They seem to know what I need to hear , and what I want to say -- down to the exact words .
This is not unusual , since poetry has been kinder to me than people have .
Poetry offers clarity and understanding without asking too many questions .
It holds me when I need to mourn .
In the middle of the global panic around Covid-19 , the most visible health crisis of our time , I have been struck by the outpouring of poetry from different parts of the world .
It is a medium that speaks to me because it appeals to a hunger that is fed by more than fact .
Poems welcome uncertainty , make space for rage , and offer solace in moments of despair .
Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writes , " Please do n't decorate me in garlands/ Do n't give me applause/ Spare me recognition for work injury , martyrdom , or any other merits/ I did n't come to Wuhan to admire the cherry blossoms/ And I did n't come for the scenery , the reception of flattery/ I just want to return home safe when the epidemic ends/ Even if all that remains are my bones/ I must bring myself home to my children and parents " .
These lines , particularly poignant when set against India 's orchestrated applause for health-workers , are from a poem in Chinese that has been translated into English as " Please Do n't Disturb " , and published on the website of Ohio State University .
The nurse is usually based in the Gansu province of China but volunteered to be at the frontline of disease prevention and control when Wuhan needed medical professionals .
Her pen name is Wei Shuiyin , and her poems are both stark as well as moving .
What makes people so depraved ? Why do they prioritise their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular captures the inner world of health workers who put themselves through great risk in order to save lives , and also carry trauma from seeing death at close quarters .
They provide essential services but are often unsung because politicians like to take all the credit for crisis management .
Knowing that the narrator of the poem is deeply committed to a life of service , and seeks no adulation , gives me gooseflesh .
Anthony Tao , a writer from Beijing , has written a six-part poem called " Coronavirus in China " to depict the multi-layered experience of living through a pandemic .
It is far removed from what most human beings might perceive as a state of normalcy , so it brings up intense feelings .
On the one hand , they smile through face masks and are surrounded by kindness .
On the other hand , they spy on neighbours and report on family .
What makes people so depraved ? Why do they prioritise their own safety at the expense of others ? What does it mean to live under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the questions that Tao 's poem made me think about .
As the poet says , " To survive humans , you have to give up/ humanity -- so says the tyrant within " .
Richard Hendrick , a Capuchin Franciscan priest living in Ireland , has an entirely different vantage point .
He has written a poem called " Lockdown " that acknowledges the fear , isolation , panic buying , sickness and death but focuses mostly on the unexpected gifts this tragedy has brought forth .
He manages to find something to celebrate amidst all the hardships -- whether it is people singing to each other across empty squares in Assisi , a clear sky and the chirping of birds in Wuhan , or a hotel in Ireland that is delivering free meals to the housebound , or places of worship tending to the homeless .
This poem invites readers to think about the ways in which capitalism has disconnected us from ourselves , and invokes imagery from traditional healing practices .
Hendrick writes , " All over the world people are slowing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbours in a new way/ All over the world people are waking up to a new reality/ To how big we really are .
/ To how little control we really have .
/ To what really matters .
/ To Love " .
This is the kind of language that gives strength to people who are facing debilitating anxiety about lost income , forced proximity with abusive family members , and the prospect of being laid off in case the economy crashes .
Ow Yeong Wai Kit , a teacher of literature based in Singapore , has written a poem called " Gone Viral " that presents a dialogue between opposing perspectives on the pandemic .
The words are placed in two columns that stand right next to each other but the meaning changes based on how the reader chooses to read the text -- vertically or horizontally .
This visual arrangement dramatises the real-world choices that individuals make .
The poet makes us think about " media sources that paint/ visitors and immigrants as/ virus spreaders " , and xenophobes who are " walking pathogens/ plagues of terror/ with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this paranoia is as lethal as any other pandemic .
"  I feel concerned about the language of war that is entering everyday conversation about the coronavirus .
Language shapes consciousness and vice versa , so I wish there was more tenderness around .
Sickness , old age , death are , after all , part of the human experience .
Unfortunately , a lot of people are reluctant to seek medical support because of social stigma .
The hate being directed at those who did not " come out " earlier is shocking .
Anyone can fall ill .
They need our good wishes , not our scorn .
My personal favourite is a poem titled " Wash your hands " by Massachusetts-based Kohenet Dori Midnight , who writes , " In the middle of the night/ when you wake up with terror in your belly/ it is time to think about stardust and geological time/ redwoods and dance parties and mushrooms remediating toxic soil/ it is time/ to care for one another " .
This poem invites readers to think about the ways in which capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional healing practices .
The poet is a spiritual counsellor and herbalist who works on disability justice and queer liberation , apart from being closely associated with Jewish Voice for Peace , a Palestinian solidarity organisation .
I like her advice : " If your heart tightens , / contract/ and expand .
/ science says : compassion strengthens the immune system " .
