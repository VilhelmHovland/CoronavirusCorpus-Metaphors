Rise of the introverts as coronavirus lockdown takes hold  Introverts are set to lap up the self-isolation imposed during the four-week coronavirus lockdown ; extroverts are set for a tough time .
OPINION : My first casualty of lockdown is a fat piece of carrot cake .
Today is my sister 's 40th birthday .
She lives a two-minute drive from me , just across the other side of Motueka .
So close , yet in these strange days of social isolation , so far .
I know there 'll be cream cheese icing on that cake , and the loss of cream cheese icing was always going to make me sad , no matter what the circumstances .
Her loving partner was probably even thoughtful enough to stud it with walnuts .
I went to see them on Wednesday evening , before lock-down officially kicked in .
I perched in the doorway , and did n't hug them hello or goodbye -- we 'd sort of started isolating ourselves over the weekend , and it was the respectful thing to do for the other people in my household to not burst our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart to think that I ca n't celebrate her birthday with her , and as I was driving back to our house , it also really hit home that the next time I saw her , I 'd have given birth to her new niece or nephew .
Hormonally , it 's not a great time to be 38 weeks pregnant .
( It is , however , a prudent time to be planning a home birth .
)  Feeling suddenly bereft and wrong-footed by the world 's strangeness , I ugly-cried all the way home .
My partner , who by now is a veteran of late-pregnancy hormone mitigation , wrapped me in a hug and then pointed out that my sister was probably not particularly sad to be missing out on a more comprehensive birthday shindig .
" You know who 'll be quarantining the heck out of this quarantine ? " he asked .
" She will be .
"  For it is true -- the isolation bubble is a valuable gift to the introverts of the world .
My sister will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family life with no need for small-talk or niceties .
She has been vaguely preparing for the apocalypse for years , or in her words , " I 've been panic-buying since way before panic-buying was cool " .
She will emerge from her isolation chrysalis like a luminous butterfly , her soul well fed from all the blessed space and serenity that the world has had no choice but to give her .
We extroverts will stagger withered and wizened back into society , woefully under-nourished after weeks devoid of human interaction .
Another introverted family member , resplendent in her enforced captivity , is already referring to this time as The After , such is her fear that she will be descended upon by crowds of touch-starved hug zombies when the restrictions are lifted .
Upon hearing Jacinda 's calm but firm instructions on Monday afternoon , my sociable sisters-in-law and I immediately went into a tailspin .
We looked at the rules from every angle , checking for loopholes and appendices .
Over the days , as more clarity came , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several houses just because we desired moral support , and that it was not going to be acceptable to stand in each other 's front yards and have a BYO cuppa catch-up through the kitchen window .
" Act as if you have Covid-19 , " our prime minister directed , which basically obliterated any ambiguity , no matter how hard you squinted at it .
As much as these imperatives left me feel slightly panicked , they make a lot of sense .
This beast -- not just the virus but New Zealand 's official response to it -- seems to have moved along at an astonishing pace , and although the government 's measures were at first shocking in their extremity , it was such a relief to be given a blueprint at a time when many of us were still teetering over details like whether we should still be congregating in cafes or sending our kids to school .
Now comes the great mental reset , when we all try to calibrate our paranoia levels and apply some common sense to completely uncommon territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lot of my questions , and trusty old Google had the solution for others .
Am I being a crazy person by wiping down my grocery items before assimilating them into my house ? ( No I 'm not -- wipe away .
) Can a family member get stuck into some renovations on an uninhabited house ? ( No .
No blurred lines .
)  And can I get my sister to freeze a chunk of her birthday carrot cake so that we can share it after the dust has settled and all of this is a distant memory ? Apparently not -- the cake would freeze quite happily , but there 's a chance that coronavirus would too .
Like day-to-day life in general , we 'll put the cake issue on hold and crack open the Edmonds cookbook afresh in a few weeks ' time .
