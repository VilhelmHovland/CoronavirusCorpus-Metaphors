I am in N .
I wear plastic gloves , clean the trolley handle with disinfectant wipe , do n't use coins or paper money , wear a mask and goggles , keep distance from other people , disinfect products wrapped in plastic or tin on arrival home .
Never touch face while out and about .
Disinfect car , all handles and steering wheel .
Disinfect all door handles and literally anything touched after arriving home .
If I do use coins put them in a jar with disinfectant and water to clean them for a bit .
After a bit , it becomes routine .
The Tory government must think we are all stupid sheep being led to the slaughter with stupid grins on our faces .
What , ? 2 million for curtains ? no probs , what ? 2 million for life-saving equipment ? nah ! the email " got lost " Do they think we do n't notice ? Do they think we are fuqing idiots ? Do they think once the dust settles there wo n't be a reckoning ?  There are benefits and drawbacks of self-employment .
I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going that route .
It is not for the faint-hearted or risk-averse .
I 'm sure the FSB would acknowledge that .
I make no apologies for my remarks about politicians .
They are generally not respected by most people .
With honourable exceptions , I tend to ignore them .
I will say for the chancellor Rishi Sunak that he has been the best minster so far in this crisis .
The task of putting together a package for the self-employed was always going to be challenging , but the scheme is open to criticism nonetheless .
Some of the most vulnerable seem to be falling between the cracks .
It 's amazing what a relentless 24/7 campaign of pro Johnson government political propaganda through the " patriotic " British media can have on the British people and how they can be encouraged to vote directly against their personal and our country 's interests .
From an incoherent Brexit to the grossly incompetent handing of a global pandemic .
The Labour Party needs to seriously up it 's game .
What is becoming increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure lockdown than the rest of the pack are increasingly seeing a slowing in Covid 19 infection and much lower mortality rates in their populations .
Germany quickly followed the South Korean route and carried out mass testing in January 2020 .
Ireland has already demonstrated that it has handled this crisis far better than the Johnson government and has more ICU beds per 1000 head of population than the UK .
The Irish and the French states already proved themselves to be far more effective and resilient than the UK .
Let 's just ignore the ongoing nonsense from the " patriotic " British media and start to look at the objective facts rather than the idiotic , transparently false , Johnson government political propaganda and naked lies .
10 Years of successive Tory governments have not strengthened our country nor have strengthened and prepared our NHS for this Covid 19 pandemic .
The immediate and urgent requirement for adequate Personal Protection Equipment for front line NHS staff together with personal ventilators is the real priority , not staging mass media stunts in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson 's government 's continuing incompetence to actually deliver to the front line in a time of national crisis .
Everyone in our country admires and respects the selfless commitment of our hard pressed and ruthlessly exploited NHS staff except the Johnson government .
" Clapping Hands for NHS Staff " is no substitution for the Johnson government 's total incompetence in handling this crisis from day one and for the inadequate supply of PPE and personal ventilators to the NHS .
Italy has been much maligned in the British media , but Italy has more ICU beds than the UK .
Let 's just take a look at the global league table for the number of ICU beds per 1000 head of population .
This fact alone will amply demonstrate how successive Tory governments post 2010 have run down our NHS .
There is nothing to clap about .
What the above unequivocally demonstrates is that in 2020 the UK can only aspire to have the same number of ICU beds of most EU countries including all the Eastern EU countries and even the broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NHS after 10 years of successive Tory governments .
By the end of the term of the Johnson government we are likely to aspire to the same number of ICU beds as Argentina or even Venezuela !  They all have plenty of ' front ' I give you that .
Front Line in the Commons indicates to me that they thought that the virus would never dare come to them , so lets all ignore the advice given to the rest of us .
Follow the FSB if you do n't already you 'll see lots of interesting takes and advice on there .
It was more your political attack and " eventually " that concerned me , business advisers should advise not attack the benefits of self employment .
Many of my clients are in the 5% who wo n't benefit from the self-employed scheme .
The position with the self-employed is as I said .
If you have three years tax returns up to and including 2018 - 19 then you 're going to benefit from the scheme - unless the average of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have that , you 're in trouble .
Clients in the small business rates category may qualify for a ? 10k grant through the local authority .
A lot of my clients do n't have business premises so wo n't get that .
It gets Johnson out of having to account for allowing him and his cabinet to crush onto the front bench , which included the Minister for Health , Hancock , all of which ignored their own advice for the rest of us .
that does not show what a dimwit , stupid , Tory government we have then nothing will !  As someone who helps small businesses and the self-employed with tax and accounting matters , I can see many of my clients struggling over the next couple of months .
Those with three years tax returns will eventually get 80% of expected profits .
Those with less will miss out , and will struggle to survive .
Politicians like to make much of the entrepreneurial spirit and the virtue of setting up on your own .
But in practice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This crisis will show clearly how valued such people really are in high places - NOT .
Boris soon might be in a package himself , between six planks , ready to be send-off .
a relief the successful ex Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab stands ready to take over , getting the coronavirus crisis and Brexit done in no time .
Friends of Dominic Cummings have suggested that the steps he took while leaving Downing Street in some haste were not that big and par for the course of a special adviser known as a sprinter nicknamed in the past as spring heeled jack and rejects whole heartily that they were in any way " Fucking Big Ones " despite reports to the contrary , media commentators have observed this could run and run .
When you can not order online groceries as they do not have any delivery slots , then I guess it is essentials that delivery vehicles can deliver , but most are not equipped with food delivery necessities and would need to be paid in lieu by the government .
Why wait until June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax returns , and an online form does the rest .
Hi I have been thinking about a guaranteed job solution and cant see how it works .
if thecrobots take large swathes of jobs eg warehouse work , assembly lines , thetecwill be fewer traditional jobs .
I have run a couple of small businesses in the past employing people but certainly could not have created jobs out of thin air .
could n't afford to do it .
who could ? A basic income for all should give people the basics re housing food education etc and then they can choose what to do from there re part time work , additional self employment , jobs , voluntary work training education etc etc .
I dontvagree with the extremes of communism or unfettered capitalism as neither work , and both strip people of dignity and self determinationalso I do think a lot if wealthy people would give it back .
I believe the majority of people are essentially good whatever class income etc with a few right bastards across the piece .
