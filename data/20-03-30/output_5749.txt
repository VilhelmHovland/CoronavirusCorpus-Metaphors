The rest of the 15 MPIC hospitals nationwide will double their existing capacity for COVID-related patients to more than 600 beds , officials said after creating a crisis team to step up efforts to contain the pandemic .
Officials of the 16-member Hospitals Group led by MPIC chairman Manuel Pangilinan and Hospitals president and CEO Augusto Palisoc Jr .

Almira said that by designating a hospital within the group to be the main referral facility for persons under monitoring and persons under investigation and those infected with COVID , the MPIC is aligning its efforts with the government to address the pandemic .
She added that if the pandemic would rise in intensity in the coming weeks , the Hospitals Group would plan for supplemental tents , with beds and requisite equipment , for non-critical COVID cases in selected hospital grounds , as an extraordinary measure .
Pangilinan said the group also provides every assistance possible to doctors , nurses and healthcare personnel to protect their wellbeing and safety as they courageously pursue their enormously difficult task of caring for patients .

Meanwhile , Marikina City would use a newly constructed two-story building , which was supposed to be its public safety center , to house the new molecular laboratory that it intends to set up for the mass testing of its residents and those of neighboring cities .
Mayor Marcelino Teodoro said the building , located at Bayan-Bayanan Ave .
, will be completed in two weeks and is " biohazard safety compliant " as required by the DOH .
The DOH earlier objected to the city 's plan of setting up its own molecular laboratory to help control the spread of COVID-19 because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor -- something which it described as not compliant to space and biosafety standards .
A testing facility , it added , should ensure that cross-infection is minimized and less foot traffic would be observed .
" This is a freestanding structure in a not too populated area and is accessible too .
In terms of location , it seems this is suitable according to what the DOH was earlier saying , " Teodoro said .
While Teodoro earlier asserted that the facility was compliant with the standards of the DOH and the University of the Philippines Manila - National Institutes of Health , the local government 's molecular lab still have to be accredited by the World Health Organization to be able to screen COVID-19 samples .
Five of the country 's current testing centers have undergone the same procedures that seek to maintain the health standards and safety of patients .
Teodoro said the local government was eager to do mass testing considering the backlog and delays in releasing results by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa .
" People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor added .
As of yesterday , his city has 21 confirmed cases and four deaths .
The DOH earlier said at least 30 public and private labs have expressed their interest to conduct COVID-19 tests .
DOH spokeswoman Maria Vergeire said they have distributed self-assessment tools to these institutions to evaluate whether they are qualified to screen COVID-19 samples .
