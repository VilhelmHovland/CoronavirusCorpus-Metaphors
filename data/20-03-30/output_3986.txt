Childcare and Covid-19 : ' So much energy is going into pretending work is happening as normal .
But it 's not .
'  Dominique McMullan describes the reality of working full-time while also quarantining from Covid-19 and caring for a child  When we received the email I cried with relief .
Although honestly , that does n't take a lot these days .
Our creche would not be asking us to pay the monthly creche fees while they were closed .
After a long struggle to even find a creche place for our son ( which you can read about here ) the thought of losing that place was pretty devastating .
But the fees each month cost more than our mortgage and due to current circumstances , we simply did n't know if we were going to be able to pay .
It was important to us to know that the staff , who love our son so palpably , and who he misses so much , would receive payment and keep their jobs .

As well as keeping our place , it was important to us to know that the staff , who love our son so palpably , and who he misses so much , would receive payment and keep their jobs .
For this we are grateful .
However , a second problem remains .
Women bearing the brunt  Across the country , parents are increasingly desperate as they attempt to entertain their children while simultaneously working their day jobs .
As the bulk of childcare all over the worldstill falls to women , it is friends and readers of IMAGE who are bearing the brunt of this responsibility .
Often minding the children during the day , while cooking and cleaning ; and using the night to work .
This ca n't last .
Important phone calls are happening in airing cupboards .
Crisis Zoom meetings are taking place with toddlers plugged into iPads just out of shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now , as businesses clamber to figure out this new reality , they 've become frenetic .

So much energy is going into pretending work is happening as normal .
But it 's not .
Advertisement  Framed within the context of what is happening across the world , the issue of balancing childcare and a day job seems minor .
But at times like this , we can only live in our own realities , and this is the reality for so many .
And to quote that overused word from the old-world , it 's unsustainable .
As I type this I can hear my son screaming in the other room .
My whole body is tense as I ignore the primal urge to get up to go and help .
Hold those you love close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We were temporarily living in my parent 's house as the Covid-19 crisis developed .
The right time for my son and I to leave seemed to pass us by unnoticed .
Grateful is n't a big enough word to describe how I feel about having the help , but more about simply being able to be close to them .
The urge to hold close everyone I love is tangible at the moment .
But I am not sure how long this situation will last .
Communicating with your husband through a car window , when he ca n't hold his 11-month-old son would be too hard .
This urge to keep everyone close made it all the more difficult for my husband to separate from us a week ago .
He interacted with someone who had travelled and we decided that until the isolation period was over , it was safer for him to stay away from my parents .
He sees his baby on FaceTime for the moment .
Communicating with your husband through a car window , when he ca n't hold his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation period is over , but we are unsure what we will do then .
This is uncharted territory , and there are no easy answers .
We must only live in the day .
