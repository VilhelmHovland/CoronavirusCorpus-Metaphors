Coronavirus : How to support vulnerable pupils at school  This time of coronavirus , risk , isolation and the unknown is a time of anxiety , fear and pain and even panic and helplessness for some ; but it 's also potentially an opportunity for growth both for individuals and for society .
My expertise is with those who work with our most vulnerable children , and I am aware that along with our essential key workers ' children , vulnerable children are being encouraged to come into school while the majority stay safely isolated at home with their families .
This has got me thinking about three key things :  Whether many will come -- as staying at home may feel easier , and their anxious parents may struggle to manage this .
Early indications suggest numbers are low .
What will school staff do with them ? Will there be mixed-age groups ? Will there be mixed groups of key worker children and vulnerable children ?  Whether the small numbers and reduced " work " pressure , plus the obvious need sometimes to talk ( and play ) through anxieties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Understanding vulnerable children  We can all regress and " act out " during tense , anxious times .
Staff will carry these anxieties , too .
It is essential that they attune to and support each other .
Talking things through is therapeutic for everyone .
But vulnerable children may very well not have this kind of thoughtful attuned support .
Trauma and anxiety without support is like a black hole into which we might fall at any moment .
For traumatised children , this stress could trigger big anxieties , reactions and even panic outbursts , because they will have a " double whammy " -- their own triggered trauma reactions plus the current family anxieties as well as all the changes in school and life .
They may also be conditioned to pick up on any anxieties in their teachers -- just to " keep safe " .
Their snappiness ( for example ) , their outbursts or their silent withdrawals could be like unconscious communications , which could be helpful to try to understand .
It could certainly modulate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy for children or their teachers and carers .
So , the teachers and staff who come into school to work with these children will have challenges .
If however , they could develop enough understanding and nurturing child-centred capacities it could be a quite unique opportunity to give such vulnerable children something supremely valuable , which they may not have had before .
A chance to listen  What will help facilitate this opportunity ?  Certainly not blaming their parents or blaming society .
Instead , there may is an opportunity to notice and perhaps understand their tendencies , and their moment-by-moment communications .
A detailed understanding of their attachment patterns will give a framework for thinking , and lead to helpful ways of responding .
Enough understanding of the effects of trauma on the brain , on learning and memory and on ( triggered ) behaviours , etc , will help staff to know that in the moment children often ca n't help their reactions .
They need help .
Some understanding and practice of nurture will be invaluable .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitated by a secure , relational , family-type atmosphere with family-type meals and conversation , and lots of talking and playing through any issues that arise .
Thoughtful , empathic responsiveness along with firm boundaries will enable children to feel secure and held in mind .
Calming activities  A knowledge of calming activities will be helpful -- both left-brain non-emotive activities like dot-to-dots and jigsaws , and short , calming meditative breaks like creative visualisations , as they are open to it .
Integrating all these approaches into the school day , particularly with a small group of vulnerable children ( or , even better , a mixed group including good role models of the non-traumatised key worker children ) on a daily basis will give them a different more healthy experience of relationships and trust .
Slowly enough , trust and security will grow to enable learning and normal conversations .
Of course , there will be hiccups .
They may be freaked out by these caring relationships they are coming to value , and resist the adults they are coming to care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they could n't bear .
But if staff can understand these ups and downs and support each other , if they can talk such difficulties through reflectively with each other , they will perhaps make a real difference to a child 's life , and that is so rewarding .
Maybe some good can come from these hard times .
