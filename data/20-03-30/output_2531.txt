Vivo to Stand Together with Pakistan During COVID-19 Outbreak  Vivo has announced to extend a helping hand to the government of Pakistan amid the novel COVID-19 pandemic .
The global smartphone brand will be among the first ones to assist the Ministry of National Health Services in Pakistan in sourcing essential supplies for healthcare .
As the first step , vivo has donated 100,000 face masks to the authority to be used in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic .
It merits mentioning here that health workers are considered to be the first line of defense in the battle against this epidemic , however , they lack the basic equipment to protect themselves .
This donation of masks will surely equip them better to help the patients .
Not only that , but vivo has already taken a slew of initiatives to help curb the spread of COVID-19 .
Its employees all over Pakistan have been strictly instructed to work from home and all market activities have been canceled for the time being .
Additionally , vivo has extended the warranty of its smartphones as it temporarily closes its service centers across Pakistan .
