Army of PRC Twitter Bots Peddles Disinformation About Virus Origins  ( Fake twitter accounts that reflect the official line of the ruling Chinese Communist Party , including the rumor that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the U .
and not in the central Chinese city of Wuhan .
Photo : ProPublica )  China has set up multiple fake bot accounts on Twitter using Radio Free Asia 's logo and descriptions to tweet fake news in recent months , including allegations that the coronavirus came from the U .
, a recent investigative report has found .
The tweets are sent by accounts using the RFA logo , but named after various regions of China , for example " Radio Free Guangdong , " or " Radio Free Anhui .
"  They churn out tweets that reflect the official line of the ruling Chinese Communist Party , including the rumor that the coronavirus pandemic originated in the United States and not in the central Chinese city of Wuhan .
The public interest journalism website ProPublica said it had tracked more than 10,000 suspected fake Twitter accounts since August 2019 that have been part of a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  The report 's co-author Jeff Kao said the hijacking of visual identifiers from legitimate accounts to impersonate them is a hallmark of Beijing 's social media campaigns .
" They changed one of the letters in the Twitter handle and they were posting political messages that were in line with the Chinese government 's views , " Kao told RFA .
" They have very few real followers , but what they were tweeting would get like 100 likes or 20 retweets , and I think that was another tactic that they were trying out , " he said .
For example , a recent post in English reported on aid the Chinese government recently provided to Italy , and was sent by the Twitter handle @RNAChinese .
" The account appears to have been an attempt to fool the casual reader into believing it was coming from the U .
government-funded broadcaster Radio Free Asia ( @RFAChinese ) , " the report said .
Hacked , repurposed accounts  Other accounts tweeting pro-China propaganda were actually once genuine , but had been repurposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " They included a professor in North Carolina ; a graphic artist and a mother in Massachusetts ; a web designer in the U .
; and a business analyst in Australia , " it said .
The article said the fake accounts are tailored to different audiences , but the Chinese-language posts were likely aimed at influencing the " millions of ethnic Chinese " who do n't live in mainland China .
In August and September , Twitter announced that it had suspended more than 5,000 suspected Chinese state-controlled accounts and banned around 200,000 accounts that had n't yet been fully activated .
ProPublica said it wrote computer programs to document millions of interactions between the 10,000 suspected fake accounts and trace an interrelated network of more than 2,000 .
" The true scale of the influence campaign is likely much bigger ; our tracking suggests that the accounts we identified comprise only a portion of the operation , " it said .
" We found a pattern of coordinated activity among the fake accounts that appeared to be aimed at building momentum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storylines were the smearing of the Hong Kong protest movement as " rioters " and " separatists , " and praise lavished on the city 's police as they used unprecedented amounts of violence to crack down on largely peaceful protesters .
Yang Jianli , founder of the Washington-based human rights group Citizen Power , said he has been targeted by hackers backed and directed by the Chinese state , although their companies may be nominally listed as private .
" The authorities use a lot of private companies to carry out operations like this , and many are willing to provide this service to the Chinese government , " Yang said .
" Clearly these companies benefit from being under the aegis of government power and privilege , " he said .
Efforts not effective  Kao said the fake accounts are n't convincing enough yet to be effective , however .
" It 's hard to say that any minds will change .
because the accounts look so fake , " he said .
" But I think the message was definitely reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  There are strong links between the Chinese Twitter bots and a Beijing-based internet marketing company called OneSight , as many of the fake accounts had liked its tweets .
The company recently won a U .
contract to boost the Twitter following of the state-run China News Service , an arm of the Chinese Communist Party 's outreach and influence arm , the United Front Work Department .
On Jan .
29 , OneSight announced a new app that tracked virus-related information , and tweeted that it would " transmit the correct voice of China " to the world , just six days after Beijing imposed a lockdown on Wuhan .
