She turned her home into a fortress , but cracked open the doors to finish her will  Mary Gates , 70 , signs her last will and testament at her Phoenix townhome , on March 26 , 2020 .
Gates does not have coronavirus but has underlying health conditions and says she is certain she will die if she contracts the virus .
( Photo : David Wallace/The Republic )  She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared , so Mary Gates sanitized her back patio and waited for her first visitors in a month .
They would not be coming inside .
Mary , who is 70 , had turned her Phoenix townhouse into a personal fortress , coated in cleaner and free from the virus she was sure would kill her .
She was used to living independently , but the pandemic turned her into a shut-in .
It had been 26 days since she last went dancing .
Thirteen days since she risked a trip to Fry 's .
Twelve days since her ex-husband joked that the coronavirus was " custom-designed to take you out , " two days since a Texas politician suggested the elderly could sacrifice themselves for the economy , and barely 24 hours since she turned to Facebook for help .
They were on their way .
Mary printed a copy of the will , scanned her early-morning edits and smoothed it on the table .
She set out a canister of pens and a bottle of hand sanitizer .
Then she dropped onto a deck chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  She never believed she 'd live forever .
The last few weeks had made that especially clear .
She read two newspapers and had a habit of watching too much cable news , all while the grim math worked through her mind .
The novel coronavirus saved its worst for the elderly ; she was 70 years old .
It preyed on those with weakened immune systems ; her lupus medication left hers susceptible to almost anything .
The virus devastated respiratory systems ; her lungs were scarred by asthma and bouts of pneumonia .
Long ago , during a stay in Guatemala , an erupting volcano filled her lungs with soot .
If it happened again , a doctor told her , there was no telling if she 'd survive .
" If I get this illness , " she said , " I believe I have a high probability of death .
"  Death did n't scare her .
Suffering did .
She remembered her father 's final days , gripped by cancer , writhing in agony .
That would n't happen to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her death in exacting detail .
She wanted pain medicine , as much as it took , and little else .
No extraordinary measures .
No life support after the first week .
" Give my family the seven days , " she said .
Then she wanted to be disconnected .
But there was still so much life to live , so when the virus started spreading , Mary retreated into her home .
She lived alone and stayed that way .
She stopped setting an alarm clock , because there was no longer anywhere to go .
She checked on older friends and kept a regular Skype appointment with her ex-husband , every Saturday , 4 o'clock sharp .
She bought a Google Play Pass and filled her phone with pay-as-you-go games .
TV filled in the gaps .
She logged into Netflix and Amazon Prime and BritBox , to catch up on her favorite British shows .
She liked mysteries and thrillers , the kind of stories that do n't have clear endings .
Outside , she knew , much of the world moved frustratingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could cure the virus , and the drug , which she takes for her lupus , sold out so quickly that she had trouble filling her prescription .
She resented the young people who did n't seem to take the virus seriously .
They kept dancing and drinking and filling the beaches , and she had to watch from self-imposed quarantine .
It felt like the world had decided to let her generation die .
It was time to arrange her affairs .
She did n't have much to leave behind , little more than her house and whatever was left of her savings , but she wanted her will to honor the people she loved .
She found a template online and filled in the details .
But the signature posed a problem .
Mary Gates , 70 , ( right ) greets Sandi Corn , a paralegal who came to Gates ' Phoenix townhome , to serve as a witness so her last will and testament could be notarized on March 26 , 2020 .
Gates does not have coronavirus but has underlying health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she contracts the virus .
Gates found Corn on a Facebook group so she would not have to leave her home to have her last will and testament notarized .
( Photo : David Wallace/The Republic )  She wanted to have her will notarized , to ensure everything went smoothly , but could n't risk a trip to the bank and did n't have cash to hire a notary .
So she swallowed her independent streak and asked for help .
" At the risk of sounding too morbid , " she wrote on Facebook , mistyping one of the words , " does anyone know a notary that could get together 2 witnesses and notarize my will ? "  Now a car door squeaked shut .
Mary scurried to the gate , ready to greet her visitors with a hug .
Then she remembered her own rules , and took a few wide steps back .
A paralegal named Sandi Corn and her adult daughter , Ellie Nagel , appeared at the back gate .
They had come to witness .
The notary was on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , still resisting her instinct to greet them with a hug .
She waved them through the gate and toward the table .
" I also brought hand sanitizer .
"  A bottle of hand sanitizer in front of pens is seen before Mary Gates , 70 , signs her last will and testament at her Phoenix townhome on March 26 , 2020 .
Gates does not have coronavirus but has underlying health conditions and says she is certain she will die if she contracts the virus .
( Photo : David Wallace/The Republic )  They gathered around the table , careful to keep space between them .
A breeze drifted through , fluttering the front pages of the will .
The strangers eased their way into small talk , but the conversation veered straight toward the virus .
" It 's so scary , " Sandi said .
" It is scary , " Mary said .
" Right now , it 's scary .
"  Sandi tossed her hands , as if she were waving away the germs .
" I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I 'm having a little trouble going places I do n't know , opening doors I do n't usually touch .
"  " Probably Mary signs first , " she said , " so we do n't have to touch it too much .
"  Mary picked up a pen -- blue , because she 'd read somewhere that wills had to be signed in blue -- and clicked it open .
Her hand trembled .
Her hands always trembled .
She steadied herself , took a deep breath and signed her name .
