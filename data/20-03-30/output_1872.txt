In Korea , double standards on racism  Share this :  Seoul likes to project itself as a place where foreigners are welcome , but the reality can be different .
Photo : AFP / Ed Jones  Welcome , First Time in Korea ? is a popular South Korean reality TV show featuring foreigners living in Seoul who invite friends from their homelands to visit the country .
Viewers can see how foreigners enjoy their visit , learning traditional cultures and the history of the country .
On the TV show , some foreign visitors are impressed with the kindness of locals .
Some may think that Koreans are kind to all foreigners .
But a recent report from the National Human Rights Commission suggests that in fact many Koreans are racially abusive to foreigners , rather than treating them kindly .
The commission issued the report last week after investigating racism issues in South Korean society based on interviews of migrants living in the country .
A total of 68 .
of respondents said racism is pervasive in Korea .
Many reported having been verbally or physically abused .
Some reported that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners .
Many believed they have been discriminated against because of their inability to speak Korean well .
This research confirms that racism is prevalent in Korea .
With the outbreak of Covid-19 , Sinophobia spread across Korea .
Online trolls claimed that South Korea should boycott China to prevent the spread of the coronavirus .
Half a million people signed a petition urging the government to impose an entry ban on Chinese , assuming that all Chinese can spread the virus .
But anti-Chinese attitudes in Korea existed long before the outbreak of Covid-19 , with many calling Chinese people " Jjanggae , " a pejorative term .
In 2017 , a Korean film called Midnight Runners sparked controversy for spreading anti-Chinese sentiment .
The film tells the story of two police trainees who fight against a Chinese criminal gang that kidnaps teenage girls for organ trafficking .
The movie denigrates Chinese people as heinous criminals .
Incensed , dozens of ethnic Chinese in Daerim district , Seoul , held a demonstration calling for the film 's director to offer an apology .
Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Korea .
Koreans ' response to an influx of Yemeni refugees in 2018 was a case in point .
When hundreds of Yemenis entered Jeju island to seek asylum , Koreans urged the government to expel them all .
They demonized Yemenis for absurd reasons : that they allegedly took advantage of visa-free entry to Jeju in order to make more money than they could in their war-torn homeland ; most of them were adult men who entered Korea by air , not riding in a leaky boat , thus they must be fake refugees .
Hundreds of people organized demonstrations demanding that these displaced people be forced to leave .
Some feminists accused Yemenis of carrying out sex crimes in Korea .
They also spread a rumor that a woman in Jeju was the victim of a crime committed by a Yemeni refugee .
Meanwhile Islamophobes claimed that as Yemenis are Muslims , some of whom have been responsible for terrorist attacks across the world , radicalized Muslims would also attack Korea .
They also said that Yemenis would kidnap young girls , as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hankook Research , a public opinion agency in Seoul , found that only 26% of Koreans were aware of the war in Yemen .
The survey also suggested that young people are more hostile to Yemenis , assuming that all refugees are illegal migrant workers .
After some Koreans distributed groundless rumors to justify anti-Yemeni sentiment , more than 700,000 people signed a petition on the Blue House website calling for their expulsion .
Korean media often report violence against migrant workers , mainly from developing countries .
In many cases , the perpetrators are the victims ' employers or managers , an indication that often migrant workers are put at the mercy of exploitative Korean employers .
Anyone who faces racism must be frustrated .
But , ironically , Koreans criticize racism , while they are hostile to foreigners .
Koreans should do some soul-searching before slamming racists .
