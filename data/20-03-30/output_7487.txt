( Greg Gilbert / The Seattle Times )  The Seattle City Council took the position Monday that all rent and mortgage payments should be canceled during the novel coronavirus pandemic , passing a resolution calling on Gov .
Jay Inslee , Congress and President Donald Trump to use emergency powers and other means to make that happen .
Councilmember Tammy Morales sponsored the nonbinding resolution , saying many people have lost jobs and have seen their incomes reduced because of the outbreak .
Monday 's vote was unanimous , 9-0 .
" It 's the end of the month and we 've got constituents who are worried about being able to make their rent payments , " Morales said .
" We also have landlords who understand their tenants ca n't pay rent but still have mortgage payments .
"  The resolution is a lobbying maneuver ; it does n't make any changes in law and does n't change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the move could help spur state and federal leaders to bail out working households with widespread rental assistance .
It asks Inslee to impose " an immediate moratorium on residential and commercial rent payments , such that no Seattleite should be required to pay rent during this health emergency or accumulate debt for unpaid rent .
"  The resolution likewise asks Congress and Trump to impose " an immediate moratorium on residential and commercial mortgage payments and rents , such that no owner of property in the nation should be required to pay mortgage during this health emergency or accumulate additional debt for unpaid mortgage payments .
