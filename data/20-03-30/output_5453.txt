Two weeks ago , I sat down for lunch with a couple of my team members to talk about COVID-19 and what it might mean for the business .
Now , it almost feels like a moment from another time .
Yes , we kept our distance , mindful of the growing menace , and the conversation was a strange mix of optimistic and ominous .
But one throwaway thought , a suggestion by one of my teammates , prompted me to post this message on LinkedIn later that afternoon .
After three days , that post had 30,000 views and I had a diary full of meetings with people looking for some help and advice .
By the end of the week , it was suggested to me that I might want to build a website with booking functionality to make it easier to help more people -- easier for me and for them .
The magic of Squarespace , integrated with Calendly , integrated with Google , integrated with Zoom did the rest .
By the end of this week -- still only week two -- 25 people will have taken me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sydney to Saskatchewan , talking about their plans to produce climate change documentaries and export vintage clothing brands .
It 's been great to be able to help people every day -- and so far , it does feel as though I have been able to help -- but I have learned a few things too .
Firstly , everyone feels challenged but no one feels defeated .
Granted , the people who reach out to me are likely to be more predisposed to a positive outlook , but not one of them has used COVID-19 as an excuse .
If anything , it seems only to have steeled their nerve to do the thing that 's on their mind , one way or another .
And that thing is typically to do with how they might grow -- their experience , their career , or their business .
Secondly , one of the ways I sometimes find myself helping people is to introduce them to someone I know who can also help -- whether that 's because they might know more than me , or simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction , both parties have said yes without hesitation , and I 'd like to think there 's something special in the human connection that we all feel .
Thirdly , I 've been heartened , perhaps even inspired , by the fact that people are indeed willing to ask for help .
In a world that can sometimes feel proud but shallow , dominated by ' likes ' but little more , I had initially wondered whether anyone would actually engage .
Maybe they would simply think that it was a good idea , but not necessarily one worth doing .
But the bookings keep coming , and the more I 've been asked for help , the more I 've felt inspired to do the same .
The fact that I asked for help with the website is a perfect example .
Whereas I might have felt guilt in the past , I now feel only gratitude .
It 's been nearly two weeks and I 've been asked a lot of questions .
That 's not to suggest I know all the answers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning too .
About growth -- sometimes through adversity as much as opportunity -- about the need for human connection , and about the true value of asking one another for help .
Who knows what the weeks ahead will hold , but I 'll be holding on for those three things , now more than ever .
