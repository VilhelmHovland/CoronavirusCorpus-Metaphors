Conserving inland waters , handwashing are needed today  Water supports the sustenance of all life on the planet , more so in this time of the 2019 novel coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) pandemic when handwashing and proper hygiene with clean water prove to be humanity 's best defence against the disease .
However , access to clean water remains a global problem with 2 .
billion lacking access to safely managed drinking water , while 3 billion lacking basic handwashing facilities , according to the United Nations Children 's Fund and the World Health Organization .
As the Asean Centre for Biodiversity joined the recent international community in celebrating World Water Day with a focus on how water can help mitigate the impacts of climate change , we take this opportunity to emphasize the inextricable relationship of biodiversity and water .
Inland waters -- such as lakes , rivers , ponds , streams , groundwater , springs and wetlands -- supply water for the irrigation of agricultural areas in the region .
The agriculture sector alone consumes 85 .
percent of the total water withdrawals in the region .
This is followed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 .
percent , according to the United Nations Environment Programme .
Inland waters , likewise , support aquatic biodiversity -- including reptiles , amphibians , fish , mollusks , insects , other aquatic invertebrates , and water plants , and water birds and several other migratory species in this region .
In this time of climate crisis , conserving inland waters , which are known to contribute to ecosystem-based approaches to climate change adaptation .
While the region 's abundant freshwater resources are fortunate to get 9 .
percent of the total global precipitation , water availability is largely influenced by seasonal changes and the rise of global temperatures .
The increasing water requirements for agricultural , industrial and domestic uses of a growing Asean population also pose a threat to the region 's inland waters , in effect putting the water supply at risk .
In the region , leading the inland waters conservation are the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance and the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership .
At present , the region has 54 Ramsar sites covering 25,160 square kilometers .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 13,730 sq km ) , followed by Thailand ( 3,997 sq km ) , and the Philippines ( 2,440 sq km ) .
The Asean member-states recognize the value of robust ecosystems in meeting the region 's water requirements , thereby integrating sustainable resource management measures into their respective national biodiversity strategies and action plans .
The ACB has been mobilizing initiatives across sectors and generating participation of governments and stakeholders to ensure that biodiversity targets are within reach .
Although progress in increasing protected areas has been made in the past years , there is a need to transform individual protected areas into protected area networks to increase the effectiveness of species and their corresponding habitat conservation .
In Cambodia , its protected area system , which has expanded by 23 percent between 2016 and 2018 , according to Cambodia 's Sixth National Report submitted to the Convention on Biological Diversity .
It said effective protected area management boosts efforts in conserving natural resources like water , and guaranteeing resilience of the ecosystems and human communities .
Indigenous knowledge is an important element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia , fishing communities employ the tagal system , which prohibits anyone to fish in parts of a river at certain times .
This partnership between the communities and the authorities raises awareness of the importance of conserving freshwater resources while increasing the income generated by the members of the communities .
To date , there are more than 600 tagal zones in nearly 200 rivers in 17 districts in Sabah .
Conserving biodiversity is in everyone 's interest .
A holistic , multidisciplinary and multisectoral approach is key to strengthening existing laws and policies governing the management and sustainable use of biodiversity .
Under these exceptionally difficult circumstances in light of the Covid-19 pandemic , may we fully appreciate the values of the ecosystem services that inland waters provide .
In the end , the whole of society stands to gain from conserving and restoring these ecosystems .
