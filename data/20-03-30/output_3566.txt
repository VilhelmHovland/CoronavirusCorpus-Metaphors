New Mercer study spotlights four talent trends for 2020  Leading global employers are supporting their workforce foster healthy lifestyles , financial wellness and reskill in light of AI and new technology , according to a study by Mercer .
Ruth Holmes  30 March 2020  With government and employer responses to the COVID-19 pandemic accenting personal wellbeing as never before , Mercer 's 2020 Global Talent Trends study identifies what it believes are the four trends leaders can harness to " win with empathy " now and post-pandemic for international organisations and those with globally mobile employees .
the current global health crises potentially set to accelerate these themes , Mercer 's survey of 7,300+ c-suite executives , HR leaders and employees in 34 countries finds that employers are navigating uncertainty with an amplified focus on the health , financial wellbeing and careers of their employees .
This is putting HR in the frontline of driving organisational change .
COVID-19 catalysing workplace changes  The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent uncertainty are " accelerating changes in the way organisations around the world are working and will continue to work into the future , " says Mercer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HR leaders surveyed and 34% of employees expecting their jobs to be replaced in three years , purpose and employee engagement are set to be key , says the consultancy .
People-centred approaches to managing uncertainty  " Balancing economics and empathy in all people decisions is important , even more so now as we face questions , concerns and the uncertainty of a global pandemic , " said Ilya Bonic , President , Career and Head of Strategy at Mercer .
" Organisations need to have a financial model and cultural mindset that enables them to prepare for and invest in the future .
" " This rethinking of purpose and priorities is vital across the organisation , but especially for HR , " continued Ilya Bonic .
" The findings from this year 's study make it clear that transformation of the HR function is a key component to creating a sustainable organisation .
"  Four global talent trends for 2020  Mercer 's study identifies four trends for 2020 :  1 .
Future focus  With a new mandate for business , 85% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond shareholder primacy .
Yet only 35% of companies deliver on this today .
in three employees say they would prefer to work for an employer that shows responsibility towards all stakeholders , beyond just shareholders and investors .
of an organisation 's success depends on whether it can support its talent to grow and shape a sustainable business , says Mercer .
Over two-thirds of executives ( 68% ) want to focus more on environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) goals .
employees , 61% of employees trust their employer to prepare them for the future of work .
However , 63% feel at risk of burnout .
pipelines also have tightened as 72% of experienced workers say they plan to work past retirement age .
Just over half ( 55% ) of Gen Xers say opportunities to advance are limited because of longevity in the workplace .
management of older workers is part of creating shared value , believes Mercer .
More than three-quarters ( 78% ) of employees want long-term financial planning , yet just 23% of companies say they provide financial education for employees today .
" Organisations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion empathy to maximise returns for all shareholders , employees and society alike , " said Laura McKim , Partner and UK Career Business Leader at Mercer .
managers and employers with a global and globally mobile workforce , employees ' most-valued career support is personal and professional growth opportunities ( 73% ) across most regions .
Asia , knowing what skills will become important or obsolete in the future tops the list ( 71% ) , while in Africa employees value managers who can have useful career conversations no matter their life stage ( 72% ) .
The UK is aligned to the global trend in that 70% of employees feel that their company gives them the space to learn and grow , both professionally and personally .
, these data suggest the important role workplace and career coaching can have in supporting employees meet their professional goals .
Race to reskill  Reskilling is the talent investment most capable of driving business success .
Almost every respondent organisation ( 99% ) is embarking on transformation and reporting significant skill gaps .
capability and lack of future skills was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say they are ready to learn new skills , 38% claim they do not have enough time for training .
, just 34% of HR leaders are investing in workforce learning and reskilling as part of their strategy to prepare for the future of work and 40% do not know what skills their workforce has today .
" Job requirements are changing and the responsibility for upskilling , reskilling and redeployment needs to be shared between employers and employees , " said Lisa Lyons , UK Leadership and Workforce Transformation Practice Lead at Mercer .
" Where organisations see less demand for certain skills and increased demand for others , they should look to identify people with transferable skills and provide reskilling opportunities .
" Across regions , employees say innovation will be the top in-demand skill in the next 12 months .
HR leaders in North America and Latin America agree with their employees .
The United Kingdom follows this trend , with employees and HR leaders agreeing that innovation is a top priority .
Elsewhere , however , HR leaders put digital marketing ( Africa , Europe , Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Asia ) .
Sense with science  Advances in machine learning continue to permeate across industries and ways of life .
The use of predictive analytics has nearly quadrupled in five years ( from 10% in 2016 to 39% today ) .
Yet , only :  43% of organisations use metrics to identify employees likely to leave  41% know when critical talent is likely to retire  18% know the impact of pay strategies on performance  15% can determine if it is better to buy/build/borrow employees  12% are using analytics to correct inequities and prevent them recurring .
Other forms of employee engagement data gathering are on the rise too .
Six in ten ( 62% ) companies use pulse surveys and 33% plan to invest in this in 2020 .
While machines outperform humans at tasks related to scale and speed , humans outpace machines at sense-checking and judgement , which are critical elements of ethical **26;734;TOOLONG ( 67% ) of HR leaders are confident they can ensure AI is not institutionalising bias , ethics codes about the collection .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in their infancy .
assessment is equally an area where human intuition is needed along with the digital assessments -- only one in two employees ( 52% ) report a positive assessment experience .
" The availability of data and capability of analytics has increased but with great data comes great responsibility , the challenge is for organisations to use it effectively to inform strategy through ethical means .
The challenge for companies lies in balancing the protection of personal data and the interrogation of this data to drive strategic decision making , " said Laura McKim , Partner and UK Career Business Leader at Mercer .
regions , disconnects exist between the analytics the C-suite prioritises and those HR leaders provide .
In the Pacific , 53% of HR leaders provide analytics on the C-suite 's second top priority as to why one team is high performing and another struggles .
Yet , only 39% are providing analytics on the top priority around key drivers of engagement .
mature markets , like the United Kingdom , only 49% are using analytics to identify the key drivers of pay inequities -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee experience  Delivering on the employee experience is HR 's top priority : 58% of organisations are redesigning to become more people-centric .
Yet , only 27% of executives believe employee experience will yield a business return .
There is also a mismatch between the 61% of employees who trust their employer to look after their well-being ; and the 48% of executives who rank it as a top workforce concern and 29% of HR leaders that a health and well-being strategy .
This is not an area to be missed , says Mercer , as employees whose company is focused on employee health and well-being are four times more likely to be energised .
employees are essential to realise organisations ' transformation agenda : they are more likely to stay , more resilient and more ready to reskill .
HR transformation is high on organisations ' agenda and delivering on the employee experience requires HR to step out of its functional silos .
, only 40% of HR leaders say they have an integrated people strategy .
" Interactions with employees matter , but often our focus on HR process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Laura McKim .
" Organisations that approach the employee experience in the same way they would the customer experience , where a premium is placed on employee interactions and system and process design comes second , will have better success in engaging employees .
" Never more than now has placing employees ' interests at the heart of our businesses been more timely or important .
" Improving the employee experience tops HR 's future of work priorities in Europe , North America and the Middle East , with the UK aligning with this trend .
Asia and Pacific put transforming talent practices ( recruitment , performance management and succession ) in the top spot .
