Eric Goyer said he did not take the decision lightly to place the community under quarantine .
" It 's maybe the most difficult decision of my life .
but it 's really to protect the members of the community and the members of the ( larger ) community living around them , " Goyer said .
" Restricting individual liberties is not something I like to do , but I want to provide the best protection to the members of the community , particularly the seniors .
"  So far about 15 Tosh members have tested positive for COVID-19 , Goyer said , adding they likely picked up the virus while travelling to New York State two weeks ago to celebrate a religious holiday .

Francis Lanouette , chief of the Therese-de-Blainville police , said another main road leading into the area where the majority of the community lives is blocked off .
" We sat down with the community , and with them , we established a plan to do what is needed to be done so that people would be abiding by the public health order , " Lanouette told reporters Monday .

" I can tell you they are doing a lot more than other communities in attempting to stop the spread of the virus , " Goyer said .
