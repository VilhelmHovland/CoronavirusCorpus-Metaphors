COVID-19 Update : Cottages and Camps -- For Now Hold Off says Minister Rickford  THUNDER BAY -- " Our government is asking urban residents to refrain from heading to their cottages .
Those on the front lines are working tirelessly and rural medical facilities have limited space and supply , " states Minister Greg Rickford .
I am hopeful that our Manitoba neighbours will respect this position .
Let 's not put any of our fellow citizens at risk and hospitals under more pressure than necessary .
"  Minister Greg Rickford  The impact of potentially thousands of Winnipeg cottagers coming into the Kenora region will out added stress on the Healthcare system and the resources in the region .
The Lake of the Woods District Hospital would likely be potentially overwhelmed .
" This is a serious issue for Northwestern communities .
We do n't have hospital capacity and the public health risk is too high for people to make leisure visits or open their camps early , " said Rickford .
" I am working closely with my provincial colleagues to review all options necessary to protect Kenora-Rainy River 's health care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Ontarians to not go to their cottages during the COVID-19 pandemic , and we hope the Manitoba Government will make the same request of its citizens .
" This is a difficult request to make to our valued summer residents and visitors .
They are vital to our business community and as spring starts to appear , become a valued part of our community , " said Mayor Dan Reynard , Town of Kenora .
" Asking visitors and summer residents not to come to Kenora is everything opposite that Kenora has been working for , but we really need everyone to just stay home .
It is key to making the difference in the spread of this virus by what we have seen in other countries .
We simply need everyone to follow the direction of the health experts .
"  " I support MPP Greg Rickford 's call on cottagers to stay home during the pandemic , " said Francis Kavanaugh , Grand Chief of Grand Council Treaty #3 .
" Grand Council Treaty #3 is taking all precautions necessary to protect our communities from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respect our efforts .
"  " Travel between communities poses a risk , and provides a perfect opportunity for coronavirus to skip from one community to another .
If we want to slow the spread , we need to stop non-essential travel between communities , " said Dr .
Ian Gemmill , Acting Medical Officer of Health , and Marilyn Herbacz , CEO for the Northwestern Health Unit .
" If you are not a permanent resident of our area , even if you have a cottage nearby , please consider that during these strained times , you may not have access to the health care that you need and would be better to remain in the area where you have a family doctor and a health sciences centre .
"  Dr .
Sean Moore , Chief of Emergency Services at Lake of the Woods District Hospital , has been sounding the alarm about the lack of resources in their ER and ICU .
" We are a tiny operation compared to the hospitals in Manitoba , and we are already well beyond capacity , " said Dr .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Woods Hospital .
" Our infrastructure and staffing is past capacity on a normal day for just our year-round residents .
Add several thousand cottagers opening up their camps , and we have the recipe for disaster on our hands .
"  MPP Rickford 's office continues to receive calls from concerned constituents and has brought this issue to the attention of his Cabinet colleagues .
" There will soon come a time where we can all appreciate the beauty of Ontario 's cottage country but for now , we ask that you stay home and help us fight COVID-19 , " adds Minister Rickford .
Here in Thunder Bay where many people in the city have summer camps , NetNewLedger reached out to the Thunder Bay District Health Unit to see if there are similar recommendations , we await an answer .
The provincial government in Manitoba has initiated check-stops at the provincial boundary .
They are exempting Manitobans who are going to their cottages and camps in Ontario from the self-isolation requirements .
