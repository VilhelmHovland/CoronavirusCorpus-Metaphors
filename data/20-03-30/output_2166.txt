CANADIAN PRESS/Ryan Remiorz  Tosh leaders agree with authorities that strict measures need to be taken to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the community , even if only a small number of members have so far tested positive , the region 's public health director told reporters Monday .
Eric Goyer said he did not take the decision lightly to place the community under quarantine .

but it 's really to protect the members of the community and the members of the ( larger ) community living around them , " Goyer said .
" Restricting individual liberties is not something I like to do , but I want to provide the best protection to the members of the community , particularly the seniors .
"  So far about 15 Tosh members have tested positive for COVID-19 , Goyer said , adding they likely picked up the virus while travelling to New York State two weeks ago to celebrate a religious holiday .
The number of positive cases is expected to rise , he said .
