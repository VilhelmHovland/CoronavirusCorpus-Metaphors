Labour offers to help Government find way to speed up payments for self-employed  Labour offers to help Government find way to speed up payments for self-employed  Labour has pledged to work with the Government to see whether payments for self-employed workers can be made more quickly after the Chancellor announced that new coronavirus support measures would only be claimable from June .
Rishi Sunak has pledged to give millions of self-employed people a grant worth up to ? 2,500 a month , but shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that while he was relieved the policy has been brought forward , there are " quite a few gaps " .
He told BBC Breakfast : " I 'm really relieved that it has been brought forwards and I 'm pleased .
There 's quite a few gaps .
lots of self-employed people who have fallen outside the scheme for different reasons have contacted me overnight .
" But we 'll work with the Government and try and get those gaps filled .
" The big issue that has come from most of them is having to wait until June for payments .
Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the next few weeks ' , so we 'll work with the Government to see whether or not payments can be made more quickly .
" There was about 40,000 staff laid off from HMRC .
Maybe one of the things the Government could do is the same as the health service , invite many of those staff back to help us get the payments out the door to these self-employed workers .
"  Mr McDonnell urged the Government to increase statutory sick pay to cover people who are self-isolating or off sick .
He said : " The Chancellor is advising people to take out Universal Credit loans and grants , well as I say , it 's very difficult getting through the telephone system , let alone the internet with regards to that .
" But again , even if they had to fall back on sick pay , if that was at a high enough level actually then they can survive in terms of day-to-day expenditure .
"  National chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses Mike Cherry said the organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on those who have been operating their own business for under a year not being able to apply for the new funding , he said : " I think the Chancellor yesterday said that the amount that some could get under Universal Credit was over ? 1,500 but others are saying it is just statutory sick pay and that is going to be a problem for many , many small businesses who just started up .
"  Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the Government is offering " the right response " for self-employed workers .
Mr Sharma told BBC Breakfast : " The Chancellor was very clear that we want to do this as quickly as possible , we 've set a date of June , if we can do it faster we will , but it is a complicated system that we are designing and we want to make sure we get it absolutely right .
"  Responding to Mr McDonnell 's calls for former HMRC staff to return , he added : " I do n't think the block right now is the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system and that is what we 're doing .
"  Outgoing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the BBC on Thursday that the Government 's response to the coronavirus pandemic showed he was " absolutely right " about public spending in the 2019 general election .
He said he had been " denounced as somebody that wanted to spend more money than we could possibly afford " but that now the Conservatives realised the need to invest in the state .
" They 've now suddenly realised that they have to spend money to invest in the state , as we have always said as a party , and they have come around to a lot of that position , " Mr Corbyn said .
