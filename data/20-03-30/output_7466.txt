BEIJING -- An official gauge of China 's manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March as work resumption picked up , though economists warned that business activity remains far from normal following a devastating coronavirus outbreak .
China 's official manufacturing purchasing managers index jumped to a reading of 52 .
in March from a record low of 35 .
in February , the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday .
The result was higher than the median forecast of a 51 .
reading by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal .
Readings above 50 indicate expansion , while those below 50 signal contraction .
A separate nonmanufacturing PMI , also released Tuesday , showed service and construction activity similarly rebounding in March to 52 .
from 29 .
in February .
But the data rebound is largely confined , for now , to an improvement in sentiment after two months in which the economy ground to a near-total halt as the coronavirus swept across China , forcing the government to implement strict measures to prevent its spread .
China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturing PMI reading did n't mean economic activity had returned to pre-virus levels .
The bureau said the result merely reflected the resumption of work after more than a month of forced idleness .
Other , more-concrete economic indicators for March will likely show steep year-over-year declines when they are released in the coming days , some analysts said .
These include figures on foreign trade , industrial output , investment and consumption in the world 's second-largest economy .
The data released Tuesday hinted at some of the pain still to come .
The manufacturing PMI 's subindex for new export orders , while rising to 46 .
in March from 28 .
in February , remained in contraction territory , though the subindex measuring factory production climbed to 54 .
from 27 .
in the previous month .
" While the PMI reading in March pointed to a sharp rebound , the economic activity was far from normal levels , " said Tang Jianwei , an economist at Bank of Communications .
Tang said he expects the economy as a whole to have contracted in March from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would likely show smaller year-over-year declines than in the January-February period .
He said a basket of stimulus measures is needed to get the economy back on track .
China injected billions of dollars of liquidity into the financial system after the virus first broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan .
Beginning in late January , authorities ordered an extended shutdown of factories and other businesses , imposed travel restrictions and locked down cities severely hit by the virus , shutting down economic activity across much of the country for more than a month .
As a result , Chinese economic activity plunged across the board in the first two months of the year .
In addition to the new liquidity injections , Chinese authorities have also exempted tax and social security insurance payments for the nation 's smaller businesses , which are most vulnerable to economic shocks .
China 's Politburo , the country 's top policy-making body , said last week that it would roll out many measures in a bid to stimulate domestic demand , including increasing the fiscal deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government debt .
On Monday the central bank , the People 's Bank of China , cut a key short-term market interest rate , which analysts said could guide benchmark lending rates lower in the coming month .
Despite the measures , economists widely forecast the Chinese economy to post a year-over-year contraction in the first quarter of the year -- an outcome that would complicate Beijing 's year-end goal of doubling the overall size of the economy from a decade earlier .
Economists said a growth rate of roughly 5 .
in 2020 is needed for Beijing to meet that goal .
However , with the rapid spread of the coronavirus in Europe and the U .
, which are among China 's biggest overseas markets , " it 's even hard for China to realize 4% to 5% economic growth " this year , Ma Jun , an adviser to the PBOC , said recently , according to a report published Tuesday by the state-run Economic Daily .
Ma suggested Beijing scrap its growth target for 2020 .
China normally sets its annual economic target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
That meeting has been postponed to an unspecified date this year because of the pandemic .
While the Chinese economy is recovering , albeit slowly , weakening overseas demand is set to curb the country 's economic growth in the coming months , said Ding Shuang , an economist with Standard Chartered .
In terms of coronavirus impact , " China 's first quarter is other countries ' second quarter , so if China 's first-quarter GDP falls sharper than expected , that means the worst has n't come yet for the Chinese economy , " said Mr .
Ding .
