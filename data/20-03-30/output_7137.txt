When the music stops : How Pensacola artists and entertainers are coping with the shutdown  Though her music career has n't stalled out in any shape or form , the 19-year-old Waltman had to break her promise to her younger self this week when she landed a job delivering pizzas .
To provide our community with important public safety information , our newsroom is making stories related to the coronavirus free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please consider becoming a digital subscriber .
" I made a pact with myself and said , ' I 'm going to work super hard and never have to get a day job ever again and just play music , ' " Waltman said .
" But this is beyond my control so I 'm delivering pizzas until music can start back up .
"  The coronavirus ' indiscriminate reign of destruction over just about every industry on earth has forced talented artists like Waltman to pivot .
For many Pensacola artists , playing the guitar , DJing , singing or rapping leads to the majority of their income , if not all of it .
When bars and music venues are shut down to satisfy guidelines to limit large gatherings , these musicians are automatically out of work by proxy .
Indiana-born blues singer Tyler Mac scrolled through his email inbox and social media feeds in disbelief on March 12 and 13 when the nationwide rash of cancellations first began .
" It 's just starting to sink in a little bit , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , but I did n't realize how much I missed talking to people , like in the crowd .
It 's a void right now .
I do n't know how to describe it .
"  Tyler Mac estimated he has performed at least 200 shows last year as the lead member of The Tyler Mac Band , performing regularly on the beach at places like The Dock and the Sandshaker Lounge .

He estimated doing at least 200 shows last year as the lead member of The Tyler Mac Band , performing regularly on the beach at places like The Dock and the Sandshaker Lounge .
Mac said he 's gone stir crazy this week .
He is n't used to going six or seven days without performing , let alone six or seven weeks , which is a feasible possibility .
" I 've never gone more than like a week or so without touring or performing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , I only had like two or three days off before I 'd join another band .

( Photo : Jody Link/News Journal correspondent )  Ramsey Coates , known better to some as " DJ Ram-Z , " grew up DJing bars and clubs , and still does from time to time , but the financial impact he 's felt in the entertainment industry as a result of COVID-19 is a bit unique .
Coates was anticipating a healthy wedding season this spring and fall as the owner of AnyDayDJ .
Now he and the four DJs who work for him just hope those bookings do n't dissolve when the pandemic does .
" All of our weddings have been postponed , " Coates said .
" When they book , they put down the retainer , but if they cancel outside of 30 days of the wedding , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of those happen , too .
So it 's impacted us financially and strategically , hard .
"  Coates said his business normally locks up three to six wedding gigs a weekend from late March until late May .
Luckily , Coates said , a lot of agreements he had in place were frozen and should be honored at some point .
Like most in the country , he just does n't know when that will be .
" What a lot of wedding vendors did was say , ' Listen , let 's not cancel , everyone 's in the same situation .
You 're still on my books , we do n't know when the date 's going to be , but as long as you finish something by 2022 , we 're good to go , ' " explained Coates , who is trying to piece dollars together during the pandemic through his other ventures as a social media agency operator and a podcaster .
" ' Canceled ' is a bad word , we do n't say ' canceled .
' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has seen his entire upcoming schedule of events wiped out , " cancel " is the only word that fits .
EmoProm , an event thrown by Pensacola 's Michael Silver , took place at Vinyl Music Hall in February .
( Photo : Courtesy of Michael Silver )  " The entertainment industry is the first industry that really came to a dead stop due to this thing , " said Silver , who has been throwing events in Pensacola for more than 10 years .
He 's the chief operating officer of the event-based company GlowRage and a former band member himself .
GlowRage and other concert series thrown by Silver are demographically aimed at the college market .
He said he does about 40% of his business around spring break season , between March and May .
" That 's all gone , " Silver said .
" I had probably $180,000 in canceled contracts from public universities because they 're all just shutdown due to this thing .
"  Working around the shutdown  The same way most everyone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of entertainment , artists have shifted their focus to livestream performances or " quaranstreams .
"  That 's when they perform from their homes or isolated areas for online audiences .
Artists are attaching " electronic tip jars " or their Venmo and PayPal accounts to their streams to generate donations .
Those donations are coming through , Pensacola artists say , but the money gained is a far cry from the booking fees they 'd otherwise rack up .
Not to mention the money they 'd collect for selling CDs and merchandise at show venues .
But something is certainly better than nothing to Mac , Waltman and pretty much anyone else who pays the majority of their bills with music money .
" We just did a stream that had more than 10,000 views , " Mac said .
" We did it right , high quality audio and everything .
Fans from England , fans from Germany were on there interacting with each , and I was really overwhelmed and humbled by the money that was coming in .
"  Coates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DJ , knocking out a pair of livestream performances in the past week .
Most recently he performed in " The Sets on Deck " live concert series , which features strictly Pensacola talent .
" It 's really easy for us to livestream , it 's one plug and we 're good to go , " Coates said .
" So that 's really convenient to help break the monotony of us getting pounded by the coronavirus .
"  Even the smallest of donations are impacting Waltman , who has performed as part of a week-long Facebook Live digital music festival called Social Distance Fest .
She said she 's trying to retain as much optimism as she can right now .
" It 's not anywhere near what I would be making if I were actually playing shows and touring , " Waltman said .
" But some guy , he was a bartender , he got laid off his job because of this and he sent me $2 .
and said , ' I just want to thank you for doing this , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than people that are well off donating $25 .
"  Silver has spent the past few weeks organizing what is essentially a pop-up , drive-in movie theater .
He 's of the belief that people need to be entertained regardless of the virus .
" Even the Romans knew that you have to give the people bread and games to keep them sane , " he said .
" I racked my brain for a couple days and came up with the idea of starting a popup movie tour .
"  Silver 's plan is to pull into parking lots , pop up huge screens and have people drive their cars in to watch .
" Windows up , no-touch entertainment , " he said .
" They scan their tickets through the window and they do n't have to have contact with anybody .
Each car is considered its own private space .
"  Silver said he 's booked more than a dozen popup movie showings in Mobile , Alabama , set to take place between April 1-5 at Hank Aaron Stadium .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while everyone is social distancing and physical distancing , you 're at least watching a movie in public and in private , " he said .
" I had to pivot .
"  Staying hopeful : Artists find silver linings amid the crisis  If they ca n't hit the stage and chase tour dates , artists have at least found the opportunity to put pen to pad and create some new music during the shutdown  " I 'm trying to utilize this time and create , " Mac said .
" To stay productive .
I 've been sitting here shredding on guitar .
"  Waltman said she 's spent a lot of the past two weeks indoors writing .
" If anything good was to be taken out of this , it 's having time to make music , " she said .
Music aside , Coates said he said he 's hoping humanity can hit the reset button and demonstrate a little more gratitude toward their personal relationships .
" I have friends that I have n't talked to over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Hey man , how you doing , how 's your family doing ? ' " Coates said .
" Everybody 's checking on each other , everybody 's helping local businesses .
Restaurants ca n't serve food , so hey , let 's go get some curbside food , let 's sit on the back porch and enjoy each other .
"  Without the sanctity of a stage and the bond he and his band mates share while performing on one , Mac has at least gotten to spend more time with his daughter .
He said they 've played more games of Guess Who together than he can count .
And as much as he 's loved playing those games , Mac said he , like anyone else who feels their identity has been stripped while out work , ca n't wait to resume playing once the virus is under control .
" We grind , " he said .
" We 're independent contractors , we provide a service and we work .
I consider myself pretty blue collar .
A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
