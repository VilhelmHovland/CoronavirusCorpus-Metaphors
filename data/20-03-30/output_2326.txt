How science is accelerating to try and catch up with COVID-19  Canada needs its own vaccine for the novel coronavirus , says virologist Alyson Kelvin .
' If all countries are experiencing this at the same time , no one is going to be able to share with us .
'  By Christina Frangou March 30 , 2020  Alyson Kelvin at the University of Saskatchewan lab inside VIDO-InterVac in Saskatoon .
THE CANADIAN PRESS/Liam Richards  Sometime last fall , a novel virus moved from an animal into a person and began to circulate speedily and stealthily from one body to the next .
By the time any human being learned of its existence , COVID-19 had already taken hold .
Now scientists are racing to catch up with a virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .
For Dr .
Alyson Kelvin , that meant boarding a plane on March 27 from her home in Halifax , where she 's a virologist at Dalhousie University , to join other scientists at the University of Saskatchewan 's VIDO-InterVac lab in Saskatoon .
Researchers at the VIDO lab study human and animal pathogens , and were the first in Canada to have a permit to work with the SARS-CoV-2 -- which causes the disease COVID-19 -- to investigate the potential for a vaccine .
Kelvin was enlisted because she has substantial expertise conducting research on ferrets .
SARS-CoV-2 does n't infect mice well enough for themto be used as reliable test subjects for antivirals or vaccines , says Kelvin .
" I 'm supposed to go back ( to Halifax ) mid-April , but I do n't think that will happen , " she says .
Her hope is that this collaboration will help develop vaccine candidates to be put forward for testing .
It 's important to have a vaccine made in Canada , she says .
" If all countries are experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to share with us , " says Kelvin .
" We need to do it for ourselves .
"  But developing and testing a vaccine takes time -- it 's likely a 12- to 18-month process , say experts .
Any vaccine must be thoroughly tested for effectiveness and safety before being rolled out .
Otherwise , the risks exceed the risks of having no vaccine at all .
" You do n't want to sacrifice safety for speed , " says Dr .
Gregory Poland , director of the Mayo Clinic 's Vaccine research group .
" I 'm a vaccinologist .
I believe in vaccines .
But I believe in being careful and being sure we are doing good and not causing harm .
"  At the same time , with the number of infected growing by the hour , we are in dire need of answers now -- yesterday , even .
COVID-19 makes itself known only in some of its victims and appears as late as two weeks after a person is infected .
" What you see now is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 is only the movie of what happened 14 to 30 days ago .
We can saynothing about the future based on right now , " says Poland .
" What we know about this disease is only around 12 weeks old .
"  He says many key questions remain unanswered , including : What is the true infection rate ? What is the case fatality rate ? Do people without symptoms pose as much threat to others as those with symptoms ? Will this virus recur annually ? Can people become reinfected ?  Dr .
Jason Kindrachuk , a Canada Research Chair and professor of medical microbiology and infectious disease at the University of Manitoba , says the strongest evidence anyone has for how to respond comes from the 1918 Spanish Flu , which wasthe last time the world faced a new virus of pandemic proportions without any vaccines or therapeutics .
And based on that evidence , the most important measure right now is social distancing to slow the pandemic and allow scientists and health systems some time to catch up .
" We ask and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take time , " says Kindrachuk .
Scientists are speeding ahead as much as possible , sharing information in a way that several of them describe as unprecedented .
New York , a team led by Dr .
Florian Krammer , a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Health System , developed a serological assay -- a blood-drawn test -- that could help identify people who were infected and have recovered from COVID-19 .
They posted their findings on March 18 as a pre-print , which is a scientific paper that has not been through the process of peer review ( an assessment by other experts in the field that is a standard part of traditional scientific publication ) .
Serological testing will help provide a better picture of how many people have had COVID-19 in the community -- instead of the very limited cases that have been confirmed by testing -- and it will help identify the level of immunity in the population .
The Krammer lab has made theingredients needed for this testing and the protocols and procedures available to scientists around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to start serological testing earlier than expected because of the assay .
" This means we 're actually a lot closer than people realize to being able to do that kind of work , " says Kindrachuk .
" It 's probably in the span of weeks as opposed to months .
"  Information-sharing among scientists around the globe is happening at a lightning pace .
" Everyone 's being really forthcoming with their data , " says Dr .
Selena Sagan , a Canada Research Chair in RNA biology and viral infections at McGill University .
Medical and science journals are putting out papers quickly , eliminating the traditional time delays built into the peer-review process .
COVID-19 is the first global public health crisis where experts have used social media to circumvent conventional systems for sharing scientific information .
" Leading scientists from around the world are sharing their experiences in real time , " says Kindrachuk .
" They 're providing their insights and views on things as simple as clinical data or clinical presentation , the modelling and transmission events .
"  To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biosafety containment .
Laboratory facilities with these capabilities are expensive to operate , and few labs in Canada have the clearance , says Sagan .
" There are barriers for research to be performed on these viruses and so that can explain partly why we do n't know as much about them .
"  Dr .
Matthias G ? tte 's lab at the University of Alberta received a rapid response grant for COVID research from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
While the rest of the university is shut down , the researchers in his lab follow social distancing protocols .
They rely on computers and phones for communication whenever possible , often while watching kids at home .
" We have to deliver , " says G ? tte , chair of the medical microbiology and immunology department at the University of Alberta .
He and his team are working on a potential treatment for COVID-19 , remdisivir , which is produced by Gilead Sciences Inc .
, and was developed initially for Ebola .
Over the weekend , Gilead announced they would expand access to remdisivir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Many scientists agree that the quickest and safest route to a treatment for COVID-19 is finding a therapy already in development that can be repurposed for the novel coronavirus .
" Developing new drugs is important , of course , for a second wave of this virus , but withthis wave , we need to work with what we have and repurpose FDA-approved drugs , " says Dr .
Nathalie Grandvaux , president of the Canadian Society for Virology and head of immunopathology at the Universit ? de Montr ? al .
" This is the only way to get the fast approval of a drug for COVID-19 that we urgently need .
"  The poor quality of data currently available means it 's difficult toassess our trajectory on the curve .
Asked how Canada compares to places like Italy , Dr .
Tyler Williamson , associate director of the Centre for Health informatics at the University of Calgary , says it 's too early to tell .
" Every place reports and tests differently , " he says .
He uses the analogy of trying to predict which team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games of the season .
In Canada , our numbers will be influenced by the swell of people who returned home from other countries over the last few weeks .
Williamson says it 's impossible to measure exactly how different social interventions will reduce spread .
" We ca n't directly compare places like Singapore and Canada because the social dynamics in Singapore are very different than they are in Canada or the United States , " he says .
" And they 're different in Canada and the United States , too .
"  But there 's no question in his mind that the threat of COVID-19 is real .
What it means precisely for Canada , though , remains unknown .
" We do know that we have to take this seriously .
There are some real concerns there may be a hurricane coming and we need to be prepared for it .
"  Poland says that conflicting messages from politicians around the world have given people false hope about risks associated with COVID-19 and the potential for a quick vaccine or treatment .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle on the virus , he said .
" Science should never be beholden to politics , to peer pressure , even to economics , " he says .
" Let science inform policy .
