Teenage sweethearts return to help out  TWO West Cork doctors -- teenage sweethearts since they met at The Boiler Room disco in Clonakilty -- have answered the HSE ' On Call for Ireland ' drive and returned home from New Zealand to help frontline health staff in the fight against the Covid-19 virus .
Dr Aidan Coffey from Kilcolman near Enniskeane and Dr Lorna Kelly from Bandon , arrived home on Tuesday , having only made the decision to return home last Thursday .
Speaking to The Southern Star , while on route to Bantry where they will self-isolate in a house for two weeks , Dr Coffey said it has been a dramatic few days for them .
' We signed up , booked the flights , told the family and we were making a lot of big decisions in the space of an hour like selling our car , furniture and saying goodbye to our friends , ' said Aidan .
Both of them were working as registrars in Hamilton and had been on a one year work holiday visa and were due home this July .
' It suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we just brought forward our flights .
We said we 'd come home and work here and help serve the country , when the national health service is in crisis .
They are the ones that trained us , and we are in a position to help , ' added Aidan .
He said that it 's bittersweet in one way to be coming home and not being able to hug their parents and family members .
' All we can do is just wave and chat to them from the car , although my mum Annette said she would leave , at a short distance , a big pot of stew for us to bring down to Bantry while we self-isolate .
'  They were also lucky that all their flight plans worked out as they said many of their friends who wanted to come home , both to Ireland and the UK , were unable to do so due to cancelled flights and restricted travel .
' The impact of Covid-19 is quite scary to be honest , and it will change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We 're not going to be able to provide the care for patients that we would have been able to do a month ago .
'  Aidan and Lorna are just two of over 60,000 people from home and abroad who have answered the HSE ' On Call for Ireland ' recruitment drive .
