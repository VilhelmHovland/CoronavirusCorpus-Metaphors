More than 90 deaths in the Netherlands in 24 hours  The new coronavirus ( covid-19 ) has already claimed at least 864 victims in the Netherlands , 93 of whom were recorded as dying on Sunday , according to the latest figures from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment ( RIVM ) .
As in Belgium , the record of deaths may be a few days late , as the information takes time to come from the country 's various hospitals .
Moreover , the number of 93 deaths does not fully reflect the reality , as it only includes people who died after testing positive , but the entire population is not screened .
On Sunday , the number of hospital admissions in the Netherlands rose by 507 to a total of 3,990 .
The RIVM notes that in the province of Noord-Brabant , bordering Belgium , the downward trend in the number of hospital admissions continues .
A total of 11,750 virus contaminations were confirmed in the laboratory , an increase of 884 cases in 24 hours .
