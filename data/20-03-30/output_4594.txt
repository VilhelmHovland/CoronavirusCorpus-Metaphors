Italy has got doctors dying and they 're in space suits .
What am I going to do ? "  Doctors work on coronavirus patients in the intensive care unit of San Matteo Hospital , in Pavia , northern Italy .
( AP )  Much has been made of " flattening the curve " to ensure the hospital system can cope with the load .
But according to this doctor , his ICU runs at between 85 and 110 per cent of capacity in " normal " times , without any extra load from the COVID-19 pandemic .
" People forget what happens when the system gets overwhelmed .
In that case people with conditions not related to COVID-19 , who would have survived before , will now no longer survive , " he said .
" Patients with ruptured ulcers , or heart attacks , there 'll be no-one to look after them .
If you rupture your appendix , well sorry , all the intensive care units will be full with COVID-19 patients .
( Graphic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I 've got an elderly man coming in with septic shock from a burst appendix .
I 'm afraid he 's going to die , so here 's some morphine and we 'll let his family hold his hand until he does .
"  The doctor said the flow-on effects from the pandemic would be devastating .
" I worry about the collateral damage , " he said .
" People who would otherwise have recovered but did n't because there was n't the capacity to help them .
"  The doctor also hit out at those who downplayed the risks the virus poses , and said ' mixed messages ' from the government had contributed to that .

Anyone can die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die in the higher age groups , but the facts were in Italy , most of the elderly were n't in intensive care .
They were allowed to die .
It was a case of , I 'm sorry , you 're over 75 , so you do n't get to go to intensive care .
"  The doctor said he was " livid " that the NRL and AFL tried to keep playing through the crisis , while images of people socialising in groups at the beach or the park left him in despair .
" Those people at the beach and the park , they do n't take it seriously enough , " he said with a heavy sigh .
Police are now patrolling beaches to stop large crowds gathering .

" To say it 's just the flu is the height of delusion , " he said .
" People are cherry-picking the numbers .
Yes , there were 35,000 deaths last year from the flu , but what they do n't realise is there is a vaccine .
" Coronavirus is actually far more contagious than swine flu .
The entire population seems to have no underlying immune response to it .
We 've seen in the past , entire civilisations wiped out through disease .
