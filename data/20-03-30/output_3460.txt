Andile Khumalo : What must I do for my employees during lockdown ?  19:15 30/03/2020 Andile Khumalo  It is clear .
Covid-19 has propelled us deep into uncharted waters .
For us entrepreneurs , this means juggling a number of pressure points and ' unknown unknowns ' as a result of South Africa having gone into a 21-day lockdown on Thursday , 26 March .
There is rent to think about , there are debts to think about , and then there are staff members to think about .
Do I force my people on leave ? Paid or unpaid ? But I ca n't pay .
Maybe I just lay them off ? Retrench or dismiss ? Is that even legal ? And if this lockdown lasts longer than 21 days , what do I do then ?  For the past few days , the only reference point we 'd had was President Cyril Ramaphosa 's Monday , 23 March 2020 speech , which pretty much told us that for 21 days " all South Africans must stay at home ; all businesses must close - except those involved in providing essential services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should do so " .
This created lots of confusion when it came to how employers should deal with employees during this time .
If your business is still operating and employees are still working , obviously you must continue to pay them .
But what about businesses that can not operate via Zoom , WhatsApp or Skype -- say for example a restaurant ? And even if your staff can work remotely during the 21 days , what if this period is extended ? How long can your teams keep working at home ? What if you run out of work for them ? What then is your obligation to staff versus your responsibility to keep the business afloat ?  Thankfully the confusion is no more .
Just two days after the president 's speech and a day before the official lockdown started , a Government Notice was issued by the Department of Employment and Labour on Wednesday , 25 March 2020 entitled " The Temporary Employer/ Employee Relief Scheme " .
You are forgiven if you have not seen or read it .
There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directive acknowledges that during the national lockdown , " companies will have to shut down , and employees laid off temporarily " and this means that " employees are compelled to take leave , which is not out of choice " which may lead to loss of income for them .
In short , if you can not keep your people employed during the national lockdown ( and therefore pay them their normal salaries ) , and you can not afford to pay them their normal salaries , you are to place them on temporary unpaid leave for 21 days and apply for this special scheme on their behalf to alleviate their loss of income .
The special benefit  The scheme is done through the Unemployment Insurance Fund , so the employee must 've been contributing to UIF while employed .
The employer is the one that makes the application on behalf of the employee and all applications are online .
Under the special benefit , all the normal UIF rules fall away and employers can claim up to R17 712 per month per employee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income replacement rate sliding scale ( 38% - 60% ) as provided for in the Unemployment Insurance Act " , provided that if this calculation leads to the salary being below the minimum wage of the sector the employee belongs to , the scheme will pay such employee the minimum wage .
It is also important to note that this scheme only pays for the salary portion of one 's total cost to company .
In addition to the this salary benefit for those who are not being paid during the national lockdown , employees who are receiving their salary but have to go into a 14 day pre-cautionary self-quarantine will qualify for an illness benefit .
This is welcome support for small businesses who would otherwise have had to grant paid sick leave to such employees during quarantine .
I think these are very sensible provisions from our government and I encourage all small business owners to apply right away and save as many jobs as possible .
Even if you have already laid off your staff without being able to give them hope on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is your chance to help them .
Reinstate them , get on your computer and apply .
All that employers need to do is ensure they are up to date at SARS with the UIF contributions deducted from their employees , and that the closing of their business is a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic .
I 'd suggest that you also make sure your business is tax compliant before applying as I do n't see the state providing support to tax dodging employers , even though the ultimate beneficiaries of the scheme are the employees .
Please send your application right away to **25;5969;TOOLONG and give your staff an opportunity to earn a living during this difficult time , which will in turn allow them to #StayHome and #StaySafe and curb the spread of Covid-19 without the anxiety of how they will provide for their families .
