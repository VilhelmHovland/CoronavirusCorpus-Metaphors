On ' Cult ! ' Paybac examines his complex relationships with the elements of his ' Nigerian ' life Album Review  For his fourth body of work in just two years , Paybac uses the symbolic representation of life as a totem to address inter-relationships in his life and the larger Nigerian society .
Paybac releases new album , ' Cult ! ' ( Instagram/LookAtPaybac )  In the modern Nigerian society , ' Cult ' is of a negative connotation .
That 's what your parents call you when you grow a beard , pierce your ears and tint your hair as a Nigerian teenager .
It 's what members of the infamous Special Anti-Robbery Squad ( SARS ) pretend you are to extort you .
On another point of negativity that does n't relate to ( victim ) profiling , cultism is one of the biggest problems ravaging Nigerian youth .
In other forms of cabalism , it is also one of the greatest impediments Nigeria faces on its way to growth and improvement .
On March 27 , 2020 , Nigerian rapper , Paybac titled his sophomore album the dreaded word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
No , he 's not a cultist .
For his fourth body of work in just two years , Paybac uses the symbolic representation of life as a totem to address inter-relationships in his life and the larger Nigerian society .
On it , he uses historical materials , political metaphors and pop culture references to describe even his complex relationships with elements of his life .
To Paybac , the Nigerian polity is one whole machinery oiled by the warm-blooded organisms that make it up .
Thus , one arm of the polity relates to another .
In that sense , the problems ravaging ordinary personal relationships ( on ' Boy Band ' ) in lack of trust grows to plant seeds of corruption that affects the entire country ( on ' F*** A Politician , ' for example ) .
To all the songs , there is an interlink to which the bottomline relates to how Nigeria creates a faulty legacy from its inability to maintain core values of positivity .
There are also times which Paybac uses politician figures , pop culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
To me , the album is basically saying , if you can not maintain a friendship or pursue a girl honestly , how will you not grow to become a societal menace ? How will you trample upon positive legacies of people like Aguiyi Ironsi ? While the foregoing is an afterthought , the album could also be simply perceived as the diary of an average wide-eyed Nigerian millennial living life in Nigeria .
Like this review , the album could sometimes be wildly opinionated in its quest to safeguard the legacy of some , successfully interprete the roles of certain societal elements and criticize the existence of certain societal elements .
It 's also quite interesting that this socio-politically charged album comes in the thick of Nigerian complacency in the face of COVID-19 pandemic .
However , at the root of the album and to my digestion of it is the idea that to everything we do , there is a legacy .
What our legacy is will usually depend on how we live and sometimes , our legacy remains at the mercy of others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's open to opinions and sometimes seems an ad hominem .
Nonetheless , the execution of it and those aforementioned elements of its creativity makes the album top quality .
In fact , this is the best body of work Paybac has ever released .
If The Biggest Tree had better mixing , overall artistic execution like on CULT ! and better production , it might rival CULT ! but it does n't .
Paybac took his time to work on something that will stand the test of time .
While speaking with a legendary Nigerian journalist , he noted that , " This is the kind of artist Nigerians can invest in .
He has the ability to garner a cult following .
If he has just N2 million to support this work with videos , he could be on to something .
"  It 's the truth .
This album is solid .
Here is why ;  ' Aguiyi Ironsi ( Through The Mud ) ' opens CULT ! to a classic reference - a criticism of the African tendency to suffer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People do n't have to smile in a bad partnership .
" It 's a manifesto for the heavy socio-political themes on CULT ! By delivery , Paybac is both himself and the roving spirit of Aguiyi Ironsi .
The legacy of Aguiyi Ironsi is a delicate and wrongly represented one .
Nigerians lump him up with the rest of the corrupt politicians .
While he might not have been clean , he is unfairly portrayed .
History shows that Aguiyi Ironsi was a good man - a lone/omega wolf - who existed in the time of vicious alpha wolves and he got consumed in the holocaust that kills also those wolves .
There is also the tale that Aguiyi Ironsi was metaphysically fortified .
The story goes that when he died , he had to be dragged through the mud and killed brutally because guns and machetes did n't work .
Thus , he struggles to set himself apart from the faulty legacy of the others .
For Paybac , he finds parallels between himself and Ironsi .
To him , both of them are wrongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged through the mud .
The three moving parts of this song - Ironsi , Paybac and Fela 's opinion - are tied by Paybac 's refusal to be wrongly portrayed .
Instead of getting kept down , Paybac comes back throwing punches .
Instead of keeping quiet as he had been forced to , he swings at the Nigerian politicians who have no passion for the job .
Instead of being like the people Fela criticized for suffering and smiling , Paybac refuses to smile .
This song sees Paybac try to rewrite his own legacy by changing his perception - unlike Aguiyi Ironsi .
Its beat sounds like a B .
loosie - guitar-heavy with layers of eerie strings .
Those ominous strings also point to the entire direction of this album - little positivity and significant highlight reels of the negative Nigerian society .
' Boy Band ' was the lead single for CULT ! and it was released in 2019 .
Again , it opens up to a Chinua Achebe quote , " Being Nigerian is abysmally frustrating and unbelievably exciting .
" From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Paybac highlights the power of his personal relationships and the lack of respect he gets from people .
To him , he makes music to be respected .
Again , back to the title , ' Boy Band ' and ' CULT ! ' are built on the concept of togetherness .
While they can both be negative ; one has a usually positive connotation while the latter is inherently negative .
This time , Paybac finds the power of togetherness in his ' Boy Band ' - his gang , and his fans .
The song then examines Paybac 's relationship with his fans and supporters .
That beat is also interesting - built on classic South-South Nigerian folk , it 's defined by its trap percussion .
' Glamour Girls ' featuring Jazzz Attah also highlights an inter-personal relationship .
But this time , it 's not overly to societal or political .
Instead , it celebrates a girl named Blessing who lives in Surulere , Lagos .
The song finds links to the Kenneth Nnebue classic , Glamour Girls .
The film which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagos girls in the risque life of transactional relationships .
' Nigeria Suk My D*k ' is the ' Mood For Eva ' of most Nigerian millennials .
This one describes Paybac 's rocky relationship with his country .
The phone conversation that opens the song and Paybac 's cold shoulder underline the frustration with which he breathes as a Nigerian .
The beat is a minimalist alternative trap that cooks up sharp piano chords .
' F*k a Politician ' comes just one day after Nigerians quoted news that Bola Ahmed Tinubu donated N200 million to Lagos State for the fight against COVID-19 with , ' He transferred money from himself to himself .
' The rocky relationship between Nigerian politicians and electorate is secured by mutual contempt - sometimes subconscious .
Here , Paybac brings it to the fore .
Again , centred on relationship , Paybac describes his relationship with Nigerian politicians .
It 's not quite unexpected as Paybac belts out " F*k a Politician " while the trap song rumbles with the intensity of King Kong .
Something also makes me think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .
Paybac raps , " Chairman talking second term , but he 's already dying .
" This album has been in the works for a long time .
' Lupita ' features Barelyanyhook and its this writer 's favourite song on CULT ! The song and its themes - not as much its BPM - reminds this writer of ' Seeds of Faith , ' off Paybac 's debut album , The Biggest Tree .
On it , Paybac describes his relationship with the elements of the Nigerian society that concern him and how those things drove him to depression .
To highlight that , a part of the hook reads , " Young Naija n***a , I been rocking she 'll toes I got 3 stripes that 's Adidas .
"  Lupita Nyong'o is the Oscar-winning Kenyan actor who is a star of Hollywood .
Often , she is used as the standard of African beauty while she 's also subject to the hypocrisy of black appreciation across American media .
On this song , Paybac ties into that idea of hypocrisy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black star like Lupita .
"  The beat itself feels like a Noah ' 40 ' Shebib emo/R&amp;B beat .
Oh and , Barelyanyhook ate this beat up .
His technique as he discusses a short version of discovering his talent at 17 to hitting trials in 2017 is gripping .
What a song to highlight one 's perilous relationship with society .
' Afroskanking ' is such a monster boom bap production that borrows from afrobeats elements .
I might be wrong , but I think the Ngozi Chimamanda-Adichie cut at the end of ' Lupita ' is material to this song .
On that sample , Adichie tells a French person that people in Africa consume her books .
Thereby , she asserts her blackness that 's often doubted .
In similar fashion , Paybac uses ' Afroskanking ' to assert and endorse - his relationship with his - blackness .
He 's boisterous and bullish about his optimism for success .
' Nana 's Interlude ' is a boom bap beat that premised on guitar chords of a 70 's rock song .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems a West African woman .
He asserts his love for her .
While the song is touching , CULT ! could have done without it .
' Masquerade ' is a bop , but in the overall spirit of CULT ! it sticks out even worse than ' Nana 's Interlude .
' The project could have done without it and its vanity is subtly wrongly placed .
' Waterside ' features Blaqbonez and it 's an ode to love .
Built on a sample of what seems cut from a classic folk song by Oliver De Coque or Victor Uwaifo , Paybac highlights his relationship to a faceless and nameless woman and tells her to meet him at the waterside .
Blaqbonez is the perfect rapper for this as they both ' wash ' their respective ' women .
'  ' A Tree Grew In Lagos ' is Paybac 's ode to ( his relationship ) with Lagos and his perspective of getting made through the pressures of Lagos .
Paybac is the tree that embraces the struggle and grew in Lagos through the warped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also points back to the title of Paybac 's debut album , The Biggest Tree - a diary of mental health struggles and personal struggles .
This time , Paybac is once again a tree .
While on The Biggest Tree , he was the tree ruminating through life , he ruminates through Lagos on ' The Tree Grew In Lagos .
'  ' Devil In The Detail ' documents Paybac 's love-hate relationship with meticulousness and finicky concepts .
Here , he speaks it through the female obsession for detail in make-up .
That beat switch on 01:04 is amazing - what a legato string .
' Money In All My Pockets ' examines Paybac 's relationship with money .
On the one hand , the song is Paybac 's dreams of a ideal life .
On the other hand , he also discusses the perils of chasing money blindly .
Nonetheless , the hook suggests that Paybac just wants the money and does n't care about the cliche that ' Money does n't buy happiness .
'  ' Nigerian Dream ' opens up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
She then urges people to also visit Nigeria .
In this social media era , The ' Nigerian Dream ' is traveling to a western colony and tweeting your love for Nigeria from that colony - but that was before coronavirus .
oops .
Here , Paybac 's ' Nigerian Dream ' is heavily informed by the subject of abject leadership and corruption the Nigeria is embroiled in .
The strife has informed Paybac 's ' Nigerian Dream ' to fulfill his vanity just one time on the streets of Lagos ; visit clubs and be a spendthrift in an opulent lifestyle .
All these opulence will be funded by one thing ; the famous ' government money ' or corruption or embezzlement or ' National chin-chin .
'  Paybac 's idea of the ' Nigerian Dream ' can then be defined as having access to the corridors of political power from where one can create a legacy of corruption by putting one 's family members in major offices .
That first verse is amazing .
And then , that Viveeyan does n't just sound like Beyonce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind .
She does n't just sing like Beyonce , she has the same voice type - mezzo soprano - with the same expansive vocal range and octaves .
She also carries that peculiar Beyonce ability to be vocally dramatic and pronounce words with aggressive emotion in a bid to enforce lyrics and get you invested .
No , it does n't stop there , she also has a Houston , Texas accent .
Well , this is n't weird at all .
If someone tells me Viveeyan also has 13 octaves , I 'm calling Shawn Corey Carter .
The song is picture-esque perfection as Paybac and Viveeyan describe peculiar situations of the artist son of a corrupt politician , calling the name of God through embezzlement , cheating while getting called , ' sharp ' and more .
' Activ8 ' was a single released pre-release of CULT ! To be honest , I think ' Activ8 ' should have been the album opener .
' Nigerian Dream ' would have been fantastic as an outro .
Nonetheless , ' Activ8 ' is topically expansive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Final Thoughts  First off , this is an amazing body of work that is near-flawless .
It 's also amazing that Paybac carries 15 tracks on his back with only two songs seeming out of place .
While that takes some marks off Paybac and his execution of this project , it does n't really matter in the grand scheme .
Paybac has done something special as a rapper and as an A&amp;R .
He should also look into being A&amp;R for other artists .
He hand-picked his features to perfection - they were all brilliant without overshadowing him .
It 's also credit to Paybac that it never seemed like his features carried him at any point .
Nonetheless , Barelyanyhook stands out .
That album art is also ridiculous .
Even though its symbolism seems too mired in excessive conceptualism , its aesthetic is something to behold .
What Paybac needs now is a budget for videos .
This guy is not slowing down anytime soon .
Chances are his next project will be even better .
But with all themes examined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listener is a question , ' As a Nigerian millennial living in Nigeria , what do you want to be ? ' I guess the answer is left to me and to the people who are watching me .
