CORONAVIRUS : Why we must keep our distance , and less common symptoms of Covid-19  CORONAVIRUS : Why we must keep our distance , how to access your GP and less common symptoms of Covid-19  FAMILY doctor Jane Wilcock from Harwood explains why physical distancing is important , how access to GP surgeries has changed ? -- and the less common symptoms of Covid-19 as she helps to keep people informed in a series of occasional articles for The Bolton News during the coronavirus pandemic .
WE are almost in " lockdown " but have liberty to walk , cycle , jog to keep fit once a day .
The Government has asked us ? -- with a few exceptions like essential workers to seeing vulnerable people for care ? -- to only go out to exercise , once a day and to shop less frequently .
We ramped up hygiene , washing hands on entry to house , car , public spaces , wiping down door handles etc visiting others less , we undertook some physical distancing but not enough  We should be social but physically distant , keep mentally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On March 13 , the UK had 10 coronavirus deaths , now there are more than 1,000 .
These are not people who would have died anyway , these are excess coronavirus- related deaths .
Coughs and sneezes travel at 10 -100mph and travel up to six foot , so spreading infection , and coronavirus also lives on surfaces for up to three days .
The explanation for physical distancing is that people are infectious before symptoms occur and afterwards for seven days .
Some people never get symptoms but still spread it about , most people get mild to moderate symptoms and 15 per cent need hospital admission , usually Covid-19 affecting their lungs .
An epidemiologist , Adam Kucharski states : " Early in the outbreak , each Covid-19 case infects 2 .
other people on average .
There is about five days between one infection and the next , so we expect one case to lead to 244 more cases in 30 days .
If we can halve transmission , so each case infects 1 .
others instead , we 'd expect four more cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected person , and as none of us is certain who is incubating the illness , we must all cut down physical contact .
Do n't be despondent if little happens initially , those in hospital are already ill and those who caught the virus today may not be admitted for three weeks , if they become ill , because they are incubating for up to two weeks .
We hope to see a reduction in acceleration of new cases in 2-3 weeks .
There are also people diagnosed with Covid-19 who are isolating indoors and not going to the shops at all for seven days so that they do not touch , sneeze or cough over other people and their items .
Their household members have to self- isolate for 14 days , as this is the time Covid-19 might incubate .
If they too get symptoms , they are isolating for a further seven days , even if that means they are isolating over the 14 days as new cases are infectious for seven days after symptoms start .
Information can be found on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Covid-19  How do you know if you have Covid-19 when not being tested ?  Be thoughtful as some people have a chronic cough , it is normal for them , and they have not got Covid-19 .
There are four definitions of Covid-19 in my view , but only two are official .
The first official definition is : those needing admission due to pneumonia or due to respiratory distress syndrome or due to severe influenza like illness ? -- fever of 37 .
? C or higher and at least one of acute onset : persistent cough , hoarseness , nasal discharge or congestion , shortness of breath , sore throat , wheezing , sneezing .
The second official group is : cases who can stay at home with new continuous cough and/or a high temperature .
They should self -isolate , also the household .
The NHS coronavirus site online discusses these symptoms .
In typical Covid-19 symptoms are : fever occurred in 88 per cent , dry cough in 68 per cent , cough with sputum ? -- mucus ? -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aching in 15 per cent , chills in 11 per cent .
The third group are people with no symptoms and we never know they had Covid -19 .
The fourth is a group of symptoms seen uncommonly but reported in the medical literature in people with Covid-19 .
This is not well publicised and my own advice is if anyone has these in this pandemic , that they self- isolate and do n't go shopping , their household too ( as above ) , to reduce possible Covid-19 transmission .
Symptoms are : lack or absence of sense of smell .
In South Korea 30 per cent of cases testing Covid-19 positive said lack of smell was their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases , and some people had no other symptoms .
Chest tightness or discomfort .
Nausea and/or diarrhoea ? -- also some reports of diarrhoea before cough and fever .
Covid-19 may cause eye symptoms , including dislike of the light , irritation , conjunctival redness and watery discharge .
Incidence of conjunctivitis is one to three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sore throat , fatigue , coughing blood , and rarely tonsil swelling , enlarged lymph nodes and rash .
It seems upper airways irritation may be a feature for some people .
From these symptoms it is clear a lot of viral symptoms might be Covid-19 , my view is to really get levels down in Bolton we should take all viral symptoms seriously and assume they are Covid-19 to prevent spread .
