Democrats have lined up behind Gov .
Roy Cooper 's 30-day stay-at-home order -- but so have many Republicans , signaling less of a partisan divide over the measure that will bring economic pain but that health officials say is necessary to save lives .
Republicans at various levels of elected office gave different opinions .
One reached by the Citizen Times said more COVID-19 research should be done before such an extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The 30-day order limits how people can move about with the basic message being to stay at home if at all possible .
In cases where the state order differs from local orders , the stricter one takes precedence , Cooper said .
That is true with parts of Buncombe County 's order , which includes more restrictions on real estate activity .
Tillis : ' difficult but correct decision '  At the federal level , GOP Sen Thom Tillis said residents need to " do our part " to protect people 's health and get through the crisis quickly by reducing chances of infection .
" I 've had discussions with Gov .
Cooper about the challenge of protecting both the physical and economic health of the state , and the governor made the difficult , but correct decision to issue a statewide stay-at-home order , " Tillis said in a March 27 statement .
He said the order allowed " essential industries " to continue to work and provided flexibility to businesses that are able maintain social distancing and implement other safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run against Cal Cunningham in the 2020 race for North Carolina US Senate .

)  WNC congressional candidates  Madison Cawthorn , one of two GOP primary runoff candidates for the US House 11th District , said the order may not have come soon enough .
" In my opinion , once we started understanding the data , I almost would have moved sooner , " said Cawthorn who has underlying medical conditions stemming from a car accident that left him in a wheelchair .
Madison Cawthorn ( Photo : Madison Cawthorn )  " I do n't think we should have a situation where we absolutely derail and destroy our economy , but at some point we have to realize that government 's number one duty is to protect the health and lives of citizens , " he said .
Cawthorn said he was n't worried about the death rate , which he said was recently reported by Henderson County hospital officials as below 1% -- though globally it is 4 .
Instead , Cawthorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by people needing other life-saving measures , such as someone suffering from a heart attack .
Lynda Bennett , who is running against Cawthorn in the runoff which was delayed until June 23 , did not return messages seeking comment .
On March 26 , Bennett tweeted a video of herself shooting what appears to be an assault-style weapon .
" Today I practiced social distancing while also exercising my 2nd Amendment rights , " she wrote .
The runoff winner will face Democrat Moe Davis in the Nov .
3 general election .
Davis in a Friday morning statement before the order was announced said he would be holding virtual town halls on Facebook live .
" We need everyone to stay at home as much as possible , practice social distancing when out and hunker down until it is safe to return to our normal lives , " he said .
Berger : not enough data  Criticizing the order was the highest-ranking Republican in the General Assembly , NC Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger .
Berger said more data should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses .
Specifically , Berger said there should be random testing to get a more exact sense of hospitalization and fatality rates .
" We owe it to the hundreds of thousands of newly unemployed North Carolinians to check the math , " Berger said in a March 27 statement .
" If the true data supports the most stringent measures , then presenting that data to the public will increase compliance and confidence in government .
If the data does not provide such support , then easing of current restrictions will be possible to do safely .
"  Edwards : time to put trust in officials  But a lower-ranking Republican member of the same chamber , Sen .
Chuck Edwards of Henderson County , disagreed .
Chuck Edwards ( Photo : Courtesy )  " I have contended throughout this crisis that this is a critical time for us to put our trust in the officials we have elected whether we agree with them or not , " said Edwards , who represents the 48th District , which was redrawn to include eastern Buncombe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward helping affected residents and businesses and " in formulating a plan as to how we can better help them once we get back into session .
"  Edwards ' general election opponent , Democrat Brian Caskey of Mills River , on March 27 tweeted a link to the governor 's announcement .
In other tweets he criticized Edwards ' opposition to adding more people to Medicaid , saying , " Expand .
Medicaid .
"  Local Democratic legislators  The three NC House members representing Buncombe , all Democrats , said climbing caseloads justified the order and that the governor sought to balance business interests .
Susan Fisher of the 114th District pointed to numbers that included the state adding at least 100 cases for four days .
John Ager in the 115th District noted the limited number of ventilators and hospital beds .
" It only takes one person to create a COVID-19 hot spot , as we have seen in other communities , " Ager said .

"  Many who will be shut down are upset , he said , including people who work in the wedding industry and who own short term vacation rentals .
