Canadian Doctor Rigs Ventilator to Treat Nine Patients Instead of Just One  As hospitals scramble to secure more ventilators , some doctors are getting creative in order to help their patients .
Such is the case with Canadian doctor Dr .
Alain Gauthier , an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital in Ontario .
So in ten minutes the evil genius who is one of our GP anaesthetists ( with a PhD in diaphragmatic mechanics ) increased our rural hospitals ventilator capacity from one to nine ! ! ! **26;8938;TOOLONG  Do-it-yourself  Gauthier , who has a Ph .
in respiratory mechanics , turned one hospital ventilator into a machine that can serve nine clients using do-it-yourself mechanics .
The process was so brilliant that some have even called him an " evil genius .
"  Gauthier was inspired by YouTube videos created by two Detroit doctors in 2006 , according to CBC News .
He said he created a complex ventilator to offer people the best chance at survival .
" At one point we may not have other options , " Gauthier told CBC News .
" The option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give that a chance .
"  The nine-person ventilator has now made headlines around the world after a colleague of Gauthier 's tweeted a picture of it .
" So in ten minutes the evil genius who is one of our GP anesthetists ( with a Ph .
in diaphragmatic mechanics ) increased our rural hospitals ' ventilator capacity from one to nine ! ! ! " he tweeted .
The tweet has garnered more than 71Klikes and has been retweeted 16Ktimes .
Even billionaire philanthropist Elon Musk seems to have been impressed by Gauthier 's efforts as he commented on the tweet that it was an " interesting thread .
" Musk even got into the logistics of the ventilator adding to his tweet that : " A single computer , pump &amp; pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients , but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care &amp; avoid cross-flow risk .
"  In these trying times where people are overwhelmed , it is nice to see medical staff taking such positive , creative initiatives .
