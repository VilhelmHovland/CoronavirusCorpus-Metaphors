Mudavadi cautions police on brutality  Amani National Congress ( ANC ) leader Musalia Mudavadi ( pictured ) has asked the police not to be brutal on Kenyans as they enforce curfew .
He said majority of citizens are already economically distressed and that any cruelty will break their hearts .
Mr Mudavadi said what Kenyans want in the wake of coronavirus pandemic is love and civility and not the brutality witnessed on the first day of the curfew last Friday .
" Enforcement of the curfew does not mean terror and brutality to the citizens .
Treat the citizenry with civility , " said Mudavadi .
He said police action could be counterproductive in ongoing efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 .
" The police have gone about it in the manner that is extremely inconsiderate and inhumane .
They give an impression they are dealing with a hostile population that must be cowed through brutal force .
It is useful to remind the Government that it is not at war with its citizens , " said Mudavadi .
