COVID Times : Saving children of a lesser god  Posted by Minhaj Adnan Published : March 29 , 2020 , 4:27 pm IST  Mohammed Wajihuddin  The current lockdown has begun unmasking many an ugly truth about India .
One of the truths is that pervasive poverty extenuated by loss of jobs and work may create a famine-like situation .
If you think I am sounding alarmist or forecasting doomsday , you only need to read about seven children eating grass with salt in Koiripur village in the Badagaon block of Varanasi district .
Belonging to the Mushar community , these children of a lesser god were forced to eat grass because their parents , brick kiln workers , have been rendered jobless and have no money to buy food .
If this is happening in Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's constituency , God knows what the poor elsewhere are facing .
As I read the heartbreaking story of the seven Mushar children in Varanasi district , my train of thoughts took me to my own village in Bihar .
Mushars populate a part of my village .
Deprivation stalks their dusty , drab hamlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and protruded bellies describe these children .
They just do n't have enough food to eat even in normal times .
Landless and hardly any savings to fall back on during hard times , these Mushars , poorest of the poor , are perennially debt-ridden .
I remember an incident that happened many years ago .
As my college had closed for a festival , I was vacationing in my village .
One day a special guest was visiting us and we were busy making arrangements to make him feel comfortable .
Outside my aangan ( courtyard ) , on the bank of an ancient pond was an old banyan tree .
The sun was setting in the western horizon and it was minutes before the dusk fell that I encountered an incident that gives me shivers even today .
saw a dark , thin figure standing under the banyan tree hesitating to come near me .
The first thing poverty attacks is your confidence .
The confidence to seek something from someone .
I am not talking about beggars who seek alms habitually .
I am talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to seek help .
I went nearer the thin , if mysterious , figure and recognized him that he was a member of the Mushar community from my village .
" Kya baat hai ( What 's it ) ? , " I asked .
" Zara side mein chaliye ( Please come aside ) , " he whispered .
Since there were guests around , self-respect stopped him from opening his mouth publicly .
" Teen din se mere bachche bhooke haiN .
Chachi se bolkar kutchch dilwa dijye ( My children are hungry for the last three days .
Please get something from aunty ) , " he said .
My father was not home and , by aunty , he meant my mother .
For a moment his words seemed like an arrow that hit and benumbed me .
Shaken to the bones , I took him immediately inside the courtyard hidden by an outhouse , to my mother .
He narrated the ordeal again .
" Pehle kyon nahiN aya ( why did n't you come earlier ? ) , " my mother who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went inside the storeroom and came out with few kilograms of flour , rice , pulses , potato and onion .
She asked him if he had edible oil and salt at home .
He said he had .
My mother told him to go home and ask his wife to cook food immediately and feed the children .
I saw tears in his eyes as he left .
I can understand how overwhelmed the Mushars must have felt when the District Magistrate of Varanasi reportedly arranged food for them .
Daily wage workers are the worst affected during the lockdown .
Thousands crammed trains which took them from metros to their hometowns and villages .
Hundreds are walking down the highways , trying to reach their destinations in the hope of beating hunger .
They worked in the metros as rickshaw drivers , cabbies , construction workers , maids , casual workers in factories and workshops .
Those who could n't leave the cities before the lockdown began are stuck , forced to survive on food being arranged by NGOs and civil society groups .
Thursday friend and fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called a couple of times , informing me about some boys in Kurla and some families in Nalasopara facing hardships .
One of the boys from Kurla said he worked with a company .
He used to eat lunch at the company 's canteen and dinner an eatery .
Now both the company and the eatery are shut .
His family is not here and he does n't know what to do .
He is just one of the thousands finding themselves at a loss .
The government says no one will be allowed to sleep hungry .
In the coming days the government 's claims will be tested .
Children are the most vulnerable in crisis situations .
Poverty-stricken , they just do n't know how to survive .
In my childhood I saw many Mushars of my village eating rats to fend off hunger .
The Mushar children would mostly accompany their mothers who went ransacking rat holes with sharp objects like khurpi , kudaal or spades .
The rats scurried till they were caught and killed .
The pangs of hunger made these Mushars forget if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children in Varanasi and elsewhere in the country have only improved upon their predecessors .
In these many decades , from eating rats , they have moved on to eating grass to keep hunger at bay .
Contrast these grass-eating children 's lot to lavish birthday parties and fat wedding receptions in cities like Mumbai .
The economic disparity is huge .
So is insensitivity of the rich .
Every time I attend a lavish wedding reception , I silently cry at the colossal wastage of food at a time when millions on this planet go hungry .
You may ask : " Why do I attend such ostentatious weddings if I ca n't stand the shameless display of wealth and criminal wastage of food ? " I attend out of courtesy .
If only the rich saved just a quarter of what they spend on weddings and birthdays , thousands of poor could have been fed properly .
Will these wealthy and prosperous among us also think about those Mushar children who were forced to eat grass next time they roll out lavish dinners to celebrate birthdays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a senior journalist , is associated with The Times of India , Mumbai .
