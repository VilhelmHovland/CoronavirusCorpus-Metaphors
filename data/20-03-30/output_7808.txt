Patients with atrial fibrillation who took oral anticoagulants alone after undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) had a lower rate of bleeding complications without an increased risk of clotting-related complications compared to patients who took antiplatelet medication in addition to oral anticoagulants , in a trial presented at the American College of Cardiology 's Annual Scientific Session Together with World Congress of Cardiology ( ACC .
TAVR , a procedure in which operators thread surgical equipment to the aorta through an artery to replace a patient 's malfunctioning valve with an artificial one , has become increasingly popular as a less invasive alternative to open heart valve replacement surgery .
An estimated one-third of patients undergoing TAVR have atrial fibrillation , a heart rhythm disorder that leads to a high risk of stroke .
The new study , antiplatelet therapy for Patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ( POPular-TAVI ) , is the first randomized trial designed to assess the safety of oral anticoagulants alone as compared to using antiplatelet drugs alongside oral anticoagulants for managing TAVR complication risks in these patients .
Anticoagulants work by interfering with proteins involved in the formation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of blood cell , from clumping together .
" The rates of complications for TAVR -- especially complications related to bleeding -- remain high , " said Vincent Nijenhuis , MD , from the cardiology department at St .
Antonius Hospital in Nieuwegein , Netherlands , and the study 's lead author .
" This study helps physicians to better understand the risks of adding antiplatelet therapy to oral anticoagulants -- namely , that doing so leads to more bleeding without reducing the rate of ischemic events .
I think once physicians are aware of this , they will not treat patients undergoing TAVR so aggressively , leading to better outcomes .
"  Both bleeding and clotting-related complications ( such as stroke and heart attack ) can be life threatening , especially among patients undergoing TAVR , who are generally older , have multiple comorbid conditions and are frailer than those who undergo open heart valve replacement .
In focusing on patients with atrial fibrillation , who typically take oral anticoagulants for many years , the trial sought to address how best to balance the risk of clots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy .
Researchers enrolled 313 patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing TAVR at 17 sites in four European countries .
Half were assigned to take oral anticoagulants alone and half took the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel for three months after TAVR in addition to oral anticoagulants .
At 12 months , those taking oral anticoagulants alone were significantly less likely to suffer bleeding complications than those who took oral anticoagulants plus clopidogrel , meeting the trial 's prespecified composite primary endpoint .
The first component of the composite primary endpoint , all bleeding as assessed with the Valve Academic Research Consortium ( VARC ) definition , occurred in 21 .
of those receiving only oral anticoagulants and 34 .
of those receiving clopidogrel .
The second component , non-procedural bleeding as assessed with the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ( BARC ) criteria , occurred in 21 .
of those receiving only oral anticoagulants and 34% of those receiving clopidogrel .
This reflects a 43% reduction in the rate of bleeding complications among those taking oral anticoagulants alone .
In a secondary analysis , patients taking oral anticoagulants alone did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial 's prespecified secondary endpoint for non-inferiority .
A composite of cardiovascular death , ischemic stroke and heart attack occurred in 13 .
of those receiving only oral anticoagulants and 17 .
of those receiving clopidogrel , while a composite of those outcomes plus non-procedural bleeding occurred in 31 .
of patients receiving only oral anticoagulants and 45 .
of patients receiving clopidogrel .
" The results suggest it would be beneficial to not give clopidogrel -- in fact , it 's safer because it does not lead to as many bleeding events , " Nijenhuis said .
The study is limited by its open label design , which means patients and doctors were aware of which patients had been randomized to receive clopidogrel versus oral anticoagulants alone , although outcomes were adjudicated by independent evaluators who were blinded to patients ' treatment status .
In addition , Nijenhuis said that the study 's findings are only applicable to patients with atrial fibrillation .
The researchers are assessing antiplatelet management in patients without atrial fibrillation in a separate cohort of the ongoing POPular TAVI study .
Other studies are underway to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticoagulants .
