Sometimes it 's the simple stuff that gets you right in the chest - like a letter from a nine-year-old , maybe .
He did n't mess about with people , Willem Hartmans went straight to the top - he addressed the coronavirus pandemic itself .
His editorial in the Illawarra Mercury was part lament , part ' we can do this ' rally cry .
The sentence that resonated most was this : I feel unlucky , annoyed , frustrated and upset that our country is now in this situation .
Willem has pretty much hit the nail on the hard for a large swathe of the population , one way or another .
You would think passengers on the two Sydney to Albury flights , which have now emerged as having passengers onboard who have since tested posted to coronavirus , would feel a bit frustrated .
As would the good people of Wagga who are in the same situation .
Also probably rating high on the frustration-o-meter right now would have to be doctors .
How could they witness the gross acts of blatant disregard and not be frustrated .
Instead , graceful acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we 've heard for some time now : STAY .
HOME .
Three words , like all good slogans .
How hard is it ? Well , that 's another matter - if you do n't necessarily fit the nuclear family bill , it could indeed be quite troublesome - but that 's for another time .
Bendigo doctors sent a stern message after more positive test results in the city .
So , too , did medical staff in the Illawarra while one NSW health district 's medical controller said : " This is real .
Some people do n't recognise it 's real .
Maybe younger people are n't getting as affected as much , but this is extremely serious for people with chronic diseases and also older people .
" South Australia 's Kangaroo Island , so keen to see mainlanders a few weeks back after rising to its knees from tragic summer fires , has taken charge of its own messaging : " If you love Kangaroo Island , do n't come " .
Another place the government 's keen for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may be a remote hope .
The PM this afternoon revealed a $130 billion " job keeper " allowance over the next six months aimed at keeping about six million Australians in jobs .
Stick with us in the blog tonight as that and more is explained in-depth .

Another place the government 's keen for you to avoid is Centrelink - though , sadly , for many that may be a remote hope .
