The ? 3 .
cost of the package of income and business supports the Government announced last week was estimated on the " worst-case " basis of 800,000 people having lost or on the verge of losing their jobs by late June , the Irish Examiner understands .
The estimate is much higher than the 500,000 many economists anticipated will be effectively unemployed or on Government income supports by the summer as the Covid-19 emergency takes its toll on jobs and the economy .
Analysts believe that the bulk of the 147,000 who work in construction will effectively be laid off and apply for the Covid-19 income-support measures after the Government on Friday night announced additional restrictions including the closure of most building sites .
The Irish Examiner has also learnt that the Government still believes that the ? 3 .
price tag for the 12-week support programme will be sufficient to meet its costs because it maintains that the 800,000 lost jobs is a worst-case scenario and will not be exceeded .
It also expects that a significant number of the people who may initially qualify for a payment of ? 410 a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to a lower payment as they lose their jobs .
The Government has also acknowledged that the ? 3 .
scheme for the 12 weeks will more than likely be extended with a similar or revised scheme at the end of the 12-week period , as many countries prepare for some sort of restrictions or lockdowns to last through the summer .
The Economic and Social Research Institute in the first authoritative study of the Covid-19 crisis on the Irish economy published last week , before the weekend restrictions on building sites were announced , estimated unemployment would peak at 18% by early summer .
Economists expect that the cost of the supports will be higher than ? 3 .
over the 12 weeks .
Jim Power estimated that based on similar schemes in the UK , the US , and Germany , the exchequer will need to spend ? 30bn in a full year .
He said that spending on that scale will be justified to save many employers and to ensure there will be jobs when the crisis eventually passes .
" Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not unique to Ireland ; most governments around the world will face significant deficits .
I would turn the question on its head .
We can not afford not to spend on the supports , " Mr Power said .
He said the costs of the business supports will quickly increase as more people lose their jobs .
He said most of the 147,000 workers employed in construction will join the Government schemes , and many of the hundreds of thousands working in retail and accommodation and food services will also be effectively unemployed .
Neil Gibson , chief economist at accountants EY Ireland , said that a prolonged shutdown lasting more than 12 weeks is increasingly a realistic outcome .
EY estimates a peak of 675,000 people will lose their jobs in Ireland , an estimate that does not include the construction workers who will lose their jobs .
In the North , he estimates 257,000 people will lose their jobs under a prolonged lockdown .
