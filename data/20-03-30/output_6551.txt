Though Hellboy creator Mike Mignola had previously said he was stepping away from drawing comics after completing Hellboy in Hell , and even wrapped up the grand plot of the entire " Mignola-Verse " with BPRD : The Devil You Know last year , he ca n't keep stop from going back to big red .
Since the severity of the coronavirus pandemic became amplified in mid-March Mignola has found himself drawing sketches every day from home as his " quarantine therapy " including images of Hellboy himself and now he 's using them for a good cause .
Mignola has announced that he 'll be releasing his daily sketches on Ebay  " So I 've pretty much become addicted to doing these little sketches--Nice to find that after all these years sitting at the table drawing is still pretty much my favorite thing , " Mignola wrote on Twitter .
" During these times we have decided to start an eBay auction of my sketches with 100% of the proceeds going to Chef Jos ? Andr ? s ' World Central Kitchen .
"  During the coronavirus pandemic , World Central Kitchen is distributing fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding healthcare workers and putting restaurants back to work by offering them a new stream of revenue to prepare and deliver these same meals .
Mignola previously teased earlier this year that he was interested in getting back into drawing comics after his brief stoppage from the practice , teasing new comics in his long-running series that will pick up after the fan-favorites in Hellboy in Hell and Koshchei the Deathless .
" Lately , I 've started to get the itch to try actually drawing comics again , " Mignola told Inverse back in February .
" I did n't think that would happen .
I sort of thought I was done with that so we 'll just have to wait and see how that goes .
