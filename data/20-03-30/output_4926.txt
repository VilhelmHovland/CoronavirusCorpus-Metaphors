Surviving COVID-19 : Struggles of Homeless India  Mampi Mondal , 19 , grew up in the streets of Kolkata .
Now she has a five-month-old son who might also be resigned to a life on the streets .
Mondal has heard of the Coronavirus but is n't clear on the details .
She has not heard the Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's speech either on the 21 day lockdown .
On relaying the contents of his speech , she retorts , " Do we have a home ? "  She resides under a flyover in the busy Gariahat area of Kolkata .
After breastfeeding her son , she hands him over to her mother Sabita Sardar and leaves for work .
Cradling the baby , Sardar slowly sits down on a piece of cardboard .
" Mampi found a cleaning job in two local shops .
Her salary will pay for the baby 's needs , " she says .
They are among the 1 .
million homeless people in India according to the Census 2011 .
Unofficial figures put the figure at 3 million .
In response to a petition filed by the People 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked the states to provide one homeless shelter for every 100,000 people in 62 major cities of India .
Since then , the highest court of the country has intervened on behalf of the homeless and called out the states and centre for their apathy in providing shelters to the poverty-stricken in urban areas , despite availability of sufficient funds .
In 2018 , the Supreme Court issued a non-binding directive that empty government buildings be converted to shelters for the homeless following the deaths of 44 homeless people in Delhi winter .
Shelters for the Homeless : Too Far , Too Few  The shelters offered a warm place to spend the night in the brutal cold which envelop much of North India .
Amidst the Coronavirus pandemic , the shelters are theoretically the best place to seek refuge for the homeless .
In the real world , however , things do n't work as expected .
None of the homeless under the Gariahat flyover I spoke to seemed eager to move into a shelter .
Sometime back , Sardar and her family were visited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Kalighat area 2 kilometers away .
These people find opportunities in Gariahat to make a few bucks by working odd jobs , collecting and selling paper and plastic and sometimes by begging .
Abhijit Sonawane has been treating the destitute on the streets of Pune since 2015 .
According to him , homeless poor people are most vulnerable to Coronavirus .
Paramjeet Kaur , Director , Ashray Adhikar Abhiyan ( AAA ) agrees .
No one has reached out yet to educate them on the preventive measures of Coronavirus .
Moreover , the advisory issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on social distancing to prevent the spread of the disease is n't practically possible for these people .
Life on the streets is hard , and women especially are vulnerable to abuse .
They find safety in numbers .
At night , the women huddle close to each other .
Inside The Shelters  The homeless population of West Bengal is more than 100,000 whereas the total sanctioned strength in the 41 shelters across the state is 1737 .
In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters across 11 districts can accommodate 18,000 .
Close to 50,000 are homeless in Delhi according to the Census 2011 .
Emmanuel Ministries runs seven homeless shelters in Kolkata .
Six of them are located in a four-story building in the Beleghata locality adjacent to a Leprosy Vagrant 's Home .
Most of the inmates go out to work during the day .
The six shelters can accommodate 200 people .
Tapan Pathak , 49 , works eight-hour shifts as security at a private building .
He has been staying in this shelter for the past six months .
" I can not afford to pay rent with my meagre salary , " he says .
The room is packed with beds pushing against each other .
Social isolation is not a viable alternative at the shelters as the physical distance between them is not adequate .
If somebody is infected and not exhibiting symptoms they can pass it on to others as well .
Meanwhile , the NGOs do what they can to minimize the threat .
AAA has been conducting awareness sessions with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handles multiple times throughout the day , " she adds .
The staff has been given sanitizers , wet wipes , and masks .
Following a rigorous cleanliness routine requires an abundance of disinfectant supplies .
" We asked the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board to provide us with sanitation materials because so far we have brought these through individual donations .
Soon we might need more of it .
"  The Department of Women &amp; Child Development and Social Welfare , Government of West Bengal , has advised Emmanuel Ministriesto educate those in the shelter and take every precaution as per the guidelines .
" We have utilised material given by the government on cleanliness , how they should wash their hands and whenever they enter the home , we have kept sanitisers or soaps right at the entrance .
They enter the hall after cleaning themselves .
"  The Delhi government has woken up to the risk of infection among shelter seekers .
They have asked the Shelter Management Agencies ( SMA ) to voluntarily lock down the homeless shelters .
On Saturday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Improvement Board ( DUSIB ) , the nodal agency for operation and management of Night Shelter in the city of Delhi , asking her to provide food for the homeless at the shelter .
She immediately set out to arrange for rations , cooking utensils , stove , and an LPG cylinder .
The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has allocated 10 percent of the total funding of the shelters for providing free food to the elderly and infirm .
The rest have to make their own arrangements .
The others leave in the morning to earn enough to feed themselves and return to the shelter .
On Sunday , the government of West Bengal announced lockdown measures across the state till March 31 .
Emmanuel Ministries staff has pooled in money to feed all the shelter inmates for the next week .
Some staff are staying back .
As the shelters continue to admit the homeless , they are keeping a close watch on the inmates .
" We are monitoring them .
Even if it 's the common cold , we wo n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says George .
George rues the predicament posed by the Coronavirus .
If they keep the shelters open , they might be endangering the health of the staff .
If they shut down the shelters , where will the poor go ?  " When we say , ' isolate ' , all of us have homes where we can isolate ourselves .
These people do n't have a home .
Their ' home ' is the roadside , " he says .
