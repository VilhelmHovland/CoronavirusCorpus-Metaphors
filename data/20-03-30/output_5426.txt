Six things to remember when laying off your staff  Laying people off is a gut-wrenching experience for anyone who likes their staff .
And that 's most small and medium business owners .
You work right alongside them every day , and they do a good job .
You know all about their three adorable children .
You know they 've been having difficulty making ends meet lately since they bought a modest house .
And now you have to tell them it 's over , at least for the medium-term .
It 's not like big companies , where the CFO just goes ' reduce headcount by 12 .
' and the victims get batch-whacked by generic HR operatives .
When you 're laying people off , it 's obviously a brutal blow for them .
It 's hideous for you .
If you have to do it , it 's essential to do it right .
Particularly when it 's in large numbers and chaotic circumstances like now .
Your people will remember March 2020 forever  The actions you take through these few weeks will be remembered for decades .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment revenue stops ? OK , I get it if you 're a restaurant or bar that runs on razor-thin margins , as soon as you close there 's no cash left .
But is laying people off instantly really necessary for every business ?  Our view is that our single most important thing is supporting our people .
It 's taken us a decade to assemble an incredible team who will generally walk over broken glass* for us and our clients .
Here 's what we 're doing .
Two weeks ago , as the curtain started to come down on the events business , we worked out how much cash and receivables we had left .
It was really important to let people know where they stood as quickly as possible , rather than leave them hanging on the industry rumour mill .
We had all-staff meetings in each state and gave everyone a detailed picture of how dire the situation was , and what we planned to do .
The week we held the meetings , we hit zero revenue as the government banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  That plan is to keep most of them on shorter working weeks until we do n't have the cash to do that .
How long we can do this is shifting fast from day to day .
There 's some government stimulus cash coming .
But we are also owed a lot of money that we 're now unlikely to see until 2021 .
If those debtors survive .
We need to keep enough cash left to put the business in cold-storage for a while , so we 're able to get it started again when the all-clear whistle blows .
But wherever it ends up , we did the best we could for our people and I 'm guessing they will remember that for a while .
Here are six tips to get through this as best as you can .
Tell them in person  Word on the street is there were a lot of layoffs via bulk email last week , well before the indoor gathering restrictions came in .
If you have hundreds of casual staff , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an SME , be fucking ashamed if you did that .
You need to tell them together .
Hold a well-spaced meeting in the carpark .
Or do it on Zoom .
So they at least feel together when it happens .
Rather than alone and unwanted , going home to be isolated with a family already consumed with a full catalogue of anxieties , feeling like they 've let everyone down .
Emails are cold .
Does n't matter how well written or how thoroughly checked by HR .
They get misinterpreted in ways you can not imagine , because you 're not there to answer questions .
They will leave simmering resentment and ill-will that you could have dealt with verbally on the spot .
A year from now , you 'll be trying to recruit good people and they will not apply because they heard you were a fire-by-emailer in 2020 .
Stick to what affects them  Get to the point quickly .
Do they have a job or not ?  You 're wasting your breath with anything longer than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner monologue going :  Do I still have a job ?  Do I still have a job ?  Do I still have a job ?  Do I still have a job ?  All your material about future company strategy and emerging from this stronger or whatever is irrelevant .
They want to know the facts and figures of how much money they 'll be getting to survive on , what happens to their leave and other entitlements , and if you plan to keep the business going post-virus .
They 'll want to know how long the virus shutdown will last , and the correct answer is you do n't know .
So say that .
Do n't speculate about stuff you read on Facebook .
It 's really unproductive in what is the most unpredictable business environment in our lifetimes .
Different people take bad news in different ways  Some people just seem to be cool with it .
Others might scream and shout .
It 's all OK , people will respond in ways that have been hard-wired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failing to take it badly .
This is a time to be patient , and work through people 's concerns in the way that suits them best .
Let the meeting be over when they say it 's over .
Know what you 're actually doing  Are you standing people down ? Making them redundant ? Putting them on paid leave then unpaid leave ? Do you know the difference ?  You need to know so you can tell them the real story .
Right now , businesses are furiously calculating if their staff on two or three days a week are better off on the JobSeeker payment .
This blog is not the place for detailed analysis of awards and workplace law , because I 'm not a pro in those areas and it 's too many words .
However , you should set aside an hour or two to read the Fair Work Australia COVID-19 updates .
We 've spent a lot of time in there in the last week ; most of what you need is in there .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days .
There 's a handy redundancy calculator here .
If you 're letting someone go , you need to know the exact numbers of what they get .
Especially if you 're thinking about redundancies , they can be expensive enough to kill your business on the spot .
The approach you take obviously depends on what your long-term goals are .
Are you closing down the business , never to return , or hoping to regroup post-virus ?  Staff layoffs are a bit of a regulatory free-for-all at the moment .
Trading while insolvent is now legal for the next six months at least , and it 's hard to see minor Fair Work infringements being heavily punished in the coronavirus aftermath .
But it 's still important to do the right thing by your people wherever you can .
Openness works  As you can probably tell if you 're a regular reader here , we 're very open about our business .
That whole ' need-to-know ' secretive management style just feels like an outdated 1990s vibe to us .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do all-staff presentations with figures on how the business is going , because if it 's going well , they 're going well .
And if it 's going badly , it 's vital they know the score .
So when you 're doing meetings like the ones we 've just had , you 're presenting hard facts rather than just executive platitudes like ' well-positioned ' which mean nothing .
It 's pretty striking to see people come from other businesses and just go : wow you guys just tell us everything .
It really does motivate them to do a better job .
And the ones who pay attention will be better future managers , because they 've seen hands-on how any given operational change has a direct effect on next month 's P&amp;L .
Or did , and will again one day when we can start trading again .
Look after yourself  If you feel the pain of laying people off , you finish the hard conversations absolutely drained , plus guilty that you 're still here with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does more damage to your system than you think .
Try not to work all through the weekend right afterwards .
This virus caper is a long game and you need to be intact for everyone else who depends on you .
( I am particularly poor at resting or relaxing after extended high stress , but I genuinely believe this hypocritical tip to be correct .
)  Until next week , comrades .
Best of luck out there .
*Metaphorical broken glass , we 're very safety-conscious here .
**A job but perhaps not in the fully paid sense .
Plenty of business owners I know are working five days for a one-day salary now .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses .
So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ? .
