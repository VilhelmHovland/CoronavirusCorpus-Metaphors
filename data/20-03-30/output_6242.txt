Coronavirus : New York state passes grim milestone of 1,200 deaths  The number of deaths in New York state due to the coronavirus outbreak has crossed the 1,200 mark , with Governor Andrew Cuomo warning that thousands of people will pass away before the crisis ends in America 's current COVID-19 epicentre .
With 253 fatalities on Monday , the state recorded its largest one-day increase in number of deaths since the coronavirus outbreak .
" That 's a lot of loss , that 's a lot of pain , that 's a lot of tears , that 's a lot of grief that people all across this state are feeling , " the governor said at a briefing .
Cuomo , earlier on Sunday , said the deaths due to the massive virus outbreak in the state sharply rose from 728 to 965 in just one day .
The number of coronavirus deaths in New York city increased by 161 from Saturday night to Sunday morning , pushing the statewide total to over 1,000 fatalities , The New York Times said .
Cuomo warned that things will get worse as the state could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't see how you look at those numbers and conclude anything less than thousands of people will pass away .
Because remember who it 's attacking , it 's attacking the vulnerable , ( with ) underlying illness among other .
And I do n't see how you get past that curve without seeing thousands of people pass away .
I hope it 's wrong .
" And we will continue to see the number of deaths increase .
In terms of most impacted states , again , New York is still number one , " he said .
The grim figure of over 1,200 deaths comes less than a month after the first known coronavirus infection was identified in the state on March 1 .
A healthcare worker , who had recently returned from Iran , was the first confirmed coronavirus case in the state .
Just days later , a lawyer in the New York suburb of New Rochelle tested positive for the virus and was at the centre of one of the earliest US coronavirus clusters .
Cuomo announced that the lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US stood at 143,025 and 2,509 people have died in the country , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .
Over 7,000 additional coronavirus cases in New York state were recorded , bringing the statewide total to 59,513 , Cuomo said .
New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the number of coronavirus cases in the city alone were 32,308 , " a stunning number .
And we have lost , and this is so painful , 678 of our fellow New Yorkers .
That means in the last 24 hours from this morning to Saturday morning , we lost 161 more people in this city .
People of all walks of life , every kind of New Yorker " .
The mayor said New York City remains the epicenter of the crisis nationally .
" A day will come when I will be able to no longer use that word and we all look forward to that word .
But right now , we are the epicenter and the numbers are staggering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are currently hospitalised in New York state , including 2,000 ICU patients .
Cuomo also pointed out that 3,500 patients have been discharged .
" We know - nobody really points to these numbers but this is good news .
846 people came out of hospitals yesterday , discharged after being treated for COVID-19 , " he said .
He told reporters that initially the hospitalisation rate in the state was doubling every two days , then it doubled every three days , then every four days .
" Now it 's doubling every six days .
So you have almost a dichotomy : The doubling rate is slowing , and that is good news but the number of cases are still going up .
So you 're still going up towards an apex , but the rate of the doubling is slowing , which is good news .
The governor said in an e-mail that " tragically we have now lost almost a thousand New Yorkers to this vicious virus .
We mourn them deeply .
Every life lost is one too many .
We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help us by staying home and slowing the spread " .
Cuomo said he is extending the " New York on PAUSE " policy until April 15 , which means non-essential businesses and schools will continue to stay closed .
Gatherings of any size for any reason remain cancelled and all New Yorkers continue to be directed to practice social distancing -- by staying home and keeping six feet of space from others when in public .
The state will re-evaluate after this additional two-week period .
He said " the increase on the trajectory of cases continues to climb " .
Cuomo notes as the state tries to reduce the spread of the virus , it is also preparing for the worst .
He said a 1,000 bed temporary hospital is opening at the sprawling Javits convention center on Monday , and other temporary hospitals are being built .
" It is a travel advisory to be implemented by the states .
In essence , it 's nothing that we have n't been doing .
Non-essential people should stay at home .
So it 's totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President did because it affirms what we 've been doing .
It also affirms what New Jersey and Connecticut have been doing , " he added .
