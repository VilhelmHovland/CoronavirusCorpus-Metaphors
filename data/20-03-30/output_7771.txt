Supervisor of elections now working to find voters who cast ballots at the Mandarin location  JACKSONVILLE , Fla .
-- A poll worker at a Mandarin precinct during the March 17 primary election has been diagnosed with coronavirus , according to the Duval County Supervisor of Elections .
The individual worked at Precinct 608 , located at Freedom Christian Fellowship Church at 3423 Loretto Road .
The individual started experiencing symptoms six days after working at the polling site , was tested on March 27 and received a positive test result on Monday .
Due to privacy concerns , the name of the poll worker with the virus will not be disclosed .
News4Jax asked Duval County Supervisor of Elections Mike Hogan if the poll worker did anything wrong .
Hogan said no .
Hogan said it 's vital to alert all the voters and it 's difficult so he 's asking for help getting the word out .
He also does not blame the poll worker , who did n't show any symptoms until six days after the election .
Then they reached out that there were sick and updated that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , they alerted us when they learned of the positive test on the same day , " Hogan said .
The biggest problem for Hogan 's office is how to get the word out immediately to those voters in the precinct in Mandarin .
Since most voters do n't offer their contact info beyond their address , the only way they can alert them is through the mail .
Last week Broward County announced two workers at polls in Hollywood tested positive .
That elections office notified 16 other poll workers who were in close contact with the infected workers .
The supervisor of elections advises the 360 voters who went to this location on March 17 that they should also take appropriate steps and seek the counsel of a medical advisor .
If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever , dry cough or difficulty breathing , please self-isolate and contact a medical provider immediately .
