" Our priority is the health of our workforce , and we will therefore reduce activity on some of our scientific missions , especially on interplanetary spacecraft , which currently require the highest number of personnel on site , " Rolf Densing , ESA 's director of operations , said in a statement .
" Our priority is the health of our workforce .
"  Of the missions going dark , two include vehicles orbiting Mars -- the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express -- which both take measurements of the Red Planet 's atmosphere .
A mission called Cluster is also going quiet , which includes four spacecraft currently in orbit around Earth that study how particles coming from the Sun interact with our planet 's magnetic field .
ESA 's Solar Orbiter mission , which just launched in February to study the Sun 's poles , is also powering down its instruments .
Most ESA employees have been working from home for the last two weeks , but the agency decided to heighten restrictions at its European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt , Germany , after an employee working there tested positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe have also implemented tighter restrictions across the continent , which factored into ESA 's decision .
The agency maintains that these spacecraft are all in stable orbits and will be safe while in these new configurations .
" These probes are designed to safely sustain long periods with limited or no interaction with ground , required for instance for the periods they spend behind the Sun as seen from Earth , when no radio contact is possible for weeks , " Densing adds .
" We are confident that with very limited and infrequent interactions with ground control the missions can safely remain in that operation mode for months , should the duration of the coronavirus mitigation measures require it .
"  In the meantime , the personnel who are still allowed at mission control will focus on maintaining ESA 's other spacecraft throughout the Solar System , including the BepiColombo vehicle on its way to Mercury .
That spacecraft is scheduled to do a flyby of Earth in April , and ESA says only a " very small number of engineers " will be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure to maintain proper social distancing while in mission control .
These are n't the first European space missions to experience delays and setbacks because of the novel coronavirus pandemic .
The launch of ESA 's Rosalind Franklin Mars rover was delayed to 2022 , in part because of travel restrictions that are being imposed throughout Europe .
And launches out of Europe 's primary spaceport in French Guiana have been suspended indefinitely until the pandemic subsides .
