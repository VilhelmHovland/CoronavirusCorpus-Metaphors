TopLine  FULL SPEED AHEAD ? -- Wisconsin 's presidential primary and spring elections are still on for April 7 .
for now .
Top officials in the state have been resistant to postpone the election because of those general elections , but lawsuits are piling up in the state in an attempt to postpone or otherwise change the election .
There are five -- count ' em , five -- major lawsuits in the state about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it : " Buckle up because there will be a lot of court action over Wisconsin 's election in the coming days .
" ( He 's worth a follow on Twitter .
) Let 's run through the cases , quickly : The DNC and the state party filed a suit seeking to expand absentee voting in the state through a variety of means , along with extending registration .
As a result of that suit , the online voter registration deadline was extended until today , with a ruling pending on other aspects .
Souls to the Polls filed a lawsuit looking to delay the election , and the League of Women Voters ' state branch filed another suit to let voters vote absentee without a witness .
Those three cases were all filed in U .
District Court and consolidated over the weekend .
A suit from the city of Green Bay also looking to delay the election and move it to mail-in voting was tossed , with a federal court ruling that the city did not have the grounds to sue ( here 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The state Republican Party also filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court saying Dane and Milwaukee County clerks have been illegally circumventing the state 's voter IDs law by giving direction to voters on how to bypass the requirement for absentee balloting due to the virus ( here 's more on that directive from the clerks from WPR 's Laurel White ) .
How people will actually vote is also a big question mark .
Officials in the state have strongly encouraged voters to request absentee ballots -- something that , as of Friday , more than 767,000 voters have done .
But Democratic Gov .
Tony Evers went a step further on Friday , calling on the GOP-controlled state legislature to pass a bill to send an absentee ballot to every voter .
However , Evers ' request came just eleven days before Election Day , would make actually getting ballots printed and sent to every voter impossible at worst and merely herculean at best .
The state legislature balked at the request : " Even he knows that 's not logistically feasible , " state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Acting like this is doable is a hoax .
" The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 's Molly Beck reported that the state 's election commission administrator said the state would n't have enough ballots to send to every voter .
All this to say is that there 's a lot of uncertainty circling around next week 's Wisconsin primary .
We 'll keep you up-to-date with the latest in Score .
Presidential Big Board  POSTPONED PRIMARIES -- Goodbye , Acela Primary ; we hardly knew thee .
New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo announced on Saturday that the state would postpone its primary , originally scheduled until April 28 , until June 23 ( the day of the other , non-presidential primaries in the state ) , POLITICO New York 's Bill Mahoney reported .
April 28 was originally the second-biggest day on the calendar , with a lot of Northeastern states voting that day .
Now , every single one of them has moved their primaries .
Of note : This moves the New York primary until after the DNC deadline for states to host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contests by June 9 ( hence all the states moving to June 2 ) , so New York -- along with Louisiana and Kentucky , which also moved after that date -- could theoretically suffer steep delegate penalties .
The DNC 's Rules and Bylaws committee will have the final say here on what happens .
-- Pennsylvania on Friday formally postponed its primaries , both presidential and other offices , until June 2 after Gov .
Tom Wolf signed legislation to that effect that passed out of the state legislature early last week .

But , as Campaign Pro chief Steve Shepard notes , " Biden 's lead is far from secure , given the tumultuous situation gripping the country and Trump 's 2016 advantage in the Electoral College .
"  PLAYING NICE -- Biden 's campaign is working to win over liberal voters .

Down the Ballot  KEEPING COUNT -- The Census Bureau announced it was suspending field operations through April 15 because of the coronavirus , a challenge for the hugely important decennial count of every person in the country .

The Kentucky Republican drew bipartisan rage after he forced a majority of his House colleagues to travel back to D .
to vote on the coronavirus relief package on Friday .
House leadership was able to beat Massie 's attempt to force a roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infuriated just about everybody -- including Trump .

She backed challengers Marie Newman and Jessica Cisneros -- two candidates who had the support of a wide swath of Democrats and not just progressive insurgent groups -- but has n't endorsed anyone else .
And some other liberals are taking notice .
" Ocasio-Cortez 's shift coincides with turnover among top aides in her congressional office -- replacing some outspoken radicals with more traditional political professionals -- along with a broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalition after his failure to significantly do so in the presidential primary , " POLITICO 's Alex Thompson and Hollywrote .

"  WAY DOWN BALLOT -- The Republican State Leadership Committee announced it will run TV ads backing Wisconsin state Supreme Court Justice Daniel Kelly ahead of his reelection bid on April 7 .
