Soldiers ' President and CEO , Carmine Stumpo , answers questions at a recent hospital town hall with over 180 staff attending by video conference .
Contributed photo  An open letter to the community from the president and CEO of Orillia 's Soldiers ' Memorial Hospital :  We have all have heard of the term social or physical distancing as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic .
It is the single most important way we can prevent transmission of the virus by avoiding crowded places and keeping two metres distance from others .
How are we doing as a community ? Not good enough .
The next few weeks will be critical in defining the impact of COVID-19 and we all need to get very serious about making social distancing a priority at work and at home .
At Orillia Soldiers ' Memorial Hospital ( OSMH ) , we have taken extraordinary measures to support social distancing including cancellation of elective surgeries and cancellation of all visitors with very few exceptions to reduce hospital traffic .
Healthcare is all about working as a team , and our teams are quickly finding new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our tightest spaces .
Within a week , virtual meetings through videoconferencing and virtual care have become the norm .
It is uncomfortable and awkward at first , but needs to be done .
We are also creating capacity within the hospital for what we believe will be an overwhelming number of patients with COVID-19 requiring our care .
We are tripling our capacity to treat patients with severe difficulty breathing , who require a machine for assistance .
With fewer elective surgeries booked , we have been able to repurpose an entire inpatient unit where we will cohort hospitalized patients with COVID-19 to limit exposure to other patients and staff .
We are working very hard at securing the necessary supplies to ensure we can care for patients and our staff throughout this crisis .
Masks , goggles/face shields and gowns are some of the most basic , essential tools we have .
There is a world-wide shortage of these items which has prompted us to consider new and creative ways to source or manufacture these items .
I want to let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparations .
The entire OSMH team is singularly focused on COVID-19 related activities , all day , every day .
I am afraid it may not be enough .
The success of OSMH will be defined by the collective efforts of this community to " flatten the curve " , essentially spreading out the total burden of COVID-19 illness over a longer period of time .
Social distancing allows the health-care community to respond to patient needs at a slower pace .
COVID-19 is sprinting towards us and we need to slow it down to a jog .
Everyone can do their part by making social distancing a priority .
Our Prime Minister has been clear : " Enough is enough , go home and stay home .
"  Our Premier has taken unprecedented steps to close all non-essential businesses .
