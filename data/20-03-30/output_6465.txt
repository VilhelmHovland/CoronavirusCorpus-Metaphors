MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY  " 2019 was a transformational year for Pivot .
We successfully managed through volume changes with our two major customers , returning to overall revenue growth in Q4 , 2019 .
The increase in revenue was achieved by driving sizeable revenue growth of 6% from non-major customers .
In addition , during the quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $27 million , generating significant cash for the business and strengthening our balance sheet , " said Kevin Shank , CEO .
" Further , we entered into an agreement with Intel designating Pivot as a non-exclusive preferred system integrator and channel partner for Smart Edge based solutions .
As a result , Pivot retains the ability to sell , deploy , and manage Smart Edge solutions going forward .
Looking at the entire year , Pivot continued to grow stronger as gross profit dollars grew , gross margin percentage increased , expenses declined , and overall adjusted earnings were significantly higher , " added Mr .
Shank .
" Adjusted EBITDA was up 56 .
to $7 .
million in the fourth quarter , while diluted EPS came in at $0 .
, which includes the gain on sale of the Smart Edge assets , " said David Toews , Chief Financial Officer .
" The sale of Smart Edge generated a cash infusion which strengthened the Company 's balance sheet , allowing Pivot to continue focusing on our capital allocation priorities .
As part of the Company 's integration initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business units through a merger .
This allows us to centralize several functional areas , which we expect will generate cost reductions , while improving controls and creating efficiencies .
"  The Company introduced a new non-GAAP measure called Adjusted Debt .
Adjusted Debt is defined as current liabilities , plus long-term other financial liabilities , less lease obligations and current assets .
The Company believes Adjusted Debt normalizes the impact of changes in working capital and therefore it is a more relevant indicator of the Company 's net debt position .
" Our Adjusted Debt was $56 .
million at December 31 , 2019 compared to $77 .
million for 2018 .
This represents a 28% improvement in this important metric year over year .
The combination of this reduced Adjusted Debt with our improved Adjusted EBITDA improved , Pivot 's Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2 .
in 2019 from 5 .
in 2018 , " added Mr .
Toews .

FOURTH QUARTER AND 2019 RESULTS SUMMARY  Fourth quarter 2019 revenues were $307 .
million , a 1 .
increase from the comparative period .
This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in product sales , and growth from the Company 's non-major customers which increased from $241 .
million in Q4 2018 to $254 .
million in Q4 2019 , an increase of 5 .
Total revenue of $1 .
billion for 2019 decreased $155 .
million compared to 2018 .

million in 2019 .
Partially offsetting this decline was an increase in non-major customers from $962 .

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 and $79 .
million for the full year , down from $25 .
million in Q4 2018 and $89 .

2019  2018  Adjusted Debt1 to Adjusted EBITDA1  2 .

The improvement in both of these key metrics in 2019 was due to the higher Adjusted EBITDA and margin generated from operations , as well as the proceeds from the sale of Smart Edge .
NON-GAAP MEASURES  The Company uses certain non-GAAP measures to evaluate its performance , defined below .
These terms do not have any standardized meaning prescribed within IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers .
Such measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS such as net income ( loss ) .
Adjusted EBITDA  " Adjusted EBITDA " is defined as gross profit less selling , general and administrative expenses , and corresponds to income ( loss ) before income taxes , depreciation and amortization , finance expense , change in fair value of liabilities , and other expense ( income ) .
Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's operating performance as it excludes certain items that are either non-cash expenses , items that can not be influenced by management in the short term , and items that do not impact core operating performance , demonstrating the Company 's ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund working capital needs , service outstanding debt and fund future capital expenditures .
Adjusted EBITDA is used by some investors and analysts for the purposes of valuing an issuer .
The intent of Adjusted EBITDA is to provide additional useful information to investors and analysts and is also used by management as an internal performance measurement .
Reconciliations of " income ( loss ) before income taxes " to " Adjusted EBITDA " are provided under the headings " SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OPERATING RESULTS " .
Adjusted Debt  " Adjusted Debt " is defined as current liabilities , plus long-term other financial liabilities , less lease obligations and current assets .
The Company 's working capital is financed by an asset-based lending facility .
The amount drawn on the facility generally fluctuates inversely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of the changes in working capital and therefore , management believes that it is a more relevant indicator of the Company 's net debt position .
Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA  " Adjusted Debt to Adjusted EBITDA " is defined as Adjusted Debt divided by the trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA .
The Company uses this measure as an indication of its liquidity position and its ability to generate income to service the debt excluding the impacts of working capital fluctuations .
