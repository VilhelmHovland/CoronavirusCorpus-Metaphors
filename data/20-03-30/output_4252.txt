South Africa now requires a special export permit for anyone who wants to sell face masks or alcohol-based hand sanitiser abroad -- and has also banned the foreign sale of hydroxychloroquine , a drug the United States just started using to treat Covid-19 .
The export ban is in place until South Africa lifts its state of disaster around the disease .
Under the new rules , in force since Friday , exporters will require special clearance to move any of the drug out of South Africa .
The same applies to human albumin , used to replace blood in trauma cases , and a short list of standard vaccinations for diseases that include polio , rotavirus , and tetanus .
With global supply lines slowed or disrupted -- and the chance that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may receive priority manufacture once available , the Covid-19 crisis has caused concern about the long-term availability of such vaccines .
