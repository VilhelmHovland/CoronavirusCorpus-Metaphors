" Speaking to TNIE Editor G S Vasu , the Hyderabad-based gastroenterologist , who was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2016 and currently serves as the Chairman of the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology , takes us through why the coronavirus may not withstand the scorching heat of the Indian summer .
" Regarding temperature , there was and there is still a lot of controversy , but recently , a paper was published by MIT , USA , where they have shown the heat-sensitivity of this virus .
Above 32 degrees , this virus is unable to exist for long periods , " he says .
In India , most places average well above 32 C in April .
" But indoors , where we are living in air-conditioning or where the temperature levels are cool , the problem still persists , " he adds .
The MIT research is peer-reviewed , which means it has not been completely published but the initial reviews look positive .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not parallel that of Italy or China because its strain is different .
" In the Indian virus , there is a single mutation occurring in the spike protein of the genome .
Spike protein is the area that attaches to the human cell .
Only one small mutation has happened , making that attachment weak .
" That is why he believes the current 21-day lockdown should not extend .
" In my opinion , we should limit it to three weeks .
It looks like , to some extent , the community spread is being controlled , " he opines .
