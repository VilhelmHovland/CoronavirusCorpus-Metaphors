Practical considerations : the impact of COVID-19 on the holding of annual general meetings  The steps recommended by the Government to combat the effects of the Coronavirus ( " COVID-19 " ) , in particular the recommendation to avoid large public gatherings , are likely to have an impact on the format of annual general meetings for UK-incorporated listed companies .
UK-incorporated listed companies are permitted to hold " hybrid " or " virtual " annual general meetings .
This checklist identifies the key points a UK-incorporated listed company should take into account when considering whether to hold a hybrid or virtual meeting and the options available in the event that such a format of meeting is not possible or feasible .
Maintain status-quo or hold a hybrid/virtual meeting ?  Consider what form of meeting is appropriate , do you want to :  combine a main , physical meeting with a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convene a meeting with no physical location , held purely electronically via an online meeting tool ( virtual meeting ) ; or  maintain the status-quo and continue to hold only a physical meeting if historically you have a low shareholder attendance at your AGM .
Consider views of investor groups on any decision taken .
Investor groups have generally not supported virtual meetings to date although they do tend to support hybrid meetings .
Review articles to check whether a hybrid or virtual meeting is permitted .
It is recommended that a hybrid or virtual meeting is only held where expressly permitted by the articles .
Considerations if your articles permit hybrid or virtual meetings  If you have not held a hybrid or virtual meeting before , consideration will need to be given to what changes need to be made to your usual form of notice of general meeting , in particular :  the notice should contain clear instructions on how to access , speak and vote at the meeting ;  the notice should make it clear that all votes will be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a helpline number to the registrar or technology provider , or both , for those shareholders who need assistance with using the technology before or at the meeting .
If a company has already issued its AGM notice for a physical-only meeting but its articles allow for a hybrid AGM , it can change to a hybrid AGM .
An announcement should be made to reflect this decision and the website should be updated .
In terms of the conduct and running of a hybrid or virtual meeting , it will be necessary to also consider the following :  how technology will be used to support the meeting .
Engage an appropriate AGM technology solutions provider to ensure that the AGM satisfies legal requirements and provides a user-friendly experience to the company and shareholders ;  ensure the technology provider and registrar work together to develop and implement an appropriate solution ;  whether a virtual meeting will exclude some of your shareholder base less familiar and with less access to technology ( e .
will the AGM be accessible from all common devices ) ;  whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  the " YouTube culture " and the reputational issues associated with a minor mishap being recorded and going viral ;  whether the cost of a video meeting is proportionate ;  what processes will be in place to ensure that technology is secure and effective and works seamlessly without interruption ;  how to ensure robust validation of shareholder entitlement to participate and vote ;  how Q&amp;A will be managed and what protocols will be put in place ; will questions need to be submitted in writing in advance of the meeting , through an online message board during the meeting , or both ;  who will review the questions to facilitate board response ? Transparency in the shareholder question process is critical to maintain investor confidence ;  that there is sufficient time for testing of technology and rehearsals ;  that in the case of a hybrid meeting there must be a quorum of shareholders physically present at the meeting ; and  consulting with key shareholders to ensure they are comfortable with what is proposed ( particularly in the case of virtual meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit a hybrid or virtual meeting  Delay of AGM  If the notice for an AGM has not already been circulated , the company may wish to change the usual date on which it holds the AGM to later in the year .
Postponement of AGM  If the company has issued its AGM notice , it can postpone its AGM if its articles permit it to do so .
The articles will govern the process for postponing the AGM , but there is no statutory minimum notice period for rearranged meetings .
As a matter of good practice , ICSA recommend that a company should provide 21 clear days ' notice .
Call and adjourn AGM  In the event that a notice of an AGM has already been circulated and a meeting called , and it is not possible to postpone or cancel the meeting , the meeting will need to be held .
It may be possible to open the meeting ( with the minimum quorum ) and then adjourn it to a later date .
Each company will need to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public company , a meeting can be adjourned as follows :  if there is not a sufficient quorum within half an hour of when the meeting is due to start , the chairman must adjourn the meeting ;  if there is sufficient quorum , the chairman can adjourn the meeting :  with the consent of the meeting ; or  if it appears to the chairman of the meeting that ( i ) an adjournment is necessary to protect the safety of any person attending the meeting or ( ii ) to ensure that the business of the meeting is conducted in an orderly manner .
In our view , in light of the advice issued by the Government in relation to large public gatherings , a chairman could legitimately adjourn a meeting on the basis that it is necessary to protect the safety of a person attending .
However , you should be aware that given that this provision is largely untested in the current circumstances , there is a risk of a challenge that it has been postponed for an " improper purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the adjournment , you will need to consider when the meeting will be adjourned to .
When adjourning the meeting , the Chairman will need to specify the time and place for the adjourned meeting .
If the adjourned meeting is to take place more than 14 days after the original meeting , notices must be resent .
The following should be considered in the event of a delay , postponement or adjournment :  whether the proposed revised date for holding the AGM satisfies the legal requirement for when the AGM must be held .
Ordinarily an AGM must be held within 6 months of the end of the financial year and the annual report and accounts must be laid before the AGM2 ;  whether the market expects you to hold your AGM on a particular date .
If so , you may need to issue a revised financial calendar and update the market with the new provisional AGM date ;  whether there are any time limits included in resolutions granted at the last AGM which will expire before the AGM is held ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 15 months after the AGM in which they are granted ) :  when will your authority to allot shares expire ?  when will your authority to disapply statutory pre-emption rights expire ?  when will your authority to buy-back shares expire ?  when will your authority to make political donations expire ?  liaise with the AGM venue to determine whether it has availability for dates later in the year and consider back-up venues if the preferred venue is not available ;  consider declaring an interim dividend in lieu of a final dividend , if the company 's final dividend would not be paid on the expected date and the timing of the dividend is important .
Adapt basis on which AGM is held  In the event that it is not possible to hold a hybrid or virtual meeting , you may wish to take action to : ( i ) ensure the company is in a position to hold such meetings next year ; and ( ii ) limit the number of people attending the AGM this year .
To achieve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which directly or indirectly prohibit the holding of meetings entirely in electronic form ( e .
any requirement that the notice states the place of a general meeting ) ;  include a provision which expressly permits a hybrid or virtual AGM ;  change the quorum requirements to make it clear that members attending a meeting who are not in the same location as each other may form part of the quorum ;  provide that all votes will be taken on a poll ( electronic participation will generally mean the votes must be taken on a poll ) ;  add language which addresses the impact and powers of adjournment in the event of technological breakdown or other impediments to participation .
In particular , articles should give the chair the discretion to adjourn the meeting as the chair would not be able to put a resolution to adjourn to the shareholders .
A resolution to adopt the revised articles will need to be included in the notice of meeting at the upcoming AGM .
Encourage proxy submissions  You may wish to make an RIS announcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote rather than attend the meeting in person .
Live stream the AGM  Consider setting up a live-stream or phone link for the AGM .
We recommend giving consideration as to how to message the fact that shareholders watching the live-stream will not be formally participating in the non-hybrid/non-virtual meeting ( in terms of quorum or voting ) .
They might not fully understand the distinction between viewing the meeting and actually formally participating .
