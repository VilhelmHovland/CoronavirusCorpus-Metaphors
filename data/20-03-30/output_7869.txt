( WTVA ) -- Some local restaurants are feeding workers at North Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo as those health care professionals face a fight with the coronavirus .
On Monday , people at the hospital unloaded 50 meals from Sweet Peppers Deli for some of those health care professionals .
Another 50 meals would come later in the day for another shift .
" So many of the staff -- whether they are doctors , nurses , environmental services -- can not leave the specified floors to go and eat anywhere , much less leave the premises , " said Jessica Vaughan with NMMC Volunteer Services .
Other restaurants providing meals this week include Chick-fil-A and the Eat With Us group .
