Beyond that , users also have the option of swiping a chat from right to left in order to automatically send it off to an Archived Chats folder .
Telegram explains that an archived chat that receives a new notification will automatically be moved from the archive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user wants to avoid this , they can mute the chat to keep it permanently in the archive list .
In addition to the new folders feature , Telegram 's big update also brings unlimited pins for pinning as many chats as you want .
This makes it easier to get straight to the conversations you most often participate in .
The features continue from there .
The update brings access to channel stats for channels that have more than 1,000 subscribers , voice recording animations for Android users , the addition of more animated emoji ( ones related to being sick with coronavirus ) , and desktop support for syncing Chat Folders to a new folder sidebar .
