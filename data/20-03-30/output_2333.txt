Stories of self-isolated couples fighting have already been monetized for a good cause , but I do n't particularly care about bean-bloated partners bickering about headphone etiquette .
What I wanted to see on my TL was a flood of posts about queers in isolation falling in love with and/or shagging their roommates .
Ask and ye shall receive : My DMs were overrun with stories of queer lust , gay yearning , and microwavable entrees .
Below is a sampling of some of the dozens of messages I received about roommates finding queer sex and romance under the same roof .
Most names have been changed for privacy reasons .
Interviews have been edited for length and clarity .
Carol , S ? o Paulo , Brazil  I live alone in a one-bedroom apartment in S ? o Paulo , yet somehow found myself isolated at home with a friend that I did n't know all that well before .
We 've known each other for years through mutual friends , but had never been close .
Before Brazil started taking this pandemic seriously , she asked if she could crash with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment .
Since I was about to leave for a week-long work trip , I told her to take the keys and make herself at home .
The day I came back from my trip , we decided to self-isolate together , even though there was only one bed for us to share .
I could n't sleep , so I sat up .
When she asked me what was wrong , I asked , " Any chance you might want to , uh , add benefits to this friendship ? "  She just said , " Thank god , " and that was that .
Now , we 're co-parenting her dog , sharing a bed , cooking together , and planning our entire quarantine together .
All our friends say we accidentally got married ? It 's an extreme quarantine version of the infamous lesbian U-Haul .
We have n't put a label on what we have -- but it sure is a very intense friends with benefits situation .
We 're sexually involved , but it 's not necessarily romantic .
We 're thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus , I got a dog in the deal .
Jess , 21 , Florida  LISTEN IF U POST ABOUT THIS I WAN NA STAY ANON , BUT ME AND MY ROOMMATE BOTH TRANS GIRLS B CUDDLIN AND FUCKIN A LOT AND THAT 'S ALL I GOT TA SAY LMAO  When VICE followed up , that was not all she had to say .
We spent every day together , even before we were roommates .
We 've been best friends for a while now ! We became roommates because our leases were up at the same time .
While isolating together , we were growing a li'l more touchy with each other , and , like , sharing blankets .
The day we started hooking up , we were watching YouTube on the couch and snuggling .
I was laying on her chest ( being a bit of a tease ) , and I looked up at her , and we started making out .
Then she spanked me a little with a toy I had left out in the living room , one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom , going AT IT .
Two goths , one apartment .
what do you expect , LMAO .
Also , she 's VERY dom , and I 'm a baby , so our hooking up was inevitable if we 're locked up together .
Kris , 21 , Boulder , CO  I had a girlfriend when my not-straight roommate and I got drunk the first day of quarantine and my roommate told me she liked me .
Not long after , she wrote me a two-page love letter confessing her deep love for me ( she actually brought it to my work before I had to stop working ) .
My favorite quote from the letter is , " Every moment we share makes my body tingly inside .
I want an intimate , deep bond , but I do n't want it with just anyone .
I want it with you .
" I literally read it on repeat in my head .
She came home and I wanted to show her that I felt the same way .
so we had sex from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been having literally the best sex ever .
Our straight roommate hates us -- she yelled at us after she found out that we were having sex and now she does n't talk to us , and , for the time being , is living with her dad .
I broke up with my girlfriend , and my roommate took me on a quarantine date .
She made dinner and set up a picnic in our apartment living room with candles .
Then the city relit the Flagstaff star ( a star-shaped light display on the mountains in Boulder ) .
We drove there and walked up to it , and she asked me to be her girlfriend .
I said yes .
Annie , 20 , Michigan  I 've been basically in love with my roommate for the past six months , and now that we 're in quarantine , we 've been drunk-talking over boxed wine and frozen taquitos until 6 or 7 a .
when the sun comes up .
I 've been playing my guitar for her , and LAST NIGHT SHE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITH HER .
When I tell you it 's been a dream !  When I woke up today , we were texting even though we were in rooms next to each other .
I 've been knitting a lot in quarantine , and she wants me to teach her how .
We kissed again , and she told me she 's had a thing for me since I moved in !  Francesca , 24 , London  My flatmate and I were already openly queer , but spending more and more time together was a powder keg .
We 've lived together since September ( we live in student accommodation , so it was fully random ) and , apparently , we 've both had small crushes on each other .
We had been at the Last Party of the year , which was the last gathering our classmates would have , since the rest of classes were cancelled .
We both wanted to leave early since we do n't love staying up late .
We were sitting together on the bus and , suddenly , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said something like , " Oh , time for bed ! "  She said , " Or you can come hang out ! "  We laid down on her bed , facing each other , talking and holding hands again for a long time .
An hour and a half later , we were almost falling asleep so we agreed it was time for bed .
We stood up , and I said , " Welp ! Guess I should go ! " and made no move to actually do so .
She said , " Are you sure ? "  We went back and forth like this for what felt like a really long time , interspersed with pauses where we just stared at each other .
Eventually , she said , " Can I at least have a hug ? " and I obliged .
After a bit , we pulled apart , I looked down and she 's looking up at me , and then -- of course ! -- we kissed .
It was great .
From there , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together .
We really do n't get sick of each other even when spending days at a time together , which isolation has proved .
Aubrey , 22 , Grand Junction , CO  My roommate and I have always known we were attracted to each other ; I was actually once the third with her and her ex-husband .
They 're divorced now , and I live with her in a small apartment with our two dogs .
We call ourselves " partners , " but in a best friend way .
I was OK with us being friends ; she 's always loved me better than anyone else has ever been able to , so even just being her friend is a delight .
She is the most incredible woman .
She has crazy curly hair and she 's super short and wears glasses .
She 's really smart and loves so wonderfully .
She hates to do dishes , but that 's really her only flaw as a living partner .
She used to be a florist , so sometimes she 'll just surprise me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she 's been getting annoyed at him a lot lately .
One night last week , we were watching Grace and Frankie together , like we do every night , when she kissed me and said " I think the problem with her boyfriend is that he is n't you .
" It was AMAZING .
We ended up sleeping together while Grace and Frankie was still playing .
She had to work early , so we went to bed after , and I guessed we 'd talk more about it that night .
She ended things with her boyfriend , and when I came home from work the next day , she had cleaned the house , made me a bouquet , and cooked fajitas .
We 're looking at houses we want to move into in May now .
