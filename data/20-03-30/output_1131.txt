A Dundee University graduate , who cared for Fife-born Motor Neurone Disease campaigner Gordon Aikman for the last two years of his life , has told how she is " terrified " the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the collapse of small care at home companies .
Andrea Ramsey , 47 , who runs her own small home care business in Edinburgh , told The Courier she is scared that if she or any of her 40 staff become infected with Covid-19 or have to ' self-isolate ' , there might be consequences for those they look after and contribute to increased pressures on the NHS .
With more than 800,000 people across the UK reliant on home visits , the social care system helps keep pressure off the NHS .
But she fears the system could go beyond breaking point if carers in the community ca n't do their jobs and clients , who she and her colleagues try to keep out of hospital , have nowhere else to go .
Andrea Ramsey  " I just want people to recognise that what we are doing is saving people -- especially now -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated with an MA in Arts and Social Sciences from Dundee University in 1995 .
" What I 'm scared of going forward is see if we go into a client 's home , and they are not well -- sometimes they have to get hospitalised : are you telling me people are going to go into hospital now for a urine infection ?  " Every bed is going to be really precious in the hospitals -- who are they going to prioritise ? "  Most of Andrea 's clients are elderly vulnerable people in their own home -- some with dementia -- who need washed , dressed , given medication , fed and put to bed .
But she also has many younger clients including three clients with MS , two with Huntingtons , and two with MND .
One such person she got to know well was Kirkcaldy-raised Gordon Aikman who was diagnosed with the degenerative and terminal neurological condition MND before dying a few years ago aged 31 .
He was 28 when Andrea started looking after him .

Andrea , who is currently working more than 50 hours per week , said it 's " not a glamorous job " and not that well paid .
But her staff are " 100% committed " and while praising Scottish Care and her local authority for their support , she says it 's time greater recognition was given by government to the role they and others play -- just months after workers were being described as " low skilled " during the Brexit debate .

" I think we 've often been ignored .
" I think now times are changing and I think people realise what an integral part we play .
" We are working our fingers to the bone .
