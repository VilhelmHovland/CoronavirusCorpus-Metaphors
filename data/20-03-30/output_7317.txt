Chicopee towing company , Interstate Towing Inc .
, has reversed a policy that initially involved billing tow customers $237 .
for decontamination of the company 's trucks and drivers as a precaution against the coronavirus .
The charge appeared on the bills of at least three customers over a 48-hour period before the company waived the fee citing " a revelation of compassion .
"  " It was a policy that was in effect from March 23 to the 25 , " said Owner of Interstate Towing Inc .
Jeremy Procon .
" We got a hold of it once we realized this is n't right .
"  The $237 .
price tag was for the light-duty hourly costs of towing and the downtime for the cleaning .
This amount did n't include the drivers ' hourly rates .
" That did not go to an insurance company and no one has paid that , " said Procon .
" It was completely wiped out .
"  Procon said that multiple people have to enter his towing vehicles when they break down or crash their cars .
Drivers come into contact with a variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which brings risk to not only his employees but also their families when they go back home .
Every time a customer enters one of the Interstate towing trucks , the employee will have to be sent home to shower and change their clothes before returning to work to reduce the risk of infection .
" What 's that going to cost you , bleach ? " said a customer that wants to stay anonymous .
" What does bleach cost , a couple of bucks ? "  The costs , according to Procon , are for taking the truck out of action for an hour and cleaning inside and out .
Only then it will be put back on the road .
" The original fees associated with this process were to go to the employees subjecting themselves to this risk , " said Procon .
" However , Interstate will absorb all costs associated in decontamination .
