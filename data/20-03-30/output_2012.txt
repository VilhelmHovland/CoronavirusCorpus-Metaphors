It is Day 8 of the Movement Control Order and we have just received news that the government has decided to extend the order for another 2 weeks .
Other than that , we also know that there is a shortage of face masks nationwide and this has affected our frontliners .
In a video that has gone viral on Facebook , a kind-hearted man was seen giving out his stash of masks and sanitiser to our abang-abang polis who have been working tirelessly to ensure everyone stays home .
In the video , we can hear the man asking the officer if he has enough masks , to which the officer says they are facing a shortage .
The kind man also gave them 3 bottles of hand sanitiser for their use ! Before he leaves , he tells them that it is very dangerous out there and asks them to take care and stay safe !  In another post as well , we see a man telling the tale of how he saw 10 police officers and a soldier but only 1 of them was wearing a mask despite all of them being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the brave law enforcers instead .
He said the reason for him to do that was quite simple , it 's because ,  " SAYA ANAK MALAYSIA .
"  We would like to thank all these kind-hearted people for making sure our frontliners are protected .
Thank you !  Meanwhile , as informed citizens , we should abide by the Movement Control Order and practice social distancing religiously ! If you are unclear about the order then you can call the hotline @ 03-88882010 .
