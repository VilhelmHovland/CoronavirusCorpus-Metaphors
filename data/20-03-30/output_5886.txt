Let down by absence of foresight  A migrant worker along with his family walks along the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway , following the coronavirus lockdown , in Palghar , Monday , March 30 , 2020 .
PTI  India 's version of the Long March has been unfolding over the past few days with migrants , underfed , uncared for and desperate to reach home , taking the road .
Some have perished in the course of these arduous journeys : a man died in Agra , out of exhaustion , before he could reach home .
The Centre 's instruction to states to halt the march of migrants , although necessary to contain the risk of infection , is likely to exacerbate their sufferings .
Some of the agony could have been avoided had the Centre , in consultation with states , put in place a robust mechanism to help this vulnerable constituency .
Instead , the interventions were , as is often the case with India 's poor , marked by confusion and ad-hocism .
Measures to ease the plight of migrants -- transportation , food and money -- or to uphold their dignity -- a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though some states attempted to alleviate the crisis .
The absence of foresight in policy is also reflected in some of the welfare measures that have been announced .
The Centre has directed states to ensure that wage labourers are not denied their payment but the absence of regulatory mechanisms -- a concrete database of migrant labourers remains elusive -- means that the benefits of such ' benevolence ' remain uncertain .
The direct cash transfers -- they are measly -- announced by the finance minister in her relief package would , similarly , be hampered by the State 's inability to identify the needy .
The challenges are manifold .
Migrants are unlikely to be rehabilitated in their native villages on account of the fear of contagion .
Most states have not done enough to dispel these anxieties with dedicated awareness campaigns .
Their return would cause structural implosions in the economy .
For instance , the agricultural cycle as well as the small and medium-sized enterprises could well be crippled by the disruptions in the labour economy .
Are there contingency plans to meet these challenges ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate health apparatus but also the hollowness of its welfare model .
The limitations of public welfarism at the time of a serious crisis threaten to undermine the moral contract that binds the Indian State to the citizens .
The prime minister has apologized -- scoring political points is irresistible -- for the hardship caused by the lockdown .
But can an apology be a balm for empty stomachs and bruised feet ? .
