The global leaders seem to have been left with nothing but unanimously conceding that the worst impact of the Novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic is yet to hit their territories but also remain adrift in devising a foolproof strategy to ward off the impending danger .
Even despite all its technological advancement and robust health system , the United States has yet been faltering in tackling the virus , and to date , nearly 2,500 people have already died of it in the US while further more than 135,000 patients remain battling with it .
With the death tally on the rise and the total number of Coronavirus-infected patients has amounted to over 142,700 in the United States , the US President Donald Trump has cautioned that by the end of the pandemic , 100,000 or more people in the Country would have lost their lives .

The huge queues of the migrants were extremely detrimental in efforts to curtail the spread of the Coronavirus in India wherein public gatherings had already been declared as tantamount to inviting the virus .
The move by the Indian government without a systematic and planned way also triggered resentment among the opposition and media .
The Indian National Congress leader Rahul Gandhi lambasted the ruling party , saying that the government had no contingency plan to cope with the situation .
Out of work &amp; facing an uncertain future , millions of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back home .
It 's shameful that we 've allowed any Indian citizen to be treated this way &amp; that the Govt had no contingency plans in place for this exodus .
**26;4370;TOOLONG  Though India has by now witnessed 1,071 Cases of Coronavirus and suffered 29 deaths but the Director of the Indian Center for Disease Dynamics Dr Rajini Vaidyanthan has warned that the Country can soon be dealing with a " tsunami " of Coronavirus Cases .
Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan said that if the same mathematical models applied in the US or UK are applied to India , the Country can have about 300 million Cases , of which about four to five million could be severe .
