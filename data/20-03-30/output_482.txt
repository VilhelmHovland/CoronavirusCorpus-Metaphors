The 10-day extension of BS 6 deadline granted by the Supreme Court due to the lockdown is unlikely to do " any good " to the automobile industry amid the coronavirus outbreak , a report said on Monday .
The existing emission norms or Bharat Stage ( BS ) 6 were to be replaced by new BS 6 regulations from April 1 .
However , the apex court on March 27 relaxed the March 31 deadline and allowed the sale of the unsold stock of BS 4 vehicles for 10 days after the expiry of the lockdown period , except in Delhi and the NCR .
" While the industry players were looking for a three-month extension ( till June 30 ) , the 10-day extension post the lockdown by the Supreme Court is not expected to do any good to the industry given the current situation due to Covid-19 ( the disease caused by coronavirus ) , " ratings agency CARE Ratings said in a report .
