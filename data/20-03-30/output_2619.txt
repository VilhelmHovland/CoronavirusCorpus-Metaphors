Grocery stores may be low on flour and yeast , but sourdough starter sellers are seeing huge increases in sales .
In November 2019 , a tweet from comedy writer Ellory Smith went viral .
" If someone you know is getting deeply into making bread from scratch they are deeply depressed I promise you , " Smith wrote , with a response of nearly 250,000 likes as of this writing .
Now , in our current state of collective isolation , anxiety , and sadness , Smith 's tweet reads like a prophecy .
People are n't just making any old bread , though .
If Twitter is any indication of what we 're all doing while we 're " working from home , " it would seem that everyone has suddenly picked up sourdough , a more intensive and attention-needing type of bread baking :  Sourdough gets its leavening from a starter , a mixture of flour and water that becomes tart , squishy , and bubbly as it grows natural yeast .
Like a pet , a starter -- which is a living organism -- must be " fed " regularly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also die ) .
Obtaining a starter often spurs a sourdough baking habit , a hobby with near-cult like devotion .
According to statistics provided to VICE by Reddit , the subreddit forum r/Sourdough , with 67,000 subscribers , has seen activity go up by over 170 percent since January 1 .
You can make a starter from scratch , sure .
But the process takes at least five days , according to King Arthur Flour , who recommends using all-purpose flour in addition to whole wheat or rye flours because the outside bran of whole grains has more nutrients and micro-organisms to kick off the growth of yeast .
That said , all of those things might be hard to come by at the moment .
Though many people have created sourdough starter by using portions of friends ' starters , popping by a friend 's house to grab a bit seems ill-advised during our time of social distancing .
The sudden rise of #stayhome sourdough bread baking prompts the question , then : Where is everyone getting their starter all of a sudden ?  In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sourdough starter because it was attached in small , individual bags to a telephone pole with a flyer stating that its name is " Godrick " and that he likes to be " kept warm and fed regularly .
" The flyer included a phone number to call if the starter ran out ; however , the person behind the giveaway told VICE that out of an abundance of caution regarding potential virus transmission , the free starter on the telephone pole is no longer .
Most people probably are n't grabbing bubbly , sour yeast from a telephone pole , though .
Baker Savannah Turley used to run sourdough workshops in New York before COVID-19 prompted restaurant closures that pushed her to move back to California .
Turley told VICE that she 's " definitely noticed more people baking since the shit hit the fan .
"  Turley is even sharing her starter .
" I have just started dehydrating my starter to mail around and have about 20 orders already , " she said .
Starter can be dehydrated for ease of shipping and a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its hydrated form .
" I had already sent mostly ready starter to a couple friends and will begin teaching Zoom classes next week by donation .
"  For those who do n't have a professional bread baker for a friend , however , Turley recommended asking local businesses , who might also be able to help out in the age of empty flour shelves .
" Local bakeries are also selling flour and will give starter away , " Turley said .
" I think almost everyone knows someone who knows someone who has a starter and it infinitely regenerates , so there is plenty to go around .
She Wolf Bakery regularly gives starter away .
I know C&amp;B in the East Village is doing the same .
"  At Leo , a sourdough-focused pizzeria in Brooklyn , co-owner Mike Fadem estimated " definitely over an 100% increase " in requests for sourdough starter in the past two weeks .
In the past , Fadem told VICE , it 's been more like one request per month , but they got at least 10 just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's roommate first created 10 years ago , and which Fadem has continued feeding ever since -- for two dollars , and they 're working on adding it to their delivery menu as well .
And of course , people are also seeking starters out online .
Comparing sales to last March , Chris Barton of the Etsy store ZOURDOUGHstarter told VICE in an email , " We 're currently running a 400 percent increase .
" Barton attributed this rise in interest to the fact that store-bought yeast has quickly sold out since stores do n't stock large quantities of it .
As a result , and alongside the realization that homemade bread is possible when you 're stuck in your house or apartment for weeks on end , Barton said , " People turned to the internet and found us .
"  According to Barton , Zourdough was " uniquely positioned to supply thousands of starter yeast packets worldwide .
" Having sold starter yeast online for 10 years , Zourdough had built up a large inventory of starter before the interest really hit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just four hours .
Despite that , Barton said that they had to " pull back a bit " on sales recently due to short supply .
" As of this Friday , we will release the bonds we put on our sales and let it fly .
I think we can keep production and shipping going 24-7 , " Barton said .
MomsSanFranSourdough , which sells starter on Etsy and on eBay , has also experienced an increase in sales , telling VICE in a message , " Sales picked up slightly when COVID first made it to the States , but when California went under the shelter-in-place order , sales skyrocketed .
Since then , as the other states followed California 's example , sales have continued to increase .
"  While it might seem self-sufficient and appealing to create your own starter , Barton still thinks there 's an upside to getting a more developed one : " You can make your own starter , but it will be weak and basically tasteless for about 5-7 years .
We sell verified OLD starters .
Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the home person activates it , they have what we have .
a good , active , sour , producing starter .
"  As the Washington Post wrote , it 's long been known that cooking and baking can help anxiety since it gives our antsy brains and bodies something to do .
That 's all the more relevant when all our hobbies outside the home are n't possible .
Throw in the fact that we 're all tethered to our devices and that our brains all want to follow suit with what everyone else is doing , and it 's no surprise that the cult of sourdough is taking over our Twitter feeds .
It might not be the worst hobby to start , though .
" It 's an absolutely insane time and I 'm just glad people are baking .
The rhythm of it definitely helps from going stir crazy , " Turley said .
" People just need a straightforward thing to do that will nourish and entertain them .
Luckily , sourdough does both those things .
