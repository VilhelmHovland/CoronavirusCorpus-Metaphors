By Huizhong Wu  BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Publishers of three U .
newspapers urged China on Tuesday to reverse the expulsion of a about a dozen of their journalists , calling the move " uniquely damaging and reckless " at a time when the world is sharing the burden of fighting the coronavirus .
China announced on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of the New York Times , Wall Street Journal and Washington Post , which were due to expire at the end of 2020 .
" We strongly urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force the Americans working for our news organizations to leave , " the publishers said .
" Perhaps more than any major news event in modern history , this moment underscores the urgent importance of both probing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of sharing the information .
"  China 's foreign ministry had not seen the letter , spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily media briefing on Tuesday , but he defended the expulsions , calling them " necessary countermeasures " that were entirely a response to " unjustifiable oppression " of Chinese media in the United States .
The expulsions were the latest escalation in a dispute over media freedom and access , which has seen Washington order four Chinese state media outlets to reduce their total staff in the United States to 100 from 160 .
The U .
journalists from the three newspapers have until Friday to hand in their press credentials and halt reporting , but will be able to stay a short period longer .
One of them said they had been told they could apply for a temporary visa to stay in the country for 7-10 days .
China and the United States are locked in an increasingly bitter rivalry that has extended to the coronavirus outbreak .
Last month , Washington demanded journalists from Chinese state media be registered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the " real sick man of Asia " .
Washington cited a " deepening crackdown " on independent reporting in China as the reason for its decision to reduce the number of Chinese state media journalists in the United States .
China 's Foreign Ministry has said its measures are " necessary " and " reciprocal " against " escalating discrimination and oppression against Chinese media " by Washington .
A recent report by the Foreign Correspondents ' Club of China found that 82% of foreign journalists surveyed said they had experienced interference , harassment or violence while reporting during 2019 .
