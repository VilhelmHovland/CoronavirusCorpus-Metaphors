Take this opportunity to build life skills in children , and let both partners share the workload .
Simple things like making bed , laying and clearing table before and after meals , hanging and picking up laundry can be taught to children  The last few days , the impact of corona virus is all over whatsapp messages , news and social media .
It is for sure a serious concern and the 21 day lock down is supposed to help us arrest the break out from reaching unmanageable levels .
Cognitively , while we all understand that this lockdown is required , emotionally and physically we are all facing challenges .
Let me articulate a few-  ? All organisations are transitioning to " work from home " I am using the word " transitioning " because while physically no one is going to work , everyone is getting used to the concept of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facilities an office provides .
Organsiations and leaderships are working on prioritising , communicating , tweaking business processes to make this work .
? Lock down has impacted access to domestic help .
So while employees are working from home , there is additional burden of household chores and childcare .
As one of my clients commented , " I do n't know if this is work from home or work for home " .
? There is fear of not getting regular supplies , staples , medicines .
? For some , staying indoors is translating into boredom .
? There is fear of financial crunch .
The stock market dip might have caused most people financial loss .
? There is insecurity of jobs , appraisals , increments and bonuses .
All the above are valid concerns , Yet , they are all out of our control .
And when something is out of control , we need to dig deep and bring out our resilience and positivity and turn the question on its head .
Instead of " How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do we use this opportunity ? " .
Because , rest assured , this time shall pass too , and when will we get an opportunity to stay home , spend time with family , and work at our own pace .
So here are some thoughts-  ? Yes , there is office work and domestic work to be taken care of .
Take this opportunity to build life skills in children , and let both partners share the work load .
Simple things like making the bed , laying and clearing the table before and after meals , hanging and picking up the laundry can be taught to children .
Parents can request for flexibility from managers to manage their domestic and official tasks .
? This is also an opportunity to drive gender neutrality in families .
Household chores are not just a ladies ' responsibility .
Rope in your partners .
Let children see their fathers pitching in .
? If time permits , do dabble in a hobby .
Painting , reading , gardening .
Enjoy the quiet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
You will miss it once you start office again .
? Exercise every day .
Walk inside your homes , gardening helps burn calories .
If you like dancing , put on some music and let the whole family dance .
30 minutes of activity in addition to household chores will help release endorphins and keep those spirits up !  ? If time permits , start an online course , learn some new skill you have always wanted to .
? Connect with family and friends you have not spoken to for a while .
Do Zoom calls , re-establish those lost connections .
? Nurture family bonds .
Replace binge watching with playing games .
Monopoly , scrabble , Taboo , Uno , Ludo , Life and so many more and such great tools for family fun and bonding .
? If you run your own business , it 's a great opportunity to revisit your business plans .
Research , read , learn and revise strategy to maintain business continuity in the upcoming economic environment .
? Yes , stock markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is alone in this .
Remember the 2008 crisis .
We recovered then , we will recover now as well .
? Help others- there are a set of people who might not be as privileged .
People providing basic services , cleaners , law enforcement force , medical fraternity .
Where possible and if possible , donate .
I am taking this opportunity as guilt free leave .
I read , write and work when I feel like .
I spend time with family .
I am rejuvenating .
And when this gets over , I will be ready to hit the ground running ! .
