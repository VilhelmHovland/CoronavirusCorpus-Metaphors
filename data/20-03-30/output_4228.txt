Most people woefully underestimate the anger and desperation you get from millions of addicts and people who enjoy their vices when you take it away from them for no good reason , then ask them to deal with it while sitting at home with nothing but work ( if they 're lucky ) to keep them busy ( and no , it is not a good reason , I do n't care about your f0kken smart-ass comments , go have a jog or cycle around the block , oh wait , you ca n't do that either ) .

Downing Street says shops can sell what they like after police urged some retailers to restrict sales of Easter eggs during the coronavirus outbreak .
The Prime Minister 's official spokesperson said officers should use " discretion " when applying new emergency powers , after some forces were accused of taking an " overzealous " approach to enforcement .
It comes after reports certain retailers were urged by police and local councils to restrict the range of products they sold - including Easter eggs - because they were deemed " non-essential " items .
The Cabinet Office has already issued guidance on which shops are allowed to remain open during the lockdown period , including supermarkets , off licences and newsagents , but have not imposed restrictions on the products they are allowed to sell .
Exactly .
This was the worst possible thing they could do to destroy morale and psychological well-being .

You do n't summarily deny millions of drinkers and smokers their vices without severe consequence .
Yes , these things may not be beneficial to the public health but this is hardly the time to add to our ambitions and start trying to cure social ills on top of dealing with the coronavirus .

New Member  The point is ; you are forcing thousands of smokers to go cold turkey .
Whilst locked up with spouse and kids .
Domestic violence will skyrocket .
The most childish immature decision I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and allow people to slowly get of the habit ( if they wish )  Expert Member  Almost like clockwork and exactly as I expected when you dump this draconian k@k on people with almost no warning .
Also , perfectly predictable , I was in that " prep high " 14 days ago today when I started isolation .
Most are barely getting into it now .
That feeling vaporises almost overnight .
Take people 's smokes and drinks aways and you 've got a sh*tstorm coming your way .

" Covid-19 has been playing havoc with South Africans ' emotions over the last month .
We have made a 180-degree turn in our emotional state ; from being joyful , anticipating good things to happen and showing trust , to being angry , anticipating the worst and showing disgust and fear .
"  From the analyses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mad at police and military , because of the aggressive and violent manner the Covid-19 regulations are being enforced ; - Angry about people being greedy and making money out of Covid-19 , when the country is suffering ; - Angry at government for playing politics in a time of fear , and uncertainty about the future ; - Mad about Moody 's downgrade to junk status , " kicking the country when it is already down " ; - Angry about being isolated , cut-off , and having no way to release stress or alleviate depression and anxiety ; - Concerned about the increase in domestic violence , not only men towards women , but among all members of the household ; - Mad at not being able to buy alcohol ( previously also cigarettes ) ; - Being stuck at home and then also having to endure load shedding ; - Lack of groceries after the rich bought everything ; .
