Amidst the rising cases of Covid-19 , the demand for items such as sanitisers and face masks has increased ten-fold .
The constant demand for these items has turned them into essential commodities .
Often people who rush to places such as pharmacies and convenience stores have to return empty handed because these items fly off the shelves in the blink of an eye .
Sometimes tough situations can bring out the best in a human being .
This was proven true for a housewife who did not forget her roots .
During this tense situation , Haidah Abdullah , a housewife from Gua Musang , has taken the initiative to stitch and create her own home-made face masks to help out those who are in need of the masks during the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) .
According to Harian Metro , she had stitched 200 masks and is intending to distribute them to the public free of charge .
This heart-warming act of kindness was carried out last Saturday ( 21st of March 2020 ) after Haidah heard the frustrations and needs of public through social media in regards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks .
And there are another 100 masks still in the process of being completed , before being distributed for free , " said Haidah .
According to Haidah , her noble deed is an act of paying it forward to the community who once had helped her when she was struggling in poverty .
Prior to this , she was living in a small rundown space with her 5 children in Kampung Bukit Gajah , Jalan Industri , Gua Musang .
It was the community and Non-Governmental Organisations ( NGO ) who helped her by providing a sewing machine and helped her to regain her footing .
Following in Haidah 's footsteps , we hope that everyone will look after each other at this critical time and go through this together .
