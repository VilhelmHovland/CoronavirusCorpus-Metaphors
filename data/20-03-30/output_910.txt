The second week of March , spring break for schools in Lincoln , was somewhat business as usual for Le Quartier Bakery &amp; Cafe , even with news heating up about COVID-19 cases in the U .
and a couple of cases in the state .
" We knew that was n't going to last forever , but we at least enjoyed that one week , " said Seth Quiring , co-owner of the business .
Then Monday came , and restaurants , coffee shops and other wholesalers dropped out , eliminating about a third of the bakery 's business with essentially a snap of the finger .
Baked goods continued to sell , but the breakfast and lunch business dwindled rapidly , Quiring said .
But Friday through Sunday , customers returned to give the bakery love and support .
" It was n't the same but it was kind of busy , actually , again , " he said .
Then Monday again , and every day is getting slower and slower , especially with community spread in Lincoln .
And the business is scrambling to analyze and make day-to-day decisions .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than continuing to work , while in Lincoln they are wanting any hours the bakery will give them , he said .
It 's a strange balancing act , he said .
And so , the business is trying to be creative , with curbside pickup and delivery options , adding soups , take-and-bake pizzas , build-your-own meatball subs , and other ways to get their products out there .
And this idea : For the current trend of quarantining as if on Christmas break , Le Quartier is offering a springtime yule log Sunday .
-- JoAnne Young  Local  editor 's pick  Speed trainer Slatt sees changes , but also sustained business in Lincoln , amid pandemic  Chris Slatt likes working with small groups of athletes .

" Usually , I just clean at the end of the night and I 've got tape on bars and handles on treadmills , but I 've stripped all that off , and after each session we 're wiping the facility down .
" My groups are not very big , and I 've got them even smaller now , just so we can have two or three guys at a time and have space and not be all up on each other .
"  Slatt said he feels fortunate -- he 's working sometimes 10-hour days with clients still coming to the gym -- and has spent the past five years building a client base that now finds the gym both necessary and something of a refuge from all of the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic .
It is never far from the mind , though .
" I 'm originally from Cleveland , and I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , they 've been on lockdown for ( several ) days , " Slatt said .
A number of businesses in Lincoln either just opened in the past few weeks or were scheduled to open soon are now faced with tough decisions about what to do in the face of restrictions on people being together .

Johnson took part in a conference call Gov .
Pete Ricketts hosted for mayors of towns with populations of fewer than 5,000 people .
" Some people say , ' Are you to proactive ? ' " Johnson said .

' Hopefully we do n't have any fatalities .

Wagner  The beat goes on at Lefty 's Records  Kent Wolgamott  03 .
JUSTIN WAN , Journal Star  Lefty 's Records owner Les Greer works at the store on Thursday .
It is business as usual at Lefty 's Records , at least for now .
Les Greer , who has sold new and used albums at his South Street store since 2011 , is still coming in at noon and staying until 6 p .
Tuesday through Saturday .
" I 'm going to be here until they tell me I should n't , " Greer said .
Customers are still showing up , just not as many as before the coronavirus pandemic .
" Two weeks ago , business was probably half of what I normally do , " Greer said .
" But , last week , it rebounded to about normal .
" This week is starting out slow , so we 'll see .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to help me out .
"  There 's no concern about keeping those who come in to flip through the bins 6 feet apart .
" I rarely have 10 at any time , " Greer said , " except during the busiest time of the year , around Christmas and Record Store Day .
"  Record Store Day , which had been slated for April , has been pushed back to June 20 .
Which means Lefty 's and other stores should still have their biggest sales day of the year .
Until then , however , Greer may have to primarily sell used vinyl .
When he placed a new albums order , one of his distributors said it was likely to close next week .
Greer , who plays records throughout the day , was getting ready to cue up Friday 's first selection when we talked .

COURTESY PHOTO  April DeCenzo ( left ) , owner of Anytime Cleaning Service , and employee Taishay Jackson clean a home in Omaha on Friday .
DeCenzo said she 's been doing more commercial and fewer residential jobs during the pandemic .
April DeCenzo and her 11 employees at Anytime Cleaning Service have drawn increased interest from commercial clients in Lincoln and Omaha , and some predicate the opening of their business on hers .
" I literally get like two to three bids out a day for commercial , " DeCenzo said .
Before , she said , " I was lucky to get one a week .
"  Before the pandemic , house cleaning calls comprised a big chunk of business , but those have dried up to almost zero , said DeCenzo .
The remaining clients include customers who have disabilities or trouble cleaning their houses due to their old age , she said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of this shift .
But lockdowns in others states , ordering people to stay home , worries DeCenzo if Nebraska were to follow suit , she said .
Her staff could only clean those businesses deemed essential by the government , so she 's advocating for the federal government to deem all cleaning services essential so they could clean homes , too .
Her employees have taken extra care to avoid cross-contamination of businesses amid the pandemic , and after a cleaning , they disinfect the bottles of disinfectant , she said .
A market run on Environmental Protection Agency-backed cleaning supplies nationally has increased costs and she 's had to add a fee to cover supplies .
During her supply hunting , she 's seen price gouging , and even if she can find what she 's looking for , it 's not readily available .
" It 's like a global shortage everywhere , " DeCenzo said .
-- Riley Johnson  Bartender worries about the future  Sadiyah Ali  03 .
Courtesy photo  John Waechter  John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As many other Nebraskans in the service industry have had to do , Waechter filed his first unemployment claim about a week ago .
" This was completely new to me , " he said .
Waechter , 25 , has worked in the service industry for eight years .
He has worked at LeadBelly for four years as a bartender , but was let go recently after the spread of COVID-19 forced bars to shut down and restaurants to close their dining rooms .
He lives with three other roommates who are also in the service industry , and Waechter is negotiating with his landlord about rent .
But now another issue has come up .
Waechter had his driver 's license rescinded , and now that the DMV has terminated in-house services , he is hard pressed to find some valid form of identification .
He wonders how this will affect his unemployment claim .
For the time being , Waechter is trying to keep busy reading books instead of serving cocktails .

Courtesy photo  Onwiler  Mark Onwiler , operations manager at The Ticket sports radio station ( 93 .
FM ) in Lincoln , arrived at work one day last week with a drill in hand .
A drill in hand ? Really ?  " Our studio is a confined space , and getting 6 feet apart from somebody in there is a challenge , " he said .
" As we 're trying to do our part to help with social distancing and stop the spread of COVID-19 , we figured we need to separate our people as much as we can .
"  Which brings us to the drill .
" We 're trying to set up microphones in various rooms where we can still interact with each other , but we 're physically separated from people , " Onwiler said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our production studio .
We actually have our remote equipment set up in a hallway right now .
If we need a third voice ( on a particular show ) , he 's standing in a hallway .
So , nobody 's actually in the same room as another person as we 're doing our regular shows together .
"  Onwiler oversees a staff of seven radio personalities and a handful of part-time producers .
At 330 N .
48th St .
, The Ticket generally keeps discussions light .
It 's sports talk .
But Onwiler also sees a big-picture responsibility attached to the station .
" Broadcasters have a certain obligation to the community , " he said .
" We need to be on the air delivering a message as messages become important .
Priority one is to make sure we are there when we need to be there .
If we get sick , we ca n't be there .
That 's my biggest concern .
That 's why I 'm going around with Clorox wipes and spraying with disinfectant .
"  And , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  For respiratory therapist , life keeps getting busier  Nick McConnell  03 .
For Holly Kreiger and the rest of the respiratory therapy team at Bryan Health , life was busy enough before the COVID-19 pandemic .
Now , as the number of cases grows daily , she said other employees are working diligently to prepare for whatever comes their way in the coming weeks and months .
Kreiger works as a respiratory therapist , primarily treating patients in the emergency room who are struggling to breathe on their own .
That work is becoming even more in demand as the nation fights coronavirus .
Kreiger said Bryan is seeing patients with symptoms that may point to COVID-19 , and they are testing and treating them .
She said there is a shortage of protective gear across the nation , and as the pandemic continues , ventilators could become scarce .
Staff at Bryan are even learning about ways to make one ventilator serve up to four people , she said .
While the hospitals are able to cope with cases now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things look more dire if people do n't take necessary preventative measures .
She said all they can do for now is prepare and wait , but she encourages people to stay home and practice social distancing to take stress off of the healthcare system .
