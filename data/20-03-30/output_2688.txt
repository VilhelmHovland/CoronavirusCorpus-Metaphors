Coronavirus Could Be the Final Nail in the Coffin for Bombardier 's ( TSX:BBD .
) Stock  Bombardier Inc ( TSX:BBD .
) stock has been having a rough go of it lately .
As of this writing , it had fallen 45% since February 19 -- compared to 34% for the TSX .
With the extreme coronavirus response measures that have been rolled out recently , it 's understandable that stocks would take a beating .

As you 're about to see , the ongoing coronavirus panic could legitimately threaten the company 's operations .
With business travel taking a beating due to travel restrictions , Bombardier could lose orders and suffer major revenue declines .
To understand why that would be so devastating to the business , we first need to look at its history .
A business in decline  Most Canadians will be familiar with Bombardier 's recent woes .
Its massive layoffs and business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance sheet struggles .
However , Bombardier 's issues go back further than most people realize .
A quick glance at Bombardier 's stock chart shows that it peaked in September 2000 at a price of about $27 .
Shortly afterward , it began a free-fall that has continued to the present day .
The company 's first questionable asset divestiture was selling Bombardier Recreational Products to Bain Capital for $1 .
billion .
The sale came as Bombardier reported a $1 billion net loss and a 15% revenue drop-off for the final quarter of 2003 .
While it 's normal for businesses to sell off units , Bombardier 's sale to Bain Capital appears to have been motivated by a desire to offset staggering losses .
The sale also deprived Bombardier of a business unit that has gone on to be successful under new management : In the five years spanning 2015 to 2019 , BRP grew its revenue by 10% CAGR and did n't have a single losing year .
The loss of BRP was just the start of Bombardier 's woes .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series jet .
Initially projected to cost $2 .
billion , it wound up costing $5 .
billion and loading up the company 's balance sheet with debt .
Bombardier also struggled to find buyers for the jet , which led to it being sold to Airbus .
That was the start of a long series of asset divestures that continued until last year .
Business jets : the only business unit remaining  Having sold off recreational products , much of its aviation , and trains , business aviation is the only major business unit Bombardier has left .
Unfortunately , depending on how the coronavirus threat plays out , that could be in danger too .

Just recently , Starbucks turned its annual meeting into a virtual event , and Nestle told its employees to limit business travel .
These are but two examples out of hundreds .
If coronavirus remains a going concern , then we 'll almost certainly see fewer business jet orders , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business .
For these and other reasons , investors would do well to avoid Bombardier stock .
