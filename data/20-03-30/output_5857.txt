( SMC ) on Monday said it is tapping its global network of suppliers to purchase some P500 million worth of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for frontliners fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) .
" It 's very crucial that we get more PPE -- protective masks , gloves , surgical gowns , among others -- out there as fast as we can .
We are hoping to fill the gap and continue supporting our government in whatever way we can .
Our health care workers and government responders are risking their own lives to save ours but they are running out of equipment to protect themselves , " said SMC president and COO Ramon S .
San Miguel said it is currently mapping out available PPE capacity from its own suppliers , as it continues to look for domestic suppliers to help increase the production of the protective equipment if they can as the battle against the virus continues .
" We are leveraging our network of suppliers to assist government in addressing this shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we are also calling on local suppliers , even the small ones , to come forward .
We will help purchase your products and get it out in the market where it 's most needed , " said Ang .

" And we need to streamline the certification and approval processes so that those who wish to respond can immediately provide the supplies our medical front liners need .
