With the 21-day lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 having come into force , the Centre on Wednesday postponed the process of updating the contentious National Population Register ( NPR ) and the first phase of the Census 2021 .
The house listing and housing enumeration of the Census 2021 and NPR were slated to be carried out simultaneously from April 1 to September 30 .
There have been widespread protests across the country since mid-December against the amended Citizenship Act ( CAA ) , NPR , and National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) .
In the wake of the lockdown , protesters have vacated most protest sites , including the one in the national capital 's Shaheen Bagh .
In a statement , the home ministry said Census 2021 was scheduled to be conducted in two phases -- house listing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enumeration from February 9 to 28 , 2021 .
The updating of NPR was proposed to be done along with the Phase I of Census 2021 in all the states and Union territories , except Assam .
However , some of the state governments had either passed resolutions in their respective Assemblies , or issued orders , that they will carry out the NPR based on the 2010 questionnaire and not the revised one .
Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also assured in Parliament that none will be asked to show any documents during the NPR process , or marked ' D ' , or ' doubtful ' citizen category .
But , misgivings about the NPR process have remained since the Citizenship Act Rules of 2003 state that the NPR process will be followed by preparation of a National Register of Indian Citizens .
There have been demands that this should be amended and the provision related to the NRC process deleted .
The home ministry on Wednesday said due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic , high alert has been declared by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Keeping in view these issues , the first phase of Census 2021 and updating of NPR , which was to begin on various dates decided by the state and union territory governments beginning April 1 and various related field activities , are postponed until further orders , the statement said .
Officials said since the census and NPR exercise require the enumerators to visit every household and meet people , it is not possible to carry out the exercise in the wake of the lockdown .
The lockdown has also meant all government , both central and state , offices have been asked to shut until April 14 .
The states which have been opposed the NPR are Kerala , West Bengal , Punjab , Rajasthan , Chhattisgarh , Tamil Nadu and Bihar .
They had , however , said they will cooperate with the house listing phase of the Census .
The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country .
