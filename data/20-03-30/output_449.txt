Over the past few weeks , I 've come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she describes how tired she is from her shift , but just before she notices the new indentations on her nose and cheeks left by a protective mask she has worn for the previous 12 hours .
As of Monday , Louisiana had the highest growth in new coronavirus cases of any place in the world .
Lately , my mom is at work more often than she 's home .
Since the virus is spreading quickly , the state is now under a shelter-in-place order , just like the Bay Area .
People back home are social distancing , just as we are here , and nonessential businesses are closed while restaurants are doing only delivery and takeout orders .
From here , it all looks familiar .
I want to say I 'm homesick for Louisiana .
But Louisiana does n't look like the home I know and love .
It looks like California .
And Georgia .
And New York .
As of Tuesday afternoon , 17 states had issued similar shelter-in-place orders , meaning more than 175 million people were encouraged to stay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else .
That 's what a global pandemic does -- it strips away your geographical identity and sense of place .
Point anywhere on a map and you 'll land on communities struggling with emotions as much as they are with crumbling economics .
There 's a commonality to everyone 's suffering , and within it , an unwelcome feeling of familiarity .
The act of calling my dad these days feels familiar , but instead of talking about crawfish boils and barbecue sauce recipes as we 'd normally do this time of year , he 's giving me Creole recipes best suited for cabinets filled by pandemic shopping , when only the bare essentials -- rice , beans , a cache of spices -- are available .
Catching up with my mom as she drives home from an E .
shift is n't new to me , but paying attention to how she 's breathing , whether she 's coughing and constantly asking if her hospital has enough masks definitely is .
Everything seemed to change overnight for Louisiana .
The state recorded its first COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had died from the virus and there were hundreds of new cases .
According to reports , some state officials believed the virus ' spread in the state may have been jump-started by the Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans in February , which attracts people from all over the world .
There 's an added level of helplessness when your family -- and every part of your adult identity -- is more than 2,000 miles away from you , as mine is .
The data show I 'm not alone in this feeling in the Bay Area .
According to a five-year sample of U .
Census Bureau data released in 2017 , only 30 percent of San Francisco and Alameda County residents were born in California .
The data showed that in South Louisiana , nearly 75 percent of the residents were born in the state .
So many folks in San Francisco and Oakland are stuck watching their hometowns cope with an unprecedented pandemic .
But instead of feeling solidarity , it 's hard not to feel you 're alone .
Maybe establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're all going through this together .
The thought process is similar to what I used during natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina .
Storms and floods do n't know economic boundaries , or race or social status .
The struggles in their aftermath are identical for all , and the same can be said about this pandemic .
After Hurricane Katrina , there were physical barriers that kept families separated .
Social distancing during the coronavirus is doing the same , on a global scale .
We 're all in the same predicament .
And though my home state of Louisiana may not look like home again for a long time , at least there are thousands of other folks in the Bay Area who just might be saying the same thing about where they grew up .
That may not be much of a reprieve from our collective sense of isolation , but maybe it 's enough .
