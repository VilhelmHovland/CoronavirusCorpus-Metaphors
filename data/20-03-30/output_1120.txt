The son of a resident in a care home at the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak has described his terror that his mum will contract the virus .
A senior member of staff at Owen Mor Care Centre in Londonderry told the man on Friday there were six positive cases of coronavirus in the home and it is understood a number of staff are now self-isolating .
Now the son of a dementia patient living at the home has hit out at the lack of information he has received about his mother , claiming he has been unable to speak to anyone at the home since Friday .
People over 70 and elderly people with pre-existing health conditions are considered more at risk if they contract coronavirus .
As a result , care homes across Northern Ireland have banned visitors to their premises in a bid to protect residents - meaning families are relying on staff to keep them updated on their loved ones .
However , the son of a resident at Owen Mor Care Centre , which is registered to provide care to 81 people with a range of needs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being left in the dark over his mum 's condition .
" Someone got in touch with me last Wednesday and said they did n't want to scare me , but they 'd heard there were people at Owen Mor who had coronavirus , " he said .
" Then she phoned on Thursday and said she 's heard there were six cases .
" At this stage I still had n't heard anything from the home and I spent all day Friday ringing to try and find out what was going on but I could n't get any answer .
" Eventually I went down and waited outside and a senior nurse came out and told me there were six cases .
" She said my mum was okay and the six people with the virus are in a different unit , but she was n't able to tell me what the home is doing to stop it spreading .
" I 'm worried because even though it 's in another unit , you just have to walk through a door and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally got a phone call from the home at 8pm that night to tell me about the outbreak but I have n't heard anything since and I have n't been able to get through to them either .
" I understand that they are flat to the mat at the moment , but we are n't allowed in to see our loved ones and the only way we can find out what is happening is if someone tells us what 's happening .
" All it would take is a one minute phone call every day just to say she is all right , but we 've heard nothing from the trust or the social worker and only had one call from the home .
" It 's very distressing .
"  The home did not comment , while a spokeswoman from the Western Health and Social Care Trust said : " The Western Trust continues to work closely with Owen Mor Private Nursing Home .
At present we are providing enhanced support and guidance to the management and staff of Owen Mor in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further information on the support that has been put in place or the information it has been providing to the families .
