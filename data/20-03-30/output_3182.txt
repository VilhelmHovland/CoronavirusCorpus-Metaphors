With the support of community members Chef John Pritchard makes meals for children who are home during COVID-19 crisis  John Pritchard dishes out some of the 100 meals that will be distributed to children , at home , during the COVID-19 crisis .
Pritchard operates Pure Kitchen in Charlottetown .
John Pritchard has been preparing school lunches since 2010 .
" It started as a means of making sure kids were getting one good hot healthy meal at my daughter 's school , " says Pure Kitchen 's executive chef .
Over the years , the demand for his homemade meals has grown , so he now provides lunches for five schools .
But , when March break was extended due to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 strain ) pandemic , he started to think of the children who would n't be returning to school .
" One night I woke up and thought , ' there are going to be some children who are going to be left in the lurch ' .
This includes kids who come from difficult situations .
For many , it was going to be their only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became determined to do something .
From his kitchen , he would make 100 meals a week and arrange for them to be distributed .
" It was n't too little an amount .
And it was something I could maintain .
That 's because I 'm relying on the meals that I 'm selling to fund it , " says Pritchard , who also shared his idea with others , through email .
The response has been amazing .
" It 's mind-blowing .
People really felt like they wanted to reach out and do something .
They are making donations and volunteering to deliver the meals .
With their support we will be delivering over 100 meals a week .
"  On Prince Edward Island , the current health situation is helping to bringing others together again .
For example , a local band just launched an album and gave Pritchard a portion of the proceeds .
" They said we want to help some school kids .
So people are really reaching out to each other .
It 's amazing .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Reuters ) - Japan 's Olympic delay has upended years of careful planning by organizers and spawned costly headaches for small businesses , hotels and even pro baseball teams , compounding a $12 billion price tag .
The Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021 last week as the coronavirus outbreak deepened , an unprecedented move in the 124-year history of the modern Olympics .
New dates have yet to be set , leaving sponsors and businesses uncertain and scrambling .
For Japan , a one-year postponement will likely cost 641 billion yen ( $6 billion ) , according to Katsuhiro Miyamoto , an emeritus professor of economics at Kansai University who studies the economic impact of the Olympics .
He reckons the bulk of that , 423 billion yen , will be from actual costs - things like venue maintenance , reprinting of marketing materials and hiring new volunteers - with the remainder coming from a broader blow to the economy .
That 's on top of the $12 billion Japan spent in the run-up .
The head of the International Olympics Committee has said the delay will mean additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which sells banana-shaped sponge cakes filled with custard , the delay has been a disaster for the Olympic-themed " Tokyo Banana " confection it spent a year developing .
Grapestone 's sales had been falling since February , when the coronavirus started to hit tourism .
Now vendors are saying they do n't want cakes decorated with the 2020 Games logo .
" We 've never seen such a dramatic fall in sales , " said spokeswoman Yukiko Ohno , without detailing the decline .
" Since the Olympics were delayed , we think a lot fewer of our customers feel they have to have the cakes right now .
"  The company has cut back production at its plants in nearby Saitama .
It also makes cherry blossom- and panda-themed cakes , but Ohno said the Olympics one is made with rice flour , to give tourists a " taste of Japan " .
BIG SIGHT , BASEBALL  Japanese sponsors , who have paid a record $3 billion to be associated with the Games , have complained privately about the uncertainty of the delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms have signed up just for a year .
" We need to negotiate whether our current contract can be extended or needs to be re-signed with additional costs , " said a representative of one sponsor .
" It 's not even clear whether we can continue to use the rights or not .
"  Venues pose a particular problem for organizers .
Tokyo Big Sight , a colossal exhibition hall on the eastern side of the city , was booked as the Olympics media center to hold thousands of journalists .
It 's unclear whether Big Sight , which is owned by the Tokyo government , will be available next year given that bookings are taken far in advance .
The venue has already entered into contracts for 50 bookings in the year starting in April and is in talks for 200 more , said spokeswoman Mayumi Inoue .
She said it was n't possible to make room for the Olympics if other events were going on .
" It has to be one or the other .
"  Jingu Baseball Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slated to be used to store equipment by organizers during the Olympics , a Swallows spokeswoman said .
The team had planned to play at the Tokyo Dome , home of crosstown rivals the Yomiuri Giants , between July and early September , but is now checking whether it still needs to , the spokeswoman said .
Another area team , the Yokohama DeNA Baystars , arranged to play its home games elsewhere - including in Niigata , some 350 km ( 215 miles ) away - because its ground was to be used for Olympics baseball .
Baystars spokesman Yasuhiro Kawamura said the team was working with the baseball association on its schedule .
Public broadcaster NHK and private broadcaster Fuji Television Network both said they canceled programs due to the postponement .
Three other private broadcasters did not respond to a request for comment about programing changes .
VILLAGE , HOTELS  The Olympic village , which is designed to house more than 10,000 athletes , could prove one of the biggest headaches .
It is due to be converted into luxury apartments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move in by 2023 .
One woman who bought a flat in the village with her husband said she was unsure about the move-in date .
" I still have n't figured out what 's going to happen , " she said .
" It would be troubling if the Olympic Village were used over an extended time period without our consent .
"  Sales of the flats and showroom tours have been suspended until further notice , Mitsui Fudosan Residential , which is leading the real estate project , said on Monday .
Around 4 .
million tickets have been sold for the Olympics , and another 970,000 for the Paralympic Games .
Organizers say they have n't decided yet how to handle tickets , although Japanese media have reported the tickets would be valid for the same events next year .
Tokyo organizers have about 3,500 people on staff , with a number of those seconded from the government or sponsoring companies .
" Many of the temporary staff are wanting to get back to their own organizations so this will affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay .
The postponement will heap more pain on hotels , which have been battered by coronavirus .
" The drop in sales we 're seeing is brutal , " said Shigeki Kitahara , president of the Ryokan and Hotel Association , who owns a traditional ryokan hotel himself .
With bookings often made far in advance , it is difficult for owners to shift plans quickly , he said .
