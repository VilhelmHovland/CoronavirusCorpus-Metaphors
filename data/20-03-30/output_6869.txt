The South African government has decreed that every web site using a .
za domain name must now carry a link to an official government coronavirus advice site .
The regulation ( pdf ) , which largely focuses on other types of teleconmmunications services , came into effect last Thursday .
It states :  Internet sites operating within .
zaDNA top level domain name must have a landing page with a visible link to www .
sacoronavirus .
The rule applies to every site , not just those purveying health news .
ZADNA 's front page currently features this clickable graphic , slightly below the fold .
ZADNA is the registry for .
za , but also the city gTLDs .
joburg and .
capetown .
The wording of the regulation suggests that these two gTLDs are also covered by the rule , but official government communications make no mention of either .
The rules also require fake coronavirus news to be blocked , but that 's on the ISPs to implement .
You may notice that the government 's domain is SAcoronavirus .
This appears to be because coronavirus .
currently belongs to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government site , and also an offer to sell the domain .
