CBD Melbourne : Staff out of site but not out of Martinez 's mind  HWL Ebsworth head honcho Juan Martinez has been known to have occasional interpersonal difficulties , especially when it comes to his colleagues .
His gruff emails to former partner Tim Griffiths in 2015 ordering him to leave the firm 's Sydney offices after his billing collapsed ended up costing the firm $450,000 in unfair dismissal damages .
" I have had other things on my mind BUT you should be packing , " he told Griffiths , according to evidence at the Supreme Court .
So what was Martinez to do when confronted last week with the problem of unruly staff working from home ? Another email , of course .
Life in the time of Corona .

"  A SLIPPERY SLOPE  It 's hard to know how Australians will be received in Aspen next year given our countrymen have been accused of being the source of a COVID-19 outbreak at the US ski resort .
It 's been widely reported health officials in the exclusive ski resort were last week waiting on " presumptive positive " results on 13 visiting Australians while other members of the group were refusing to be tested .
It 's also well known that a fair chunk of the Portsea-Toorak set attended a drinks party at Flexigroup founder Andrew Abercrombie 's Aspen apartment , including former IOOF chief executive Chris Kelaher .
Australians were part of a cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less well known is the fact authorities almost took action against two members of the Aussie contingent after learning they had skipped out on self-isolation to go skiing on Friday , March 14 .
US-based 9news .
( no relation ) confirmed late last week Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser considered slapping court orders on the Aussie pair which would force them by law to stay inside their hotel rooms but decided against it .
The pair travelled to Snowmass ( one of the four mountains ) for several hours of skiing on Friday , March 14 , even as county health officials urged all residents and visitors in the town to practise social distancing .
At the time , the pair did not have any symptoms .
After Weiser decided against any action , the Aussies then left Aspen .
By Sunday , Colorado Governor Jared Polis had issued an order for all four mountains to cease operating in a bid to stop the spread of the virus .
Just as well .
And now sources inside Postie HQ say his role is in line for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief information officer John Cox had been appointed executive general manager for corporate affairs , in title if not in spirit .
Some elements of the role are expected to go to chief executive Christine Holgate .
There 's been other moves , too .
The organisation 's legal counsel , Nick Macdonald , has also had a shake-up to his role , of sorts , and now reports directly to Holgate .
THE OTHER SORT OF PARTY  Melbourne 's social calendar is n't the only casualty of COVID-19 .
The political calendar has evaporated overnight .
Both Victorian Labor and the Liberal Party 's Victorian division have been forced to scrap their state conferences and annual general meetings , which were both scheduled for May .
Victorian Labor 's state conference is the annual event where members can gather to discuss and vote on the party 's platform .
Fortuitously , 2020 was an off-year for voting for office-bearers with state president Susie Byers , her vice , Shannon Threlfall-Clark , and their administrative committee still having another year to go .
But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been forced to postpone their State Council 's annual general meeting which was also scheduled for May 23 .
Conservative officials are voted onto the party 's state administrative committee every year .
In the absence of a meeting , the vote is n't likely to take place .
And of course , its constitution does n't allow for online voting .
Party officials will meet -- over a phone conference -- next month to thrash out whether president Robert Clark and the current 19-person state administrative committee will tip over into caretaker mode .
Or whether a stripped back state council will happen just for the purposes of a vote .
Either way , it 's a logistical nightmare .
Loading  CORRECTION : An earlier version of this story said John Bongiorno and Andrew Stuart were present at Andrew Abercrombie 's cocktail party in Aspen .
This is incorrect .
Mr Bongiorno and Mr Stuart were not present at the party and had returned to Australia before it took place .
The Age never intended to suggest that they had the virus or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Bongiorno and Mr Stuart for this error .
