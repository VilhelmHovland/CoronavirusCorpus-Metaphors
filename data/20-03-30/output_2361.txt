Irrationality in the Time of Coronavirus  What the AIDS epidemic taught me that can help all of us today .
Epidemics are biological , yet they have effects on our psychology and social relations .
Fear can mobilize people to think clearly , but it can also bring out irrational reactions .
We saw this 40 years ago when the AIDS epidemic started .
At the time , I was a young psychoanalyst , learning how the human psyche is prey to irrational forces .
The AIDS epidemic presented a vivid showcase of those forces , teaching lessons that could help in the present COVID-19 crisis .
Fearing the Unknown  The first reaction to a new epidemic is terror , magnified by a lack of knowledge .
What was causing AIDS to spread ? What was its origin ? How could it be treated ? Without reliable facts , people made things up , blaming racial groups , recreational drugs , or a negative mental attitude .
Another irrationality is about who is at risk .
Ideally , it is " not me .
" I will feel safer to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With AIDS , there was talk of " risk groups " -- like gay men and Haitians -- implying white heterosexuals were safe .
They were n't .
With COVID-19 , we began hearing that only those 60 and older or those already sick with other conditions need worry .
Yet there are reports of people in their 30s and 40s who are also vulnerable and dying .
Money Ca n't Save You  Danger brings out the defense of omnipotence in some people , who think , " I am rich , powerful , and influential , so I do n't have to worry .
" Wealthy people are flying out of town in private planes and spending enormous sums stocking up on food and supplies .
Will money and power protect against the COVID-19 virus ?  Roy Cohn , a mentor to our current president , used his influence early in the epidemic to obtain experimental drugs and to hide the fact he had AIDS .
He died of AIDS in 1986 anyway .
In Iran and Italy , government leaders have already been infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of Congress are self-quarantining .
Fame , power , and celebrity will provide no protection .
During an epidemic , government leaders should be a model of balanced rationality and empathy , paying close attention without panicking .
False reassurance or dismissing the magnitude of the danger only makes things worse .
President Reagan did not mention AIDS until 10,000 Americans had died of it .
President Trump 's initial denials , followed by his over-optimism , will boomerang as the situation continues to worsen .
By contrast , the blunt , truthful warnings of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo are inspiring courage and confidence .
False Prophecies  Great dangers bring out irrational wish-fulfillment .
We all would like to believe a cure is around the corner , so we seize on every positive shred of information , even if it is false .
In 1984 , there was the new AIDS wonder drug , HPA-23 .
Rock Hudson flew to Paris for it ; it did n't work and actually made many patients worse .
When you hear today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to get too excited .
A cure will come , but not before there have been many false rumors .
Positive Outcomes ?  Nobody wishes for epidemics , but they can eventually have adaptive effects on societies .
Before the AIDS epidemic , the National Institutes of Health had slow and inefficient ways of testing new drugs .
In 1988 , Larry Kramer published " An Open Letter to Anthony Fauci , " calling him an " incompetent idiot .
" It was mean , but it got results .
Fauci , who is still at the forefront of handling epidemics in America , acknowledges that AIDS activists changed the American system of testing and releasing medications .
Humane celebrities like Elizabeth Taylor also used their influence .
AIDS brought out a sense of community among those afflicted , and we saw amazing acts of kindness and selfless charity .
The AIDS epidemic changed our society .
It gave recognition to gay people as human beings who have a caring community .
It cracked our society 's sense of invulnerability and improved our health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful , lead to improving our world ? It could wake us up to the careless way we have treated our democratic privileges and the inequalities of our health care system .
It could lead us to love one another better , despite our differences .
Irrational reactions do not go away , but when we recognize them , we are more able , if we try , to use our intelligence and goodwill to help one another .

With novel epidemics , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It 's called asymmetric risk , the cost of being wrong is much greater than the benefits of being right .
I think the events of the past two months have proven that .
Had Italy and the EU banned flights from China early they would not be in the mess they are in right now .
The pandemic is the result of not assuming the worst .
" The first reaction to a new epidemic is terror , magnified by lack of knowledge .
What was causing AIDS to spread ? What was its origin ? How could it be treated ? Without reliable facts , people made things up , blaming racial groups , recreational drugs , or a negative mental attitude .
"  Why are you mocking lack of knowledge early in an epidemic ? It 's not like analysts had special knowledge and everyone else was flying blind .
I was treating patients in 1981 when it was called GRIDS and I assure you the top doctors in the country did n't know what was going on beyond phenomenology .
Also , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? IV drug use turned out to be one of the major routes of transmission .
" Another irrationality is about who is at risk .
Ideally , it is " not me .
" I will feel safer to make up a story that pins the danger on someone else .
With AIDS , there was talk of " risk groups " -- like gay men and Haitians -- implying white heterosexuals were safe .
They were n't .
"  It is simply an inconvenient medical fact that gay men and IV drug users are at greater stastical risk , and those facts trump your virtue signaling .
We did n't know that at first , and until the partner studies came out it was reasonable to think everyone was at risk .
It also was n't unreasonable to think it might be spread by mosquitoes .
You 're guilty of hindsight bias about epistemology here and even with that getting the facts wrong .
Lest you reflexively ( and unanalytically ) think that this is homophobic , lesbians are clearly in a low risk group for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to blame for this epidemic .
This was n't analytical at all , it was just pablum and vapid virtue signaling .
It 's also Dunning Kruger on steroids .
Analysts have no special expertise on these issues .
Read about systemic risk from Nassim Taleb and And The Band Played On by Randy Shilts .
The only insightful thing about this article is that it 's biased , it drips with party politics by mentioning the fails of the Republicans .
I 'm an independent , so I 'm not particularly slanted either way .
This is an uncertain time we live in and we are only wise in hindsight .
So , let 's stop with the finger pointing and get on with uniting for a cure .
We are all descended from people who overreacted .
Those who underreacted died and so did their spawn .
The lesson of the AIDS epidemic is that we should have overreacted earlier .
Patient zero was approached by public health authorities and he told them to to go hell .
Nothing was done .
One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was considered homophobic .
Blood donation policies are based on a policy of overreacting as a result .
I could n't donate because I went to Costa Rica .
That 's an overreaction but I understand since the cost of underreacting is greater than the cost of overreacting .
This is what happens when a field of expertise gets dominated by everything but math and statistics .
It 's ruled by social trends and wishful thinking .
Thank you for the insightful and intelligent article , Dr .
Blechner .
Fear " mobilizes people to think clearly " and as you said , also brings out our " irrational reactions .
" I can add to what you wrote and irritate some people I saw in some of the responses .
I 'm not a scholar or a doctor , but as an immigrant US citizen , living in NYC for 25 years , I see Dr .
Blechner 's point of view very clearly .
I was in my twenties during the AIDS crisis and I know the fear during that time , independent of whether you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least you could go to a gay or straight person 's funeral .
Unfortunately I heard in the news , people in Italy were not able to see their loved ones in the hospital for the last time , go to their funeral , and they did n't know where was the buried corpse ! It really broke my heart ! We are all free to have our own opinion and read this article and understand it as a " politically biased view " as the main message , but If we want to exercise our compassion or have the spirit to " uniting for a cure " , we need to reflect how we as individuals absorb things and understand this article because " fear can mobilize people to think clearly or bring out irrational reactions " .
This article is not about politics but we can bend things to our own way of thinking .
We never lived a moment like this in our entire life , and it is very scary .
Who is " at risk " ? We are all at risk to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ! Money , race , power or sexual orientation ca n't save you because we are all at risk of contamination , and this is very unifying .
The main " parallel " between HIV and Corona is about the psychological and emotional effects or the irrational forces .
When I read some of the comments , I thought about the prevailing irrational forces in them .
This article is about a professional experience and about a man who dedicated a big part of his career to help the emotional aspect of HIV-infected patients when they were dying , since the early stages of the AIDS crisis in NYC .
Medical doctors could not cure HIV , and Dr .
Blechner was dealing with the emotional issues of a terminal illness , giving human support and also dealing with the homophobic issues that came with the illness .
I did n't see any " hindsight bias " in this article , but a sincere testimony of a serious professional .
We all can analyze using words with bad meanings if we see things that way .
" Light on analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are diminishing and disrespectful words .
What we need in this world is more respect .
OBrien , nobody said that your thinking was homophobic , only yourself .
" Lest you reflexively ( and unanalytically ) think that this is homophobic " .
We are not entitled to represent somebody 's thinking and bend their response to our own thinking .
You reinterpreted Dr .
Blechner 's brain and called yourself homophobic in his name .
Maybe it is just mirror thinking that is reflecting the Dunning Kruger 's syndrome on you .
Sometimes we talk about the other person with what is coming from inside us .
Let 's try to avoid the irrational forces , and let 's learn from this crisis .
Maybe " it could lead us to love one another better , despite our differences .
Irrational reactions do not go away , but when we recognize them , we are more able , if we try , to use our intelligence and good will to help one another .
" These are wise words , and I really want a better world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
