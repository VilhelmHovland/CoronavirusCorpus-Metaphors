More  Landlords face six-month eviction freeze  Residential and commercial landlords will be banned from evicting tenants under financial stress caused by the coronavirus economic downturn for the next six months , federal and state governments have announced .

" States and territories will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of persons as a result of financial distress if they are unable to meet their commitments , " Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday night .
Similar principles were agreed to for commercial leases .

" But also to ensure if you are n't going to engage in cooperative activity between banks , between tenants , and between landlords , then the sort of support you might otherwise expect to receive you will not receive .
