A year ago , I published an article on the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ) , in which I dismissed the thought that IBB is the best fund to play the expected growth of the biotech sector .
Since then , the fund has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index by 3% .
Source : Seeking Alpha  I introduced investors to SPDR Biotech ETF ( XBI ) , which I thought would outperform IBB because of its high concentration on small-cap stocks representing this business sector .
Below is a comparison of returns between these two funds and the broad market in the last 12 months .
IBB has outperformed both the market and XBI over the last 12 months .
However , up until the beginning of 2020 , XBI had provided better returns than both the index and IBB , which was consistent with my expectations .
Twelve months and a pandemic later , I believe IBB is the best fund to hold for the next 12 months for reasons that are discussed below .
A cure for coronavirus will likely come from the big guns  The major catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months is the possibility of developing a vaccine or a drug to fight the novel coronavirus .
However , such a product is unlikely to be invented by a small biotech company .
This is not to say that the chances of such an occurrence are nil , but collectively , the big names in the industry have a better chance of finding a cure .
Here is a list of companies that are working to develop a cure for COVID-19 and their market capitalizations .
Heat Biologics has previously announced that it is developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine .
It disclosed March 17 in a financial filing that its COVID-19 vaccine candidate had been added to the World Health Organization 's " draft landscape " of 41 candidate vaccines .
Inovio develops immunotherapies and vaccines but has n't yet had a product approved for treatment .
For INO-4800 , preclinical testing was performed between Jan .
23 and Feb .
The company plans to begin clinical trials in the U .
with 30 participants in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with BARDA to test its vaccine candidate , with both organizations providing funding for research and development and the public-health organization funding the Phase 1 trials .
Moderna received funding from CEPI in January to develop an mRNA vaccine against COVID-19 .
On Feb .
24 , it said it had shipped the first batch of mRNA-1273 to the NIAID for a Phase 1 clinical trial in the U .
As evident from this data , the majority of companies who are actively working to develop a cure are billion-dollar companies .
Governments and other responsible authorities , on the other hand , prefer to work with these companies because of their strong track record of previously working with state authorities to fight pandemics and other outbreaks .
This backdrop tilts the odds in favor of IBB  IBB is a fund that primarily invests in large-cap biotech stocks , making the fund tailor-made to benefit from the expected surge in healthcare stock prices once further developments are announced of the fight against COVID-19 .
The exposure to small and micro-cap biotech stocks are non-existent , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
However , the outbreak of the novel coronavirus , in my opinion , has changed the healthcare investing landscape considerably and tilted the odds in favor of large companies .
The top-10 holdings of IBB further highlight that the fund is invested in companies that are already researching for a product to fight the virus .
The pandemic fears might drive the market performance for more time than some investors are factoring in  The thinking behind many investors is that the spread of COVID-19 will come to an end in the next couple of months , paving the way for global economic growth to return to its normalcy .
However , things might be a bit more different than that .
Even if the United States , along with other regions that are hammered by the virus , curb the spread of the virus , the repercussions of the pandemic will be felt throughout 2020 .
Biotechnology companies will continue with their effort to develop a cure and different stages of their clinical trials will unfold for many months or years to come .
Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments for the entire year .
Takeaway : IBB has an attractive risk-reward profile  Is buying IBB better than buying the one company that will , for sure , develop a vaccine successfully to put an end to the novel coronavirus ? Most certainly not , but no investor would be able to predict what company or companies would be successful in their efforts .
Identifying which company would win the race and become the first to develop such medicine is even more complex .
Therefore , an investment in IBB seems to have the best risk-reward profile to play the uncertainty , while gaining necessary exposure to the biotechnology sector .
Even if things continue to go South and none of the companies emerge victorious in this race to find a cure for COVID-19 , the billion-dollar companies can still survive and reward investors in the long run , as opposed to a small-cap company whose stock price has shot up over the last few months based on expectations for a successful trial to fight the novel coronavirus .
Almost all component companies of IBB have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue in the coming years .
Therefore , an investment in IBB is a less risky bet on the highly volatile biotech sector .
This makes IBB even more attractive .
Biotech stocks are not for everyone because of the significant level of business uncertainty .
An investor who is keen to gain exposure to the expected surge in healthcare stock prices should consider IBB because of its risk-reward profile and the long-term prospects of the companies the fund has invested in .
