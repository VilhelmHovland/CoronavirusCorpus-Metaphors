Coronavirus crisis exposes public safety risk of mass incarceration  Two inmates leave Santa Rita Jail in Dublin .
They were among several hundred prisoners granted early release as the county tries to limit coronavirus spread in a vulnerable population .
Photo : Noah Berger / Special to The Chronicle  Thousands of people have been released from prisons and jails across the country over the last two weeks for one reason : our collective safety .
Let 's just allow that a moment to sink in .
The freedom of thousands incarcerated citizens is currently being deemed in line with our public safety -- it 's an incredible reversal of what we 've been told by the people locking them up .
And yet this is coming from the people locking them up .
Last week , Sheriff Greg Ahern of Alameda County made the decision to release over 400 prisoners from Santa Rita Jail , all of them low-level offenders with 45 days or less left to serve , and some with chronic health issues .
This act was , of course , a response to the coronavirus pandemic -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Rita faces , and it 's not the first .
Santa Rita Jail is the fifth largest in the country , with a capacity to hold 4,000 people .
The majority of those incarcerated there have mental health and substance abuse issues .
For years Santa Rita 's death rate has exceeded that of the largest jail in the nation , and a large number of these deaths are suicides .
Sheriff Ahern was clear that his decision to decarcerate was in the interest of public health .
The coronavirus has made Santa Rita unsafe for his staff , the prisoners , and society -- but the sheriff 's decision also begs the question , was his jail safe and healthy in the first place ?  Just days after the releases took place , Ahern proposed an $85 million spending bill that would expand his department 's annual budget to more than half a billion dollars .
Though an expansion of programming and mental health services are clearly needed at Santa Rita -- choosing this moment to propose a massive funding increase is deeply jarring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , now 2,171 people , is the lowest it 's been in at least the last decade .
Why would you need to drastically expand the budget of a half-empty jail ?  Yesterday I spoke with Mike ( who asked me not to use his last name ) , a man in his 40s who was released from Santa Rita on March 19 .
I asked Mike to describe the circumstances of his release .
" They just came to my cell and said ' you want to go home early ? Then get ready in five minutes .
' "  Mike had been in jail for a probation violation since Jan .
13 , serving an 80-day sentence .
" Nothing special happened , " Mike continued .
" They gave us our belongings and a ride to the BART station .
No hand sanitizer , no gloves , no masks , nothing at all .
"  The guards told Mike that they were releasing people with nonviolent crimes early .
" They did n't say it had anything to do with corona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed .
"  Mike learned about the pandemic on TV .
He says he and the 40 other people in his unit had been quarantined for a week and a half leading up to his release .
" They said it was the flu .
Everybody had to stay in their unit .
Deputies and nurses passed everything through a door .
Some of the staff were wearing gloves and masks , some were n't .
"  Mike says a couple people in his unit had flu symptoms , and were tested for corona , but Mike was never told the results .
" I kept myself clean , kept away from people , " Mike said , " but in jail you do n't have control over what 's happening to you .
they 're bringing new people in , you do n't know what they 've got .
"  After hearing this account , some people might come to the conclusion that it would have been safer to keep Mike locked up .
After all , if public safety was Sheriff Ahern 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with greater precaution ?  Epidemiologists agree that prison walls are no protection against the killer virus we 're facing .
Prisons become incubators where infectious disease can thrive .
With staff and administrators coming and going , inevitably the virus will leak out , increasing the spread in the greater community .
This prediction has already borne out at Santa Rita Jail , with news last week one of their nurses tested positive for the coronavirus .
When Mike was released he went straight to his mother 's house , where he found her boiling oranges and lemons to clean out everyone 's lungs .
On the outside , Mike says he has far more control over his own behavior and practices .
" Seriously , though , " Mike continues , " out here you can do the right thing , keep everything clean , stay indoors , do social distancing , so you wo n't be passing anything on -- and stay informed .
"  Sheriff Ahern did the right thing to decarcerate , but his spending proposal -- which will be voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an egregious contradiction .
Why ca n't the funds freed up from the recent releases be used to improve safety and mental health services for the prisoners that remain ?  With nationwide crime already decreasing during the pandemic , how is jail expansion in any way serving public safety ?  " The whole world is about to be pushed in a whole new way , everybody gon na have to pull together no matter where you 're from , to take care of each other , " Mike said .
" Everybody 's next move is gon na count for something .
"  This pandemic is a moment of reckoning for our country and the world , forcing us to look at the ways mass incarceration has made the moment we 're in even more dangerous .
All indications point towards the coronavirus as a giant storm on the horizon both in our prison system and society at large , a disaster that has n't yet hit .
Unfortunately , in the weeks and months to come these releases may feel like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multimedia journalist , playwright and artist based in Oakland .
