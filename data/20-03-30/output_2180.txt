Full Disclaimer  There was a breathtaking rush here : The Prime Minister of Canada decided to send a major signal to small business that help was coming on Friday , because it could not wait till Monday .
The spiralling fears of Canada 's small-business owners could n't be left unaddressed any longer , so Justin Trudeau stepped out of Rideau Cottage armed with little more than a back-of-the-envelope policy decision to tell them help is on the way .
It is big .
It can , potentially , keep many Canadians in jobs , and allow more of those small businesses to be ready to get back to normal business quickly .
Story continues below advertisement  The plan is to pay 75 per cent of the wages of small businesses whose revenues have been hit by the coronavirus crisis -- a substantial subsidy .
Details still to come on Monday .
They will matter a lot .
The subsidies will be available to " qualifying businesses , " the PM said , without saying what that means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them down on paper over the weekend .
Just sending the signal that the subsidy is coming soon will prevent some layoffs , said Dan Kelly , the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business .
" This will cool a lot of raw nerves right through the economy , " he said .
Things have moved fast .
In this case , the government was always behind .
Only the previous week , on March 18 , Finance Minister Bill Morneau unveiled an economic response plan that included wage subsidies of 10 per cent .
That was in a bill the Liberals tabled Tuesday .
But on Friday , Mr .
Trudeau had to acknowledge it was n't enough .
Not only that , he felt it was urgent to say so now -- and that could not even wait till the details were ready on Monday .
This is the government of Canada catching up to the scale of the problem .
The first response was to put out a plan and wait to see if it needed adjustment .
The government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing , and the economic response did n't get ahead of the curve .
Story continues below advertisement  It is admittedly a steep curve like none seen before , but the Canadian government 's economic response has been slower than the early movers like Australia and smaller in scale than many -- including our U .
neighbours , now passing a US$2-trillion relief bill .
The 10-per-cent wage subsidy Ottawa initially planned was criticized as ineffective from the get-go .
If you are going to do a wage subsidy in these times , it should be large enough to provide real incentive to keep people if payrolls .
This one was a day late and 6 ? dimes short .
So , Mr .
Trudeau had to reassure small business owners -- before another day passed -- that the subsidy would be increased many times over , to 75 per cent .
There was no website with details , no backgrounder , no details .
The government released information on other newly announced measures , such as the deferral of GST and customs duties collection that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a $25-billion program to provide $40,000 loans to small business , $10,000 of which will actually be forgiven -- in effect , a major small-business grant program that might be a lifeline for very small operations .
For larger companies , there were measures to make credit available .
But there was n't even basic info on the increased wage subsidy .
Kelly 's members were calling for details .
Story continues below advertisement  Presumably , the government will cap the amount paid per employee .
There will be criteria for the size of company that can apply .
Morneau indicated the subsidy is for companies whose revenues have been hit by the coronavirus crisis -- those that are battered but not broken -- but there was no indication of the process or how bad the hit has to be .
In New Zealand , for example , a company simply attests that its revenues have declined by 30 per cent .
Over the weekend , the Finance Department will rewrite the policy it wrote last week ( March 18 ) .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The first priority was emergency aid to individuals , and the government revamped its plan dramatically in the week after its first proposal .
Morneau signalled his next step is aid for airlines and the oil-and-gas sector .
In this kind of short , sharp shock to the economy , Mr .
Trudeau 's government is finding it ca n't measure the problem twice before setting the scale of its response .
It has to get ahead of it .
