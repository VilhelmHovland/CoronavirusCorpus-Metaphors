Indian politicians are known to flout the law , often in full public view .
However , one would think that the Corona Virus lockdown is serious enough to keep even politicians indoors .
Exceptions always exist , like this politician from Karnataka , who was videographed playing with his grandson , on an empty road , in total violation of the nationwide lockdown .
Here , watch the video for yourself .
The politician in question is SR Srinivas , the Member of Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) from a town called Gubbi , in Karnataka .
As the video clearly indicates , the politician is following his grandson , who 's in a remote controlled toy car .
What 's more .
This incident happened in front of the police superintendent 's office in Gubbi , in full public view .
A police official seems to be filming the incident on a mobile phone camera .
Over the past few days , high handed police officials have been lathicharging people for loitering and even buying groceries .
However , no such action seems to be taken on the politician , who 's playing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockdown .
In many other parts of India , police officials have even seized vehicles of motorists for violating the lockdown , and some have even been slapped with hefty fines .
Arivalagan , the spokesperson of Janata Dal ( Secular ) -- the political party to which the erring politician belongs to -- has condemned the incident with the following statement ,  During this pandemic which has taken place worldwide , he should not have done it .
He is one the senior most leaders and a 4 -time elected MLA .
He should have greater responsibility during this stage .
His act is entirely condemnable .
There is no question of supporting him .
Whoever it may be , when it concerns our health , they should not be doing like this .
He should have greater responsibility , especially , being an MLA .
The Prime Minister of India , Narendra Modi , announced the nationwide limited lockdown at 8 PM the 24th of March , 2020 , asking everyone to stay indoors from the midnight of 25th March to 14th April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , people were advised to stay put indoors , as a means of preventing the Corona Virus ( COVID-19 ) from spreading .
The idea behind the lockdown is to prevent the virus from infecting more people , and giving India 's health infrastructure a chance to cope with the already infected people .
Such violations by lawmakers will set a very wrong precedent , especially if police officials do not act against them despite clear visual evidence .
