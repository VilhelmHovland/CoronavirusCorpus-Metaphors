A number of elite Jewish athletes have welcomed a decision not to assemble an Australian team for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
JEWISH Australian elite athletes have welcomed a March 23 decision by the Australian Olympic Committee ( AOC ) not to assemble an Australian team for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo amid the global coronavirus crisis .
With all athletes currently unable to properly train , and with upcoming Olympic qualifying events and national championships cancelled or postponed , the AOC 's position is it is clear the Tokyo Games can not be held this July , and Australian athletes needed certainty , and to prioritise their own health and the health of those around them .
Two days after the AOC 's announcement , International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) board member Dick Pound confirmed the IOC had made a decision to postpone the summer Olympic Games , most likely to 2021 .
World number one female canoe slalom athlete , Sydney 's Jessica Fox , expressed relief , claiming it was " totally the right decision , given the circumstances " .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The health and safety of everyone is the priority .
The times are changing , but it 's all about doing what you can with what you 've got , and finding joy .
Look out for each other .
"  Melbourne 's Jemima Montag will turn 22 tomorrow , and she already has the best possible present to celebrate -- a confirmed spot in the Australian Olympic Team for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo .
Mazal tov !  Race walker Jemima Montag qualified for Tokyo last month by winning the Oceania Championships , and said while she shed some tears about the Olympics not being held this year , she is " trying to reframe it as merely a shift of timelines " and is " sending love to anyone who needs it " .
With their training plans thrown out the window , all three expressed relief that common sense has prevailed .
Kiroi-Bogatyreva posted an inspirational message of resilience on social media : " In times of uncertainty , remember where you started and how far you have come ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fine , just wait ! "  Australian Olympic men 's 400m runner Steven Solomon .
Levy tweeted , " Be kind to one another in these difficult and different times .
and most of all , wash your hands ! Remember , what we do now will echo an eternity , in the attitude you display and the behaviour you deliver .
"  Solomon has switched his focus from the track to doing all he can to promote awareness about each individual 's responsibility to contain the spread of COVID-19 , creating a downloadable " Let 's Stop the Coronavirus Wildfire " information resource .
Meanwhile , Maccabi Australia confirmed on March 27 , following advice from the Maccabi World Union , that the 2021 Maccabiah Games in Israel will be postponed from mid-2021 to 2022 .
