In her report to councillors , Thatcher Swann said the increased spending power would be used to urgently cover unexpected work or expenses " during these unprecedented times " .
Such spending would be reported to the emergency committee that councillors agreed to establish last week to respond to the coronavirus outbreak .
A council spokesperson said emergency committee meetings would not be open to the public , but any decisions the committee made would be publicised .
As well as urgent matters relating to the Covid-19 response , the emergency committee is able to consider decisions that would normally be dealt with by regular council committees , which have all been suspended until further notice .
The emergency committee is made up of Mayor Rehette Stoltz , deputy mayor Josh Wharehinga and a regular council committee chairperson ( depending on the matter at hand and availability ) .
At least two members are needed for an emergency committee meeting to be valid .
