Ray-Ban Maker EssilorLuxottica Halts Dividend as Postpones AGM  By Reuters  March 30 , 2020  PARIS -- Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica is suspending its dividend due to the coronavirus pandemic and said on Monday it was delaying its annual shareholder meeting by a month .
Companies in France and elsewhere have come under pressure from unions and governments to forego shareholder payouts to save up cash to weather the crisis , particularly when they are considering taking some form of state aid .
EssilorLuxottica last week scrapped its financial guidance and warned of a hit to second-quarter profit due to the outbreak , adding it was putting some investments on hold as it halted production at selected sites .
The eyewear company , formed in 2018 as a merger between French lens manufacturer Essilor and Italian spectacles maker Luxottica , also said on Monday that Laurent Vacherot , Chief Executive of Essilor , was retiring .
Paul du Saillant , who was deputy CEO , will replace Vacherot as a director on the company 's board and also become Essilor CEO with immediate effect , EssilorLuxottica said .
Essilor and Luxottica 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should run the business .
These culminated last year when Luxottica 's founder and largest shareholder of the new entity , Leonardo Del Vecchio , began an arbitration process .
This was soon abandoned , with the parties pledging to find a new chief executive by the end of 2020 at the latest .
Du Saillant will be given the same as mission as Vacherot had to pursue the integration of the two companies alongside Francesco Milleri , CEO of Luxottica , within the structure headed up by Del Vecchio , executive chairman , and Hubert Sagnieres , executive vice chairman .
EssilorLuxottica , which also owns brands like Oliver Peoples and Oakley , said its annual meeting would take place without any public on June 25 instead of May 15 , mirroring other companies in putting off AGMs amid a broad coronavirus lockdown .
Earlier this month , the company had said the board would propose a dividend of 2 .
euros ( $2 .
) per share .
" The board decided to re-evaluate its previous decision on dividend distribution at a later date .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm , reduce or cancel dividends based on the evolution of the situation , " it said .
