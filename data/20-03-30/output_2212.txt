( Dmitry Kostyukov/The New York Times )  On their peaceful island off France 's Atlantic Coast , some of the locals watched , with growing dread and rage , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent nationwide lockdown to stem the coronavirus outbreak , hordes of Parisians jammed into trains , an odd surfboard sometimes sticking out of the crowd .
There was no doubt about their destination .
" Irresponsible and selfish , " thought Dr .
Cyrille Vartanian , one of the six physicians on Noirmoutier .
With some time to spare -- Paris was roughly five hours away -- a local mayor , No ? l Faucher , moved to block the only bridge to the mainland .
But national authorities said it would be illegal .
" We were powerless because people were not confined to their principal residences , " Faucher recalled , describing the influx as " an invasion .
"  Overnight , the island 's population nearly doubled , to 20,000 .
Nearly two weeks after the nationwide lockdown went into effect March 17 , there are about 70 suspected cases of the coronavirus on the island .
In France and across Europe , affluent city dwellers have been decamping epicentres of the crisis to their second homes , where proximity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decent internet link permits remote work .
But they also bring fears that they will spread the virus to regions with few hospitals to handle a surge of the sick , putting at greater risk local residents who tend to be older and have limited incomes .
Perhaps more than anything else , the influx into second homes has ignited anger over what the global pandemic is laying bare every day : the ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor .
Nowhere is that anger rawer than in France , which has 3 .
million second homes -- far more than any of its neighbours -- and whose domestic politics have been roiled in recent years by debates over inequality .
Unlike the second-home-owning class , many Europeans face the likelihood of spending weeks in quarantine in cramped spaces .
Some have been laid off while others must continue to work , sometimes with limited protection , in low-paying jobs like supermarket cashier or deliveryperson that require contact with people .
At first , the French government urged citizens to work from home in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect of people refusing to work because of the health risks , Bruno Le Maire , the finance minister , urged all employees from " activities that are essential to the functioning of the country to go to their workplaces .

( Dmitry Kostyukov/The New York Times )  According to both locals and Parisians on the island , some urbanites arrived in Noirmoutier and headed straight to the beach .
They were seen picnicking , kite surfing , jogging and biking .
In retribution , tires of about half a dozen cars with Paris plates were slashed .
" Their behavior was unacceptable , " said Fr ? d ? ric Boucard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were on vacation .
"  In Italy , currently the European nation with the most infections and deaths , many fled south from the hard-hit north , the region first put in lockdown .
Although hard figures are unavailable , some officials in the south have attributed new infections to the influx .
Last week , Ruggero Razza , the Sicilian regional council member for health , said on television that many of the new infections in Sicily -- 846 on that day alone -- were caused by an influx of nearly 40,000 people from other regions .
In Spain , Jos ? Mar ? a Aznar , the former prime minister , packed his bags for his holiday villa in Marbella , a celebrity resort on the Mediterranean , leaving Madrid on the very day that the capital shut all schools and universities .
The move fueled anger across social media as well as calls to monitor Aznar and lock him inside his villa .
In Germany , authorities have been discouraging people from moving to their second homes .
In the northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials banned people from using their country homes unless they had come for work .
Hotels in Germany have been ordered to close .
But the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl , in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps , got special permission to stay open for one guest and his entire entourage : King Maha Vajiralongkorn Bodindradebayavarangkun of Thailand .
A frequent visitor to Bavaria , the king also owns a lakeside villa in Tutzing , southwest of Munich .
In Greece , Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a nationwide lockdown last week after thousands of city dwellers ignored his appeals to stay home and fled to villages and islands , which are in no position to handle coronavirus cases if they arrive .
Last week , the mayors of several Aegean Islands asked the government to curb arrivals from the mainland .
The mayor 's office on Milos described the recent arrivals as " Trojan horses that could spread the virus into the community .
"  Other countries -- including Belgium , Norway and Croatia -- have explicitly forbidden people to go to their vacation homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French own second homes , raising the risk of spreading the virus , the government has not limited access .
In fact , France has a long history of exodus from the capital during uncertain times ; past outbreaks of the plague and cholera , along with political trouble , have sent the Parisian elite to the countryside .
" Social elites have always had one foot in the city and one in the country , " said Jean Viard , a sociologist at the National Center for Scientific Research in Paris .
" Leaving town in times of epidemics has always been the rule .
"  The coronavirus is spreading across France as the recent yellow vest movement has reinforced the historic divisions between Paris and the rest of the country , he added .
On Noirmoutier , the mayor , Faucher , said he wondered whether the French government 's relaxed attitude toward the second homes reflected a misguided " desire to relieve the pressure on Paris , " where hospitals were being inundated with infected patients .
But Noirmoutier has no facility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 25 miles away , he said .
Although Vartanian said it was too early to draw a direct link from the coronavirus cases that have appeared on the island to the new arrivals , " it 's well known that the virus does n't move by itself ; it moves with populations .
"  On March 16 , news reports of an imminent lockdown sent tens of thousands of Parisians scrambling .
Train stations experienced a sudden , huge wave of departures , according to the SNCF , France 's national railway .
Car owners could be seen stuffing belongings into their vehicles , especially in the wealthier areas like the 16th arrondissement , where 15% to 20% are estimated to have decamped , said Dani ? le Giazzi , the district 's mayor .
Tensions were particularly high the first few days after the Parisians descended on the island .
If they were n't kite surfing , the Parisians were hoarding .
At a bakery in a neighbourhood called L ' ? pine , one Parisian left with 20 baguettes in her arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on organic cat food , and yet another filled a shopping cart with $325 worth of groceries .
Locals and Parisians fought over the fresh vegetables that were delivered at 10 a .
" They jostled my supervisor of fresh vegetables in trying to create a path from the first leek to the biggest leek , " said Isis Reininger , the manager of the supermarket .
Things have calmed down thanks to law enforcement , Faucher said .
A helicopter flies low over the beach to enforce a new ban , reporting trespassers to police officers on the ground .
Patrol officers have issued 50 warnings to people flouting confinement rules .
Bruce Kelley , an American from Connecticut , and his French wife drove down from Paris to their vacation home , making sure to take their car with the non-Parisian plates .
" Leaving home is a selfish act , and it 's always on our minds to some degree , " Kelley , 59 , said , standing next to his Volvo SUV .
" What was really brutal is being told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach is 200 yards from our home , and nobody is there .
