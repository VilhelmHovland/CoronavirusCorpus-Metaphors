One South Africa leader Mmusi Maimane commented on a clip of an officer beating a civilian :  " Bafethu Cyril Ramaphosa , Ronald Lamola and SA Police Service the civilians are not the enemy .
The virus is the enemy .
This is not right .
Let 's respect civilian rights and have all security officers observe the law .
"  Interim Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen has also slammed the behaviour :  " Those who find the forced squats and push-ups being meted out by the SANDF amusing , just think if this was a member of your family ? This is n't how a professional military conducts itself .
History has shown us that it starts with push ups but always ends in a more sinister way .
"  Member of Parliament Dean Macpherson also weighed in on the issue , calling on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene :  " Let 's not forget who the army and police have taken their orders from and to ' nudge ' people if they do n't listen .
That ' nudge ' has turned into frogmarching , beatings and now bullets .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Briefly .
reported that President Cyril Ramaphosa had urged against ' skop and donner ' tactics , urging the military to be respectful when they engage with civilians  " They will be looking up to you to give them confidence that everything will be alright , they will be looking unto you not as a force of might but as a force of kindness .
This is not the time for skop en donner .
This is a moment to be supportive of our people .
