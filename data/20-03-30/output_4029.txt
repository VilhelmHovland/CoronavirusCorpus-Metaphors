" I felt that the best way was to establish a public trust so that the monies that come do not get intermingled with Government money and all of those problems .
A public trust that is to be managed by an independent body of trustees , so that people will see that these monies are being properly accounted for and properly deployed , " he said .
The President added that the work of the Board will complement the efforts being made by the State in catering for the poor and vulnerable , stressing that " whatever money we raise , that is the target " .

" We have to wish each other the best of luck in these very trying times .
I believe sincerely , my conviction on that is profound , that the cooperation of people like you , the cooperation of the generality of the Ghanaian people , and , of course , the support of the Almighty , I believe that this challenge is one that we shall overcome , " the President concluded .
On behalf of the Board , Justice Sophia Akuffo thanked the President for the confidence reposed in the membership of the committee .
