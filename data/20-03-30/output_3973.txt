In the wake of unprecedented strain on mobile networks during the coronavirus pandemic , ComReg said it will be releasing extra radio spectrum .
With many now staying at home and needing to work remotely or keep in touch with their loved ones , mobile networks have seen an unprecedented surge in demand .
Now , to help ease some of the strain , ComReg has approved plans to release extra radio spectrum to add capacity for mobile phone and broadband connectivity .
The communications regulator said that it has been involved in discussions with telecoms operators , and now plans to release radio spectrum in the 700MHz and the 2 .
bands to allow them to meet increased voice and data traffic .
It also said it has liberalised the use of the existing 2 .
band so that it can be used for 4G connectivity and other technology , rather than just 3G .
This , ComReg said , would just be a temporary measure during the coronavirus pandemic .
The regulator 's commissioner , Jeremy Godfrey , said : " Given the extraordinary growth in usage of mobile services , ComReg is moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploy additional radio spectrum , where this can be of immediate use .
" ComReg will continue to engage with industry and support telecoms companies to ensure that our telecoms networks continue to meet users ' needs during these extremely challenging and evolving times .
"  Global networks under pressure  Minister for Communications Climate Action and the Environment Richard Bruton , TD , added : " We are now more dependent on electronic communications networks and services than we have ever been before .
It is imperative that communications networks and systems continue to work and cater for our changed social and economic needs during the Covid-19 situation .
"  Many countries across the world are experiencing significant strain on their mobile networks at the moment , as recently revealed by Irish telecoms company Spearline .
Its research showed that connectivity and audio quality has experienced a failure rate of as much as 10pc in Italy since the outbreak .
Likewise , audio quality has dipped approximately 4pc below normal levels .
