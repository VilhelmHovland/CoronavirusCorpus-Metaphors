NCAA grants spring-sport athletes , including college golfers , extra year of eligibility due to coronavirus  After a few weeks of disappointing news , college golfers finally are catching a break .
On Monday , the NCAA Division I Council voted to approve an extra year of eligibility for all spring-sport athletes after previously canceling the remainder of spring competitions due to COVID-19 concerns .
As part of the decision , schools will be responsible for the financial costs associated with keeping on the student-athletes .
Schools will have the option to provide equal or less aid to seniors who decide to return for the 2020- ' 21 season and had otherwise exhausted their eligibility , with the NCAA 's Student Assistance Fund available for schools to help finance the scholarships .

However , with pro tours on hold due to the coronavirus ( and uncertainty over what happens when play resumes ) , turning pro in the summer and hoping to play on sponsor 's exemptions might be a more challenging prospect than previously expected for college golfers .
" It 's come up in conversations about going back , but that would probably be the last option , " Augenstein recently told Global Golf Post .
" That may happen only if it 's the worst-case scenario .
Just like when you get done with high school , you want to move on .

Given the unusually early date , and the potential difficultly of getting starts on the PGA Tour or Korn Ferry Tour , some players might go back to school to play for their schools another year and perhaps earn a spot on the U .
team before then turning pro after the 2021 NCAA Championship .
