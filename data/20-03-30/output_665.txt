Hundreds of cars lined up Monday waiting to receive boxes of food from the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank amid the covid-19 crisis .
Unlike last week , the cars were not lining up to get into the Kennywood parking lot but across the street from the food bank 's headquarters in Duquesne .
There was more food to be given away .
Organizers were prepared to serve 1,700 families , a hundred more than last week when some people were turned away .
" We planned for a hundred more because we 're at our home base , not knowing how many people are going to come out .
We just want to make sure we 're prepared , " said Charlese McKinney , network development director of the food bank .
McKinney estimated that 300 cars were already lined up when the food giveaway began at noon .
It was scheduled to last until 3 p .
" It 's a little bit different this time because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said McKinney .
Dozens of volunteers lined up on either side of Grant Avenue loading two boxes of food items into the back seats and trunks of each car .
One box contained canned goods and dry food items such as pasta .
The other box was filled with frozen meats .
McKinney said it was enough food to sustain an average-sized family for about five days .
She said the crowd included more first-time visitors than before .
One of the recipients , Bob Sabol , 66 , of Whitaker said every bit of food helps in this emergency .
" I 'm on a limited income , because I was more or less laid off because of the virus , " said Whitaker .
" This helps a lot , because after my Social Security it leaves me $300 a month for groceries , gas and maintenance on two vehicles .
I 'm very grateful .
"  As the steady line of cars rolled through , volunteer and University of Pittsburgh pre-med student Michael Sutton , 20 , of Mars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The woman behind the wheel told Sutton to put them in the back seat .
Sutton explained that even with the work he 's doing for his online classes and filling out medical school applications , he has nothing better to do .
" It feels great , " he said .
" You can see it in their faces .
Some of them are too embarrassed to say anything because this is their first time receiving from the food bank .
But you can see just how much they appreciate it because they need the help .
"  Volunteer Kathleen Mihm , 52 , of Wexford has five children at home .
She felt it was important to come out to help distribute food .
" As you can see , the boxes are n't really big but people are so appreciative of what little they are getting , " said Mihm .
" You just see so many people come together when people are nervous , scared and it 's nice to see everybody come together to help those less fortunate .

Meanwhile , the food bank announced Monday afternoon that it is discouraging traditional food drives until further notice because of the spread of the coronavirus .
The food bank said it made the decision to ensure the safety of its staff and the community as well as to better allocate employee time to packing food boxes , sorting bulk produce and conducting enhanced cleaning procedures .
" Every food drive donation that comes through our doors requires a staff member or volunteer to sort , organize , and repack , " said Lisa Scales , president and CEO of the food bank .
" With our current temporary restriction of volunteers at our warehouse and the need to get food to our neighbors experiencing hunger in a timely and safe fashion , we are requesting monetary donations in lieu of food donations at this time .
