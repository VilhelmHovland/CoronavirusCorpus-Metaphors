Amid the new coronavirus scare are several health myths going viral on social media platforms and one of those is : Improve your pH levels as " the pH for coronavirus varies from 5 .
to 8 .
"  The message on WhatsApp reads : " All we need to do to beat coronavirus is to take more of an alkaline foods that are above the above pH level of the Virus .
Some of which are : Lemon - 9 .
, Lime - 8 .
, Avocado - 15 .
, Garlic - 13 .
, Mango - 8 .
, Tangerine - 8 .
, Pineapple - 12 .
and Orange - 9 .
It further adds : " Increase your intake of the above to help boost your immune system .
Do not keep this information to yourself only .
Pass it to all your family and friends .
"  According to health experts , boosting your immunity is important but pH level of the new coronavirus is only misinformation .
" Around this time , it is very important to deal with any information cautiously .
There is a lot of information available which has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr Manish Mathur , Specialist-internal medicine on Lybrate , an online healthcare platform , told IANS .
" The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has n't released any data on the coronavirus ' pH level .
In general , alkaline food items are essential to build the body 's immunity .
The stronger the body 's immunity , the better will it fight infections and diseases , " Dr Mathur noted .
pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is .
The range goes from 0 to 14 , with 7 being neutral .
pHs of less than 7 indicate acidity , whereas a pH of greater than 7 indicates a base .
pH is really a measure of the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in the water .
" Consumption of lemon , orange , pineapple and other alkaline food items are suggested by doctors .
It , however , must not be perceived that consumption of these food items will prevent anyone from catching the coronavirus , " said Dr Mathur .
The total number of positive coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign nationals , with 942 active cases , according to the Health Ministry .
According to Bimal Chhajer , Director , SAAOL Heart Centre in New Delhi , though it may not be a well-established fact that consuming foods above pH value 7 may help in fighting against it , but these foods are considered as good immunity boosters and aid in improving the immunity which can help the body to fight against any infection .
" Ten major foods to boost our immunity include eating citrus foods like orange , lemon , amla and kiwi .
Broccoli , spinach , red Pepper ( Shimla mirch ) , and other green leafy vegetables increase our immunity .
A combination of apple cider vinegar , garlic , ginger , honey and lemon is also a very good way to increase immunity , " Chhajer told IANS .
Probiotics like curd or yogurt taken at room temperature helps increase immunity .
" Green tea , tulsi and cinnamon drinks are also healthy as far as immunity is concerned .
Turmeric or haldi extract has the ability to boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus , good for immunity , " said Chhajer .

There is n't enough evidence that decades-old anti-malarial drugs work for the treatment or prevention of coronavirus , but here 's what we do know so far .
President Donald Trump 's excitement about decades-old anti-malarial drugs to treat the coronavirus has touched off widespread interest in the medications , hoarding by some doctors , new clinical trials on the fly and desperation among patients who take them for other conditions .
Many experts say there is n't enough evidence that the drugs work for the coronavirus , but at least a few say there 's little to lose in giving hydroxychloroquine to patients who are severely ill with coronavirus .
" It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might help .
we have literally nothing else to offer these patients other than supportive care , " said Dr .
David Juurlink , an internist and head of the division of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Toronto in Canada .
Here 's what we know and do n't know about the drugs , chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , also known by the brand name Plaquenil .
What We Know  The drugs are approved by the U .
Food and Drug Administration , but not for the treatment of the coronavirus .
The drugs have been around for decades and are approved by the FDA .
Hydroxychloroquine has been approved for the prevention and treatment of acute attacks of malaria , as well as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis .
Chloroquine is approved to prevent and treat malaria .
At a briefing on March 19 , Trump suggested that the FDA had approved hydroxychloroquine for treatment of the coronavirus , which is not accurate .
At the same briefing , Dr .
Stephen Hahn , the FDA 's commissioner said : " That 's a drug that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at , as to whether an expanded-use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients .
And again , we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial -- a large , pragmatic clinical trial -- to actually gather that information and answer the question that needs to be answered and -- asked and answered .
"  A number of hospitals are using the drug to treat patients with the coronavirus .
The University of Washington , the University of Michigan and other academic medical centers have added hydroxychloroquine to their treatment protocols .
" Hydroxychloroquine is an inexpensive and generally safe drug for short term use , with few drug-drug interactions , " the University of Washington protocol says .
" While it is unknown if it is effective to treat COVID-19 , there is a favorable risk:benefit and cost ratio .
Multiple trials are ongoing , and this recommendation will be updated when further data is available .
"  While Trump has talked about the combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin , also known as Zithromax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ azithromycin for use in treatment of COVID-19 , calling the evidence " weak .
"  Patients who rely on hydroxychloroquine for other conditions ca n't get it .
As we reported last week , patients with lupus have not been able to refill their prescriptions .
Anna Valdez , a nurse in California , told us that without the drug , she will likely have a disease flare or have to switch to stronger immune suppressing medicines that could , paradoxically , put her at more risk of serious consequences should she contract the coronavirus .
" When I think about the other people out there with lupus and other autoimmune disorders , we 're all really scared right now , " Valdez said a week ago .
" If I get coronavirus , unlike someone else my age , almost 50 years old , who is likely to recover and will be fine , I will likely end up in the ICU .
"  According to a report by BuzzFeed News , health insurer Kaiser Permanente seems to be prioritizing getting the drug to COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California patient that it would not refill her prescription for hydroxychloroquine .
" Thank you for the sacrifice you will be making for the sake of those that are critically ill ; your sacrifice may actually save lives , " her doctor 's office said in a message .
A Kaiser regional medical director told BuzzFeed that Kaiser , like other health care organizations , " has had to take steps to control the outflow of the medication to ensure access to severely sick patients , including both COVID-19 and those with acute lupus .
Continue Reading  User  Ramesh Popat  Good one ! !  If you are wondering what messgaes to give your family and friends who could be stressed out due to the restrictions imposed in a bid to contain the spread of novel coronavirus , researchers have found out a solution that may work for you .
They found that during uncertain times , messages that validated a person 's feelings were more effective and helpful than ones that were critical or diminished emotions .
The researchers tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as insensitive or unhelpful .
" One recommendation is for people to avoid using language that conveys control or uses arguments without sound justification , " said one of the study authors Xi Tian from the Pennsylvania State University in the US .
" For example , instead of telling a distressed person how to feel , like ' do n't take it so hard ' or ' do n't think about it , ' you could encourage them to talk about their thoughts or feelings so that person can come to their own conclusions about how to change their feelings or behaviours , " Tian said .
The findings , published in a virtual special issue of the Journal of Communication , suggests that your comforting words can have different effects based on how you phrase them .
The researchers said people can try using language that expresses sympathy , care and concern .
For example , " I 'm sorry you are going through this .
I 'm worried about you and how you must be feeling right now .
"  Acknowledging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying " It 's understandable that you are stressed out since it 's something you really care about " -- may also be helpful .
The researchers studied how people responded to a variety of different messages offering emotional support .
They recruited 478 married adults who had recently experienced an argument with their spouse .
After analysing the data , the researchers found that low person-centered support messages did not help people manage their marital disagreement in a way that reduced emotional distress .
In contrast , high person-centred messages produced more emotional improvement and circumvented reactance to social support .
According to the researchers , a highly person-centered message recognises the other person 's feelings and helps the person explore why they might be feeling that way .
Meanwhile , a low person-centred message is critical and challenges the person 's feelings .
For example , " Nobody is worth getting so worked up about .
Stop being so depressed .
