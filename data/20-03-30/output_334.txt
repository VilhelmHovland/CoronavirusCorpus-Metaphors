Amanah KiwiSaver rises in value with substantial cash  KiwiSaver members are now faced with a serious market event that is making them worry about their savings .
As they see their balances drop , there is a belief by some that they should be switching to a ' Conservative Fund .
'  But is this right ?  The term ' Conservative Fund ' refers to the nature of the investments that the fund offers in a document called a Statement of Investment Policies ( SIPO ) .
We looked at the SIPO of an aggressive fund , the strictly Shariah Amanah KiwiSaver Plan because we noticed that its price has stabilised and is showing growth even amidst the Covid-19 crisis .
The Amanah Ethical website states that as on March 3 , 2020 , it sold about 72% of their investments to cash .
Fluctuating fortunes  Under the Financial Markets Conduct Act definition , Amanah is normally an aggressive fund ; but since the market now faces a crisis , as an active manager , it now holds substantially cash ( USD ) .
Cash is the most conservative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the KiwiSavers Cash fluctuates with the strength of the New Zealand Dollar .
How does these definitions relate to Amanah Ethical ?  The definition of aggressive and conservative funds depends on the type of investments the fund makes in normal market circumstances .
Until March 3 , 2020 , Amanah was a very aggressive investor in the US stock market .
In late February , our Investment Committee saw the market risk growing with the cloud of the Covid-19 virus and the risk of disruption to the world supply chains becoming blacker by the day .
Protecting investors  At the start of March 2020 , Amanah moved to protect our investors .
Our SIPO states that Amanah can hold up to 100% cash to manage volatility .
As mentioned , Amanah sold its investments on March 3 , 2020 , with 72% cash .
While we are correctly described as an aggressive fund , we can and have moved to hold substantial cash to buffer volatility .
Cash is a very conservative investment .
This does not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reflects the benefit of an actively managed fund .
This is why our members pay slightly higher fees .
Right now , our investment book is what most would see as conservative , but we are not a conservative fund because as soon as Amanah notices the market stabilising , it will aggressively re-enter the US stock market .
We may not gain in the short term , but over a five-year investment span , we believe that the benefits to our members will be real .
The Message  The message from this is part of the active management/low fees debate .
The problem as we see is that the average KiwiSaver member is ill-equipped to make a rational switching decision because , simply selecting a conservative fund now without understanding the strategy of an active manager like Amanah puts them at risk of making decisions .
This will result loss of money permanently by precipitating the present loss in market value .
