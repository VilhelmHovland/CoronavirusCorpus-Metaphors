He may have left behind a mixed legacy at Air India , but Ashwani Lohani is clearly a babu in demand .
After being at the helm of the troubled carrier twice , and having been chairman of the Railway Board , amongst his other accomplishments , some thought that Lohani 's successful run as a bureaucrat was over .
But the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh has now appointed him chairman of the Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation , with the rank of a Cabinet minister !  It is Lohani 's two stints at Air India that brought him most attention , especially since he had no previous background in aviation , having been an officer of the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he smoothed the ruffled feathers of disgruntled employees , and expanded and repositioned the airline .
His legacy would have endured had he stayed on to oversee its privatisation and ensured a smooth transition .
But clearly , his administrative skills have endeared him to the Andhra chief minister .
He is expected to harness the tourism potential of the state .
He also happens to be the second former babu brought in from Delhi to the state , after former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg .
Of course , this is a matter of consternation to those ruling the roost locally .
Mysterious decline  The appointment of IAS , IPS and other Group A services officers through promotions declined by 50 per cent between 2016 and 2018 .
A Lok Sabha query revealed that the number of appointments through promotion was 2,918 in 2018 .
Comparably , it was 5,953 in 2016 and 5,944 in 2017 .
However , no one seems to know the reason behind this drastic dip in promotions .
According to sources , Department of Personnel and Training ( DoPT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ongoing court cases , fewer retirements , etc .
, but these reasons are insufficient .
Especially when we consider another fact : there are a massive number of vacancies in the Centre .
One reason for this , it is being said , is that promotions from deputy secretary to secretary are made by committees and selection panels .
If there are delays in the meetings of these committees , obviously no promotions can be made .
Whatever it is , it is indeed a confusing situation .
Reckless behaviour  Bureaucrats , by definition , are meant to follow rules and make others follow them too .
But not here , not even when the entire country is locked down and is making a valiant effort to fight the Covid-19 outbreak which is spreading and has claimed several lives .
While the government is strictly enforcing quarantine , social distancing and other methods to check the spread of the epidemic , some babus are still bending the rules to accommodate the wishes of some ' VIPs ' and their ilk .
Those in the know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mumbai who arrived at the airport from the UK , were received on the tarmac and promptly whisked away to their home forgoing the mandatory routine for all passengers who arrive in the country from abroad .
Then a relative of a former minister was seen meeting a foreign emissary at the airport , flouting all rules .
But in terms of sheer officious callousness and stupidity , this has to be it .
West Bengal 's first confirmed case of Covid-19 has forced senior officials to go into self-quarantine .
Apparently , the son of a senior official in the state Home department returned from London , but the youth 's mother , a West Bengal civil service officer promoted to the Indian Administrative Service , still chose to attend office , meet top officials , and go to meetings while her son did n't appear for tests , and rather chose to skip them , until much later when the suspicion was confirmed .
This reckless behaviour has now placed top bureaucrats -- including the director-general of police , the home secretary , and some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when all hands are required on deck to fight the virus that threatens us all .
