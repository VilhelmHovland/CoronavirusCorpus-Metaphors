Coronavirus : Lessons from Bengaluru 's past in dealing with pandemics  History has shown us that societies and countries change , often radically , when they emerge from large crises .
As the world deals with the coronavirus outbreak , a look at what lessons history has to offer Bengaluru from earlier pandemics .
There are numerous theories about the second pandemic that killed millions in Europe .
Some pertain to doctors sporting beaks to prevent themselves from getting infected during the Black Death , some in defence of ' ring around the rosie ' , a children 's rhyme that was believed to be composed during the second pandemic which has now been proven false .
But with the third pandemic striking in the 19th century , scientists are confident that the breadcrumbs lead to China 's southwestern Yunnan province , from where the bubonic plague is believed to have originated and spread across Asia and the US , in particular , through the trade routes originating in British-controlled Hong Kong .
This killed millions across India .
The reasons for the origin of the plague were later attributed to the Han Chinese exploiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades later , when Manchuria faced the pneumonic plague and it spread to parts of China , history tells us clearly that the Russians and the Japanese were far more efficient in handling the pandemic than China .
Mao 's push for the ' Four Pest Campaign ' has left a scar in the way wildlife and ecology is treated in China .
Despite these majestic mistakes , the world has shied away from addressing the root cause of the problem - China .
Before the outbreak happened recently , the world was taking note of the way China has been oppressing its Uighur Muslim population in Xinjiang province .
This is not new .
In fact , the Qing Dynasty massacred the Hui Muslim population during the Panthay Rebellion in the mid-19th century .
This rebellion actually amplified the plague outbreak as a result of the migration that happened to the newly emerging urban centres of China .
This pattern of pandemics originating from China has repeated itself time and again , failing to send a message across to China to correct their historical wrongdoings .
Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1897 , Pune : Around midnight , celebrations for Queen Victoria 's diamond jubilee had just concluded at the Government House .
Chairman of the Special Plague Committee Walter Charles Rand was being followed by the Chapekar Brothers .
Damodar , the eldest brother signalled " gondya ala re ala " , meaning that the target had arrived .
However , it was n't Rand but his military escort who had been killed .
Rand was later shot dead too .
The death was avenged by the brothers due to the oppressive measures adopted by Rand to deal with the plague 's outbreak in Pune .
He ordered that the common man be strip-searched , segregated , and deprived of their belongings to ensure any attempts of outward mobility had been subtracted completely .
Lala Rai , a close aide of Bal Gangadhar Tilak ( who was also in Yerwada prison when Damodar was arrested ) attributed the trigger point for Indian demand for independence to the brothers .
The British were brutal in handling the outbreak of the plague in India .
Ruthless actions were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Handling it ' royally '  Historical records cited in the British Medical Journal have now established that the Mysore Presidency had adopted several measures such as appointment of plague commissioners , regular inoculations , and examinations of travellers entering cities .
People were n't always cooperative .
Untouchability was still practised , and people found excuses to avoid medical examination one way or the other .
In 1898 , nearly 3,000 people died due to unhygienic living conditions around the Bangalore cantonment area .
This was all because a single person who was infected with the bubonic plague arrived from Hubli .
Bombay Presidency was the first to be affected since it was a centre of commerce .
In those days , Dharwad served as a frontier area for the presidency .
So any contact from an infected person meant that the disease would soon find its way to Mysore Presidency in no time .
Temples were dedicated to goddesses who were supposed to have powers to ward off any evil .
There are a lot of things one can learn with the way Mysore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and special relief measures were announced .
This included better sanitation facilities , improved communications infrastructure , wider roads , Victoria Hospital was inaugurated in 1900 by Lord Curzon , and Malleshwaram and Basavangudi saw more accommodations being laid out to those in need .
The State even issued timber and bamboo to financially weaker sections of the society and advances were paid to government servants .
21st Century problem seeks 19th Century solutions  The most actionable measures today adopted by many states come from a legislation that 's more than a century old .
The Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 enables the government to take necessary precautionary and remedial measures .
Karnataka was the first State to implement it on 11 March 2020 with the passing of ' The Karnataka Epidemic Diseases , COVID-19 Regulations , 2020 ' .
Approved to be in effect for one year , it provides certain special powers for the State to handle the situation effectively .
According to the aforementioned law , the State holds special impositional powers .
This is in case the citizens refuse to comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the public and private hospitals to have ' flu corners ' dedicated to screen suspected cases .
Maintenance of records of travel history was carried out at the hospitals on those who were confirmed/suspected to carry the disease .
Takeaways  What do these learnings mean to us today when we are facing an existential threat from the deadly virus from Wuhan ?  Parallels can be drawn between the plague pandemic that hit Bangalore in 1898 and the present situation .
parallels are in the context of the response measures of the government and the behaviour of citizens .
Surely , the experience from the past has helped the State to act sooner and more efficiently .
It must be acknowledged the State government has been so far performing satisfactorily in its efforts .
The current pandemic is possibly a wake-up call to formulate a new comprehensive , updated legislation that addresses the requirements of today .
The State , in the earlier pandemic , slowly but surely did resolve the crisis .
It would do so now as well .
However , just like in 1898 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general public .
Drawing from history , the effectiveness of the solution to today 's crisis lies in our hands .
Several clips of police insensitivity towards civilians have been making the rounds on social media .
The State machinery needs to look into this and ensure a humane way is adopted in dealing with common citizens .
There needs to be reforms in the healthcare sector .
Better infrastructure is needed .
Manufacturing in the time of crisis has proven to be slow .
This needs to pick up .
This is also a right opportunity for us to exhibit India as a better destination for foreign investments than China .
Japan , South Korea , and Taiwan have all offered themselves as a viable alternative to China .
The 14th Century plague has proven that the trade routes contribute to the vulnerabilities that we witness today .
The plague back then began in Hubei ; COVID-19 's origins are in Wuhan , capital of Hubei .
Those reforms that follow the conclusion of the COVID-19 pandemic will make an impact that can be felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for such large-scale reforms , it would be the best case scenario for everyone living in Karnataka .
The present pandemic must give us the right time to introspect on the state of our healthcare and pharmaceutical industry in India .
We import almost 70 percent of our active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs ) .
As geostrategist Brahma Chellaney aptly puts it , China 's dominance on being a giant in the global supply chains has to be challenged .
Having said this , history has shown us that societies and countries change , often radically , when they emerge from large crises .
This history has repeated itself , cruelly .
The only question that arises at the moment is : are we going to learn from it anytime soon ?  ( Edited by Evelyn Ratnakumar )  ( Disclaimer : The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of YourStory .
