I do n't have the UK stats , but falling off ( DIY ) ladders is a leading cause of accidental death in the UK .
I used to do a bit of H &amp; S at festivals .
I know the dangers .
I have done it myself .
Good luck and chance is probably why I am still able to post here .
In these circumstances , it 's easy to over think things .
And trying to process the totality of it all and order it into any sort of coherent model , will probably drive you mad .
Mindfulness is actually very helpful ; in fact three , good deep breaths , will rapidly restore some sense of order .
The main thing is to accept the situation .
Not give in to it , but to just stay calm and do your best .
After that , it will be what it will be .
" All that spiritual advice about living in the present , embracing the moment , the power of now ? Yeah , well , the present is very difficult .
The present is where we are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as you rightly pointed out it 's always been like that anyway .
Only our fragile attempts to escape the now have been seen for the illusion that they are and always will be .
pooh pooh the idea that spiritual insight along with the individuals who share their thoughts on such matters is at best misguided .
we include the Dalai Lama , Mother Teresa , Mahayana Buddhists , followers of the Hindu tradition of Advaita Vedanta ? All of the above were and are founded in tradition of living in ' the now ' including whatever it presents us with .
we should a little more respect to those who like it or not are not wallowing in self pity about how things should have been but accepting that we are where we are .
Only then can the strength be found to change and help those who may need it .
Suzanne used to be one of my least favourite writers on the G .
I dismissed her as a slightly vitriolic proponent of identity politics .
Of course , I still always read her , possibly to fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .
Gradually , over the past 18 months I have started to really enjoy her articles .
I 'm not sure if I have somehow become ' woke ' or the tone of her writing has changed or a bit of both .
As you say , she is never mindless .
IndeedSalary should be dependent upon how soon people notice that you have n't turned up for your work .
It would be a long time before anyone went looking for Jacob Rees Mogg compared to a refuse collector , nurse or lorry driver ?  Flu kills a bit less than 20,000 a year in the UK .
CV has killed only 1000 so far , but the death toll doubles every 3 days if no action is taken .
So , in another 2 weeks , we will pass 20K unless the lockdown starts to have an effect well before then .
Thanks to the lockdown , we are probably looking at a figure in the few tens of thousands before we are done .
With no intervention , it would have been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Visit to Tesco now planned as military style operation complete with mask and improvised Hasmat suit only to find the same shelves empty of those products made in UK like toilet paper and hygiene products .
Chickens too seem to have gone on strike as no eggs and staff unsure when they would be back .
Is this what our Brexit future looks like ?  My wife , who is a teacher in NZ , recommends largely ditching the school curriculum and spending the time teaching your daughter some life skills she might not know .
Baking , cooking , how to clean the bathroom , how to change the oil and wheel in a car etc etc .
If the lockdown continues for longer , do n't wait for her to finish the homework , do it with her and learn whatever she is learning , either for the first time or again .
If it 's any solace , most of us with kids at home are struggling to keep them engaged .
There are times I would happily throttle the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sure they would reciprocate the feeling ! Good luck , you are not alone .
It is perfectly possible to feel a bit shitty and truthfully , acknowledge that yes , you may also be a bit of a shit .
It 's what makes most of us human .
The idea of ' loving oneself first ' as a pre requisite to mental health is astonishingly vacuous , selfish and naive .
It flies in the face of thousands of years of philosophical inquiry into the nature of just what it is to be a human being .
Deaths are doubling approximately every 3 days , not every day as claimed by the OP .
Confirmed new cases are a somewhat unreliable measure subject to significant undercounting , though you could argue that the proportion of undercounting should n't change over time , so it should be able to pick up any flattening of the curve .
Death is a more reliable measure , but is significantly delayed .
It 'll take a couple of weeks for any curve flattening to show up in the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's milk chocolate gives me all the mindfulness I could possibly desire .
A lot of what you fancy does you good , especially in the current circumstances .
Gone are my initial goals to do a keep fit session every day and lose weight .
They did n't last 5 minutes .
one good things about social distancing is being able to escape the loathsome hugging and kissing that now seems to have become de rigeur even with casual acquaintances .
Wonderful article .
When life is overwhelming the best survival is sometimes to zone out , give yourself a mental day off .
And the last paragraph encapsulates the collective sentiment of the country right now : finally the true VIPs who make our living possible are centre stage - the supermarket , warehouse , delivery workers .
The nurses , doctors , porters , physios and other frontline and background hospital workers .
Rail workers and bus drivers allowing key workers to get to work .
But also pride in manufacturers and designers turning their skills to life saving equipment .
" I have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
A&amp;E .
Should I glove up and push a gentle note through their door ? Would that be the neighbourly thing ? "  The law of unintended consequences and the illusion of perceived danger versus real danger has shaped a lot of our response to the virus .
In NZ we are not allowed to head out in canoes , SUP or other water craft , nor allowed to bike on local MTB trails in case it necessitates intervention by the emergency services .
On one level that is totally understandable , though each of those activities can be conducted in a way as to almost entirely mitigate that risk .
Instead , we are broadly encouraged to stay locked in our homes , a place that annually sees more accidents than the workplace and all sporting activities combined .
You can hear the power tools around our neighbourhood and a fair bit of gutter clearing and roof washing is going on .
Statistics tell me that is all going to lead to more A&amp;E visits than a bit of gentle mountain biking or paddling .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape without a bit of inconvenience and it seems a bit whiny to complain of having life disrupted when for some the virus is causing the end of life .
The biggest positive for me is the fairly widespread realisation that society depends on us rather than the authorities and that we have the power to shape our own communities simply by our responses to each other .
I wonder if this will lead to positive outcomes , like reclaiming the streets for ordinary people rather than feral thugs in some parts of the UK ( and NZ ) , once the crisis has abated .
I ; m at a loss to understand why all this angst about being at home - we have generations schooled in social media who will text each other across a table rather than talk - so now .
use your social media .
n't think of ' oh me i 'm so bored or so lonely ' .
let your ego go .
it 's not about you ! ! ! Take a deep breath and enjoy it .
then enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting a bit sick of all the " productivity porn " that has been plastered all over the media - both social and traditional - in recent weeks .
It feels like I can barely move for ads and articles plugging some app or software to revolutionise home working or some new course to transform one 's career or better oneself .
Not to mention the tidal wave of posts , programmes , tips , videos and proclamations about mindfulness and meditation that seems to be sweeping the nation .
Of course , self-improvement is a laudable goal , but in these times of anxiety and angst over things as vital as our health , our family 's health , the economy and our jobs , we really do n't need to be piling more anxiety upon ourselves by worrying about whether we 're engaging in sufficient self-improvement or making the most of this lockdown to transform ourselves into mega-productive **32;738;TOOLONG machines .
Still encountering people who think it 's all a hoax , or exaggerated , or does n't apply to them .
forty years of neoLiberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materially but emotionally .
We 're become so used to lies it 's difficult to believe the truth , particularly when it 's coming to us via lying lies who habitually lie .
One example .
Matt Hancock , the Health Secretary , announced at the press briefing before he disappeared that the government were now testing 10,000 people a day .
This was a lie .
They had the capacity to ( maybe ) test 10,000 people a day .
This was also a lie .
The government said that over the weekend 7,5000 people were now being tested .
This was a lie .
Over the last four days just over 24,000 tests were carried out .
And before you assume this is around 6,000 people per day .
Do n't .
This would be a lie .
The numbers are for tests , not people .
The same person often requires two or three tests .
How many people a day are being tested ? Well , for certain , less than 6,000 a day .
No constituency ( not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most had several to choose from .
And there was always the alternative of not voting .
So ignoring one alternative did not force them to vote for Mr Johnson 's party lol  I wish , I could but I do need my mind to do my job .
Home office and all that but otherwise I agree .
I am watching good old comfort shows , lots of anime and try to keep my mind busy ( outside of work ) with really dumb stuff .
Well , folk voted for Labour to oppose the tories and got a mindless opposition .
Where are they ? Still squabbling over who should be leader , whilst the Tories make sure there wo n't be much worth leading by the time they 've finished .
