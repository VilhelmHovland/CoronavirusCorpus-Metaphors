A loss of taste and smell is a sign of coronavirus -- but it 's still left off official symptoms listCredit : Getty Images - Getty  But some people who have had coronavirus have also reported experiencing a loss of their sense of taste or smell .
Asked about the unusual symptom during the Downing Street press briefing today , the country 's top scientist , Sir Patrick Vallance said it was a feature of the virus .
However , he followed it up by saying that it was up to the Chief Medical Officer , Professor Chris Whitty - who himself is currently self-isolating after showing symptoms - to change the official diagnostics list .
Chief Scientific Adviser , Sir Patrick , said : " The symptoms that the Chief Medical Officer has outlined - and the ones that you should self-isolate on - are a persistent new cough or fever .
The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology ( ENT UK ) , which represents ear , nose and throat experts around the country , say they have seen a ' significant ' number of patients suffering from these effects of Covid-19 .

The organisation says it has told Public Health England about the apparent link .
Meanwhile , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) also said it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-19 .
It 's thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat .
Experts say it 's something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold .
Prof Carl Philpott , of the Norwich Medical School at UEA , said : " Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss -- this is smell loss that persists after a cold .
" There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors .
" So far with Covid-19 , the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss .
"  Cases rise  Meanwhile , there has been almost a 50 per cent rise in just a few days in the number of people being treated for coronavirus in England 's hospitals , according to new figures .

The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) will this week release figures on deaths involving Covid-19 in the wider community , such as care homes .
The ONS will look at deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate , including in combination with other health conditions .
These figures are likely to inform a truer picture of how many people have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus , rather than just looking at deaths in hospitals .
Speaking on a visit to the new NHS Nightingale Hospital on the ExCeL site in east London , Sir Simon said that the number of patients will increase , but extra capacity is being made available .
