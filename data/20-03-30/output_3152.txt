"  Showing more unity than at any time since the G20 was created during the 2008-2009 financial crisis , the leaders said they committed during a videoconference summit to implement and fund all necessary health measures needed to stop the virus ' spread .
" The G20 is committed to do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic , " along with the World Health Organization and other international institutions , they said .
Their statement contained the most conciliatory G20 language on trade in years , pledging to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies and other goods across borders and to resolve supply chain disruptions .
But it stopped well short of calling for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical supplies , with the G20 leaders saying their responses should be coordinated to avoid " unnecessary interference .
"  " Emergency measures aimed at protecting health will be targeted , proportionate , transparent , and temporary , " they said .
The G20 leaders also expressed concern about the risks to fragile countries , notably in Africa , and populations like refugees , acknowledging the need to bolster global financial safety nets and national health systems .
" We are strongly committed to presenting a united front against this common threat , " the G20 leaders said their statement .
Saudi Arabia , the current G20 chair , called the video summit amid earlier criticism of the group 's slow response to the disease .
It has infected more than 500,000 people worldwide , killed almost 24,000 , and is expected to trigger a global recession .
Saudi King Salman , in opening remarks , said G20 countries should resume the normal flow of goods and services , including vital medical supplies , as soon as possible to help restore confidence in the global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over $5 trillion into the global economy , as part of targeted fiscal policy , economic measures and guarantee schemes " to blunt economic fallout from the pandemic .
The amount is about the same as G20 countries injected to prop up the global economy in 2009 .
But a U .
relief bill is pledging $2 trillion in fiscal spending , more than double its commitment from that crisis .
President Donald Trump said later the videoconference showed " tremendous spirit to get this over with .
"  He told a White House news briefing on the coronavirus that the G20 countries were keeping each other informed about their efforts to fight the crisis .
" We 're handling it a little bit in different ways but there is great uniformity , " Trump said .
Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed in a call on Thursday on the importance of cooperation through the G20 and other groupings to help international organizations " eliminate the pandemic quickly and minimize its economic impact , " the White House said .
The meeting displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Russia , an observer to the meeting said .
" Everyone realizes that it is essential to preserve jobs , and to maintain trade flows , not disrupt the supply chains , " said one Brazilian government official with knowledge of the videoconference discussions .
No country advocated " total confinement , " mainly because most of the countries in G20 are not implementing such moves , the official added .
While the group pledged joint action , the leaders ' statement lacked the urgency of the 2009 effort , said Mark Sobel , a former U .
Treasury and International Monetary Fund official .
" It 's endorsing what 's already being done in various countries but it is n't offering a multilateral , global vision .
" said Sobel , now affiliated with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington .
The G20 leaders also asked the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group " to support countries in need using all instruments to the fullest extent .
"  IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva plans to ask the Fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50 billion in emergency financing available to help developing countries deal with the virus , a source familiar with the plans told Reuters .
To boost global liquidity , Georgieva also asked G20 leaders to back a Fund plan to allow member countries to temporarily draw on part of its $1 trillion in overall resources to boost liquidity .
The IMF made a similar move in 2009 with a $250 billion allocation of Special Drawing Rights , its internal unit of currency .
Georgieva gave no specific number in her statement , but observers to the G20 meeting said an SDR allocation of up to $500 billion could be needed .
On the health response , the G20 leaders committed to close the financing gap in the WHO 's response plan and strengthen its mandate as well as expand manufacturing capacity of medical supplies , strengthen capacities to respond to infectious diseases , and share clinical data .
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the G20 to seek support for ramping up funding and production of personal protection equipment for health workers amid a global shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts .
