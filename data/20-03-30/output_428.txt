Coronavirus resources  It was Saturday night on a main street in the South , but locals described something odd : One side of the street was almost normal , if quiet , with restaurants serving dinner and groups of young people milling around .
The other side of the street looked practically vacant .
" There was no foot traffic on the left side , " recalled business owner Janet Atwell , 51 .
Both sides of State Street are in cities called Bristol , but the left side is Virginia , the right side is Tennessee and the yellow line down the middle of the road is both a state border and a new frontier in this country 's uneven response to the coronavirus outbreak that often is breaking down along partisan lines .
Advertisement  The different scenes on either side of the pavement reflected the differing pace of the two state 's governors as they seek to contain the pandemic .
On that Saturday night on March 21 , Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia , a Democrat , had established stricter limits on public gatherings than Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned dining inside restaurants and public gatherings of more than 10 people , but Northam has ordered a larger swath of nonessential businesses to close .
A month after the first coronavirus death in the United States , the state and local officials charged with trying to contain the outbreak here have not settled on a unified strategy .
The country has a naturally decentralized public health infrastructure and a president who is loath to establish nationwide directives and has at times downplayed the threat of the virus .
Experts say the resulting patchwork of policies reflects the country 's partisan divide , with some exceptions .
" There is more resistance to taking aggressive , proactive steps to address the pandemic among Republican governors , " said Jonathan Oberlander , professor and chair of social medicine at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill .

" But for now , at least , it is very much an issue defined by partisan divisions , and that means the response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which impedes our ability to take coordinated action to protect the public 's health .
"  It has left some bordering states , as well as city governments and the states they are in , at odds over the best way to stop the spread of the virus .
Of at least 27 states that have formally issued statewide stay-at-home orders or advisories , only eight have Republican governors ( and two of those governors , in Vermont and Massachusetts , lead mostly Democratic states ) .
The only state in the largely Republican-led Deep South with such an order is Louisiana , which has a Democratic governor and a worsening outbreak of the virus .
Some governors have bucked this trend .
Govenor Mike DeWine of Ohio , a Republican , outpaced many Democrats in announcing aggressive closures in response to the virus weeks ago ; some Democrats , including Northam , have resisted mandating statewide stay-at-home orders .
But the divide goes well beyond governors ' mansions : A poll conducted by Pew last week found 78 percent of Democrats and independents who lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health of the US population , as opposed to 52 percent of Republicans and those who lean toward that party .
President Trump , who initially downplayed the virus and warned that strict containment measures could needlessly harm the economy , has stoked these partisan divisions .
He has also shown an interest in making the response to the virus even more regionalized , pushing for a county-by-county approach that could contribute to further divergence in how red and blue America handles the crisis .
Advertisement  Some of the difference between red and blue states ' response to the virus can be explained by the way the virus has spread .
It exploded in dense , Democratic areas , particularly Seattle and New York City .
But from Monday to Thursday of last week , nine of the 10 states where the number of detected cases grew fastest were won by Trump in 2016 , according to the FiveThirtyEight website .
That could increase pressure on leaders in them to implement stricter containment measures .
In Tennessee , there are 1,373 confirmed cases of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than in Kentucky , where Governor Andy Beshear , a Democrat , has implemented a healthy-at-home order ( Tennessee , however , appears to have done more than three times as many tests as Kentucky ) .
As the virus began to spread , Lee encouraged mayors to pray , according to a phone call obtained by the Chattanooga Times Free Press , and told reporters he did not want to " mandate " the closure of businesses , citing the economic harms .
He is resisting calls from Democrats and doctors to implement a statewide shelter-in-place order .
In Bristol , where two small cities with the same name meet on a main street that has become a lively tourist hub , the existence of different sets of rules has made some residents , business owners , and local officials uncomfortable .

A Republican who voted for Trump in 2016 , Atwell started to get nervous as the virus began to march through the country .
She instructed her staff to disinfect the cues and pool tables between games , and kept wipes out in case her customers wanted to sanitize the balls , too , although she never saw anyone use them .
But it did n't feel like enough .
She closed the bar entirely on March 20 , days before Lee 's dining-in mandate went into effect , even though she felt like she was taking her customers ' freedom by doing so .
" I may be totally different than most people on the Tennessee side , but maybe it 's the nurse in me saying it 's better safe than sorry , " Atwell said .
" I did n't want to be open and exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then walk across the street and potentially harm someone that 's taking more precautions .
"  Advertisement  Justin Brown , 34 , the owner of a tattoo parlor on the Tennessee side of the street , is allowed to stay open under Lee 's orders , although he would be deemed a nonessential business and would have to close if he were located across the street , in Virginia .
But he , too , decided to close up shop .
" Tennessee has , I feel , kind of dropped the ball a bit , " he said .
" I 'm obviously not a medical professional or a scientist or anything like that -- I draw pictures for a living -- but I 'd rather be a little more safe than sorry .
"  Other businesses near the main drag were still open and taking a more relaxed attitude .
Hal Boyd , the co-owner with his brother of Boyd 's bike shop on the Tennessee side , said his business was busier than ever .
" The weather 's turned nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and , in response to a question , joked that people were closer to 6 inches apart than the CDC-recommended 6 feet apart in their cramped store .
" I hope we 're erring on the safe side , " he said .
" We really do n't know , nobody knows how serious this is .
More people have died from the flu in the last several years and you know , they did n't shut it down when we had the swine flu or bird flu .
"  Some localities in Tennessee , including the city of Nashville and Knox County , have issued their own stay-at-home orders .
But leaders in others , including Mayor Chaz Molder of Columbia , say they lack the power to do so even though they want to .
Overall , Molder said , the lack of a clear order from the governor has slowed the overall response from residents , some of whom still view coronavirus as a distant threat .
