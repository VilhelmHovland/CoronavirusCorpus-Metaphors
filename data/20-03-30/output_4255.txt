While hospitals across the world have banned all non-urgent , elective surgeries in the face of the coronavirus crisis -- two of SA 's largest private hospital groups , Netcare and Life Healthcare , are still allowing these operations .
Only Mediclinic has decided to stop all elective surgeries at its hospitals .
In the US , president Trump has called on hospitals to stop these operations -- which include cataract operations , ligament repairs , knee and hip replacements -- immediately , while the UK and Australian public hospitals have banned it already .
In Gauteng state hospitals , these operations have been suspended for more than a week .
The ban is aimed at protecting doctors and nurses -- who are crucial in the fight against coronavirus - from an increased risk of contracting the disease from contact with these patients .
Also , these elective surgery patients are at an increased risk of contracting coronavirus , which could add to infection numbers .
Importantly , elective surgeries can add to the burden on healthcare resources , including using scarce stocks of masks and gloves , and keep beds occupied ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Dr Stefan Smuts , chief clinical officer at Mediclinic Southern Africa , described the group 's decision to ban elective surgeries as a " drastic measure " which will help manage the risk to patients , staff and doctors .
" It is important to limit the movement of people during the lockdown period as far as possible , " says Smuts .
Procedures relating to emergency , life-saving or chronic medical attention will continue .
But Netcare has not yet decided to stop elective surgeries -- it is up to the discretion of the treating doctor , for now .
" We have started to see the transfer of private patients from public to private hospital and are very sensitive to the potential increased demand on the healthcare system .
At this stage , however , Netcare has not taken the decision to cancel elective surgeries , " the group 's medical director Dr Anchen Laubscher said .
Life Healthcare has also not stopped surgeries , and says it is a clinical decision of the treating doctor .
" If surgery or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its associated risks with their doctor , before the admission date , especially in the current context of the Covid-19 pandemic , " says Dr Charl van Loggerenberg , general manager of emergency medicine at Life Healthcare .
While some bodies who represent surgeons , including the Federation of South African Surgeons and the Association of Plastic , Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons of Southern Africa were clear in their support of postponing elective and non-essential surgery , the South African Orthopaedic Association seemed more open to elective surgeries , suggesting that it would be up to each of its members to assess the risks .
Insurers reprimanded  Meanwhile , the country 's financial watchdog has slammed insurers who have declared travelling nurses -- who are collecting bloods samples as part of insurance contracts - as essential services in the lockdown period .
" This not only exposes these nurses and customers unnecessarily but detracts from the ability of laboratories to focus efforts on the pandemic , " the Financial Sector Conduct Authority ( FSCA ) in a strongly-worded statement .
" Given the burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of paramount importance that no additional stress is placed on the medical fraternity .
The FSCA views this conduct in a very serious light .
