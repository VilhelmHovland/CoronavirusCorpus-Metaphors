Wolfert : Long-term care was in crisis even before the onset of COVID-19  The outbreak has been frightening enough for the many Canadians who are relatively young and healthy .
Imagine how much more frightening it would be to an isolated senior whose health was already fragile .
Johanna Wolfert  Updated : March 30 , 2020  At the Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon , Ont .
, several residents have died as a result of COVID-19 .
Stan Behal / Stan Behal/Toronto Sun  Imagine this scenario : The health care system is overloaded .
Demand for beds is skyrocketing , and new patients are being admitted in worse health than those who came before them .
There are not enough workers to keep up .
Overworked staff are burning out , but when some leave or take time off , the pressure builds on those left working short-handed as a result .
Pay is n't high for remaining staff , but even though their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients need them .
They would love to spend a few extra minutes with patients who are lonely and afraid -- to provide comfort and much-needed words of hope -- but there 's barely enough time to meet each patient 's basic physical needs .
Sound like a crisis situation ? It is .
And it is n't imaginary or something the COVID-19 outbreak created .
It 's the reality that Ontario 's long-term care workers have been experiencing for years .
More than ever , we need to be attentive to the pressures threatening Ontario 's long-term care sector .
Compared to 10 years ago , LTC residents today are older , have poorer health and need more support .
They 're among the most vulnerable to severe novel coronavirus complications -- almost all long-term care residents are over age 65 and have underlying medical conditions .
Yet low attraction and retention of LTC workers mean widespread staff shortages , putting both residents and staff at risk .
Four in five LTC homes say they struggle to fill shifts , while nearly half of LTC staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support workers , who provide upwards of 80 per cent of hands-on resident care , is particularly acute .
If ( when ) long-term care workers get sick , it 's critical they stay home to protect residents , but residents still need care even if staff capacity thins .
Meanwhile , working short-handed increases the risk of resident-to-staff violence .
Many LTC workers experience physical , verbal and sexual aggression from residents on a daily basis .
Their number-one recommendation to address the problem ? Increased staffing .
Four in five long-term care homes say they struggle to fill shifts , while nearly half of LTC staff report working short-staffed every day .
Making sure LTC residents get quality hands-on care -- and that the workers who provide this care stay safe -- has never been more urgent .
Especially in times like these , though , LTC residents need more than basic physical care : they need emotional support and encouragement .
The COVID-19 outbreak has been frightening enough for the many Canadians who are relatively young and healthy .
Imagine how much more frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already fragile .
Ontario 's chief medical officer has restricted non-essential visits to LTC facilities , making the social support provided by front-line care workers more important than ever .
Yet it is usually the personal , humanizing aspects of care that are neglected when homes are short on time and staff .
When what should be a patient-centred career becomes an assembly line of care , both residents and workers suffer .
In times of crisis , it 's crucial we give special care to the vulnerable among us .
Front-line workers in LTC homes have been coming in every day -- pandemic or no pandemic -- to provide this care .
These workers have done so despite serious challenges crippling the LTC system , including declining wages for workers , inconsistent and redundant paperwork , uneven access to time-saving technology , and low attraction and retention of staff .
And long-term care workers will continue to do so on the front lines of the greatest public health crisis of our time , outside the relative safety enjoyed by those of us who can work from home .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them , starting by following public health recommendations .
We have a responsibility to protect at-risk LTC residents and those who care for them , which requires our commitment to preventative measures like social distancing during the outbreak -- and to convening stakeholders to address systemic LTC policy issues once the crisis has passed .
Let 's all show our appreciation for the long-term care workers who continue , undeterred by crises , to care for those most at risk in these unprecedented times -- and pray for their continued safety as they carry out their invaluable work .
