Irish company 's pioneering technology for COVID-19 adopted by New York healthcare provider  TECHNOPATH Clinical Diagnostics today announced that Northwell Health , New York State 's largest healthcare provider with 23 hospitals and nearly 800 outpatient facilities , is minimizing the risk of spreading COVID-19 by adopting Technopath 's technology platform that safely neutralizes infectious medical waste .
Northwell is the first health system worldwide to implement Technopath 's pioneering technology .
" According to a recent study by the National Institutes of Health , coronavirus survives on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days1 .
" As Northwell Health significantly ramps up COVID-19 testing to over 1,600 samples daily , there is an urgent need to quickly and reliably minimize the risk of spreading disease from infected medical waste , " said Malcolm Bell , CEO and founder of Technopath .
" Partnering with Northwell to provide the most advanced , environmentally friendly , and cost-effective technology for the treatment of medical waste infected with coronavirus is allowing us to respond to what the World Health Organization has characterized as a global pandemic .
" he added .
Developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously shreds and disinfects infectious medical waste using a patented destruction and disinfection process that kills COVID-19 viruses along with all bacteria , spores and other pathogens that pose a danger to human health .
The technology requires no heat in the process , and no dangerous chemicals emanate from the system at the end of each 20-minute treatment cycle .
The resulting confetti-like solid residue is categorized as regular waste , entirely safe to handle , and can be used in a number of waste to energy and other recycling applications .
" For the past several weeks , Northwell has continued to take on the health and safety challenges posed by COVID-19 , " said Michael Dowling , Northwell president and CEO .
" This new technology allows us to remove the unknown risk exposure when disposing of medical waste while avoiding the need for the costly and carbon-inefficient transportation and disposal by third-party handlers .
It 's a positive light during a unique time .
"  One of the unknown risk exposures to public health safety from COVID-19 is the treatment and disposal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely employed include road-hauling untreated infectious waste from labs and other health care facilities to treatment sites followed by environmentally detrimental thermal treatment and landfilling .
Implementing the Envetec 200 technology comes as Northwell continues to ramp up COVID-19 testing .
Northwell Labs is one of 89 public health laboratories in the US testing for the novel coronavirus and recently advanced to fully automated testing capabilities , which allows the health system to test more than 1,600 potential COVID-19 samples daily .
" The Envetec 200 technology exemplifies Northwell 's dedication and constant search for the very latest and innovative technologies available in healthcare , " said Dwayne Breining , MD , executive director of Northwell Labs .
" We have carefully evaluated our options to eliminate any potential risks associated with the new large-scale testing for COVID-19 being performed at Northwell Labs .
"  Dr .
Breining continued , " We are extremely confident that the Envetec system provides us with the best-in-class technology solution for treating hazardous health care waste at source and also eliminates any unknown risk of infection to the wider community .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commercial operations and employment as markets expand globally for the treatment of infectious medical waste material .
Northwell Labs installed the Envetec 200 technology in late 2019 and has been awaiting regulatory approval , which was fast-tracked on March 13 when New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order to allow a series of special emergency-measures .
Governor Cuomo 's executive order accelerated the formal approvals from the US EPA and the New York State Department of Health that had been pending , enabling Northwell to complete the system validation and put the technology to use .
