President Donald Trump , with Vice President Mike Pence , arrives as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr .

( Yuri Gripas/Abaca Press/TNS )  The continued happy talk from Donald Trump is poorly serving the citizens .
It is keeping some people from self-quarantine , and embracing social distancing .
I walked my dog yesterday and came upon two Trump supporters who I 've known a long time .
They were walking side by side .
I pointed out respectfully that they need a little distance between them .
Next thing I knew they both were yelling , insulting me .
An effort to retrieve reality was not successful .
Advertisement  Our president needs to be honest with the American people so those who love him stop acting in this manner .
Now is the time to be respectful ; now is the time for honesty from elected leaders .
