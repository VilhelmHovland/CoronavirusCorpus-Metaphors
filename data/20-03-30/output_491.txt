Last Sunday morning , after I woke up , my son offered me some of his breakfast .
He made eggs and turkey sausage , which I had never heard of .
Six hours later , the food passed through me .
Then a wave of wooziness swooped through my body from head to toe .
I never felt anything like it before .
Something had invaded my body , and the television , always on with deadly news , made it clear what was happening .
Like thousands of others , I must have it .
Was it the dreaded virus ? Or was it a mild disorder with a heavy topping of anxiety ?  I could n't put it out of my mind .
All I could think of was how I needed to give my wife all my computer passwords , so if something happened to me .
I worried about breathing , and you know when you think of your breathing , it does n't take much to stop its natural flow .
Of course , I searched the Web and found a study published in the American Journal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus patients in China exhibited stomach disorders .
This was my George Costanza moment .
The hypochondriac character on the TV show Seinfeld who thought the smallest ailment ( a white " discoloration " near his mouth ) must be cancer and a certain death sentence .
I ate Saltines and drank lots of water ( something I had forgotten to do that day ) .
I went to bed .
The next morning , I woke up feeling fine .
Everything was right-side up again .
God was playing games with me .
God wanted to scare me .
It worked .
I know I 'm not alone in this paranoia .
My wife , Karen , the least hypochondriatic person I know , thought she had a fever .
Turns out she was cooking over a hot stove .
The next day , she felt the same again , but she was working in the garden on a hot day .
" It scares you , you know ? " she said .
Yeah , we know .
Even Dr .
Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own time enduring what I call " the George Costanza syndrome .
"  A week ago , she said in a White House briefing , she felt feverish .
Hearing that , President Donald J .
Trump quickly scurried away .
She said , " I remember when I was worried Saturday morning , I was trying to think what all did I touch on Friday ? Did I touch a doorknob ? Did I do this ? Did I do that ? Did I not wash my hands ? I mean you go through this whole -- did I touch my face by accident ? "  Hers was a false alarm .
Deborah Birx , White House coronavirus response coordinator , thought she had a fever and got tested for the virus .
Her results were negative , but she discussed the scare with reporters .
( Alex Brandon )  Staying positive  I sought professional help to handle the anxiety .
Elena Lister , my best friend from childhood , is a psychiatrist and professor at Cornell Medical Center in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the epicenter of U .
infections .
I called her and told her about the turkey sausage incident .
She explained that we 're wired in our evolutionary development to emphasize the negative over the positive .
That helped us survive .
" We remember the negative experiences so we do n't repeat them .
It 's a **30;2346;TOOLONG kind of thing , " she said .
" We do that to the future , too .
So we have a thought , and we lose sight of the other options .
For example , my belly hurts .
The immediate thought is , it 's probably COVID .
The other option is , I ate too much turkey sausage .
" So we are prone to be wary and stay alert to the worst outcome to prevent danger for ourselves .
But it 's maladaptive at this point in time .
"  I asked what maladaptive means .
She explained that it 's a leftover hereditary trait , once helpful , that does more harm now .
" It leads to anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said .
We want to be in control , but the nature of this virus is loss of control .
We do n't know if we have it .
We do n't know how we got it .
We do n't know if our family is going to get it .
We do n't know if we 're going to die .
" Sometimes we end up choosing to feel anxiety over other feelings , " she said .

And so , I turned to them .
Let 's dance  What did I turn to ? Humor and positivity .
For my weekly Wednesday night Watchdog Nation newsletter , I spent time gathering my favorite virus jokes , all in good taste .
( " I just went out for a walk .
Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .
" -- Howie Fox ) .
I shared a new dance video created by my pal Michael Hoffman of Carrollton with his daughter Ali in their kitchen .
The video to the song Hold My Hand by Jess Glynne is so much fun that as I watched , I could feel my mouth slowly curl into a wide smile .
You can find it on Facebook or on YouTube ( search " Quarantine Challenge 2k20 " on the Michael and Ali Hoffman channel ) .
As of this writing , their video #QuarantineChallenge2k20 has attracted 8 .
million views on Facebook in less than a week .
" Take a moment to dance in the kitchen , " Michael told viewers in a feature on the WGN morning news show in Chicago .
Avoid the negative  In trying to overcome my caveman 's trait of pushing the negative , I talked to my mentor Tim Durkin , a former Marine and now a business coach and consultant .
Tim always finds sunshine on a dark day .
He made a list of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
People could show more respect to truck drivers because they deliver the food .
Same goes for store stockers who work through the night .
Tim believes politeness and thoughtfulness shown to others are on the upswing .
And he believes we wo n't take our comforts so lightly anymore .
Tim Durkin is a Carrollton-based business coach and consultant who sees the silver lining on big problems .
( Courtesy photo )  Tim added , " We have two generations that have not known any real inconvenience , but they will never forget these times .
And I am convinced they will be better for it .
They will come to realize the power of family and friends , of sharing and sacrifice and of hope and optimism .
"  As for me , what a glorious week of living .
The colors were brighter .
The music sounded better .
The love of family and friends was stronger .
Oh , and I swore off turkey sausage .
