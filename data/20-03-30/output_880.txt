RBNZ GOES FURTHER .
The RBNZ will buy more government bonds , as well as corporate and asset-based securities to support liquidity in the corporate sector .
Basically , it means that banks can sell-on corporate loans to the RBNZ to realise more liquidity .
The RBNZ is hoping that means banks will keep lending to the corporate sector if they know they can offload these loan contracts to the RBNZ .

ANOTHER VERY GOOD YEAR FOR INSURERS According to updated data published today by regulator the RBNZ , insurers booked a +29% rise in profits in 2019 although that was down from a +38% rise in 2018 .
Life insurers however saw their net premium income fall -17% while general insurers booked a rise of more than +8% in premium income .
Insurers earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 to almost $5 .
Some of this will have been unrealised of course so is likely to have crashed since then .
Investment gains made up only 18% of their total net revenue however .
( As a knowledgeable commenter pointed out , this is an industry that has not yet stepped up with premium deferral plans to help get their clients through the current crisis .
Insurance clients have the bridges burned behind them if such arrangements are n't forthcoming .
It is not possible to get or keep a mortgage , for instance , if you do n't keep the house insurance policy up to date .

IAG NZ 'S COVID-19 ASSISTANCE FOR SMEs IAG New Zealand says it will defer premium payments for small businesses experiencing financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
It also says small businesses that need to close premiums due to COVID-19 can maintain full insurance cover on the premises with no increase to their premium .

INSURERS TO ' RESPOND FLEXIBLY &amp; RESPONSIBLY ' The Insurance Council of New Zealand ( ICNZ ) says support for customers ' financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be up to each member to implement .
The ICNZ , whose members do n't include health and life insurers , says its members will continue to handle all insurance claims and support customers .
In addition they will " respond flexibly and responsibly " to those in genuine financial hardship or are vulnerable or have difficulties communicating with them .
The ICNZ says all customers should contact their insurer if they are in genuine financial hardship .

What hope do we have that RBNZ are buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing we need is RBNZ cleaning the balance sheets of banks and taking the hit on their bad loans because that means the tax payer is taking the hit that should have been taken by the banks shareholders .
The type of distress that Smiths City is going through is what the RBNZ is trying to prevent .
Following discussions last Friday , Smiths City 's bank ASB has agreed to delay by four weeks , the repayment of $1 .
million of the company 's $65 million Senior Secured Facility due for payment on Tuesday 31 March 2020 .
Why does n't the RBNZ directly buy the distressed portion of ASB 's loan facility to Smiths City , which would give ASB capacity to function in a normal manner ? But with restrictions to dedicate more lending to productive GDP qualifying enterprises at lower RWA capital requirements .
The cost is being realised by significantly higher value and more regular T Bill tenders .
They also wrongly assume that government deficits create money , when actually they create national debt &amp; growing regressive interest transfers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be serving Link  Responding to the root cause of liquidity dislocation is surely preferred to letting the rentier class disgorge their high quality securities portfolios upon the taxpayer , together with the contingent liabilities , which they are largely underwriting with taxes .
Moreover , who wants Smith City CP ?  Best to concentrate on the local default situation and the impact upon yourself and family and the fact that it is basically irredeemable - China is distant and really uninterested in rounding error nations such as ours .
Im cutting firewood in the drizzle .
6ml so far and that 's just not enough .
back country is short and brown we needed 50 ml or more and it 's just not happening .
Looks like works are cutting kill to %50 for lamb and %30 for beef .
Shaping up to be one hell of a winter , i 'm just trying to grow something before May , when things pretty much stop around here .
Wondering whats going to happen now the US ethanol industry is shutting down , that 's about %30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty clear which victory he is thinking of .
But my prediction is he wo n't be the Republican 's Presidential candidate .
They wo n't publicly roll him , he will resign , or not stand , citing health reasons .
Watching the 6pm news , and as expected it is clear the lockdown is a disaster .
All " guilty " parties are rightly saying but we were told we could choose to " extend our bubble " , that they are " allowed to exercise " , that they are doing x/y/z for their " Mental health " , and that they have stayed local because " I rode my bike here "  All the experts , ministers , and heads of various government departments are now stuck saying yes it is in line with what was stated , but is not in line with the intent .
Talk about polishing a turd .
It is a losing battle when the PM went on National TV and said stay at home , well try and stay at home , well try and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to give out a list of valid excuses .
Sam Morgan argues the usual governmental gradualism is n't enough to deal with the Covid-19 threat .
He calls for more aggressive social distancing and testing measures because " each day of urgency will save lives "  I 've been working full time to respond to the Covid-19 threat through whatever I can do with investors , philanthropists and the companies I 'm connected with to prevent New Zealanders from dying unnecessarily .
And I 'm at a loss as to why more is not being done : we 're simply not going fast enough .
Our Government seems committed to a failed policy of gradualism dressed up as faux-decisiveness .
Our leaders and political systems are designed for peacetime .
We have no experience of wartime .
Our systems do n't understand needing to move before you have the data you would like .
The data may not be here in New Zealand yet , but it is certainly there in front of governments in Italy , US , UK , Spain and so on .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even when they so called cracked down all they did was hand people a pamphlet and send them on their way .
if they had shut the borders a month ago and did proper enforcement and testing of returning kiwis we would not be locked down .
However , there remains confusion and debate as to what activities are permitted under lockdown , with some people under the impression that they can not leave their homes under any circumstances , while others are continuing to walk , surf , run and play golf .
There is evidence of price gouging by the Duopoloy in the Supermarket sector , ostensibly under the guise of excess demand .
Its very subtle but the cost of our shop the day before the shutdown was , shall we say , expensive .
And we did not buy any more than we normally do , no hoarding , with just enough fresh fruit and veggies for a week , and long life milk instead of fresh ( which we normally buy twice a week ) .
When I complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told that tomatoes will be $5,99 per kg at New World by next week .
That 's almost equal to the discount cost of a kilo of Pork , .
frankly we should be outraged , particularly when we have not yet had any frost or very cold weather , and more so given tomatoes can be grown all year round in tunnels .
Someone somewhere is clipping a very big ticket in this scam  Maybe its time some entrepreneur brought in tomatoes from the Phllippines ( they are around 70 cents a Kg there ) , like we do with bananas and pineapples , or Australia where they are retailing at Aus $2,99 in Qld .
We could be more than 100% more expensive than Aussie by next week it appears .
There is not much we can do about this other than vote with our $ and not pay outrageous prices for anything where we feel we are being fleeced  So for me its quite simple , we will not be buying tomatoes at that price , and hope others follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded , it will serve that bunch of thugs running our supermarkets right  Supermarkets have held growers and consumers to ransom for years with their anti-competitive behaviour .
They bully the growers for low prices then mark it up to on sell to us .
Ever wonder why so many local butchers have closed over the recent years ?  yes Smiths City has made bad decisions ROY Campbell is away with fairies , they have employed staff and got rid of long servers , there flagship store is run by ex warehouse stationery staff who do n't have a clue about the old traditional offerings We have spent 40k with group over 36 months BUT would never deal with company again due lack of knowledge .
