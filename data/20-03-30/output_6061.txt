One would think that with the coronavirus crisis now sweeping the world , shuttering businesses and squeezing income dry , art would be the last thing on anyone 's mind .
That it should take a back seat to other , more urgent matters ( like food security and access to medical care ) .
That art , in fact , has become irrelevant .
Well , not quite yet .
There 's a great initiative coming from artists who want to help medical frontliners in the most logical way they can : selling artworks , with the proceeds intended to go to producing urgent medical protective gear .
This is " Art in the Front " , an online auction that was the brainchild of Cebu artists and art lovers like Pia Mercado , Golda King , Jean " Govinda " Marquesto , and Uzi Emperado .
Nope , this was n't thought of as a gimmick by profit-minded galleries , or an idle play-ploy by wealthy collectors .
This fundraiser is artist-led , and what a laudable initiative it is .
This auction ( started last Friday night , and running until April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I love my alma mater ) to support UP Fablab .
Fablab will , in turn , produce face shields , scrub suits , intubation kits and 3D-printed ventilation valves ( I actually do n't know what the second half of the items listed is , but they sound pretty impressive ) .
Despite the many choices available to me in curfew-capital Manila ( not ) , I planted myself in front of my computer and started checking out the artworks for sale .
I was elated to learn that Cebu favorites like pop-artist Kenichi Wani , contemporary media artists Happy Garaje , and of course , ideators Golda King and company , had pitched in with collectible pieces not normally found in the art market .
I was also delighted to see fashion designer Oj Hofer contributing a sketch , a vivid red slash , just a few strokes capturing perfectly a stylish fashion plate .
I would have thought that perhaps , Oj could have donated one of his sculptural dresses that so elegantly robes his muses .
That was before I realized that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marries his zen-Japanese obsession with his fashion design roots , as well as his UP Fine Arts background .
Anyone want a one-of-a-kind sketch by Oj ?  Photographer Joseph Ong had a bouffant-coiffured model up for sale , and Wyndelle Remonde offered up a self-portrait at a bargain .
Even a Manila favorite , the street artist Distortmonsters , had contributed a winsome piece titled " Girl Scout Cookies " with a starting bid of half his usual prices .
I 'm actually hoping more artists from all over will pitch in and toss over more works to the pot , so that my insatiable hunger for encountering artists and artworks gets fed .
Sort of .
For example , scrolling through the choices , I chanced upon watercolorist Aliver Escano 's ' scapes of beach and city , Marianne Guinto 's still lifes , and Guido Lubanga 's pen and ink sketches .
Gorgeous discoveries !  What a great , guilt-free excuse to purchase art .
For starters , and just to get things rolling , I placed bids on a couple of works by perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come Saturday morning the next day , I was gratified to see that I had already been outbid by other well-meaning citizens .
Happy to concede , fellow bidders !  So while Cebu and the rest of the country hunker down for the province-wide lockdown , my immediate request is for more art lovers to get online and start outbidding each other .
No need to even get off your butts - stay planted on your couch ! Might as well do good from the comfort of our homes - while we can !  The presence of Chinese vessels near Pag-asa Island , a fifth-class island town of Palawan located in the disputed Spratlys Island chain in the South China Sea , is not new to the Department of National Defense .
