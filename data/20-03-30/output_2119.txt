BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union marked the 25th anniversary of its open-border Schengen agreement on Thursday with all its land borders shut or subject to heavy checks imposed in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus .
The Schengen agreement , underpinning an increasingly integrated and united Europe , came into force on March 26 , 1995 .
It initially abolished checks at frontiers between France , Germany , Belgium , the Netherlands , Luxembourg , Spain and Portugal .
In the following months and years others joined , and today the Schengen zone has 26 members , including non-EU nations Switzerland and Norway .
But on its 25th anniversary , the agreement is virtually suspended because of the coronavirus , which has frozen most economic and social activity , disrupted supply chains and turned most Europeans into prisoners in their own homes .
" The COVID-19 outbreak is having a major disruptive impact on European cross-border mobility and transport , " an internal document of the European Commission said , referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus .
The document , dated March 25 , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the exception of Ireland , which is not a member of the Schengen area and does not share any land border with EU states following Britain 's exit from the bloc .
" THERE 'S NOTHING WE CAN DO "  Airports in all but five EU states are subject to restrictions on arrivals and flights , the Commission document said , warning about the disruption caused by such measures on the supply of goods , including essential ones such as drugs .
" The very life of many of our citizens relies on unhindered movement across borders of workers , essential medical supplies and goods of first necessity , " Jean Asselborn , foreign minister of Luxembourg , where the town of Schengen is located , said on Thursday .
He called for the lifting of checks and the reopening of borders as soon as possible .
But even the founding members of the Schengen accord have shut their borders , despite experts ' advice that the measure is not effective against the virus .
" I had heard in the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect that there would be such strict controls .
There 's nothing we can do about it , " said Dutch commuter Bart Jansen .
He was trying to go to work from his home town of Breda in the Netherlands via a shortcut on Belgian territory , but was not allowed to enter Belgium .
The two countries were , along with Luxembourg , France and West Germany , the signatories of the original Schengen agreement in 1985 , 10 years before its application .
