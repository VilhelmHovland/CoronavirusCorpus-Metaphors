All gatherings of more than two people in public -- excluding people you live with .
All social events , including weddings , baptisms and other ceremonies , but excluding funerals .
How long are the rules in force ?  The new rules are enforced immediately , as of the Prime Minister 's declaration on Monday night .

He explained : " To put it simply , if too many people become seriously unwell at one time , the NHS will be unable to handle it - meaning more people are likely to die , not just from Coronavirus but from other illnesses as well .
So it 's vital to slow the spread of the disease .
" From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home .
" Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households .
