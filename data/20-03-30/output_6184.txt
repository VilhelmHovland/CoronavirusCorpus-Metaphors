There is no better place than Rome for someone studying to become a Catholic priest .
But as coronavirus took hold of the European country , Bendigo 's Jackson Saunders was forced to make the decision to leave Italy and return to Australia .
He arrived back in Bendigo on Saturday and is currently in the mandatory 14-day self-isolation period .
Mr Saunders is a seminarian student priest with the Catholic Diocese of Sandhurst .
He arrived in Rome last July to begin four years of study at the Gregorian University .
Last week , as the situation in Italy grew worse and more advice from the Australian government was released , Mr Saunders made the decision to come home .
" I 'm grateful that I made the call to come home , it was getting harder and harder to leave , " he said .
" I felt it was appropriate to come home at this time .
" The situation in Italy , sadly , is worsening .
The Australian government had advised all Aussies to return home and Qantas and Virgin were cutting back travel .
" I also knew my family and friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" READ MORE : It took three flights for Mr Saunders to make it from Rome to Melbourne with stops in Frankfurt and Abu Dhabi part of his journey .
" It was fascinating .
I was lucky to get home and I just made it home , " he said .
" When I left Rome 90 per cent of people were wearing masks including me .
" What stood out going through Frankfurt was that it felt like I was walking up my home dirt road in Marong .
There was no one in sight for five minutes at one point .
It seemed like I was in the airport on my own .
You could see airports were shutting down .
" The flight from Germany to Abu Dhabi had 21 people on it , so I was lucky that it went ahead .
Coming home to Melbourne people were anxious to get home , understandably .
One couple in Rome had cut their honeymoon short and another had been to a family wedding in Ireland and were eight days into a 24 day holiday .

" It was about a month ago that coronavirus first surfaced in Italy .
It sort of appeared overnight , " Mr Saunders said .
" I follow the news quite closely on The Age , 3AW and the Bendigo Advertiser and they were talking about Italy all of a sudden .
" We were briefed and told to prepare .
All our classes at university had been suspended and the only things open were considered essential services like supermarkets , hospitals , pharmacies and , funnily enough , tobacco shops .
" At first I made the decision to stay .
I was in a good environment and well cared for , so I thought it would be okay to stay .
In the last week the number ( of cases ) spiked and I began to feel anxious .
" Last week it hit me how serious it was but before that I hoped things would calm down and settle .

He has also heard of positive actions people are doing to ensure everyone is able to get by .
READ MORE : " Italy perhaps reacted a little slowly ( but ) the measures Australia put in place are good , " he said .
" It 's important Australians keep themselves safe .
We should take care of each other .
" ( In Italy ) , I was inspired by the way the Romans united with one another .
Each night the locals sing on their balconies at 6pm as a sign of support and solidarity .
It was uplifting to hear .
" The other day , I had a message from a friend who had been to Newstead to take groceries to people who were housebound , at St Kilian 's priests celebrated Mass with no delegation but more than 400 watched online .
You can sense people are united together .
" We are lucky in Australia and have lots to be grateful for .
The Aussie spirit during the bushfire crisis ( was amazing ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tough months ahead but if we follow the advice , we 'll get through this with hope and a sense of joy in looking out for one another .
" As Mr Saunders continues his self-isolation , he will continue his studies from Bendigo .
" Thankfully I am continuing my university studies online from Rome and through independent reading , " he said .
" I will do that for a couple months .
Once out of isolation , I will go to a parish somewhere in Sandhurst .
" Originally , I was supposed to be ( in Rome ) for four years and was going to be home for July .
The way things are looking , I doubt I 'll back in Rome before July but I will just take it one day at a time .
