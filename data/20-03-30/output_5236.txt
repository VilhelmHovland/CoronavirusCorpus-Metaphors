Getting ready for business revival ? What about supply chains ?  AS we are hit by two major interrelated crises , a balanced response to keep the effects of both at manageable proportions is needed to mitigate their immediate but also future effects .
One crisis is Covid-19 's very contagious influenza infection , the other one is the hype and to some extent the overreactions manifested largely in overly bureaucratic restrictions , and limited answers about how to handle the future , beyond the restrictions .
It is important for us to outline the negative effect of the Covid-19 hysteria on business in general , and supply chains in particular .
Let 's start with international logistics :  A lot of flights are suspended and sailings are canceled .
This means that air cargo can be difficult and circuitous .
Since most of the cargo is still carried on passenger planes and with air travel mostly suspended , it can be very challenging to send airfreight .
Airlines are now planning to convert passenger planes into cargo planes .
For exports , there is a sufficient supply of containers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manila .
Another challenge for export is the closure of the Manila International Container Terminal ( MICT ) at the North Harbor as what had happened a week ago .
This will be a big problem if repeated .
International logistics hitting the Philippines :  Traffic of imports remains moderately okay with the Manila International Port ( MIP ) still receiving about 3,800 containers daily .
Especially worrying , however , is that food and medical supplies in refrigerated containers ( reefer containers ) are facing problems as they arrive in the Philippines .
Evergreen and Cosco for now refuse reefer shipments to the Manila port due to lack of plug-ins , but acceptreefers for Batangas and Subic .
There also has been a rush of importers delaying their imports mainly due to government mandated closures of restaurants and other establishments .
MIP suffers from huge numbers of reefers already at port and is struggling to accommodate them , some of them overstaying for long periods already .
Clearance of general and bulk cargo ships takes long , especially for ships with Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships stay at anchorage until Bureau of Quarantine gives the clearance to berth .
The significant number of factories either closed or only partially operating results in a buildup of overstaying import containers in the MIP as import withdrawals dropped by more than 25 percent .
South Harbor is now at 65 percent , while the MIP is at 74-percent storage space utilization .
With the government mandated lockdowns allowing only a few industries considered vital to operate and even these industries ordered to operate only on skeletal work force , we can expect a buildup of imports in Manila ports to substitute missing local supply .
However , Batangas and Subic can still take additional volume .
Both are pushing hard to get more cargoes into their ports where their utilization is still below 50 percent .
Local logistics : From production to market  Despite the several issued by the Department of Trade and Industry issues memos coupled with Department of the Interior and Local Government , specifically stating the free flow of goods , this is hampered by several local government units having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention toward unhampered deliveries is focused on Luzon only .
It urgently needs to be extended to the Visayas and Mindanao .
Additionally , DILG has stressed to LGUs not to stop the transport of goods !  The greatest challenge however is getting people to work .
With all types of public transport suspended from air , sea and land , it has been extremely challenging to get people to work .
Regarding domestic sea freight , there are a number of carriers suspending services either due to a lack of cargo or the ports they are calling are closed either due to a government mandated lockdown or lack of workers reporting for work .
Due to curfew and limited opening hours of wet markets , deliveries must be on time , which rely on supply lanes be free , so that shortages are not likely to occur .
Supply chains have to be studied and effectively implemented .
Several meat processors have giving warning signals that due to shortage of raw materials and particularly labor they ca n't assure adequate supply to be available to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From export producers to export markets  Once trucks can get through the checkpoints in the provinces and will reach Manila , and when they go back to their respective towns , or provinces , they often wo n't be allowed to go in until having passed through a 14-day incubation period .
Truckers have , therefore , stopped their pick-up and deliveries .
This is not acceptable .
Truckers need to be provided with special IDs .
Life goes on and the economy needs to be kept going .
Additionally , activities in Philippine Economic Zone Authority remain restricted and very limited ( especially due to restricted movement of people ) , hence , there are only a few export shipments from Peza .
This is a big concern and it is foolish not to keep Peza companies going .
Again , special IDs and special tests are needed .
Trusting that business activities will be allowed to reactivate operations during the second half of April , what should be high on management 's list ?  Shoring up supply chains  Business needs to reevaluate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to a quasi-standstill .
Businesses will have to reevaluate their supply chains and look to diversify them .
However , logistical hurdles are making it harder to get products from around the world due to panic buying and the threat of labor crunches .
As governments take nationalistic approaches , they risk disrupting an international system that has become increasingly interconnected in recent decades .
