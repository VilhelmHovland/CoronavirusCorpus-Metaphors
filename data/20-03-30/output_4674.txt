The Premier League has discussed plans for its clubs to play the rest of the 2019-20 season in an isolated " World Cup-style " camp in London and the midlands of England over June and July , according to The Independent .
Currently , the likeliest solution to finish the season is reportedly to play games " behind closed doors , " though the idea of camps has apparently gained traction among the clubs .
The reason for interest is reportedly the allure of increased television ratings thanks to the special nature of the event .
Plans have reportedly been drawn up to televise all 92 matches remaining in the season , with a handful every day over the summer months .
How would this Premier League camp work amid the coronavirus pandemic ?  Basically , clubs and their staffs would be confined to separate hotels away from their families with full testing and quarantine conditions .
Training ground pitches have been reportedly discussed as possible venues , such as St .
George 's Park .
Ideally , such a setup will minimize the risk of players contracting the coronavirus .
Just one positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  By waiting until June and July , the league reportedly hopes a more rigorous testing system will be in place and hospitals will be less slammed by coronavirus cases .
It 's impossible to envision this being pulled off without readily available testing for all involved .
Every Premier League will be clamoring to restart the season , but none more so than Liverpool .

Many other people would also have to be quarantined , including officials and television crews .
The possibility of a basic player injury during the game also raises an uncomfortable question about the plan , per the Independent :  " Where does a player who does his cruciate or breaks his leg go after he 's stretchered off ? " one source privy to the plans asked .
" Hospitals will have much bigger concerns .
The Premier League would almost have to have a private hospital blocked off .
"  Given how much of an uproar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wealthy -- having much easier access to testing and treatment , the idea of blocking off a private hospital just for sports injuries , even if the coronavirus is more under control by then , would not be a popular one .
But that might just be how desperate leagues are to return to play .
The United Kingdom government is also reportedly keen on the idea , as many of its citizens deal with the grind of self-isolation amid the outbreak .
The return of the Premier League would be a boost to isolated people around the world , especially the Liverpool fans .
Plenty of other leagues will also probably be plenty interested in the idea if the Premier League looks like it can pull it off .
