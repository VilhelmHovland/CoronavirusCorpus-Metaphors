In a Twitter post , the politician compared Kenya 's state of preparedness with that of Nigeria which is currently building one of the largest isolation centres in Lagos after reporting 97 cases of COVID-19 .
" So what 's the real situation of COVID-19 in Kenya when the Government is not telling/showing us where the COVID-19 billions are being spent ? Look at Nigeria ! With a population of 190 million and 97 COVID-19 cases , " he said .
He also defended Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie saying he should not be blamed for saying there are 7000 people under quarantine in the country .
" Do n't blame Kiarie John with his claim of 7000 in quarantine , be open ! " he added .
Kiarie had indicated the country should be expecting the coronavirus cases to rise up to more than 10,000 by May 2020 over what he said was lack of enough testing kits and that the country may be having more cases than what is being reported .
Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie said Kenyans should prepare for the worst .
