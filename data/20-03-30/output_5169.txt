Last Updated : Monday 30 March 2020  A deserted Rajpath in New Delhi on March 25 .
Photo : Vikas Choudhary / CSE  As vehicles go off the road after the country-wide lockdown in the wake of the novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) outbreak , the typical two humps of daily pollution coinciding with morning and evening traffic peak-hours have nearly flattened out in India 's big cities .
As cities slow down to fight the pandemic , daily average levels of particulate matter of size less than 2 .
micron ( PM2 .
) and nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) have reduced sharply from the pre-lockdown days by close to more than half in Delhi and the towns of the national capital region ( NCR ) .
A similar trend is evident in other big cities including Mumbai , Kolkata , Bengaluru , Hyderabad and Chennai .
But the impact of this overall declining trend is dramatic on daily peak-hour pollution .
This is evident from the new analysis carried out by the Centre for Science and Environment that has assessed hourly trend in PM2 .
and NO2 levels during the day before and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janata curfew .
This brings out the pronounced effect of traffic on hourly pollution trends .
With traffic minimised , hourly trends have plummeted , reducing daily exposures to toxic vehicular pollution .
While overall daily levels of PM2 .
and NO2 concentrations have fallen significantly -- by up to 60 per cent in several cities during the lockdown days , the hourly change is also dramatic .
Hourly NO2 levels that are strongly associated with vehicles , have dropped more sharply .
Hourly PM2 .
levels that are also influenced by other pollution sources have reduced substantially .
For comparison , the average of March 18-19 , 2020 , have been taken as regular days and the average of March 25-26 as lockdown days .
Janata curfew was on March 22 , 2020 .
Real-time data has been sourced from the website of the Central Pollution Control Board .
Normally , on regular days , peak hour pollution during morning and evening traffic hours inflates like a balloon .
But after the lockdown and imposition of curfew , the peak hour PM2 .
concentrations have dropped by 57 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 62 per cent in Faridabad and Noida , and 64 per cent in Ghaziabad .
Similarly , peak hour NO2 concentration has dropped sharply -- by 64 per cent in Delhi , 66 per cent in Gurugram , 40 per cent in Faridabad , 79 per cent in Noida , and 75 per cent in Ghaziabad .
From studies done by SAFAR and TERI-ARAI in 2018 , it is known that vehicles contribute about 40 per cent of the total particulate load in Delhi .
According to SAFAR , vehicles contribute about 62 .
per cent of the NOx load and according to TERI-ARAI , 81 .
per cent of NOx load .
The overall impact during the lockdown is hugely substantial .
Comparatively , the effect is somewhat lesser on Janata curfew day in Delhi and NCR .
This could be due to the shorter duration of Janata curfew ( 14 hours ) that had also shifted the peak hours beyond the curfew hours .
It is also reported that people had rushed out for panic buying on that day .
But this experience is different in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other cities including Kolkata , Mumbai , Bengaluru , Hyderabad and Chennai also witnessed a drastic drop in peak hour pollution and also daily average levels with some variation .
Mumbai was the first one to lockdown and shows a sharper drop .
Kolkata has witnessed a higher drop on Janata curfew day , compared to the subsequent lockdown days .
Overall , peak hour NO2 levels during locked-down days show a sharper drop than PM2 .
in all these cities as well .
In Kolkata , peak hour PM2 .
reduced by 46 per cent and NO2 by 74 per cent on a lockdown day .
Similarly , in Mumbai , it is 52 per cent and 85 per cent respectively ; in Bengaluru , it is 42 per cent and 76 per cent respectively ; in Hyderabad , 32 per cent and 72 per cent respectively and in Chennai , it is 46 per cent vs 44 per cent .
The take away  Emergency response to the pandemic has induced this change in air quality and hourly concentrations .
This does not make a case for crisis-led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight the new health crisis have somewhat tamed the health risk associated with the ongoing air pollution crisis to give a short breather .
This change has been possible due to massive community-wide lifestyle adjustments to practice social distancing .
This proves why we need strong action to reduce traffic volume and phase in a near zero emissions mandate .
This crisis-induced change must force us to find and sustain long-term solutions to reduce our vulnerability to toxic risk .
