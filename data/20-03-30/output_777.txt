David Crook was in a less than ideal situation paying rent on two San Francisco apartments .
Then the shelter-in-place order hit .
Crook and his wife were planning to move from the Mission to lower Pacific Heights on March 25 .
They had moving van parking permits from the city , movers scheduled , and arrangements with PG&amp;E and Xfinity to switch service .
That 's when " all hell broke loose , " he said .
The city canceled the moving van permits .
The movers said they would still come , but Crook did n't know if it was a good idea .
Meanwhile , the couple was juggling two landlords -- seeing if they could stay in their old apartment while holding a place ( ideally rent-free ) in the new one .
" This is beyond anybody 's ability to plan ahead for , " Crook said .
Crook , like countless others in the process of moving into , out of , or within the Bay Area during a pandemic , was stuck in limbo .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do tell everyone to stay home .
The San Francisco Department of Emergency Management has since clarified that Bay Area residents can still move .
If their movers are willing , the workers should practice 6 feet of social distancing and sanitation as specified in the order .
Coronavirus Outbreak  " Residents do not need to cancel their moving plans -- they are free to move .
But they should follow social distancing and we strongly recommend self-isolating when they arrive at their destination to not put others at risk , " a city representative said in an email .

James , Erika Carlos  " I think she 's going to move anyways and she 's going to sleep on the mattress on the floor .
It stinks .
There 's bigger problems even for me in the world right now .
It 's materially problematic for us .
I 've got two kids and it 's a small house and now we 're in a room with no furniture , " he said .
Snow was also frustrated by the inconsistency in delivery services .
While he was able to order an enclosure for his son 's rabbit and a new litter box for his girlfriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace , he does n't yet have a bed .
" The uncertainty , just like it affects businesses , it affects personal decisions as well , " he said .
Snow subsequently received a message that deliveries were restarting and he would get his new furniture by March 31 .
West Elm , owned by Williams Sonoma , did n't respond to a request for comment .
Crook and his wife decided to go ahead with the move on Wednesday because they ca n't afford two rents .
They plan to load essentials like computers , food , cleaning supplies and medicines into a U-Haul and take it to the new place before the movers arrive .
They 'll then leave the new apartment before the movers arrive to place the heaviest items -- a bed , armoire , bookcases and desk .
Those will sit for days , in a quarantine of sorts , before being cleaned and positioned .
