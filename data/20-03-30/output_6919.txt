Ocean City extends beach closures , ' requests ' people not visit during COVID-19  Ocean City leaders reinforced their COVID-19 message to the public again Sunday ; do n't come to Ocean City right now .
The mayor and Town Council reiterated their request and now demand to the public in a Sunday afternoon closed-session council meeting after it seems that the town was only getting partial compliance from the public .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not listening to our requests , " said Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan .
" We 've asked visitors and non-resident property owners not to travel to Ocean City at this time .
Unfortunately not everybody is adhering to that .
"  Meehan and the rest of the council met for an impromptu closed-session meeting Sunday afternoon to discuss the town 's continued response to COVID-19 .
After the meeting the council came out with stronger messaging and new restrictions to gain the compliance of the community in the fight against the novel coronavirus .

Originally the closure was set to expire on April 15 .
Meehan also reminded non-resident property owners from states such as New Jersey , New York and Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days .
Under the town 's new plan property owners are asked not to rent out their properties through April 30 , Meehan said .
The request includes property owners who use Airbnb , VRBO or any other third-party rental service .
" It is their right to rent their properties when they want to through those agencies , but we 're asking them not to rent those properties at this time , " Meehan said .
That request is also being extended to hotels in town , Meehan said .
The town is working with the Ocean City Hotel-Motel Restaurant Association to ask hotels to convey its COVID-19 message to anyone who calls seeking to make a reservation .
Ocean City is closely monitoring the situation , Meehan said .
The town is also listening to its residents , visitors and business owners , and trying to protect them .
The goal of the town 's new orders , Meehan said , is to protect residents and visitors and hopefully be able to open Ocean City for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement to the situation that we were facing with regard to people coming into Ocean City , and I think our previous actions have reduced the numbers , " Meehan said .
To keep that progress and not regress , Meehan said people need to listen to Ocean City 's new order .
Town officials are currently trying to find a way to enforce compliance for those who do n't listen to Ocean City 's new request .
" The message is you must comply and continue to comply to these orders , " Meehan said .
