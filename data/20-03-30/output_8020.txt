CPJ Urges Unconditional Release of Jailed Journalists  The Committee to Protect Journalists has launched the #freethepress campaign urging the unconditional release of all imprisoned journalists .
It argues that given the COVID-19 pandemic , the approximately 250 journalists currently jailed around the world--according to its 2019 prison census--should be immediately released .
" Journalism must not carry a death sentence , " said CPJ .
In an open letter to world leaders , CPJ points out that those journalists have no control over their surroundings and are frequently denied the necessary medical care .
" People deprived of their liberty , and those living or working in enclosed environments in their close proximity , are likely to be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 disease than the general population , " the World Health Organization has said .
