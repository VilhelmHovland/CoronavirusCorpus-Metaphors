The director of the University of Florida 's Center for Smell and Taste and the co-director of the UF Health Smell Disorders Program answer questions about this emerging trend .
Is the loss of smell an early sign of COVID-19 ?  Loss of smell occurs with the common cold and other viral infections of the nose and throat .
Anecdotal reports suggest the loss of smell may be one of the first symptoms of COVID-19 .
Doctors around the world are reporting that up to 70% of patients who test positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cough or other typical symptoms of the disease -- are experiencing anosmia , a loss of smell , or ageusia , a loss of taste .
A new study just published found that 20 of 59 patients ( ages 50-74 ) interviewed in Italy reported a smell or taste loss .
More research is needed to understand this link , but it may provide a low-cost , practical indicator of which people should self-isolate or get further testing , depending on the symptom severity and testing availability .
What are anosmia and ageusia ?  The body 's chemical senses include smell , used to detect volatile odors , and taste , which recognizes food compounds like sugars , salts and acids .
A number of chemosensory disorders result in the diminishment , distortion or complete loss of smell or taste functions .
For example , anosmia is the complete loss or absence of smell , while hyposmia is a reduced ability to smell .
Similarly , ageusia is an absence of taste .
Approximately 13% of people over 40 years old have a significant impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for younger people , but significantly higher for the elderly .
By contrast , taste loss is much less prevalent , and often results from physical damage to the taste nerves .
Even so , both smell and taste disorders are quite common and can have major negative impacts on the health and quality of life of the millions affected .
According to news reports , many of the COVID-19 patients reporting a chemosensory loss describe a loss of taste .
However , it is more likely that smell loss accounts for this symptom .
When we eat or drink , the brain combines our perceptions of taste from the mouth with what is known as retronasal olfaction -- that is , the perception of smell that comes from odors leaving the mouth and entering the nose through the connecting passage in the throat -- into what is specifically called flavor .
Patients who have experienced anosmia or severe hyposmia may describe a loss of taste but are still able to detect sugar , salt or acid on the tongue .
What they have lost is the contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict that in most cases , the taste loss reported by COVID-19 patients is likely due to a reduced or absent ability to smell .
Why could the coronavirus cause anosmia ?  Loss of smell can result from many diverse causes such as head trauma , nasal polyps , chronic allergies , toxin exposure and neurodegenerative disease .
One of the most common causes of anosmia and hyposmia are viruses that produce upper respiratory infections , often referred to as the " common cold .
"  Viruses could impact smell function in any of several ways .
They could attack various cells in the nasal tissue , inducing local inflammation and disrupting odor detection .
The virus could directly disable or damage the sensory cells in the nose that detect odors .
Another possibility is that viruses could follow the olfactory nerve 's pathway through the skull and into the brain , where they could do additional damage .
Whether this coronavirus wreaks havoc on our sense of smell by killing olfactory sensory neurons , by disrupting their function or by otherwise impacting nasal olfactory tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investigation .
Could anosmia serve as an early indicator for COVID-19 disease ?  The doctor and patient anecdotes reported recently describe a high incidence of anosmia in COVID-19 patients , including many without other symptoms .
Thus , smell testing could be a useful tool to identify people who may be infected with COVID-19 .
Indeed , some otolaryngologists , doctors who treat diseases of the ear , nose and throat , in the United Kingdom and United States have recommended that individuals who experience a sudden loss of smell or taste should self-isolate for 14 days , and that smell testing should be integrated into COVID-19 screening protocols .
But do the facts bear this out ? For example , one small study of 59 people found that 60% of patients with upper respiratory infections not related to COVID-19 had a significant reduction in their ability to smell .
This might suggest that the prevalence of smell loss associated with COVID-19 is no higher than that typically experienced with the common cold .
Unfortunately , smell testing is rarely done as part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is lacking .
Furthermore , self-reporting of smell function can be inaccurate .
It is thus critical to conduct controlled scientific studies to assess whether smell disorders such as anosmia are an indicator of a COVID-19 infection .
It will take time to conduct those studies .
In the meantime , what should you do if you experience sudden smell loss ? The advice from ENT UK , a professional group that represents ear , nose and throat surgeons , and the British Rhinological Society seems prudent .
Self-isolate , and contact your physician for recommendations of next steps .
Smell testing as part of a typical COVID-19 screen , as recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngologists , also makes sense , even if the test is not diagnostic for COVID-19 in and of itself .
Simple scratch-and-sniff smell tests could be sent to patients to take in their home and report via secure communications , minimizing coronavirus exposure of overburdened health care providers .
Along with body temperature readings and a patient history , smell testing could allow physicians to make better choices about who to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven D .
