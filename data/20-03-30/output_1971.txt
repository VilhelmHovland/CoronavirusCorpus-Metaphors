With hordes of people queuing to get into the supermarkets every morning , the thought of visiting your local Tesco or Sainsbury 's at the moment can be a bit daunting .
And with Boris Johnson 's announcement on Monday night that suggested we should only go to the supermarkets when " shopping for the necessities , as infrequently as possible " , the home delivery slots run by supermarkets have quickly filled up .
Some supermarkets have had their delivery slots filled up as far as late June .
However , although supermarkets play a huge role in our 21st century lives , they are not the only way of accessing food .
Farm shops across the county are still in operation and , even if they have closed their shop fronts , many are still delivering produce to those in need .
Here are some of the farm shops you can visit/order from if you ca n't face going to the supermarkets .
