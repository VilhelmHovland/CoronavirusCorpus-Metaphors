"  A thread : Our show at @1017TheHammer has been cancelled due to the economic fallout of COVID-19 .
Needless to say , this is terribly disappointing .
When the station was started two years ago - and I joined shortly after - we were excited to bring local sports talk to this area .

will continue airing Mike Golic and Trey Wingo , along with Pat McAfee and Colin Cowherd , who were all a part of previous programming .
Jared Jesulaitis hosted the Sports Connection , a recent one-hour lunch break addition to the station .

" This was a great way to connect with our listeners , our high school teams and coaches , Purdue coaches and athletes .
It was a great two years and maybe the best two years for me professionally .
" I am not walking away bitter .
I am walking away thankful for the two years we had and all the connections we were able to make with the community .
I step away with good feelings and happy thoughts .
Hopefully someday this type of format can come back to the community .
