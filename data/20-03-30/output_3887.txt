" It 's that old adage that you can take people off the streets but you ca n't take the streets out of people .

The theatre community has rallied around Clive to give him piece of mind about Geezer and the veteran vendor , 56 , is already turning his attentions to This Land , one of Theatre Royal Plymouth 's biggest productions to date which was due to be performed in June .
The huge event , which is part of Plymouth 's celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower 's historic voyage to the New World , will now go ahead in 2021 .
Clive added : " The money from the theatre has sorted my food for the week .
So I 'm really happy and I 'm really glad of it , it 's a worry out of our hands .
" I 'm a single person and one of my biggest worries is if I did get Covid-19 seriously , what would I do with Geezer ? But I 've been told : " Do n't worry , the theatre family will take Geezer on while you 're in hospital " .
So that was a major relief for me .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling me .
" In a way I think it 's good that This Land has been delayed -- because another year gives you extra planning and when we get over the Covid-19 situation , people are going to be gagging for a bit of theatre , gagging to go out and do things and they will want inspiration .
So I think it will be even bigger and better next year .
I 'm finding positives out of a difficult situation .
