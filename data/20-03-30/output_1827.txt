Plea to government : Allow NGOs to deliver food , other necessities  We , the undersigned civil society organisations and non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) , view with grave concern the announcement by Defence Minister Ismail Sabri concerning how NGOs will now no longer be allowed to deliver food to vulnerable communities .
We certainly appreciate the gravity of the coronavirus situation and are fully committed to assist the government in every possible way to battle the coronavirus pandemic and stop the spread of the virus .
At the same time , we are concerned that there is a lack of appreciation as to just how many vulnerable communities are affected by the movement control order and are having difficulties accessing basic necessities such as food .
These communities include the bottom 40% of households , the urban and rural poor , Malaysians who have lost their income as a result of the movement control order , the elderly , the house-bound , the sick , orphans , Orang Asli , migrant workers , refugee communities and many , many more .
It is hard to imagine that the government has a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to take over serving all these communities immediately .
The very suggestion of such over-centralisation suggests poor planning and a poor understanding of the plight of the poor .
NGOs do not exist to supersede the work of the government or to put the government in a bad light in any way .
The concept of #KitaJagaKita is not meant to imply any failure on the part of the government -- it only emphasises the fact that the crisis is so bad , that all of us have a duty to care for one another .
We plead with the government to allow all NGOs that have been distributing food , medicine and other aid to be allowed to continue doing so in a way that is safe and responsible , in full cooperation with the government and in accordance with the health and safety guidelines of the government .
We are certain NGOs involved will continue taking every required measure , including the consistent use of hand sanitisers and masks , social distancing and the minimising of the number people involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many vulnerable Malaysians at risk .
We all need to come together and do our part , as a united nation .
