SHANGHAI -- China is stirring from its coronavirus-induced hibernation .
More than two months after the government moved to lock down Hubei province and large swaths of the country , there 's a growing body of evidence the nation is on the road to recovery .
The number of new positive coronavirus cases has slowed to a trickle -- and mostly accounted for by returnees .
Last week , in one of the most encouraging indicators that the tide had turned , the government lifted the lockdown on most of Hubei .
The city of Wuhan , one of the hardest-hit areas in the province is still under quarantine but will soon see travel restrictions lift on April 8 .
Car traffic in Shanghai and Shenzhen have returned to normal levels , a report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch observed , although Beijing as the capital is under stricter rules and is still quieter than usual .
Nomura also noted that as of March 24 , the cumulative business resumption rate had risen to 86 .
percent across 15 cities it sampled .
Social distancing remains intact but major malls in Shanghai , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago had barely any customer foot traffic to speak of , now are getting a decent flow of masked visitors to shop and dine , albeit spaced one table apart .
The properties have also dropped the practice of enforcing individual temperature checks on everyone who enters their premises .

COVID-19 is both a supply and demand shock .
China 's manufacturing base may be normalizing , but it does so just as demand in other major economies are hit critically , with overseas brands and retailers rushing to cancel orders and sometimes flat out rejecting finished goods from their vendors .
Markets are still underestimating the hit from COVID-19 to China 's exports , Nomura said , adding the pandemic spreading to other major economies would have " devastating " effects .
It predicted export growth to fall precipitously from an estimated negative 20 percent year-over-year in the first quarter to negative 30 percent in the second quarter .

On Saturday at midnight , China essentially closed its borders to foreign nationals , including ones that hold working visas for China -- only special visa categories like diplomats or flight crew members are exempt .
It also moved to severely limit the number of international flights , with foreign airlines only allowed one flight per week into the country .
In addition , incoming international flights to Beijing since last Monday have been required to stop over in other Chinese cities first for passenger virus screening before travelers are able to continue onward , a decision that appears to be a way to keep the capital 's case numbers low .
The long weekend national holiday of Qing Ming falls this April 4 to 6 but evolving travel restrictions and uneven enforcement of quarantine measures on a local level means people are unlikely to travel or gather as they usually do .
Companies in the meanwhile are leaning heavily on digital and e-commerce , with livestreaming gaining quickly in importance .

Others like Pinduoduo were relying on major promotions .
The country 's third-largest e-commerce platform said it would hold a shopping festival on Tuesday in conjunction with the retailer , Gome .
It plans to give away 500 million yuan , or $70 .
million , worth of incentives in an effort to promote a rebound in domestic consumption .
Called " Super Brand Day , " the sale is to begin at midnight on March 31 , the first of a series of large-scale sales promotion events it plans to hold , the company said .
" We are responding to the government 's call to speed up the rebound in consumption , and that was the motivation behind our collaboration with Pinduoduo , " said Gome retail vice president Wang Bo .
" We believe that there will definitely be an explosion of pent-up demand after the coronavirus outbreak .
