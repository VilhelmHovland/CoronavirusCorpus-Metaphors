Volunteers use online forum to mind children of healthcare workers  Student teacher acts as childcare worker for nurse who is working on the front line  Ciara Devon : If you know in yourself that you need something more to do , then there are so many options out there "  For student teacher Ciara Devon ( 26 ) the best way to play her part during the coronavirus pandemic was to volunteer as a childcare worker for a nurse who works on the front line .
The day that universities , schools and cr ? ches closed due to coronavirus , she decided to reach out to the local community to see if there were any elderly or vulnerable people in need of assistance .
With help from an online forum she decided that offering childcare to healthcare workers was the best use of her skills .
Now she is minding a nine-month-old baby boy three to four days a week so his mother can continue to treat patients .
" I just would n't be able to sit at home knowing I could help someone .
Working in the health service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no way you can pay back these people for all they 're doing , but I just thought that this was my time to give something back , even if it 's just a small thing .
"  Final-year medical student Shane Kelly , one of the organisers , says the volunteer idea has been borrowed from an example in Glasgow , Scotland , to help parents working in hospitals , GP clinics and care homes  Some 5,000 people signed up to the group 's Facebook page .
Hundreds of families have already been helped in the last two weeks , though even he is unsure of the exact number now involved .
" It started as two separate groups of medical students and then another of teachers and childcare workers on Facebook .
But the demand was rapidly exceeding what we are capable of , so we joined together .
"  The organisers have now set up a website ( covidchildcare .
) which seeks to bring together parents with volunteers .
Once linked both sides decide themselves if they are well-matched .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly the demand outstripped our capacity , " Kelly said .
" We 're not doing the connecting anymore , we 're a forum , so a lot of it comes down to the two sides involved .
Volunteer  Devon , who is currently writing her thesis for her Maynooth University geography degree , said minding the young baby was the only time she now leaves home in order to protect herself , her family and the family she is helping .
Not everyone can volunteer , she says : " I 'm in a better position to help out because as a student teacher I have fewer classes I need to organise online work for .
"  She says volunteering is rewarding .
" I really recommend getting involved .
It allows you to have a purpose in some way , so you do n't get stuck in a rut .
If you know in yourself that you need something more to do , then there are so many options out there .
We wo n't get through this if we all only look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
