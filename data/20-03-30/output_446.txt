* * *  TAMPA -- Across Hillsborough County , families are hunkering down at home , hoping their isolation will keep them safe from the coronavirus .
That is n't an option for the county 's homeless .
With a county-wide order for people to stay indoors now in effect , the city of Tampa is establishing a tent city that will allow up to 100 homeless people to shelter in place .

One hundred tents have been pitched and fenced-off on a site that will also include mobile shower trailers , a mobile laundromat and six portable toilets .
Its residents will get three meals a day and , if needed , medical treatment .
The homeless are considered at high risk for the coronavirus , in part because they often have poor health .
Making matters worse is that their makeshift life-support system of park restrooms , libraries , coffee shops and gyms where they can wash and shelter are now closed .
" We realized we had homeless people on the street as resources started drying up and they would not be able to access food and things they need , " said Vanessa McCleary , the city 's housing and community development manager .
The camp will be called Hillsborough Hope , after Pinellas Hope , the shelter ministry that Catholic Charities set up in Clearwater in 2007 after police officers slashed tents at a homeless camp near downtown St .
Petersburg .
" In Tampa , we help each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect example , " said Tampa Mayor Jane Castor in a text .
" As we all stay safe at home , Hillsborough Hope , in coordination with a host of community partners , is providing shelter to 100 homeless individuals in our community that have no place to go .
The sooner we start taking care of each other , the sooner we can get through this together .
"  The shelter will be open to any homeless person except for registered sex offenders .
Those who turn up will be screened for the coronavirus .
Anyone presenting with symptoms will be referred to BayCare Health System , which has kept some test kits aside for the homeless population , McCleary said .

Electric and water connections were put in place and plans made to handle security and garbage .
Temporary floodlighting and fire extinguishers were installed .
It was n't until Thursday afternoon that the first tent was pitched .
" In a week , we 've done what it would normally take a year to pull off , " said McCleary .
The camp will go only part way to protecting the county 's homeless .
Hillsborough has about 1,600 homeless people , according to the 2019 point-in-time count .
The results of this year 's count have yet to be released but about 650 people in the county do not have any shelter , McCleary said .

Catholic Charities is also supplying them with water bottles and hand sanitizer .

About 60 percent of homeless people who stay at Pinellas Hope end up in permanent housing .
