Over the last 15 years I have been in many queues .
I queued for a table at one of Melbourne 's brunch cafes , for a chance to taste best croissants in the world , or to go to the women 's toilet after a concert or comedy show .
When I found myself queuing for essentials at my local grocery store , with barely half the things on my shopping list available , I was transported back in the time of queuing for staples in communist Romania .
The queues I had experienced so far in Australia have been light-hearted , respectful , you-go-ahead , no-you-go kind of affairs .
Queues of sharing , of curiosity , of plenty .
That 's not the kind of queue I 've experienced in the past few weeks , since the pandemic panic buying started .
The person in front of me ordered eight chicken fillets and the man behind me gasped .
At first the emptied shelves of toilet paper , pasta and rice sort of amused me .
I stayed amused until I found myself shopping in a tense atmosphere one morning .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anticipation of flaky pastry .
The person in front of me ordered eight chicken fillets and the man behind me gasped .
He had his eyes on the fillets too .
Was there going to be enough when his turn came ? I decided I did n't need chicken fillets after all , but I did feel some of his panic transfer to me .
For the first time since living in Australia , I wondered if I was wrong not to fill our pantry with whatever I could find .
While I could still find it .
In Romania queuing for food and worrying about sourcing food was an integral part of life .
Sometimes you did n't even know what you were queuing for .
It almost did n't matter .
In a time of such scarcity , coffee would do just fine , even if you went looking for meat .
Everyone had a next door neighbour who had a cousin whose sister worked at the local ' alimentara ' , the local grocery store .
Connections were everything .
Without them dinner could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store was about to get a delivery of one thing or another .
From then on , everyone would plan how to get their hands on a tin or two .
Sometimes my mum would wake up at 5am to get a spot in the queue , then come back to get me ready for school , then go back in the queue when the store would open .
Sometimes we 'd miss out .
Sometimes our neighbour would share some of what they managed to buy with us , or would invite us for a meal .
Sometimes my mum would wake up at 5am to get a spot in the queue , then come back to get me ready for school , then go back in the queue when the store would open .
You had a chance to get something if you got in the queue early enough , but sometimes you did n't .
Your best bet was to know someone who could put some cheese ' aside ' for you .
You could also hire someone to stay in the queue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but incentivise them in some way .
You paid for the products , they queued , you shared the goods .
Retirees with plenty of time on their hands were best placed to fill that need .
Queuing for essentials in Australia has been eerie and brought its own kind of emotional toil .
The supermarkets that only a few weeks ago had everything you could wish for , now spanned rows and rows of empty shelves .
In communist times , sourcing food and clothing was almost its own kind of job , constantly on everyone 's mind , entering every conversation .
Overnight , the conversations between friends here , on social media , are peppered with tips on where to find food staples , when you stand the best chance to find what you 're looking for .
Thankfully , there is also that pleasant , banding together fuzzinness of sharing tips and food .
We took a while to take the pandemic seriously , but if there was one place where panic spread early , it was in the queues .
Never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of Australia .
' What if we do n't .
' seems to be what we 're all thinking .
Communist Romania was not low on food or clothes , but Romanians were .
Communist Romania was not low on food or clothes , but Romanians were .
A huge amount of everything produced in the country was exported .
We fought , schemed and came together over what was left .
But there just was n't enough to go around .
Here the scarcity is created by our fear , our need for security , our desire to know we have enough , just in case .
With home delivery , take-aways and groceries still open , running out of things to buy does n't seem like the real enemy , but perhaps the only one we know how to respond to .
Australians must stay at least 1 .
metres away from others and gatherings are limited to two people unless you are with your family or household .
