The Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021 last week as the coronavirus outbreak deepened , an unprecedented move in the 124-year history of the modern Olympics .
New dates have yet to be set , leaving sponsors and businesses uncertain and scrambling .
For Japan , a one-year postponement will likely cost 641 billion yen ( $6 billion ) , according to Katsuhiro Miyamoto , an emeritus professor of economics at Kansai University who studies the economic impact of the Olympics .
He reckons the bulk of that , 423 billion yen , will be from actual costs - things like venue maintenance , reprinting of marketing materials and hiring new volunteers - with the remainder coming from a broader blow to the economy .
That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the run-up .
The head of the International Olympics Committee has said the delay will mean additional costs for everyone .
For Grapestone Co Ltd , which sells banana-shaped sponge cakes filled with custard , the delay has been a disaster for the Olympic-themed " Tokyo Banana " confection it spent a year developing .
Grapestone 's sales had been falling since February , when the coronavirus started to hit tourism .
Now vendors are saying they do n't want cakes decorated with the 2020 Games logo .
" We 've never seen such a dramatic fall in sales , " said spokeswoman Yukiko Ohno , without detailing the decline .
" Since the Olympics were delayed , we think a lot fewer of our customers feel they have to have the cakes right now .
"  The company has cut back production at its plants in nearby Saitama .
It also makes cherry blossom- and panda-themed cakes , but Ohno said the Olympics one is made with rice flour , to give tourists a " taste of Japan " .
BIG SIGHT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3 billion to be associated with the Games , have complained privately about the uncertainty of the delay .
Unlike global Olympic sponsors , most of the Japanese firms have signed up just for a year .
" We need to negotiate whether our current contract can be extended or needs to be re-signed with additional costs , " said a representative of one sponsor .
" It 's not even clear whether we can continue to use the rights or not .
"  Venues pose a particular problem for organisers .
Tokyo Big Sight , a colossal exhibition hall on the eastern side of the city , was booked as the Olympics media centre to hold thousands of journalists .
It 's unclear whether Big Sight , which is owned by the Tokyo government , will be available next year given that bookings are taken far in advance .
The venue has already entered into contracts for 50 bookings in the year starting in April and is in talks for 200 more , said spokeswoman Mayumi Inoue .
She said it was n't possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on .
" It has to be one or the other .
"  Jingu Baseball Stadium , home to Tokyo Yakult Swallows professional team , was slated to be used to store equipment by organisers during the Olympics , a Swallows spokeswoman said .
The team had planned to play at the Tokyo Dome , home of crosstown rivals the Yomiuri Giants , between July and early September , but is now checking whether it still needs to , the spokeswoman said .
Another area team , the Yokohama DeNA Baystars , arranged to play its home games elsewhere - including in Niigata , some 350 km ( 215 miles ) away - because its ground was to be used for Olympics baseball .
Baystars spokesman Yasuhiro Kawamura said the team was working with the baseball association on its schedule .
Public broadcaster NHK and private broadcaster Fuji Television Network both said they cancelled programmes due to the postponement .
Three other private broadcasters did not respond to a request for comment about programming changes .
VILLAGE , HOTELS  The Olympic village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could prove one of the biggest headaches .
It is due to be converted into luxury apartments , many of which are already sold .
Tenants are supposed to move in by 2023 .
One woman who bought a flat in the village with her husband said she was unsure about the move-in date .
" I still have n't figured out what 's going to happen , " she said .
" It would be troubling if the Olympic Village were used over an extended time period without our consent .
"  Sales of the flats and showroom tours have been suspended until further notice , Mitsui Fudosan Residential , which is leading the real estate project , said on Monday .
Around 4 .
million tickets have been sold for the Olympics , and another 970,000 for the Paralympic Games .
Organisers say they have n't decided yet how to handle tickets , although Japanese media have reported the tickets would be valid for the same events next year .
Tokyo organisers have about 3,500 people on staff , with a number of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of the temporary staff are wanting to get back to their own organisations so this will affect their motivation , " said one Olympics insider about the delay .
The postponement will heap more pain on hotels , which have been battered by coronavirus .
" The drop in sales we 're seeing is brutal , " said Shigeki Kitahara , president of the Ryokan and Hotel Association , who owns a traditional ryokan hotel himself .
With bookings often made far in advance , it is difficult for owners to shift plans quickly , he said .
