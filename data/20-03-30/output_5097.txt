The mental health fallout from the coronavirus pandemic had the potential to resemble the psychological impact of the Great Depression , one of Australia 's leading adolescent psychiatrists has warned .
Patrick McGorry , an architect of the youth mental health service Headspace , has called for an urgent overhaul of the mental health system so it can cope with the aftermath of the immediate crisis .
" An Italian health worker said it 's like having a tattoo , it will be with me for the rest of my life .
Whether your whole body is covered with tattoos or just one is the issue , " Professor McGorry , a former Australian of the Year , said of the possible mental health scars that the pandemic may leave .
And the longer the crisis continues , the deeper the potential impacts , particularly for young people .
" If there was an economic depression , that would have more damaging effects than the disaster itself , " he said .

" A lot of people think it 's going to be related to the actual event but it 's often the recurrence of a pre-existing mental health problem like depression or psychosis , " Professor McGorry said .

About $10million will allow Beyond Blue to provide a dedicated coronavirus wellbeing helpline .
Another $14 million will go to existing mental health services , including Lifeline and Kids Helpline .
" The government deserves a pat on the back .
They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health as an acute priority in the context of COVD-19 , " Professor McGorry said .
He said more innovative approaches were needed for the delivery of mental health services both during and after the crisis .
Telehealth and online platforms , such as MOST , hosted by youth mental health organisation Orygen , had the ability to provide moderated social therapy to individuals living with illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression .
But in acute or complex cases where direct interaction was still required , extra protective resources needed to be provided to mental health workers .
" Instead of bringing people into mental health centres , workers need to go out to people in their homes .
The positive thing is that reduces the risk to everybody because you are not getting the crowding of professionals and the crowding of waiting rooms .
But some thought needs to be given to providing the protective gear for the people who are involved in that type of work , " Professor McGorry said .
