Besides general poor health and habits like smoking and drinking for men that may cause damage to lungs , leading experts told Xinhua hormonal influences on the immune response may also play a key role in this phenomenon .
While addressing a White House daily briefing , Dr .
Deborah Birx , White House COVID-19 task force director , said a report from Italy shows that men in nearly every age bracket were dying at higher rates than women .
She called it a " concerning trend .
"  According to Italian health authorities , men accounted for 58 percent of all 13,882 COVID-19 cases in Italy between Feb .
21 and Mar .
12 , and 72 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent more likely to die than were hospitalized women .
Data from other countries also showed more men are dying of COVID-19 than women .
A report of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that the mortality among men with confirmed coronavirus infections was roughly 65 percent higher than it was among women .
Unhealthy habits such as smoking and drinking alcohol occur in more men than women , which may damage lungs and prime for inflammation when battling an infection , experts said .
Men tend to have more underlying health conditions such as hypertension , cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disease , according to Global Health 50/50 , a research institute examining gender inequality in global health .
" While other factors , that may promote severe infection such as history of smoking and heart disease , also differ between men and women , the immune system is known to function differently between the sexes , " said Susan Kovats , an immunologist and microbiologist at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation , in an interview with Xinhua .
Gender differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well documented in humans and mouse models and correlate with differences in immune cell activity , she said .
Immune cells are capable of responding to estrogen and testosterone , suggesting the disparate levels of these hormones in men and women may play a role in their differential immune responses , Kovats explained .
In response to some viruses , compared to male cells , female cells produce higher levels of proteins termed " interferons " that are a crucial part of the early innate immune response .
Interferons trigger a cascade of proteins that are directly anti-viral and act to attenuate viral spread , according to Kovats .
" Indeed , evidence shows that production of interferons is promoted by estrogens .
During a respiratory virus infection , a greater capacity for interferon production may help to reduce viral spread and lung damage in females , " she said .
Stanley Perlman , professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa , has studied infected male and female mice with the coronaviruses that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found male mice were more susceptible to infection than females at every age .
" Our experiments in mice suggest that this is in part hormonal .
If we removed estrogen from mice , they were now as sensitive as males to SARS-CoV , " Perlman told Xinhua .
The immune response between males and females could be hormonally-related , but remain poorly understood , Kent Pinkerton , professor of the University of California , Davis , School of Medicine , told Xinhua .
If scientists can uncover how that works , they could identify better strategies for fighting coronavirus infections in general , experts said .
