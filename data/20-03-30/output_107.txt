The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) has decided to introduce several extraordinary regulatory measures to provide flexibility to Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks to provide some relief to businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 crisis .
In deciding these measures , the Monetary Board took note of the overall resilience of the banking sector especially due to the already built-up capital buffers , the current and future liquidity levels , potential upsurge in the rising trend in non-performing loans due to the inability of majority of borrowers to service their loans as usual and extraordinary disruptions to the functioning of the economy .
Accordingly , the Monetary Board has decided to introduce the following extraordinary measures to provide further space for banks to assist COVID-19 affected businesses and individuals on an urgent basis .
