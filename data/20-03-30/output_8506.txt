Does Sunday 's order mean the end date for restaurant restrictions in Massachusetts will be extended ?  Sunday evening , the White House extended the federal social distancing guidelines to April 30 , which will likely have repercussions for local rulings , including the current restrictions on restaurants and bars in the local area .
Currently , dining and drinking spots in the Greater Boston area and the rest of Massachusetts are only allowed to offer takeout/delivery through April 6 , with other New England states having similar mandates , though with differing end dates .
Now that the nationwide social distancing guidelines will be in place for another 30 days or so , this could cause Gov .
Charlie Baker to revisit the end date for restaurant ( and other ) restrictions in this state , though nothing has been decided at the time of this writing .

During the closure of dine-in services at all Massachusetts restaurants , some establishments are finding new ways to serve customers .
