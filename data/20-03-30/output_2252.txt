Surely , by now , we 've all noticed that the grocery store shelves are staying filled .
Yes , okay , hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes are hard to come by .
But fruit and vegetables are reappearing overnight .
And milk .
And cereal and steak and soap and juice and canned food .
Really , for a society fighting a pandemic , we have plenty of just about everything .
Here 's why : some time during the day or night a tractor trailer turns into the store 's vacant parking lot , piloted by a driver who safely guides the big machine backwards to sync with the loading dock .
Then he ( or she ) waits while tonnes of crates and pallets are removed , does the paperwork , climbs back up into the seat , starts the engine , and rolls away .
It happens tens of thousands of times a day , all over Canada and America , mostly hidden from a public that arrives within hours to fill carts .
Listing everything moved between supplier and retailer by trucks would exhaust everyone 's attention .
So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all consumer goods move by truck .
Sometimes they move by ship or train first , but eventually , they 're delivered by truck .
If you got it , as the saying goes , a truck brought it .
Half of the food on Canadians ' tables comes from the United States by truck .
Seventy percent of everything in the Canada/U .
trade network -- and it is one vast trade network -- moves by truck .
Those life-saving medical supplies we 're all reading about ? Trucked .
Parts for new ventilators ? They 'll arrive at the manufacturers by truck .
Which is also how the assembled ventilators will be delivered to hospitals .
There are roughly 317,000 Canadian truck drivers on the road .
Seventy per cent of the trucks that cross the U .
border have Canadian plates .
Trucks are an efficient , organized hive .
Without them , supply chains would snap , and the fears that have driven the panic buying we 've seen across North America would suddenly be justified .
Trucking companies have stepped up , continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to base empty , meaning these companies are facing revenue challenges associated with these increasing empty miles .
The government of Canada does n't need to be told how crucial trucking is to our way of life -- it has worked hard in collaboration with the trucking industry during this crisis .
That 's why the common border remains wide open to cargo .
It 's why truck drivers are deemed an essential service and are exempted from the quarantine rules that now apply to other travellers , and why some transport regulations are temporarily relaxed should supply chain flexibility be required .
There 's been some heartening public support , too , a lot of it on social media , hashtag #thankatrucker .
But people are scared , and truck drivers are running into that , too .
Normally , while a truck is being unloaded , the driver is offered access to the facility 's amenities .
Some places are still doing that .
But others are now insisting drivers stay in their trucks .
Bathrooms are off limits .
Some drivers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But respect is a universal balm .
Restaurant Canada members understand that .
McDonald 's and A&amp;W , which are now closed to diners and whose drive-thru lanes are too small for big rigs , are offering drivers curb service .
Thanks for " tirelessly and bravely continuing to provide essential services to help keep us all safe and healthy , " said McDonald 's Canada .
Well .
That 's just .
nice .
If you ca n't give a truck driver access to the bathroom , maybe set up a porta potty , and make sure it stays clean .
Have some water , coffee , and sandwiches on hand ; if your employees have hand sanitizer , offer some to the driver .
By all means , socially distance ( the driver will , too ) .
But there are still all sorts of ways to be kind to our nation 's truck driving heroes .
And a smile and a wave on the road adds a little bit of pleasant to a long trip .
Let 's keep that in mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #thankatrucker .
