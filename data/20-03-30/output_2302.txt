( Pexels photo )  VICTORIA -- The novel coronavirus threatens the health of Canadians , but to some people the pandemic stokes fears of a government plot to subvert freedoms , say experts who study conspiracy theories .
Terrorist attacks , natural disasters , economic shocks and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak are events that fuel conspiracy theories , says Edwin Hodge , a sociologist at the University of Victoria who studies far-right extremism .
" Believing that it just happened by accident does n't work , " said Hodge .
" One of the things I found that a lot of conspiracy theories do is they provide a sense of order to a chaotic universe .
"  He said this holds true across political and social spectrums .
Governments closing public and private places , urging physical distancing and requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days to slow the spread of COVID-19 would be viewed as state control tactics by those who believe in conspiracy theories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those measures to help fight the pandemic , those people heard a different message , he said .
" What they really hear him say is your constitutional rights do n't matter anymore , " said Hodge .
" Now we 're going to separate and isolate you and that 's how we 're going to get you .
"  David Black , a communications theorist at Victoria 's Royal Roads University , said while the world struggles with an epidemiological crisis , a battle for the truth is raging in a post-truth age where facts and information are often blurred .
" Post-truth is not lying , " he said .
" Post-truth is where we stopped caring .
We became indifferent to facts , to evidence , logical consistency .
" Just when we need facts , evidence , logical consistency and fidelity to truth as we try to share information about a disease that could harm or kill many people , we find ourselves culturally unprepared to receive the information we need .
"  Black said conspiracy theories about the novel coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence and truth are powerful anti-conspiracy forces .
Daily statements by the prime minister and public health officials across Canada provide necessary information to blunt conspiracy theories .
" It 's a counter because what we see is sobriety , is information , is people in positions of leadership counselling against irrational behaviour , " said Black .
Health Minister Adrian Dix said he is aware of conspiracy theories about the origins of the new coronavirus , but the government is providing the public with the most detailed , reliable and up-to-date pandemic information available .
" There 's a lot of noise out there , " he said .
" Part of our strategy is to give people as much information as we can .
What we are trying to do is give all the facts , some of which are quite frightening , but we 're trying to demonstrate calm .
"  Dix said hour-long briefings are not out of the ordinary as he and Dr .
Bonnie Henry , the provincial health officer , are keen to answer every question because many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Hodge said the pandemic is forcing people to think critically about information .
" As hard as it is to find a silver lining out of it , it is encouraging people to reassess where they are getting their information , " he said .
" We 've been put in a very stressful situation and being told to critically evaluate information under extraordinary conditions .
