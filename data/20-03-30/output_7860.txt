Wow My wife and her nurses wish they had any of that equipment - they are gettting one of the very last masks the doc put on and a ziplock for each room they are assigned - when they leave the room , they are told to put the mask in the ziplock that is taped to the door - think about that , put a single mask for one room into a ziplock and remove it each time you go back into the room to wear it again for a 12 hr shift - how quickly do you think the underside of the mask is compromised due to the close proximity of the ziplock ? ? ? I wish my wife had the opportunity to adorn her self with 3 or 4 layers of protective wear .
Indeed God Protect them .
