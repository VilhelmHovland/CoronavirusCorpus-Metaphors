Welcome to the Tiny Theatre : Florida Rep actors turn their closet into a stage on Facebook  They were just a day away from performing the play " A Doll 's House , Part 2 .
" Then Florida Rep canceled it -- along with the rest of the Fort Myers theater 's season -- due to the coronavirus .
Suddenly , the married couple found themselves at home instead of performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weird .
" We got that far in the process , so your intuitive self thinks you 're going to go on , you know what I mean ? " Brendan says .
" It was really a strange feeling .
We were a little restless .
"  So they decided to do something about it .
They started performing online , instead .
Brendan Powers and Rachel Burttram Powers perform for Tiny Theatre .
Their audience : The people on Facebook Live and also their cat , Milo .

They set up one in their closet .
No audience ? They found one on Facebook Live .
No plays ? They asked their playwright friends to send scenes , monologues and short plays .
More theater news : Mann Hall suspends all shows through May 1 , including Waitress , Come From Away  Tiny Theatre debuted March 21 with scenes from Audrey Cefaly 's romantic comedy " Maytag Virgin .
" They followed that with a three-parter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And more works are coming , including poetry written by a teacher friend 's sixth-grade class in Brazil .
Brendan and Rachel say it 's a way to stay sane while social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak -- and also take people 's minds off their problems for 20-30 minutes at a time .
" I get sort of in a funk if I 'm not working on a project , " Rachel says .
" An artist has to create ! Otherwise , what 's our purpose with a capital P , you know ? "  " Not only is it fun for us , just to give us something to do and to stay in touch with a lot of our folks in the artistic community , " Brendan says .
" But the responses we 've been getting from people are really quite touching .
" We 've had some people sending notes saying ' This was the best part of my day today .
Thank you so much .
' It 's just been really really powerful , the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams have racked up thousands of views and hundreds of appreciative comments .
" How exciting , " wrote LaTasha Armstead of Iona .
" Bravo .
"  Kathy Grey of Fort Myers agreed .
" You two are fabulous for doing this ! ! This is exciting ! "  Tiny Theatre offers three performances a week at 9 p .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday .
The Facebook Live stream goes active five minutes before show time ( Rachel and Brendan jokingly say that 's when the " house opens " ) .
The intimate performances keep things simple : An IKEA curtain , an iPhone on a tripod , no costumes , and Christmas lights for some visual flair .
And no memorization : They perform with scripts in hand .
The couple experimented with lighting until they found something that worked : A ring light that a friend dropped off at their front door .
The tiny closet does n't have a working light of its own , Brendan says and laughs .
" That 's been on our to-do list for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a stage , they admit : Maybe 4 feet wide by 4 feet deep .
Still , they make do with what they have and accept the challenge .
Brendan Powers and Rachel Burttram Powers were set to star in Florida Rep 's " A Doll 's House , Part 2 " ( pictured ) .
When that got canceled , they instead created Tiny Theatre in their closet .
( Photo : Bryelle Dafeldecker )  Plus they 've added yet another layer of challenge , as well .
" Just to keep it interesting , we do n't want to rehearse too much , " Rachel says .
" Something about the spontaneity , it 's so charming -- I hope ! "  Tiny Theatre takes performing down to its essential elements , she says .
No music .
No special effects or scenery .
No costumes .
" We were like , what does it take to make a theater ? " Rachel says .
" It takes text , it takes actors , and it takes an audience -- when you really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brendan say they love the positive response they 've gotten so far -- both from audiences and the playwrights who let them perform their work for free .
" It was amazing how many people flooded our in-boxes saying , ' Oh my God , yes , this is so crazy ! Let 's do it ! ' " Rachel says .
" This was such weirdo thing that sort of developed , you know , out of necessity , really : What are we going to be doing with ourselves ? "  Brendan Powers and Rachel Burttram Powers perform " onstage " for Tiny Theatre .
They stream performances three times a week from their Fort Myers storage closet .
( Photo : Special to The News-Press )  Now they both have something to look forward to , three nights a week .
And while their Florida Rep plays have been canceled , the show must go on at the Powers house .
" We love live performance , obviously , " Rachel says .
" The interface with the audience is really where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to you do that in self-isolation ? Well , the beauty of the Internet and Facebook Live .
