Philippines coronavirus testing to be stepped up soon - WHO  MANILA , March 31 ( Reuters ) - Coronavirus testing is expected to increase substantially in coming days in the Philippines , where the high number of deaths relative to confirmed cases reflects lower testing so far , a World Health Organisation official said on Tuesday .
The coronavirus death toll in the Philippines rose to 78 on Monday - the second highest in Southeast Asia outside Indonesia - with 1,546 reported infections .
" With respect to the high proportion of deaths in the Philippines , that 's essentially because of the way Philippines has chosen to test , " WHO technical advisor Matthew Griffith told a news conference , referring to the focus on testing only the most severe cases until now .
" We expect the testing to increase substantially in the coming days .
