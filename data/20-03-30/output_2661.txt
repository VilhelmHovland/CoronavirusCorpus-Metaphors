Raymond Bowe/BarrieToday  A lot can change in a matter of three weeks .
With city council not sitting down together since March 9 , chief administrative officer Michael Prowse provided an overview on what has happened since a state of emergency was declared in Barrie on March 23 to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic .
As of Monday morning , the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said there were 50 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the region .
Two men , both in their 70s and who had pre-existing medical conditions , have died recently in Barrie from the virus at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre ( RVH ) .
One of the men was visiting from Alberta .
Hospital officials later confirmed the two men were related .
The city 's senior management team has been overseeing the coronavirus crisis .
The so-called emergency control group ( ECG ) was activated March 13 .
The group , which also includes police , fire , hospital and public-health officials , continues to meet on a daily basis to navigate through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly different hats as they sit around the table and have different titles , I sit as the incident commander , " Prowse said Monday night during an online meeting of city council , the first of its kind .
The ECG meets every morning , but sometimes several times a day if needed and on weekends , if required .
" The goal is to respond to the current emergency and make decisions in the best interest of the city , and to address whatever the threat or hazard is , and make recommendations , " said Prowse , who called it " an ever-changing landscape .
"  In the last three weeks , Prowse said thousands of decisions have been made by the ECG as they try to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the community .
The CAO said the ECG is relying on information from public-health officials to make their decisions .
" They are certainly closest to it and they are live on the ground , " Prowse said .
" Decisions that we made have always been grounded in the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our partners with the health unit .
"  When the municipality declared an emergency , city police activated their operations centre .
Prowse said police staffing levels continue to be " strong , " despite health concerns in the community .
The Barrie fire department , which has also put a pandemic plan in place , is reporting 15 per cent fewer emergency incidents .
Its current staffing levels are " high .
" The fire department has also provided hundreds of masks to the hospital .
Several measures have also been taken to help city taxpayers , including no late fees or NSF charges , extension of pre-authorized payment plans , the elimination water shut-offs until at least June 30 , free city transit , and extension or cancellation of recreation passes .
Prowse said it was also " a point of pride " that the City of Barrie was one of the first municipalities to take those steps " to help soften some of the blow during these very difficult times for our residents and our businesses .
"  City theatres , recreation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakeshore exercise equipment are also cordoned off for now .
Sanitization at all city buildings has also been heightened .
Parking enforcement staff has been redeployed to deal with safety issues only .
At Barrie Transit , Prowse said they expect to move to hourly service this coming weekend to reduce on-bus congestion .
The number of passengers is limited to 15 riders per bus , with every other seat being taped off .
Access Barrie executive director Rebecca James-Reid said there has been a " steady decline " in the last seven to 10 days on city buses , " so it has n't become a major problem .
"  Monday night 's online meeting is how council and general committee will be conducted for the foreseeable future .
The mayor is the official spokesperson for the city during the COVID-19 emergency .
" It has often been said over the last several weeks on media by many that COVID-19 is not a short-term event , " said Mayor Jeff Lehman .
" I 've heard it described as a winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency that will be with us for some weeks and potentially months .
"  Some councillors had questions about how to deal with people who are n't following the guidelines , such as physical distancing and reducing the size of gatherings .
The province is now saying groups of no more than five people should get together .
Prowse said he wanted to impart a strong message to residents : " With physical distancing , mathematical modelling shows we can reduce the cases by up to 95 per cent , " he said .
With information changing on a daily basis , and sometimes even hourly , Prowse said " our most effective weapon is education .
"  " It will take some adjustment , but voluntary compliance is going to capture probably 90 per cent of that , " the CAO added .
" We 're going to have to deal with that 10 per cent .
"  Coun .
Mike McCann said he has spoken to friends in the United Kingdom where they are doling out on-the-spot fines .
He questioned whether something similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting out clear enough , " McCann said .
Dawn McAlpine , the city 's general manager of community and corporate services , is working alongside police and the health unit to deal with people who are n't following the guidelines .
The province recently extended powers to municipal bylaw officers that usually fall to police .
However , the preference would be voluntary compliance , McAlpine said .
If that does not work , fines can be issued .
It has only been a few days since the province suggested smaller gatherings and physical distancing .
" It is only a recommendation , it is not law at this point in time , " she said .
" If it 's greater than five ( people ) , we would seek to educate , seek voluntary compliance and after that , individuals may be subject to a fine .
" The city could n't provide a bylaw that is more restrictive , necessarily , than the province , " McAlpine added .
