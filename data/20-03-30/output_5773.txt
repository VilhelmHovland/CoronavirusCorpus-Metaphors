RBI 's Das -- Economy 's Steward in the Times of Corona  Friday , Mar 27  MUMBAI -- Shaktikanta Das , many an analyst exclaimed , brought a bazooka to war against the virus infection gripping the economy , by announcing a massive 75-basis-point cut in the repo rate and a 100 bps cut in banks ' cash reserve ratio .
The Reserve Bank of India 's governor also offered a three-month leeway to lenders and borrowers to ensure the virus does n't eat into the financial lifelines of the economy .
Das was seen doing all the heavy-lifting after the fiscal and administrative measures by the government were dubbed a whimper .
" Clearly , a war effort has to be mounted and is being mounted to combat the virus , " the governor said .
What was reassuring that the former bureaucrat displayed humility in assessing the threat of the virus -- a welcome deviation from the pomposity associated with a policymaker .
" We are living through an extraordinary and unprecedented situation , " Das said in televised address to the nation today , as he announced slashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Everything hinges on the depth of the COVID-19 outbreak , its spread and its duration , " Das said about the prospects for the economy in the coming months .
" Life in the time of COVID-19 has been one of unprecedented loss and isolation .
"  Politicians and policymakers across countries have been panned for underplaying the impact of the virus on lives and the economy .
They got exposed for being underprepared in dealing with the impact .
" Tough times never last ; only tough people and tough institutions do , " said the central banker who is rooted in realpolitik .
According to Das , the RBI had quarantined 150 employees and service providers together with the IT facilitators as a part of its business continuity plan .
" The Reserve Bank is at work and in mission mode , " the governor said of his team members .
" It is our effort to ensure normal functioning of markets , nurture the impulses of growth and preserve financial stability , " Das said as he detailed the measures .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to undermine the uncertainties before the economy .
Economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID-19 related lockdowns and social distancing have been imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries , he said .
Expectations of a " shallow " recovery in 2020 have been dashed , Das said , warning of a recession in a large part of the world economy .
" The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity , spread and duration of the pandemic .
"  The Indian economy will be hurt if global supplies remain clogged , he said .
" If COVID-19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated , the global slowdown could deepen , with adverse implications for India .
"  Das indicated inflation is unlikely to be the biggest of his worries in the months ahead .
" Aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further , " he said .
Shunning bravado that is often associated with policymakers looking to project they are on top of a crisis , Das said , although the Monetary Policy Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not brave giving forecasts for growth and inflation .
" Projections of growth and inflation would be heavily contingent on the intensity , spread and duration of COVID-19 , " he said .
The pandemic stalks the global economy and the outlook is highly uncertain and negative , Das said .
" Several nations are battling its exponential contagion ; countries are shutting down to prevent being sucked into that black hole .
"  Accolades flowed in for the RBI governor and the Monetary Policy Committee for their decisions today .
The scale of measures surprised the market .
Das claimed what the RBI offered today was a comprehensive package with force multipliers .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed .
The RBI has taken " giant steps " to safeguard the economy , he tweeted .
Not just to his immediate audience such as bankers and bond traders , Das sounded sagely for the common citizenry -- " COVID-19 is upon us ; but this too shall pass .
"  Das ' measures and his demeanour on live television was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no bearing under his watch .
And he stayed true to what he had said a few weeks ago -- the central bank will do " whatever it takes " .
Jury is still out on how Das will be remembered .
But in the years to come , chronicles of RBI will mention him as the economy 's steward in the Times of Corona .
