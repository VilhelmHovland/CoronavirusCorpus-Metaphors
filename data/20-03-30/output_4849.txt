Social distancing is necessary .
Self-isolation and quarantining are common .
And working from home is the new normal .
McCann 's Emma Black and George Groves analyse the performance of various media channels over the past month to illustrate where ad dollars are working hardest during this crisis .
Over the past few days , we have been gauging the role of paid media and its ability to support brands to connect with consumers in the middle of COVID-19 .
Consumers are , and will continue to , spend more time inside .
And , accordingly , the way consumers interact with media channels will change , adapting to these different lifestyles .
Brands considering the reduction , or removal , of all paid media during this period of uncertainty should look back at 2008 's global financial crisis .
A heavy-handed approach to scaling down activity only resulted in long-term damage for brands .
In order to navigate the impacts of COVID-19 , brands must be ready and willing to change their media mix  ADVERTISEMENT  At the same time , for many categories , it will not be beneficial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unable to buy your products .
In unchartered times like this , a pragmatic approach is to maintain brand saliency , so consumers will be more likely to return to your brand once we come out the other side .
The current landscape we are facing is unprecedented , but not unmanageable .
In line with that , we foresee several shifts in human behaviour that will also provide paid media insight :  Social distancing wo n't mean distancing from social media .
Messaging apps will be an important way for friends and loved ones to stay in contact with one another .
Social media feeds will remain a connector to the outside world and a way to share in our collective humanity in a troubling time ;  As more people spend time at home , we can assume consumption of entertainment media sources will increase .
Paid linear TV , broadcast video on demand ( BVOD ) , and streaming video on demand ( SVOD ) will likely experience gradual increases in consumption in coming weeks .
While production of most new content is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bingeable shows will likely see success ; and  News organisations will see bumper traffic figures , as it becomes more important than ever to be up-to-date and informed .
Through our digital media trade desk , we have analysed the past four weeks of market impression data to understand how the current situation is translating into consumption trends in online environments .

A big contributor here is an increase in BVOD consumption , which saw a 16% increase , and in-stream/ pre-roll video placements across news websites .

( Click to enlarge )  Increased web traffic is helping native ad networks like Outbrain see a surge in available inventory for marketers to buy .
The week commencing 8 March alone saw a 42% jump in available impressions compared to the week prior .
Unsurprisingly , the largest amount of impressions are available against the news vertical .
However , entertainment and technology also represent a large portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only prioritising coronavirus updates , but are also looking for more content to watch or read .
Consider using paid native media strategies to capture this consumer intent to interact with content that interests them .

Unless your brand specifically can not appear next to coronavirus-related content , running paid display activity across news environments will be a strong way to maintain a high level of audience reach .

Investing in paid digital audio placements can be a sound investment for most brands .
It is well known that audio advertising has high effectiveness rates , and in the current environment should be a consistently delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at McCann Melbourne and George Groves is digital account director at McCann Melbourne  McCann will be posting updates on media trends every Tuesday on its LinkedIn and Facebook pages  It would be good to see more of this and I guess data behind the obvious is a good thing but .
So , the conclusion is ; more time people spend at home = more time on electronic and digital and more time in social therefore chase the numbers and use these platforms more .
I 'd love you to take it a little further .
In China they cancelled all new movie releases for LNY except one movie that released on TikTok -- wow ! stay tuned for what that might do for distribution given Tencent produce so many movies now .
Alibaba was catapulted to stardom by SARs .
interesting thought for your ecommerce capabilities and sadly , will this be just too great a cultural shift in media consumption habits for some printed metros to withstand ?  My assumption at the moment is that we probably wo n't see innovations in content delivery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality to ease up on bandwidth .
( However will be delighted to be proved wrong ! )  While we 're looking at where eyeballs ( and ad impressions ) are moving , there 's always an extra layer of analysis for each brand to make sensible decisions with their media .
Native is seeing by far the biggest jumps across the board but obviously is n't right for every single brand out there .
