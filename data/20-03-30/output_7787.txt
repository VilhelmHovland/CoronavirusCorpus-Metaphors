Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis release includes non-GAAP adjusted net income , which is not a metric that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( GAAP ) .
This non-GAAP financial measure is adjusted for certain items ( including ( i ) changes in the fair-market value of public equity-related assets and SWK 's warrant as mark-to-market changes are non-cash , ( ii ) income taxes as the Company has substantial net operating losses to offset against future income , and ( iii ) depreciation and amortization expenses , primarily associated with the Enteris acquisition ) and may not be directly comparable to similar measures used by other companies in our industry , as other companies may define such measures differently .
Management believes that this measure is useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in analysis of ongoing operating trends and provides useful additional information relating to our operations and financial condition .
This metric should be considered in addition to , and not as a replacement for , the most comparable GAAP measure .
The Company is unable to provide preliminary results for the comparable GAAP measure of non-GAAP adjusted net income for the fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results without unreasonable efforts because the exact amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-GAAP adjusted net income is not currently determinable until the closing procedures for the quarter and full-year 2019 are complete .
Accordingly , the Company is unable to provide reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP for non-GAAP adjusted net income without unreasonable effort .
It is important to note that the items that are added to the comparable GAAP measure to determine non-GAAP adjusted net income may be material to the Company 's fourth quarter and full-year 2019 results in accordance with GAAP .
