P&amp;O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said : " It is clear that our original date of April 11 to resume sailings , which would have been a 30-day pause in operations , is just not feasible in light of the Government announcements last week .
" Regrettably , therefore , we are now extending this pause until May 15 .
" Given the current guidelines , it is prudent and practical to extend the pause until normal operations can be resumed .

"  P&amp;O Cruises also announced that Covid-19 restrictions have disrupted the final outfitting on its new ship Iona in Germany , which is expected to delay her introduction to service .
As a result of the continued impact of COVID-19 , we have made the decision to take the preventative measure of extending our suspension of all Cunard voyages an extra month until the 15th May .
Cunard president Simon Palethorpe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to support the management and containment of Covid-19 globally .

It is therefore right we extend the pause in operations .
" It is too soon to know exactly how this situation will evolve .
But I do know that we , the Cunard team , will commit all our resources , energy and talent to weather this storm and come out stronger than ever for our guests .
" We have been sailing for 180 years and we look forward to many more .
We will get through these tough times together and look forward to welcoming our guests back on board again soon , when the time is right .
