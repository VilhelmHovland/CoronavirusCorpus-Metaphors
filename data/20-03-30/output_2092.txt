Even though Vietnam is one of Southeast Asia 's poorer nations , its efforts against the virus , praised at home , have ensured its tally of infections is lower than those of many neighbours .
By Thursday , those quarantined numbered 44,955 , including nearly half in military-run centres , down about 15% from Monday 's figure , official data showed , as many among the first influx to return home early in March were discharged .
" Those with symptoms are taken to hospital , and the rest are sent to quarantine camps , where they will share a room with 10 to 20 others on the same flight .
"  The official was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not authorised to speak to media .
Vietnam has reported just 148 infections , its health ministry says , with no deaths .
Its proven infection rate is lower than any regional nations except Myanmar and Laos , where testing has been limited .
Official figures show Vietnam has tested more than 30,000 people .
The current phase of the battle against the virus is " decisive " , Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has said , in an effort government statements describe as the " spring general offensive of 2020 " .
Vietnam took a textbook approach in its early response strategy , based on its experience as the first country outside China to be hit by the SARS outbreak of 2003 , said Todd Pollack , an infectious diseases specialist at Harvard Medical School .
" Quarantine of individuals who have contact with a case or are coming from a high risk area is definitely a key strategy ; especially since people infected seem to be infectious at the very start of symptoms , " added Pollack , who works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( HAIVN ) .
' CARING SOLDIERS '  Vietnam began its mass quarantine programme on Mar .
16 , when it began compulsory testing and quarantine measures for arrivals from virus-hit areas .
Singapore and Taiwan are among the other nations to have quarantined thousands of people , although most have been confined to their homes rather than camps .
China also sends new arrivals to designated sites for compulsory quarantine .
Vietnam 's aggressive contact tracing has occasionally led to the quarantine or self-isolation of hundreds of people because of just a few cases .
People have been cheered by tales on social media of tired soldiers offering help or sleeping in the forest to provide bed space for arrivals at military-run quarantine centres .
" Quarantine camp ca n't be like home , " said Nguyen Ha My , a student who was sent to a barracks 160 km ( 100 miles ) outside Hanoi after she arrived from Hungary on Saturday .
" No place can be like home , but I feel safe here , " My , who shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The soldiers here are very caring .
I was given the smallest things such as shampoo , shower gel , and even toilet paper .
"  My and others in quarantine said everyone practised social distancing , with those showing initial symptoms immediately moved elsewhere in the camp .
Nguyen Nhat Anh , who left Vietnam in February to study in Australia , is another person who returned home on Saturday .
" It 's like a vacation , at quarantine camp , " Anh told Reuters .
" Free Wi-Fi , free meals , free face masks .
Just a little heart attack if any of the roommates cough .
