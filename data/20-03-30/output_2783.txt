The drug , sold in Canada under the name Mifegymiso , first registered as experiencing a shortage on Feb .
The shortage was attributed to a delay in the shipping of the drug and was expected to be resolved by mid-February .
However , the drug remains on backorder today and is n't expected to reappear on store shelves that have run through their existing stock until next week .
Pharmaceutical orders are generally placed months in advance , according to Fr ? d ? rique Chabot , the director of health promotion at Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights , an organization that helps women obtain information about their sexual and reproductive health , including access to abortion .
Because Mifegymiso is manufactured in Europe , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipment was stuck in Montreal as extra measures were put in place to ensure the safety of those dealing with the packages .
While public health officials and politicians confirmed to CTVNews .
last week that abortion access will be maintained throughout the COVID-19 pandemic , at least one official encouraged women to opt for a medical rather than surgical abortion to encourage physical distancing .
" When clinically appropriate , we are recommending women choose medical termination over a surgical procedure in order to promote social distancing , " said Doug Dahl , a communications officer with the Saskatchewan Health Authority , in a statement emailed to CTVNews .
A medical abortion is when a person takes a series of pills to terminate a pregnancy .
With the medical option , the patient does n't need to head to a clinic or a doctor 's office the way they would for a surgical abortion .
If these pills are n't available , women seeking to terminate a pregnancy would have to opt for the surgical option instead -- an option that providers have ensured remains available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chabot said her organization has n't had too many calls from people impacted by the drug shortage .
" I 'm sure it had an impact , but it was not across the board .
So people are still accessing medical abortion right now .
It 's not on pause , " Chabot said .
" I assume that it probably impacted regions where there 's less providers , so it 's less frequent that this is asked of the pharmacy so there 's many less of an impetus to stock up on Mifegymiso .
"  Still , while Chabot said this shortage did not have a huge impact on women 's ability to access a medical abortion this time around , she warned that the demand for this drug will likely increase as this pandemic continues .
" At this point , everything is being rearranged to ensure that abortion is being treated as an essential service .
it would have an impact , if there was a shortage , because it is recommended that a lot of abortion clinics move many of their appointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chabot said .
As a result of this change , Chabot says Canada needs to make sure it 's equipped to meet this demand .
" Plans must be put in place to make sure that we do n't suffer shortages in the next while , as Mifegymiso will play a big role in ensuring access to abortion in Canada , " Chabot said .
She also noted that tightened travel regulations and the push for physical distancing are creating new barriers for women who have to travel within Canada to access a surgical abortion .
" We must re-think how we provide these services across the board -- and everyone needs to do their part , " Chabot said .
