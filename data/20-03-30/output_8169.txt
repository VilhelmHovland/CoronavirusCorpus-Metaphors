With the novel coronavirus epidemic spreading across the U .
, it is like a switch has been thrown on the economy , turning out the lights first here , then there .
The economy could be in good shape when the switch finally gets flipped back on , but that is going to depend on how the country handles the crisis .
For starters , it is important to recognize that there was nothing dangerously wrong with the economy before the epidemic struck .
There were , of course , problems .
It was n't growing very quickly , inflation and interest rates were lower than policy makers would have liked them to be and wage growth was n't particularly robust despite the low level of unemployment .
But it had n't built up any of the dangerous excesses that usually provoke recessions .
Stock market valuations were running ahead of the fundamentals , but nothing like before the dot-com bubble burst .
Corporate debt was elevated , but the degree of leverage in the economy was n't on par with what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly were n't any of the 1970's-style inflationary excesses that prompted the Federal Reserve to slam on the brakes .
Rather , the parts of the economy that have been most hurt by the sudden stifling of sales as a result of shutdowns and other social-distancing measures -- the restaurants , bars , barber shops and nail salons with shut gates -- made sense before the coronavirus and will make sense after it .
So will the jobs they provide .
As the lights start going back on , they can get back to work and the economy will come back , too .
That assumes those businesses are still standing when the pandemic has passed , though .
Readings on the drop in revenue are only starting to come in , but they give a sense of how bad things are .
Small-business transaction data collected by software and business-services provider Womply shows that in the week ended March 25 , sales at bars and lounges were down 52% from a year earlier , restaurant sales were down 59% , and at hotels and other lodging places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an empty commercial area in West Palm Beach , Fla .

Without any clear sense of when the threat from the virus will let up , it is n't clear when the lights will start coming back on .
Until then , the key will be how many businesses buckled by the crisis can get the help they need to survive .
The $2 trillion package passed last week , with its support for households ( and thus , consumer spending ) and small businesses is a start , but now execution will matter so that when the help arrives , it does n't come too late .
If the crisis drags on for longer , then more money will be needed .
Then , one hopes the bar around the corner will be able to pull the chairs down from the tables , the bartender can go back to work behind the taps and an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste so good .
