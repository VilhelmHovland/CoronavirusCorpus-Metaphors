( Photo : Joe Rondone/The Commercial Appeal )  On Saturday , Shelby County marked two melancholic milestones .
First , the Shelby County Health Department announced the county 's first death from the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 , as reported by our Laura Testino .
And then , later that day , the department reported 269 confirmed coronavirus cases ( rising to 362 on Sunday ) , overtaking Nashville 's Davidson County as the county with the most cases in Tennessee and more than sextupling the 58 cases reported Sunday a week ago .
And in a bizarre ( and legally suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the deceased than the law requires even for rape or murder victims .
These grim milestones come amid growing concern that locals are n't taking social distancing and an order to stay away from other people seriously enough .
Last week , despite the ongoing , countywide safer at home order , hundreds of people visited public parks in Memphis .
Mayor Jim Strickland , who just closed sports facilities , said parks are next if people keep do n't keep their distance from each other , our Micaela Watts reports .
" Right now , city parks are open , " said Strickland , " But , if we continue to see what we saw yesterday in Tom Lee Park , we will have to close parks .
"  Sheltering in place only works if people , y'know , shelter in place .
And so , closing the parks makes sense .
People can still get out and walk in their neighborhoods or enjoy the outdoors in the comfort of their backyards .
Maybe it 's time to start porch-sitting again .
People can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet between themselves and others , of course .
But they 're not .
And , let 's be real , they probably wo n't , which is why Strickland should act , and act soon .
Because public parks , as beloved as they are , are not " essential " when people are literally dying now in the county .
Closing the city 's parks is a small price to pay compared with stopping the spread of this virus .
So , for the love of God , let 's close these parks .

on masks  Buy Photo  Mary Olds adjusts her protective face mask on a break in handing out Shelby County Schools K-12 learning packets and meals for children from Abundant Grace Fellowship Church on Shelby Drive Monday , March 23 , 2020 .
The district school system has set up dozens of access points across the city in hopes of reaching children in need of nourishment and coursework supplies as the schools have shut down indefinitely over concerns of the spread of coronavirus .

The people who should wear masks are the elderly , the sick , and people who have medical problems or a weak immune system , according to the statement .
As for others ? If you want to wear a face mask , go for it , but it 's hotly debated whether it 'll do any good .
" To be honest with you it would be hard to give you a number , " Shelby County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Director Brenda Jones said .
Different governments and agencies have different amounts of supplies , she said .
" Have we pulled it all together to determine how much is available ? No we have n't .
