Now that the museums are physically closed as a security measure during the coronavirus crisis , new ways of making cultural visits through their websites have been developed .
But also , since art is inspired by life , other web platforms have spawned to express how artists are living this pandemic .
This is how the first virtual museum about the coronavirus was born .
Its name is Covid Art Museum , an ingenious idea of Emma Calvo , Irene Llorca and Jos ? Guerrero , publicists from Barcelona , Spain , to commission the best works that artists are sharing on Instagram .
" Our selection criteria is to choose works that are made in the quarantine period , that transmit and reflect what we are all living and feeling , " the creators explained to Yorokobu , " that 's why we do n't limit ourselves to any one technique .
We collect all kinds of art , be it illustrations , photographs , paintings , drawings , animations , video , etc .
"  Because the three publicists regularly follow a large number of artists and galleries , their task of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also receive proposals from creatives from all over the world through Instagram .
" We find messages of all kinds : many talk about love and union ; others seek to raise awareness ; some have a more comical approach and others are simply curious observations of the new scenario in which we find ourselves , " they said .
" We think the pandemic will end eventually , but art never dies .
"  But some people are also inspired by the panic and chaos happening in their work .
The elements that are most repeated in " Covid Art " are , as you can imagine , the masks , the toilet paper and yes , the virus itself .
" We think the pandemic will end eventually , but art never dies .
For the time being , this will be our archive on Arte Covid , and in the future , all those interested will be able to find out how the artists expressed themselves during this period , " concluded the founders .
Are we witnessing the emergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to time , trigger our creativity ? .
