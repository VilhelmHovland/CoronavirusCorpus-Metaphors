Open to Opinion  Why India may be flying blind with its nationwide lockdown to contain coronavirus  As the lockdown to contain Covid-19 exacerbates the economic slowdown by reducing the labour supply as well as the consumption of goods and services , the government has to address it by adopting timely relief measures .
The Indian government 's decision of a complete lockdown reduces the overall severity of the epidemic by limiting the spread of the virus .
However , the same decision exacerbates the economic slowdown by reducing the labour supply as well as the consumption of goods and services .
The government will have to address this dichotomy by adopting more efficient measures of containment of coronavirus and launching a series of financial relief packages .
Each of these measures , if executed timely and aggressively , will generate spillover benefits on the other .
Taking into consideration the global morbidity and mortality rates due to Covid-19 , India is likely to tick upwards of 1 .

Assuming 10 per cent of the hospital beds are ICU beds and 50 per cent of these beds have ventilators , we have a maximum of 40,000 ICU beds with ventilators .
Considering 5-10 per cent of all patients will require critical care in the form of ventilator support , other things equal , we will put lives of at least 37,500 patients at serious risk .
However , this is based on a worst-case scenario , relying heavily on global estimates that have a different risk and comorbidity profile .
Given only 22 per cent of the registered deaths in India are medically certified , the real mortality rate due to Covid-19 will be significantly less in India .
The lockdown has forced millions of daily wage earners into joblessness .

This is because , in this approach , the population never reaches the critical level of immunity to avoid a recurrence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing this problem will involve a two-step approach -- ( 1 ) aggressive testing of cases along with increasing the number of quarantine facilities ; followed with ( 2 ) a gradual relaxation of containment measures as the number of new cases begins to decline so that the population approaches the critical immunity level .
Other things equal , the only way out of this pandemic will be to have a substantial population to become infected and recover to acquire immunity .
Testing everyone with flu-like symptoms will ensure Covid-19 cases do not mix with the other hospitalised patients .
In doing so , the use of rapid diagnostic tests should be preferred over RT-PCR to overcome the delay in testing .
The auxiliary nurse-midwife network should be strengthened by infection control training to help provide effective and timely care to village communities .
An immediate ban on over-the-counter selling of anti-malarial drugs should be implemented to maintain the stocks and ensure the medicine is available to those in need .

Although the government has promised a Rs .
lakh crore relief package to mitigate the economic damage caused due to coronavirus , the relief package largely misses out on any support promised to the urban poor .
( Representational photo : Reuters )  Although the government has promised a Rs .
lakh crore relief package to mitigate the economic damage caused due to coronavirus , Care ratings estimate the cumulative economic cost of a 21-day lockdown at Rs .
lakh crore .
Therefore , the current relief package is likely to be insufficient .
This problem is compounded with 90 per cent of the total workforce engaged in the informal economy and a vast majority of these constitute the daily wage earners .
To make matters worse , the relief package largely misses out on any support promised to the urban poor .
The lockdown has forced millions of migrant workers into joblessness and restrained them to the urban areas - leaving them with no choice of taking succour with their families .

There is an urgent need to identify additional resources and maximise its utility .
The windfall gains from the falling crude oil prices can provide a much-needed additional pocket to the government for providing additional financial assistance .
Although there is a fall in the domestic demand for oil , the loss in revenue will be outweighed by the gains through the recent increase in the excise duty on petrol and diesel .
While it may be a little too late , the government can still benefit from implementing some of the measures taken by South Korea , who have flattened the curve of new infections without the economically damaging nationwide lockdown .
For instance , adopting measures such as the use of thermal imaging , setting-up of standalone testing centres , and robust contact tracing .
The subsequent relief measures must target the salaried employees .
The government can provide wage support guarantee to ensure that businesses retain their employees , while delaying hiring .

The RBI can effectively buy securitised tranches of loans from banks if the banks are wary of the current scenario in lending retail loans .
A national lockdown with border closures is likely to be ineffective as it will aggravate the economic damage and reduce the population resilience for fighting the infection peak .
With an economy that was already sliding off the slope , India must reconsider its stance on the nationwide lockdown to ensure the economy does not fall off the cliff .
