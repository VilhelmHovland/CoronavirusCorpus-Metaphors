" A huge part of the reason why many ( but far from all ) people on benefits consciously choose it at a lifestyle " .
What nonsense .
on impossible .
benefits get cut without mercy unless the claimant is striving to get work and can prove it .
Tell you what gets my goat atm , the virtue-signalling fawning over our essential workers ; " ooh are n't they angels , I never knew , thank you so much .
"  Maybe I 'm weird , but I 'm always polite and say thank you to the folk on the tills , I 'll often chat footy with the asst manager in our small co-op , or footy coaching with a lad in Aldi , I always let on to and have a laugh with our bin-men , the guy who used to sweep our road is a legend , ( the wife would often give him a cuppa ) , if I 'm in I always talk to our postie about footy , politics and all kids of shit if he 's got the time , our Hermes delivery lady is also welcome , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've suddenly " got woke " wrt the jobs folk do , jobs you 've sneered at and looked down your noses at because as the nearly poor you hate the really poor , well guess what ? They 're in work and many of you soon wo n't be .
Suck it up , especially if you voted Tory and Brexit .
It is so heart-warming to have a caring PM in these difficult coronavirus times - finally , we are all in this together :  Boris Johnson said three weeks before his Covid-19 diagnosis that he was " shaking hands with everybody , " including coronavirus patients , and would continue to do so -- despite scientific advice warning against the greeting .
According to today 's news Boris Johnson will warn every household in Britain that the coronavirus outbreak is likely to worsen and that he is prepared to tighten the nation 's lockdown .
Brexiters starter pack ( one or all of below may apply ) - you have never gone to school , or high school dropout - you wear Lonsdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone you see- you have only 10 years to live - you 're like " hey mate , you 've got a ciggy on you " or " Mate you 've got some lose change on you " - you 're on benefit and never worked a day 's in your life but claim British job for British people - you say " T0mmy mate , you 're a legend " - Nigel Farce is your dadI posted this on DM app , people are calling for my life .
Between 1997 and 2001 I sobered up from 35 years of alcohol that had become a destructive addiction .
I was totally dependant on the state for those years and the state fed me and housed me without complaint .
When I recovered New Labour were in power and I was supported by WTC , self assessment for income tax and generous housing benefit .
I became a self employed cab driver and made a small fortune , retiring in 2007 .
I will always be grateful to the British welfare system without which I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIP changeover .
They 've cut most of it .
I have to appeal but I have no idea how to survive as an appeal wo n't take place for over a year or possibly two .
The DWP should agree to allow all appeals at this time and pay the increased benefits .
We start another week in La La Land tomorrow .
I am hoping for the best despite the dystopian headlines and disorientating change in the world that seems to get worse daily .
However the blossom is coming on my apple trees and the spring flowers are out .
We will get over this and we can make something positive out of all this .
However it will take a great deal of effort and we need to ensure we do not forget .
Or dare I say it forgive those who allowed us to be so woefully prepared for a foreseeable crisis .
With climate change and a global pandemic , we 're surely being asked to make changes to benefit us all , globally and locally .
The virus does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour are all affected .
Let 's use this to bring about changes for the better for everyone .
A well paid and respected health and benefit system that looks after us all without the bureaucracy , reduction of plastics and waste , grow more of our food needs in this country , less imports less air , sea and road miles , and so much more .
Johnson and his bunglement just drip ineptitude .
Johnson 's personal ineptitude helped put Nazanin Zhagari-Ratcliffe into a long stretch in prison .
Apparently , Johnson 's inefficiency with his email spam folder lost the UK an opportunity to acquire several thousand ventilators and so to forego saving multiple lives with each .
In any case , Brexit seemingly trumps ordinary people 's lives .
U-S-E-L-E-S-S ! ! !  The sooner this ignoble buffoon leaves Downing Street , the better it will be for all of us .
I am waiting for someone to publish a list of Johnson 's cock-ups ( no , not cock up ) .
He brings shame and embarrassment on Britain because of his amateurish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man ? He seems to be an international laughing stock .
No wonder he has never held down a proper job .
Is his pathetic excuse for prowess all the life experience that an old Etonian needs to become Prime Minister ?  The science will be examined with the greatest scrutiny , but the balloonery of some of the commentators on here wont ( hopefully ) .
What people question is their right but lets leave the serious stuff to the experts .
This whole thing demanstrates how important the NHS is .
Although it also demanstrates how fradgile it has been with reduced budgets .
It really has made be sad ? ? how the NHS as been treated ! ! , come a time of need ! !  Some very salient points .
The knowledge , that it will not get better , that there is no way out as things stand and the bureaucracy as it has existed from it 's beginning is not helpful in getting as much help as possible to the needy but ensuring they do not get a farthing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend with .
No we are not all in it together .
The middle classes are all going on about how to cope with stress and manage their mental health , but still getting a salary and have loads of food in their freezers .
Badly paid shop staff , bin collectors , postal workers etc are all bravely trying to carry on providing essential services without ppi and the self serving hand clapping for nhs workers There 's the homeless , the mentally ill , the elderly with no family or support network , a host of people managing on the borderline of poverty , I could go on .
WE are not all on it together , never have been and never will be .
After this , nothing will change .
So why are n't Brexiters picking the fruits and vegetables in the fields now that the EU workers have been chased out ? Why are you desperately trying to fly in people from outside the UK , rather than getting used to work for every penny ?  Sorry , John - but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a lot more free time on their hands ) that the NHS is only under strain because selfish people miss their appointments and " treat it like an all-you-can-eat buffet " .
( Yes , that is a direct quote ) .
Bozo was advised by the Chief medical Officer to self isolate .
If the rest of us want to see a Doctor , we would have to accost them as they came out of their house on their way to the surgery .
Surgery ? You know where we used to go when we were younger when we did n't feel well .
Nice idea , but do you think that British businesses will want to pay those wages ? I do n't .
And the government will do all it can to replace low-paid workers from Central Europe with low-paid workers from Africa , India , wherever , as long as there is a steady stream .
Coronavirus has slightly stymied all that for now .
But I have no doubt whatsoever that businesses will remain low-paying during and after the coronavirus crisis as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a socialist revolution in the UK .
Maybe if we have some great catastrophic environmental collapse , then people in this country might start to think differently .
Until then it will be " I , me , mine " until the end of time .
Corbyn is , was , and will be forever unelectable as the Prime Minister of a Labour government .
Neil Kinnock pointed out years ago .
needs a leader who can win elections - a role for which Corbyn is totally unsuited .
of story .
have to suffer years more of clown government due to this failure of Labour to come up with an acceptable leader .
