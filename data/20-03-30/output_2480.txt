Between COVID-19 and Constitutional Encroachment , By Wole Soyinka  So far , the anti-COVID-19 measures have proceeded along the rails of decentralised thinking , multilateral collaboration and technical exchanges between states .
The universal imperative and urgency of this affliction should not become an opportunistic launch pad for a sneak RE-CENTRALISATION , no matter how seemingly insignificant its appearance .
Constitutional lawyers and our elected representatives should kindly step into this and educate us , mere lay minds .
The worst development I can conceive is to have a situation where rational measures for the containment of the coronavirus pandemic are rejected on account of their questionable genesis .
This is a time for Unity of Purpose , not nitpicking dissensions .
So , before this becomes a habit , a question : Does President Buhari have the powers to close down state borders ? We want clear answers .
We are not in a war emergency .
Appropriately focussed on measures for the saving lives and committed to making sacrifices for the preservation of our communities , we should nonetheless remain alert to any encroachment on constitutionally demarcated powers .
We need to exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interventions that are not backed by law and the constitution .
A president who has been conspicuously AWOL , the Rip van Winkle of Nigerian history , is now alleged to have woken up after a prolonged siesta and begun to issue orders .
Who actually instigates these orders anyway ? From where do they really emerge ? What happens when the orders conflict with state measures , the product of a systematic containment strategy -- including even trial-and-error and hiccups -- undertaken without let or leave of the Centre .
So far , the anti-COVID-19 measures have proceeded along the rails of decentralised thinking , multilateral collaboration and technical exchanges between states .
The Centre is obviously part of the entire process , and one expects this to be the norm , even without the epidemic 's frontal assault on the Presidency itself .
Indeed , the Centre is expected to drive the overall effort , but in collaboration , with extraordinary budgeting and refurbishing of facilities .
The universal imperative and urgency of this affliction should not become an opportunistic launch pad for a sneak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  I urge governors and legislators to be especially watchful .
No epidemic is ever cured with constitutional piracy .
It only lays down new political viruses for the future .
