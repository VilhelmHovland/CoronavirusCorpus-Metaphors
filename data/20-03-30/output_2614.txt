First-year college football coaches facing ' extreme challenges ' in wake of coronavirus pandemic  First-year Baylor coach Dave Aranda is living 450 miles from the school 's football offices in Waco , Texas .
He 's waiting to move into a house there that he 's bought but never actually seen .
And he 's spending his days alternating between reading philosophy , making recruiting calls and balancing work duties with his daughters ' requests for him to make TikTok videos .
Life at the Aranda house in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , unfolds like a lot of American homes these days .
School starts at 8 a .
with the three kids scattered around the house -- 15-year-old Jayden in the den , 13-year-old Jordan upstairs in her room and 10-year-old Ronin in the kitchen -- locked into their assorted virtual schooling .
While Aranda 's kids study , he calls his current players , works on recruiting new ones and communicates with his staff via Zoom .
His wife , Dione , monitors the virtual schooling .
The afternoons have been filled with Aranda toggling between his work duties and the calls to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue with content  Ad  Aranda finds himself caught between navigating a demanding new job in unprecedented times and the life he 'd temporality left behind to go take it .
The Aranda family stayed in Baton Rouge to finish out the school year , and their football coaching father said eight of his 10 assistant coaches have family in a city other than Waco .
Aranda found a quote from his daily philosophy reading to summarize the uncertainty : " Technique is what teachers use until the real teacher arrives .
"  Those spontaneous lessons are being learned around the country by first-year coaches like Aranda , dealing with the restrictions and fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic .
Many are stuck in towns they 'd planned on leaving , coaching a team that ca n't practice and preparing for a season that may not happen .
Much of their coaching is relegated to the video conferencing software Zoom , their vocation executed amid a setting that reminds them of the old Hollywood Squares gameshow .
After winning a title at LSU , Dave Aranda will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( John Korduner/Getty Images )  So while college football has evolved into a virtual enterprise , the reverberations have been strongest among the coaches attempting to adjust to new environments :  * Missouri coach Eliah Drinkwitz says one of his biggest worries for his players doubles as his own : That as he orders dinner on Grubhub from Shakespeare 's Pizza , Pickleman 's Caf ? and Slim Chickens , he ca n't out-train an unhealthy diet .
" I 'm living proof , " he said .
* Boston College coach Jeff Hafley 's 4-year-old daughter , Hope , slides her daily arts and crafts project under his office door with hopes he 'll hang them on his office wall .
The Hafleys have installed a bounce house in their basement , which Hope and 1-year-old Leah use during their dad 's breaks .
* Old Dominion coach Ricky Rahne has been moonlighting as both the history and music teacher for his sons , Ryder ( 10 ) and Jake ( 8 ) , giving lessons in everything from the Nevada gold rush to Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his wife of 28 years , Cari , are empty nesters who suddenly have a full house with their three kids under one roof with the occasional competing zoom call .
* Colorado State coach Steve Addazio is running his program from his vacation home in Cape Cod , Massachusetts , after selling his home near Boston .
While moving trucks have shipped the Addazio 's belongings to Colorado , it 's unknown when he and his wife , Kathy , will be able to arrive and use them .
All those first-year coaches are also living proof of this new normal , tackling new jobs and adjusting to new lives while being housebound for perhaps the first time in their respective careers .
" It 's like the ' Hunger Games ' a little bit just going to the Safeway , " Aranda jokes .
Finding an identity : ' It 's going to be one shot , one kill '  The conversation with Aranda bandied from bible passages to Battleship , his favorite board game that he jokes his kids are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at football , which is going to be complicated as Baylor did n't have a single spring practice before the school shut down athletic activity .
There 's been very little carryover from former coach Matt Rhule 's staff to Aranda 's .
The new offensive coordinator , Larry Fedora , will bring a fresh system , and the defensive system of Aranda and coordinator Ron Roberts will require an overhaul .
While there 's some optimism that there could be extra practices in the summer if a return to normal happens quickly , it 's already certain there will be a sprint to prepare for the season .
So what will Baylor look like from a fundamental football standpoint ?  " It 's going to be , just the facts , man , " Aranda said .
" The mindset changes when you do n't have the practices .
We 'll be clear on an identity .
This is who we are .
This is what we do .
It 's not going to be , ' Try this , ' or ' Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one kill .
"  Aranda hinted that football this fall could end up being less sophisticated and a bit sloppy .
He said teams that can execute the simple things -- get calls in on offense , communicate checks on defense and snap cleanly -- are going to thrive with offseason reps limited .
At LSU , where he served as defensive coordinator the past four seasons , Aranda said they 'd install a bevy of calls for blitzes in the spring -- Install 3 , Tight 4 , Romo 4 and Bradshaw 4 .
That will be streamlined due to lack of opportunity .
" It 'll be the quality of what we know , " Aranda said .
" Not the quantity .
"  Drinkwitz was planning to take the field for Missouri 's fourth spring practice when football activities were shut down .
He 's ahead of Aranda logistically since his wife and four daughters -- ages 5 months to 9 years old -- have already moved into their home in Columbia .
But watching " Frozen 2 " on repeat and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games .
So he agrees with Aranda 's general philosophy that teams are going to have to major in majors , meaning stick to what they do well .
When asked which hurts more , the missed practices or the time to bond with players that the staff hardly knows , Drinkwitz chuckled .
" I think that 's like asking whether you amputate your arm or leg , " he said .
Drinkwitz will be bringing a new offensive system , breaking in a new starting quarterback and will have to do it with little practice time .
Drinkwitz is a believer that reps leads to mastery in football , and that element will be missing .
" Watching it is not the same as doing it , " Drinkwitz said .
It 's difficult to carve an identity for a team when you 've yet to identify the strengths .
" How do you know who to build the offense around ? " he asked .
" Who is the playmaker ? Who is the offensive lineman you run behind on third-and-short ? It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
' What are the strengths and weaknesses of the team ? That 's what 's missing .
"  Missouri football coach Eliah Drinkwitz talks with a fan during an NCAA college basketball game on Jan .
( AP )  Facing unique , ' extreme ' challenges  ODU coach Ricky Rahne is back at his old house in State College , Pennsylvania , where his family had remained while he started his first head coaching job in Virginia .
The Rahnes are " hopefully " closing on a house this week in the Norfolk area , but until then they are abiding by the meticulous school schedule put together by his wife , Jennifer , who has an engineering degree from Cornell .
When school ends , the family retreats to the basement , where Rahne plays hockey and basketball with the sons he calls " rambunctious from central casting .
" For family bonding , the Rahnes play a four-player version of the Diablo III video game and the card game cribbage .
Missing spring practice is n't as much of a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school where he served as offensive coordinator , because of the reservoir of continuity built under James Franklin headed into his seventh season .
ODU , meanwhile , will be installing an entirely new offense and defense under coordinators Kirk Campbell and Blake Seiler .
" It 's one thing to do it on the board and another when they have to make split-second decisions , " Rahne said .
" If it was about the board , I 'd be a great player .
But I 'm not .
We need these guys to be able to do things on the field .
"  Rahne 's team did n't get in any spring practices , as he 'd arranged the calendar to put the practices later .
That allowed them to get in concentrated time in the weight room to help change the team physically .
First-year Florida State coach Mike Norvell got three practices in , and he 's as worried about his team 's physically as he is with football schematics .
Norvell said the FSU roster has transformed itself with 695 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably quell as players lack the access to workout equipment and , in some cases , proper nutrition .
" We made great strides over the last two-and-a-half months , just a drastic change to how we 're going to operate , " Norvell said .
" Not to be side-by-side or face-to-face and in person with our team , it creates some extreme challenges .
"  Hafley has tried to keep things as normal as possible for the Boston College staff , as he says that they 're operating " as if we 're all in the office .
" That means 8 a .
staff meetings over Zoom , virtual meetings with players and Hafley jumping in and out of those position meetings as if he 's walking the halls of the Yawkey Center .
The staff watches recruiting film together virtually , the same as they would in the office .
" This is a different level of being organized , " Hafley said .
" If we can coach in these circumstances , we 'll be much better football coaches because of it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Aranda 's first season at Baylor , he 's hoping that by missing the daily cycle of practice , meetings , walkthroughs , film reviews and tutoring , there is a chance for even greater connection .
He 's spent much more time individually with his players , albeit it on the phone , than he would have in a spring practice setting .
He considers that a silver lining in all this .
" The opportunity for authentic fellowship and connection , " he said .
" It 's funny that you have to be a million miles apart and on Zoom to get that connection .
"  In this strange era of what Aranda refers to as " the real teacher , " new techniques are abound .
And Aranda has been eager to learn and embrace the new circumstance .
" When things do slow down , you 're reintroduced to yourself , " he said .
" The best coaches coach who they are .
To fully know what makes you tick and drives you .
That 's the secret sauce .
