Battling Covid-19  " Internet access is no luxury , but instead a moral human right and everyone should have unmonitored and uncensored access to this global medium -- provided free of charge for those unable to afford it , " Dr .
The right to Internet access , also known as the freedom to connect , is based on the conviction that all people must have equal access to the Internet in order to exercise and enjoy their right to freedom of expression and opinion and other fundamental human rights , and state has a responsibility to ensure that Internet access is broadly available , and may not unreasonably restrict an individual 's access to the Internet .
When it comes to Jammu and Kashmir , we realize that the people of this geographical part have been subjected worst human rights violations and they have been denied the basic moral human rights including the access to high speed internet as well .
On one side the government of India is projecting forward initiatives like " digital India " but ironically in this part of the world , the word ' digital ' is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months now , people here are still craving for access this basic moral human right .
The students , teachers , and the business community have been worst hit due to the restrictions on high speed internet .
To understand the phenomenon I would like to share some facts where it seems clear that how internet has been a subject of discussions over a period of time keeping in view its importance , whenever and wherever this right was denied .
Quoting Dr .
, he writes that , " Without easy access to internet , many people lack a meaningful way to influence and hold accountable supranational rule-makers and institutions .
These individuals simply do n't have a say in the making of the rules they must obey and which shape their life chances " .
In May 2011 , the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression , Frank La Rue , submitted a report to the UN Human Rights Council " exploring key trends and challenges to the right of all individuals to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media " .
The report made 88 recommendations on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of expression online , including several to secure access to the high speed Internet for all .
Moreover , a report recently released by the United Nations argued that disconnecting individuals from the Internet is a violation of human rights and goes against international law .
Some countries have taken things one step further .
Estonia passed a law in 2000 , for example , that declared access to the Internet a basic human right .
In 2009 , France followed .
Legislators in Costa Rica , in 2010 , reached a similar decision .
In 2009 , Finland passed a decree .
stating that " every Internet connection needs to have a speed of at least one Megabit per second ( broadband level ) " .
In India Kerala High court , Justice P .
Asha ( while observing a case of a student who as expelled from the college for using mobile phone beyond restricted hours ) held that the right to access to the internet is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to privacy under article 21 of the constitution .
The court observed that , " when the Human rights Council of united nations has found that the right of access to internet is a fundamental freedom and a tool to ensure right to education ; a rule or instruction which impairs the said right of the students can not be permitted to stand in the eye of law .
"  Now if we analyse all these references with respect to Jammu and Kashmir , we see how it is a dark stain on the worlds so called largest democracy .
Since 5th August 2019 , this place is a symbolic large prison where there have been gross and severe human rights violations .
After remaining cut off from rest of the world for almost seven months , the supreme court of India heard many petitions and issued orders to the JK administration to review the internet gag .
On January 10 , 2020 the apex court said that the internet was a fundamental right and asked the government to review its suspension in the UT of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is major source of information and thus suspension of internet without any particular duration and indefinitely is a violation of telecom rules .
Since then we are craving for high speed internet but the ego of these authoritarians is unshaken .
There have been deadlines after deadlines , raising peoples aspirations but every time the present administration comes with up with same excuses .
This gag on 4G internet affected every sector here but now it is pinching us more severely because amid this COVID-19 outbreak while whole world is employing its means to fight this deadly virus , our doctors , students , businessmen and other professionals continue to suffer .
This was high time for the Govt .
to restore high speed internet services so that masses could get information about the precautions and other guidelines related to COVID-19 .
The students , medicos , journalists and common people were literally begging on social media for the restoration of 4G services but the Jammu and Kashmir administration again ordered the continuance of 2G mobile data services till next date despite a growing demand for restoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .
I wonder , for how long we have to wait !  The worst hit is our already ailing education system .
Our teachers are exploring options like Google classroom and you-tube channels .
They deliver online lectures and make videos available but due to low speed of internet , the students are not able to download or view these online resources .
Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) has called on the GoI to immediately restore high-speed ( 4G ) internet in the J&amp;K saying the existing restrictions on communications are potentially " criminal " during the Covid-19 pandemic and it is the cruel reality to which the citizens of the J&amp;K , including its journalists , are currently being subjected .
"  It is an irony that on one side the Ministry of Human Resource Development has issued orders for teachers of higher education to work from home amid this lockdown .
But is working from home an option for people in J&amp;K who can not even watch WHO video clips on corona virus awareness ? The Ministry of Home Affairs and PMO India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to restore high speed internet here .
In one of recent tweets by MHRD , they were asking students to learn from e-resources and some dedicated channels .
The tweets from PMO continued to share links of e-resources but for whom ? I want to ask them , Are n't we humans living here ? Do n't you consider students of JK at par with the rest of India ? Is n't the education and health of J&amp;K people equally important as of any other Indian ? Are we beggars who have to beg you for every basic fundamental right ?  The GOI and J&amp;K administration must review their iron-fist policy on Kashmir immediately and must restore high speed internet without any further delay so that our students can coop up with the loss they have been suffering from .
Amid this deadly COVID-19 scare , It is high time for them to restore 4G Internet here so that people can get easy and timely access to proper information and guidelines .
