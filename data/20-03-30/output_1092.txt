The move came as regional airline Loganair said airlines were unlikely to survive without a government bailout .
The pandemic has had a severe impact on airlines , Loganair boss Jonathan Hinkles told the BBC 's Tom Burridge .
He said that any airline saying it could survive without government help " would probably be lying " .
' Challenging time '  EasyJet said its cabin crew would be furloughed , with staff paid 80% of their wage from 1 April through the government 's job retention scheme .
The airline 's boss , Johan Lundgren , said he was " working tirelessly " to make sure the airline was " well positioned to overcome the challenges of coronavirus " .
" I am extremely proud of the way in which people across EasyJet have given their absolute best at such a challenging time , " he added .
EasyJet 's headquarters are at London Luton Airport and it has 331 planes .
In normal times , it serves 159 airports and 1,051 routes .
Mr Lundgren said the airline had operated its last rescue flight on Sunday 29 March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as requested " .
What if you have flights booked with EasyJet ?  If your flight has been cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days under EU air passengers ' rights rules .
But getting your cash may prove tricky as the airline - along with British Airways - has removed the usual option where passengers would be sent a link that took them to the booking and they could request their money back online within seconds .
Instead many airlines are trying to persuade passengers to take vouchers instead .
To get your money back you 'll have to phone the airline .
EasyJet told the BBC : " Customers on cancelled flights can transfer to an alternative flight free of charge or receive a voucher for the value of their booking online or claim a refund through our contact centre .
" We are experiencing higher than average wait times so we would thank customers for their patience and assure them that these entitlements will be available long after their cancelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know about the coronavirus ?  ' We have to fly '  Loganair 's Mr Hinkles warned that the connectivity of remote Scottish islands and rural communities across the UK " can not be maintained without air services " , arguing that government support for his airline was " essential " .
Loganair operates routes to the UK 's most remote airports such as Barra in the Outer Hebrides , and it is still ferrying people , mail and essential goods , such as pharmaceutical products , out to about 15 island airports .
Nevertheless , the Scottish carrier has had to ground half of its fleet and dramatically slash its flying schedule .
This has put its entire operation in jeopardy .
" We ca n't just shut down " , Mr Hinkles said .
" Morally , we have to fly .
"  All airlines have called for additional support measures from the government to weather the storm .
The industry group Airlines UK and the Airport Operators Association have asked the government to cover air traffic control charges and payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .
Airlines also want a six-month suspension of the Air Passenger Duty tax , which brings in ? 3bn every year to the Treasury .
A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said that the aviation sector is " important to the UK economy " .
They added : " We are willing to consider the situation of individual firms , so long as all other government schemes have been explored and all commercial options exhausted , including raising capital from existing investors .
"  Meanwhile there is still a fair amount of traffic coming to and from London 's Heathrow airport .
That is because the amount of cargo handling via Heathrow has doubled in recent days as vital supplies are being moved around the globe , including medical equipment , the airport told the BBC .
