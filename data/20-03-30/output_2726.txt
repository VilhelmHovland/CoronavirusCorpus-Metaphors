He 's slim , clean-shaven , in his fifties , with short curly brown hair .
He 's wearing a blue shirt and a spotted red tie .
Steve says BUDGET DAY IS ALWAYS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DAYS ON ANY GOVERNMENT 'S CALENDAR , BECAUSE IT SUMS UP HOW ONTARIO INTENDS TO SPEND MORE THAN 170 BILLION OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS OVER THE UPCOMING YEAR .
BUT HOW IS THE CURRENT FINANCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WHEN NO ONE HAS A CLUE WHAT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ECONOMY NEXT WEEK , LET ALONE NEXT YEAR ? JANET ECKER MAY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT .
SHE WAS ONTARIO 'S FINANCE MINISTER 17 YEARS AGO WHEN ANOTHER PANDEMIC .
SARS .
HIT THE PROVINCE , AND HER BUDGET HAD TO QUICKLY PIVOT TO TAKE THOSE REALITIES INTO ACCOUNT .
SHE JOINS US NOW FROM HER HOME IN AJAX , ONTARIO VIA FACETIME .
Janet is in her fifties , with short blond hair .
She 's wearing glasses and a blue blouse .
Steve continues JANET , IT 'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN .
HOW ARE YOU MAKING OUT ?  Janet says DOING PRETTY WELL .
I 'M IN SOCIAL ISOLATION .
MY HUSBAND AND I CAME BACK FROM FLORIDA ON SUNDAY SO WE 'RE HERE IN THE HOUSE FOR TWO WEEKS DOING OUR BIT .
Steve says GOOD FOR YOU .
DO YOUR DUTY .
I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS : ROD PHILLIPS IS GOING TO BRING DOWN SOME KIND OF ECONOMIC STATEMENT TOMORROW .
HOW DOES HE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ECONOMY RIGHT NOW ?  The caption changes to " Janet Ecker .
Former Minister of Finance .
"  Janet says OH , WITH GREAT , GREAT DIFFICULTY .
SARS WAS NOWHERE NEAR THE CHALLENGE , THE ISSUE THAT ONTARIO .
WELL , EVERY FINANCE MINISTER , BUT CERTAINLY HERE IN ONTARIO ARE FACING .
SO IT 'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT .
AND I CAN REMEMBER ONE OF THE PROVINCIAL FINANCE MINISTERS WHO HAD .
WAS SORT OF TRYING TO BE FINANCE MINISTER DURING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS BACK IN ' 08- ' 09 , STANDING UP IN A SPEECH AND JOKING THAT ALL THE NUMBERS HE WAS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE WERE IN PENCIL , IF YOU WILL , SO HE COULD ERASE THEM , BECAUSE THEY WERE CHANGING ALMOST HOURLY .
AND THAT 'S CERTAINLY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MINISTER PHILLIPS IS FACING .
WE DO N'T KNOW WHAT 'S GOING TO HAPPEN .
WE DO N'T KNOW WHEN THE STOCK MARKET WILL STABILIZE , HOW MANY JOBS WILL BE LOST , WHAT THAT 'S GOING TO DO TO THE GDP .
I WAS SPEAKING TO SOMEONE JUST EARLIER TODAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I SAID , WELL , WHAT 'S THE GDP GOING TO BE , YOU KNOW , WHEN YOU 'RE MAKING THAT CALCULATION ? WE JUST DO N'T KNOW .
SO I THINK IT 'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO BE TRANSPARENT , TO BE OPEN , NOT TO MAKE PROMISES THAT , YOU KNOW , THEY CA N'T KEEP OR THEY DO N'T KNOW IF THEY CAN KEEP , AND LEVEL WITH PEOPLE ABOUT , HERE 'S WHAT WE KNOW TODAY .
HERE 'S WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES .
HERE 'S WHAT WE THINK MIGHT HAPPEN BUT WE DO N'T KNOW .
AND TRYING TO DO ALL OF THAT AT THE SAME TIME AS LOOKING LIKE THEY ARE IN CHARGE AND THEY ARE CONFIDENT AND THEY ARE PROVIDING LEADERSHIP .
SO MY HEART GOES OUT TO MINISTER PHILLIPS BECAUSE IT 'S GOING TO BE VERY , VERY CHALLENGING TO DO .
Steve says I THINK YOU TWO HAVE A BIT IN COMMON .
NOT ONLY FINANCE MINISTERS , NOT ONLY PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVES , BUT I THINK YOU BOTH REPRESENT THE SAME RIDING TOO , DID YOU NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AJAX AND PICKERING , AS I LIKE TO JOKE , BECAUSE MINISTER PHILLIPS , MINISTER Bethlenfalvy .
Steve says YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW HIM WELL .
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM DURING THE COURSE OF ANY OF THIS ?  Janet says THERE 'S BEEN A BIT OF EMAIL BUT HE 'S PRETTY WELL UP TO HIS EYEBALLS .
I KNOW HE 'S BEEN GETTING SOME REALLY GOOD ADVICE FROM SOME REALLY GOOD PEOPLE .
I MEAN , THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HE 'S BEEN AROUND BOTH MUNICIPAL AND THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS BEFORE , YOU KNOW , SO HE 'S GOT BUSINESS EXPERIENCE .
HE 'S PRETTY .
YOU KNOW , THERE 'S A GOOD HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS , WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO OTHER MEMBERS OF OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES , BUT I THINK WE 'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM IN THAT CHAIR .
THERE 'S ALSO SOME OTHER MINISTERS WHO I THINK ARE SHOWING .
AND THE PREMIER .
WHO FRANKLY HAVE BEEN SHOWING GOOD LEADERSHIP IN THIS .
CERTAINLY MINISTER ELLIOTT , OUR HEALTH MINISTER , MINISTER BETHLANFALVY , THE TREASURY BOARD , WHO HAS BEEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOING WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO BE DOING AT THIS TIME .
NOBODY IS PERFECT BUT I THINK THEY 'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED THEM TO DO .
Steve says I GUESS WHAT I WANT A BIT OF A SENSE FROM IN THE BACK ROOMS .
THE PREMIER HAS BEEN CATEGORICAL , DO N'T WORRY , PEOPLE OF ONTARIO , WE HAVE YOUR BACKS .
WE WILL LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED , IS THE WAY HE PUT IT .
DOES THE FINANCE MINISTER GO TO THE PREMIER AND SAY , CAN YOU PUMP THE BRAKES , BUDDY ? YOU 'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY THAT I 'M NOT SURE I CAN PAY FOR .
DOES THAT CONVERSATION HAPPEN AT A MOMENT LIKE THIS ?  Janet says WHAT DOES HAPPEN AT MOMENTS LIKE THIS IS CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS ? HOW MUCH ROOM DO WE THINK WE HAVE ? WHAT CAN WE DO TO PICK UP THE PIECES AFTERWARDS ? ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS WHILE YOU 'RE HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE GIVING YOU SOUND ADVICE ABOUT IN EFFECT , SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN , AT THE SAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO BALANCE , IS THAT IF YOU DO THAT , HOW MUCH DAMAGE WILL THAT DO ? WILL THERE BE BUSINESSES LEFT WHO CAN PICK UP AND HIRE PEOPLE AND PRODUCE OTHER GOODS , ET CETERA , AFTERWARDS ? SO IT 'S A REALLY BIG CHALLENGE .
MY GUESS IS , HAVING WATCHED TRUMP THE OTHER DAY .
GOD FORBID .
YOU KNOW , DOING HIS PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE YOU SAW HIM STARTING TO EQUIVOCATE ON SOME OF THE SHUTDOWN SOCIAL ISOLATION STUFF AND PEOPLE WERE QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT , MY GUESS IS THAT THE ECONOMIC DAMAGE FIGURES THAT HE 'S LOOKING AT ARE STARTING TO BE IN THE NIGHTMARE CATEGORY .
AND SO YOU NEED TO TAKE THE ADVICE OF YOUR HEALTH OFFICIALS .
WE NEED TO BE DOING THE ISOLATION AND SHUTTING THINGS DOWN AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS .
BUT IT 'S A TOUGH BALANCING ACT BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT BUSINESSES OUT THERE NOW THAT LIKE LITERALLY HAVE NO REVENUES COMING IN , THAT ARE HAVING TO LAY OFF STAFF , TAKE SERIOUS PAY CUTS , ET CETERA , AND HOW QUICKLY SOME OF THEM ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFTER THIS IS OVER AT SOME POINT .
NO ONE KNOWS .
SO IT 'S EXTREMELY A CHALLENGING BALANCING ACT , AND WE 'RE GOING TO BE .
I MEAN , ONE OF THE THINGS , STEVE , THAT 'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BALANCED BUDGETS , THIS IS WHY IT 'S SO CRITICAL TO HAVE A BUDGET THAT GIVES YOU SOME FISCAL ROOM TO DO THESE KINDS OF THINGS , BECAUSE OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT , OUR PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT ARE SPENDING LITERALLY BILLIONS AND THEY MAY BE NEEDING TO SPEND MORE AND THERE 'S A LIMIT TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO HERE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BORROW THAT MONEY AND EVERYBODY .
EVERY GOVERNMENT IS OUT THERE SPENDING MONEY , WITH ALL DUE RESPECT , LIKE DRUNKEN SAILORS TRYING TO FIX THINGS AND SUPPORT PEOPLE .
THEY NEED TO DO THAT , YOU WANT THEM TO DO THAT .
BUT THAT 'S THE CHALLENGE : HOW MUCH ROOM DO YOU HAVE TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS WHEN YOU RUN INTO THIS KIND OF CRISIS SITUATION .
SO IT 'S GOING TO BE VERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIGHT NOW THAT 'S NOT THE PRIORITY .
CAN WE FLATTEN THE CURVE , AS EVERYBODY LIKES TO SAY .
AND CAN WE GIVE PEOPLE AS MUCH RUNWAY AS POSSIBLE BY DOING THINGS LIKE , YOU KNOW , GIVING MORTGAGE PAYMENT FREEDOM , IF YOU WILL , CUTTING ELECTRICITY PRICES , SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO DO AS THEY LOOK FOR WAYS TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES .
I MEAN , THAT 'S WHAT THEY NEED TO DO , BUT IT 'S REALLY GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE PICKING THE PIECES UP AFTERWARDS .
Steve says I TAKE YOUR POINT ON THAT .
I SHOULD TELL YOU , I GOT AN EMAIL TODAY FROM SOMEBODY WHO SAID , HOW MUCH PROTECTION DO WE WANT TO GIVE BUSINESSES OUT THERE INASMUCH AS , IF YOU HAD A FAILING BUSINESS BEFORE COVID-19 HIT AND IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT WITHIN , YOU KNOW , A MATTER OF MONTHS OR MAYBE WEEKS , YOU WERE GOING TO HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY OR SHUT DOWN OR WHATEVER , BECAUSE OF THIS CRISIS , SHOULD WE NOW BE GOING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOLLARS TO SAVE THOSE BUSINESSES ? HOW DOES A FINANCE MINISTER TREAT THAT PROBLEM ?  Janet says YOU KNOW , THAT 'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION .
THAT IS ONE OF THE RISKS THAT YOU ANALYZE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPTIONS IN FRONT OF YOU , ABOUT HOW DO WE HELP STABILIZE THE ECONOMY ? THE U .
FINANCE MINISTER .
I THINK IT WAS THE FINANCE MINISTER .
BUT THE U .
GOVERNMENT JUST ANNOUNCED , WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS , I BELIEVE , THAT THEY CA N'T .
THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SAVE EVERYBODY .
I MEAN , THEY 'RE ACKNOWLEDGING RIGHT UPFRONT THAT SOME BUSINESSES .
GOOD , BAD , OR WHATEVER .
ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THE DRAIN AND THERE 'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT .
SO WE 'RE PROBABLY MORE ON THE SIDE OF LOSING ONES THAT WE DO N'T WANT TO LOSE THAN WE ARE SAVING ONES THAT SHOULD N'T BE SAVED , BUT THERE 'S NO QUESTION , WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE COMPANIES .
WHATEVER THE OPTIONS ARE THAT THEY COME OUT WITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : THOSE THAT WE DESPERATELY WANT TO HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED AND CA N'T , AND THOSE THAT , YOU KNOW , WERE PROBABLY ON LIFE SUPPORT TO BEGIN WITH .
BUT WHENEVER GOVERNMENT TRIES TO RESPOND IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS , YOU KNOW , GOVERNMENTS ARE ALWAYS .
IT 'S A VERY BLUNT INSTRUMENT .
SO THERE 'S GOING TO BE GAPS .
THERE 'S GOING TO BE HITS AND MISSES .
AND THE OTHER THING FOR PEOPLE .
FOR ALL OF US TO REMEMBER .
AND I KNOW IT 'S SO EASY TO SECOND-GUESS OUR GOVERNMENT LEADERS AT THE FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL LEVEL .
THERE IS JUST NO TEXT BOOK FOR THIS , NO RULE BOOK FOR THIS .
THERE 'S THINGS THAT PEOPLE THINK WILL HELP .
THERE 'S WAYS THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN DELIVER IT .
YOU 'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF GOOD PEOPLE WORKING 24-7 TO TRY AND DO IT .
BUT IT 'S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT .
THERE ARE GOING TO BE HITS AND MISSES AND THAT 'S THE NATURE OF THINGS .
Steve says SO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO ANTICIPATE TOMORROW WHAT ROD PHILLIPS , THE FINANCE MINISTER , IS GOING TO SAY .
COULD HE REALLY SAY IN HIS ECONOMIC STATEMENT : IF YOU HAD A BUSINESS BEFORE COVID-19 HIT , DO N'T WORRY , WE WILL ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE ONE AFTERWARDS ? IF YOU WERE MAKING X NUMBER OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY BEFORE COVID-19 HIT , DO N'T WORRY , WE WILL EITHER BACKSTOP OR WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BACKSTOP THAT SAME INCOME AFTER COVID-19 IS OVER ? CAN A FINANCE MINISTER REALLY SAY THAT ?  Janet says PERSONALLY , I DO N'T THINK SO .
I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF HE WERE TO GIVE THAT KIND OF BLANKET GUARANTEE BECAUSE THERE 'S NO WAY THAT ANY GOVERNMENT COULD REALISTICALLY DELIVER ON THAT .
WHAT I THINK YOU WILL HEAR HIM SAY , AS THE PREMIER HAS BEEN SAYING , IS THAT THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HELP AND TO HAVE OUR BACK , TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES THEY CAN AND INDIVIDUALS AND WHATEVER .
AND I THINK AS LONG AS HE 'S .
AS LONG AS PEOPLE THINK THAT HE CARES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THAT THEY CAN , THEY 'RE TAKING ADVICE , THEY 'RE CONSULTING WITH THE OPPOSITION , WHICH I GATHER THEY 'VE BEEN DOING AS WELL , BECAUSE THIS IS N'T A PARTISAN ISSUE , YOU KNOW , PEOPLE I THINK WILL WANT TO HEAR THAT REASSURING WORDS BUT NOT .
I MEAN , NOT WORDS THAT ARE GOING TO GUARANTEE THAT , HEY , WE 'RE GOING TO WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND THIS WILL ALL BE OVER .
IT WO N'T BE .
AND IT 'S VERY CHALLENGING FOR ALL OF US .
AND THE STORIES THAT WE 'RE STARTING TO HEAR FROM INDIVIDUALS IN BUSINESS AND JUST PERSONAL LIVES , YOU KNOW , WOULD BREAK YOUR HEART .
BUT , HEY , WE ARE ALL GOING TO HOLD HANDS AND GET THROUGH THIS .
Steve says HMM .
I 'VE GOT A FEW MINUTES LEFT AND I WANT TO ASK YOU TWO MORE QUESTIONS .
THIS ONE IS JUST ABOUT BRASS KNUCKLES POLITICS HERE .
AND TO ASK THIS QUESTION I WANT TO SET IT UP BY REMINDING YOU OF , GOSH , HOW MANY YEARS AGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LARRY GROSS WAS WHAT THEY CALL THE TREASURER OF ONTARIO , ESSENTIALLY THE MINISTER OF FINANCE TODAY , AND HE HAD TO GO TO NEW YORK TO BEG FOR THE CREDIT RATING FOR THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO , AND AS HE TOLD ME THE STORY BACK IN THE DAY HE SAID , I KNEW IF I LOST THE TRIPLE-A CREDIT RATING FOR THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO WEAR IT AND BILL DAVIS WAS SOON TO RETIRE AND I WOULD RUN FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND THAT WOULD NOT BE A GREAT WAY TO START MY LEADERSHIP CAMPAIGN .
I SET THIS STORY ON THE RECORD ONLY INASMUCH AS , WE KNOW THAT ROD PHILLIPS THOUGHT ABOUT RUNNING FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PARTY THE LAST TIME AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED NOT TO BUT HE CLEARLY WILL BE THINKING ABOUT IT THE NEXT TIME THE LEADERSHIP IS OPEN .
HOW MUCH OF HIS OWN PERSONAL POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS , WHICH ARE COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE .
POLITICIANS ARE AMBITIOUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR EYE ON THE PRIZE .
HOW MUCH OF THAT WILL FACTOR INTO TOMORROW 'S ANNOUNCEMENT ?  Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUITE FRANKLY , STEVE .
LISTEN , I MEAN , EVERY POLITICIAN IS HUMAN .
THEY DO THINK ABOUT , GEE , IS THIS GOOD , IS THIS BAD , WHATEVER .
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY , IN A CIRCUMSTANCE SUCH AS THIS , BASED ON WHAT I 'M HEARING AND SEEING FROM THEM , THE BIGGEST PRIORITY IS JUST MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION BECAUSE IF THERE WAS EVER .
GOOD POLITICS IS GOOD POLICY SITUATION , THIS IS IT .
PEOPLE WANT THEIR POLITICIANS TO TAKE ACTION THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE , THAT WILL HELP AND , YOU KNOW , THEY 'RE ALL GOING TO BE JUDGED , FROM THE PREMIER ON DOWN , FROM OUR PRIME MINISTER ON DOWN , YOU KNOW , DID THEY TAKE ACTION ? HOW DID THEY TAKE ACTION ? WERE THEY OPEN , TRANSPARENT , EMPATHETIC , ET CETERA .
I THINK IN THIS CASE THE TEMPTATION TO BE , QUOTE , POLITICAL , IS NOT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE REALLY , REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HERE .
Steve says OKAY .
LAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MINISTER , SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR DECADES IN THIS GREATER TORONTO AREA , HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU THAT BY THE TIME THIS COVID-19 CRISIS IS OVER , OUR ECONOMY WILL HAVE BEEN SO DEVASTATED THAT IT WILL TAKE US WHO KNOWS HOW MANY YEARS TO PICK UP THE PIECES ?  Janet says WELL , I THINK THAT 'S THE WORRY .
YOU KNOW , WE HAVE AN ECONOMY , WE HAVE A PEOPLE .
WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT HAS PROVEN INCREDIBLY RESILIENT BEFORE .
BUT WE 'VE NEVER BEEN WALLOPED LIKE THIS BEFORE EITHER IN THIS KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCE .
AND SO I THINK THAT IS VERY MUCH THE WORRY OF OUR POLITICAL LEADERS , MINISTER MORNEAU , MINISTER PHILLIPS AND OTHERS , HOW MUCH WILL BE LEFT , AND I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING TOO IS THAT THEY 'RE STARTING .
AS THEY LOOK AT THE ECONOMY , IT 'S , WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP THAT .
EVERYBODY GET BACK ON THEIR FEET , BUT ALSO LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF WHICH INDUSTRY SEGMENTS MIGHT BE ABLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DO TO HELP THEM ? OR WHICH SEGMENTS ARE PROBABLY A LOST CAUSE OR GOING TO TAKE FOREVER TO GET BACK UP ON THEIR FEET .
SO HOPEFULLY .
AND I THINK SOME OF THAT PLANNING AND THAT RESEARCH IS BEING DONE NOW , BUT THAT IS THE BIG WORRY : WHAT IS LEFT WHEN THE DUST SETTLES ?  Steve says JANET , TAKE GOOD CARE .
SAY HI TO DEREK FOR US .
IF IT 'S POSSIBLE , ENJOY YOUR TWO WEEKS IN ISOLATION AS YOU GET THROUGH THIS COVID BUSINESS .
Janet says WASH YOUR HANDS AND BUY TOILET PAPER STOCK .
Steve says AMEN TO THAT .
THAT 'S JANET ECKER , THE FORMER FINANCE MINISTER FOR THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO .
