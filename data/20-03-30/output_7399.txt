" We were having difficulty obtaining the proper PPE ( personal protective equipment ) N95 mask , " said Jeffrey Brooks , DMD , executive associate dean and associate dean of clinical affairs for the UTHSC College of Dentistry .
" The Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery decided to get creative and to fabricate a mask that would allow us to use N95 or similar material to manufacture our own PPE , specifically masks .
"  The college has been working to design maks that will allow the most production of masks in the shortest amount of time .
Over 10 custom masks have been printed so far .
With this design , the mask can be disinfected and the filter component can be replaced , according to the UTHSC .
UTHSC Dentistry says the masks have an airtight fit and are custom made for each provider .
The masks will be used by the College of Dentistry faculty and residents who operate an emergency dental clinic at UT and serve children 's dental needs at LeBonheur .
