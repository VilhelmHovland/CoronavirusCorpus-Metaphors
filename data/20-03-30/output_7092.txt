Tennis-WTA working on better pay , considers extending Tour  MUMBAI , March 31 ( Reuters ) - With lower-level players reeling financially from the tennis shutdown over the coronavirus , the Women 's Tennis Association ( WTA ) told Reuters it is working to boost players ' earnings when the sport resumes and considering extending the 2020 season .
The tennis season screeched to a halt in early March due to the virus , leaving players in the lowest tiers without any opportunity to earn their livelihoods .
" The WTA is diligently working with our tournaments to maximize earning possibilities when the professional tennis circuit is able to resume and is considering an extension to the current 44-week season to enable more tournaments to take place , " the association told Reuters in a statement .
" It is our sincere hope to return to the court as soon as possible - when the health and safety or our players , fans and staffs can be guaranteed , we will be back competing .

" We wish there was a way everyone , especially those in need the most , could be compensated at the level they were expecting , but the needs are so great and the WTA unfortunately is not in a financial position to do that , " the WTA said .
" Professional tennis players are independent contractors and not employees of the WTA .
