HONG KONG , CHINA -- Media OutReach -- 30 March 2020 -- To combat the spread of COVID-19 , the Chinese government imposed an unprecedented and controversial lockdown on Wuhan , a city of 11 million people , starting on the morning of January 23 , and then in other Hubei cities several days later .
Under the order issued by the government , all public transport , including buses , trains , flights and ferry services , were suspended .
Residents of Wuhan were also not allowed to leave the city without permission .
This lockdown , which is only being relaxed two months on as the number of new infections in China has tailed off , is being emulated by a growing number of governments from the U .
, Italy and Spain to the Philippines as infections have spread across the globe , with over 360,000 people infected and over 16,000 dead .
- Advertisement -  A new study has further strengthened the case that COVID-19 cases in China would have been significantly higher had the government not enacted the historic lockdown on the city of Wuhan in the early days of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of School of Hotel and Tourism Management at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ( CUHK ) Business School in collaboration with Prof .
Hanming Fang at the University of Pennsylvania and Prof .
Long Wang of ShanghaiTech University , the study sought to quantify and isolate the effect of restricting travel on the spread of the virus .
- Advertisement -  It estimated COVID-19 infections would have been 64 .
percent higher in Chinese cities outside Hubei province , and 52 .
percent higher in the other cities within Hubei but outside the provincial capital and outbreak epicentre of Wuhan , if the government had not acted to shut the city .
The results of the latest study has lent further weight to previous findings that the lockdown significantly delayed the spread of the virus across China .
Controlling for the fact that the virus itself would have reduced travel on its own , and the panic would have increased travel , it found that the lockdown on Wuhan itself cut the outflow of people from the city by 56 .
percent compared to if a quarantine had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people into the city by 76 .
percent and movement within the city by 54 .
percent .
These results were then correlated with COVID-19 infections figures released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention , also known as China CDC .
" We find , using simulations with these estimates , that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan , even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities , " says Prof .
Yang .
This model was also extrapolated to estimate the actual number of infection cases in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei .
If a lockdown had not been put in place , the 347 cities in China outside Hubei would have recorded a total of 20,810 cases as of the end of February , compared to the actual number of 12,626 .
Similarly , for 16 cities within Hubei but outside of Wuhan , cases would have reached 23,400 without the mandatory quarantine , instead of the actual 15,330 .
It also found a persistent gap between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuhan from the start of the outbreak .
This gap widened over time , possibly as a result of the overwhelmed health care system and peaked on January 26 , with the number of official cases constituting 80 .
percent of the estimated total , before tailing off to settle at around 11 .
percent .
" We are thus able to conclude that almost all infection cases in Wuhan were able to be treated over time as the stress on the health system was relieved , " says Prof .
Yang , adding that the discrepancy may be explained because some of the infected may have recovered on their own or died without reporting their situation during the early stages .
If the mandatory quarantine had not been put in place , the simulation also predicted that new infections would still have peaked on their own -- on February 2 in Hubei excluding Wuhan , 9 days after the real-world lock down took place , and on February 3 elsewhere in China .
It also predicted that estimated new cases would gradually converge to the real-world reported daily cases by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing measures implemented elsewhere in China would have worked eventually to contain the spread of the virus , even if the city of Wuhan was not locked down , " Prof Yang says .
" However , the initial onslaught on the medical system in all cities in China would have been much more severe , and the total number of infection cases elsewhere would have been significantly higher .
"  Elsewhere in China , the study also looked at the effectiveness of less severe lockdowns implemented to different degrees in other cities , from establishing checkpoints in building entrances and quarantine zones , shutdowns on public transport as well as limits on the movement of people in and out as well as within cities .
" The results suggest that these enhanced social distancing policies in destination cities were effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from Wuhan and other source cities in Hubei .
This in turn implies that population inflows from the epicentre contribute to the spread of infection only before the social distancing measures were applied .
" It appears that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can flatten the upward trajectory of the virus , " Prof .
Yang adds , noting that the results of the study will have strong implications on other countries in their fight against COVID-19 .
