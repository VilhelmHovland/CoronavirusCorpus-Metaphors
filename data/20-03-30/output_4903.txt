Gandhi appealed to Congress workers to help such migrants by offering them food and shelter .
" The government is responsible for this terrible condition .
It is a big crime to bring citizens to this condition .
Today , in the hour of crisis , our brothers and sisters should at least get respect and support , " he said .
Out of work &amp; facing an uncertain future , millions of our brothers &amp; sisters across India are struggling to find their way back home .
It 's shameful that we 've allowed any Indian citizen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contingency plans in place for this exodus .

Out of work and facing an uncertain future , millions of " our brothers and sisters across India are struggling to find their way back home " , the Congress leader said .
" It 's shameful that we 've allowed any Indian citizen to be treated this way and that the government had no contingency plans in place for this exodus , " he said .
The Congress leader also tagged a video of migrant labourers lining up in long queues waiting for transport to take them home that has gone viral .
Gandhi said " hundreds of our starved and thirsty brothers and sisters , along with their families , are forced to walk down towards their villages " .
" If you can , please provide them with food , water , shelter to them during this arduous journey .
I particularly appeal for help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tweeted in Hindi .
Congress senior spokesperson Ajay Maken said migrants were facing immense distress after the lockdown .
They have lost faith in the government as they have either lost their jobs or had no money to fend for themselves in cities , he said  " The government was ill-prepared as far as fighting this coronavirus is concerned .
I think , the government took a knee-jerk reaction as I gave the example of South Africa .
" They took three days time , they gave three days notice to implement 21 days lockdown , so , why did n't the ruling BJP , give enough time to people to prepare and prepared themselves , " Maken said .
He said the first immediate thing is that the central government should ensure migrants are adequately taken care of and they are not left on the streets and on highways .
Social distancing should also be maintained while transporting them home , Maken said .
He also demanded that Rs 7,500 be transferred to their bank accounts and adequate arrangements are made for their food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the government can send planes to bring back Indians from abroad , why can not it provide transport to send the labourers home .
" How can we as a nation just leave thousands of migrant workers to fend for themselves ? There are men , women and children who are walking as far as Eastern UP and Bihar , " she said .
" We sent planes to bring citizens from Europe , why are n't we organising transport to take the poorest and most vulnerable amongst us home , " she tweeted .
She said it is the government 's moral duty to help fellow citizens in this time of crisis .
" For God 's sake , Modi ji and Amit Shah ji please use the power you have been given to save their lives , " Priyanka Gandhi said in an appeal to the PM and home minister .
" Do not give this treatment to our own Indians .
We should be ashamed that we have left them in this state .
These are our own .
Labour is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said while lauding the efforts of the UP Congress in helping the people in this hour of crisis .
The Congress has been critical of the government 's handling of the situation , accusing it of not taking adequate steps to mitigate the plight of migrant labour force .
Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had also written to the prime minister , urging him to take immediate steps to help the poor migrant labour force , who have been forced to return home on foot in the absence of public transport amid the country-wide lockdown due to coronavirus .
The Union Home Ministry on Saturday changed the rules for assistance under the State Disaster Relief Fund ( SDRF ) , facilitating availability of money for food and temporary accommodation for migrant workers during the 21-day lockdown .
In a communication to all chief secretaries , the ministry also said medical care and clothing can be provided to migrant workers during the period .
