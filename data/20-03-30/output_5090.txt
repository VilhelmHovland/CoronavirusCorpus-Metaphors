Through Friday 's close , the Dow is off more than 26% from its record close on February 12 .
The S&amp;P 500 is down 24% form its February 19 record close .
The Nasdaq has declined more than 23% from its recent high .
And these declines include the rally investors saw last week when the S&amp;P 500 recorded its largest weekly jump since 2009 .
With surprising speed , investors have begun asking if the worst is over for the markets .
" The positive tone in most of our conversations with clients echoed the signal in positioning measures , including a sharp rise in hedge fund net leverage and a steep decline in put/call ratios , " said Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin in a note to clients published Friday .

Some experts predict that the curve in the United States will crest in April .
A peaking , and then flattening , of the curve does not , of course , mean the public health crisis ends .
There are significantly harder days ahead for the health care system .
There are harder days ahead for all of us .
