Open for Business : Westwood Cycle racing to keep up with demand  Small businesses are at the heart of our communities .
The Open for Business series is our effort to document the struggles of our local merchants in these unprecedented times , and to highlight their resourcefulness , resilience and creativity .
In the age of social distancing , cycling is one of the few outside-the-home activities that do n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westwood Cycle , a bike shop that 's been operating in Westwood since 1946 , has customers flocking to its website and flooding the store with calls about getting repairs for their old bikes .
How has this experience been for you ?  There is a dramatic increase in requests for tuneup , service and repair on existing bikes .
In new bike sales , there is interest in some of the affordably priced bicycles , since people can go outside and get some fresh air and exercise .
And kids ' bikes -- they are definitely in high demand right now .
Ordinarily , springtime is extremely busy for us , with tremendous traffic flow into the store .
But we 've seen an increase in services and repairs that is flooding us .
We have a backlog of tuneups and repairs .
Traditionally , it may be a three-day turnaround on a tuneup , but now we are into five to seven days .
What is your biggest concern for the business ?  We certainly expect that this fiscal year , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at last year .
Every day , a customer will tell us they 've been furloughed or laid off , so that 's impacting their purchasing decisions .
Typically , a bicycle is discretionary income , although there are people who use it for transportation .
Ordinarily , they could come to the store , look around and touch stuff , but with shelter-in-place , we ca n't currently legally have customers in the store for retail sales .

- USA TODAY NETWORK  Interested in this topic ? You may also want to view these photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Every single customer that we have had a phone or verbal conversation with are extremely happy and grateful that we can be here .
I ca n't say it 's business as usual , because things are different , but we can get the word out that bike shops are open and customers should call their local bike shops .
We can really use everyone 's support at this time .
What safety precautions are you taking ?  Governor Murphy has decreed that bicycle shops are essential businesses .
We can legally be here and operating .
Customers can curbside drop off a bicycle for a tuneup service .
Once we have it ready to pick up , they can do payment over the phone and the bike will be available for them to pick up curbside to minimize any human interactions .
In terms of new bikes and accessories , that can be done through our website , which has a payment portal .
Again , they would go to curbside pickup .
For any new bike purchase , if it 's a local customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're happy to take orders over the telephone or email as well .
We disinfect everything in the store : door handles , telephones , computers , sales counter , pens and credit card terminals .
When we take a bike in , we will sanitize it and when we present the bike to someone , we will disinfect before we hand it off .
Why do you think people are gravitating toward cycling during these times ?  You can go outside and ride -- it does n't cost you anything .
There 's very little car traffic ; if you 've driven around this past week , you 'll notice that in both residential and urban areas , there are very few cars .
There 's plenty of parks with bike paths .
People can get out and not need to be in close proximity to each other .
It 's a great way for someone who does n't jog or run to have a low-impact form of exercise .
What can the community do to help ?  Send a letter or email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are great , and let 's keep them open as essential businesses .
Support the local retailers with purchases through their local website ; buy some stuff .
Talk to people who are influencers in your town , county or state about making cycling safer for everyone , whether it 's on the roads or opportunities for parks where people can enjoy their bikes with their families .
