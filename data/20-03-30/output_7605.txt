Navy docks carrier , marines weigh buzz cuts as virus spreads  The Pentagon is struggling to stay ahead of the expanding coronavirus pandemic as early missteps start piling up , a scattershot response sows confusion and the Navy is forced to sideline an aircraft carrier .
The USS Theodore Roosevelt , a 5,000-person aircraft carrier meant to be patrolling the Pacific and South China Sea , is instead sitting dockside in Guam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Infections started cropping up after an early March port call in Vietnam , which Pentagon leaders say had about 16 known virus cases at the time .

( Photo : Howard Lipin , TNS , File )  Defense Secretary Mark Esper says he 's leaving key decisions about how to address the outbreak to local commanders .
But as infections mount and more warriors are sidelined , Pentagon leaders will face difficult questions about how to stay fully ready to confront rivals from North Korea to Iran and how to signal unflagging resolve to such adversaries .
" The military is torn between its need to maintain operations , which can not be done with social distancing , ' and the need to restrict interactions to inhibit infections , " said Mark Cancian , a military analyst with the Center for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine Corps colonel .
" It has still not figured out how to strike that balance .
"  Marine Buzz Cuts  The piecemeal approach means that , in some cases , basic precautions that prevent troops from being put at risk are being ignored .
Across the U .
, civilian barbers are still driving onto military bases to give Marines buzz cuts .
That was a decision the top Marine struggled to explain at a news briefing Thursday .
" Everybody 's still getting their heads shaved as long as the barbers come to work , " said General David Berger , the Marine Corps commandant .
" Things like grooming standards -- barber shops in one area may be open , and in another base they may be closed .
So we very much trust the leaders to make those calls , and we 've given them the latitude to waive requirements where it 's not practical to meet them .
"  On Monday , the Pentagon said there have been 569 confirmed cases of coronavirus among active military personnel , up from 340 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of the force , but the case of the USS Roosevelt encapsulates how quickly a seemingly minor problem can hamper one of the world 's biggest warships .
After the first three sailors on the carrier were evacuated , Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly projected confidence about the ship 's status , saying it would continue sailing .
" This is an example of our ability to keep our ships deployed at sea , underway even with active Covid-19 cases , " Modly said March 24 .
But two days later , the carrier was sidelined indefinitely in Guam as the Navy tries to contain the outbreak .
Emma Moore , a researcher on military and veterans issues at the Center for a New American Security , said the virus outbreak has resulted in some " cringe-worthy " decisions being made as the military sorts out which personnel and missions are more essential than others .
" Ultimately this public health crisis has shown that the military has gaps to fix in areas it would have considered itself an expert : communication , fast response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citing how the Navy continued crowded meetings in close quarters on ships and the barbers still are coming on to bases to give Marines buzz cuts .
Testing Limited  Like many states and cities , the military 's ability even to test for the virus is limited .
Modly said in an interview Friday with Hugh Hewitt that the Roosevelt can test about 200 sailors per day , meaning it would take more than three weeks to test everyone on board .
But he disputed the idea that the ship would be out of action if major hostilities erupted .
" If there was a reason for her to go into action she would just go , " Modly said .
" She 's close enough to some trouble spots that she could mobilize and go quickly .
"  There have been other missteps .
The Army briefly stopped most training exercises only to restart them days later .
And the service waited until Thursday to raise its health protection status to " D , " the highest level , for critical rapid-response forces that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep those troops isolated and ready to fight .
" All the chiefs are wrestling with the same issue or same challenges , " General James McConville , the Army chief of staff , said in a press briefing on Thursday .
" They want to protect the force , but at the same time they know they have a mission to protect , and that 's the balance .
" He added that " we need to do more to limit exposure , especially for those who are not doing mission essential tasks .
"  It was n't until March 13 that the Pentagon established a coordination task force to work closely with Office of the Secretary of Defense , Joint Staff , the military services and other agencies to develop policy documents and provide recommendations to senior leadership , according to a memo signed by Navy Captain Oliver Lewis , the Defense Department 's executive secretary .

It also closed recruitment centers .
Before Congress managed to draft an economic stimulus bill to help workers and businesses impacted by the pandemic , the Pentagon moved quickly to accelerate payments to contractors to help ensure they keep production lines open .
Military leaders also have praised General Robert Abrams , the commander of U .
forces in South Korea , for taking drastic measures to prevent troops from being exposed to the coronavirus by locking down bases in February , as that country 's outbreak exploded .
" Where the threat was most acute , the leadership acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a retired Army lieutenant general and director of the Center for National Defense at the Heritage Foundation .
Some military leaders concede the scope of the virus threat was n't fully understood before it took root globally .
" We started putting some of these data points together and trying to string it together over the course of February , " Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy , who visited South Korea to see the situation firsthand in February , said at the Pentagon Thursday .
" It 's just been a very , very complex issue that 's taken time to get the data points together .
"  North Korea , Iran  Pentagon leaders have warned that adversaries will seek to take advantage of any weakness , real or perceived , in the U .
's focus or military strength because of the pandemic .
Since the outbreak started , North Korea has launched short-range ballistic missiles in defiance of international sanctions , while Iranian proxies have staged attacks on bases in Iraq where the U .
has troops .

Pentagon spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said in an email that while the Defense Department is " committed to transparency , " readiness data " for key military forces is information that is classified as a risk to operational security and could jeopardize operations and/or deterrence .
"  Such threats are also why some things wo n't change unless the outbreak in the military gets far worse .
Berger , the Marine commandant , signaled as much when he was asked about the wisdom of large-scale formations at rifle ranges and training exercises that are continuing .
" The Marine Corps is unique , " he said Thursday .
" We are mandated by law to be the nation 's most ready force , and that 's what I think you expect us to be .
"  But epidemiologists have warned countries against an uncoordinated response to the pandemic , saying strong measures in one area can be undermined by weaker responses elsewhere .
Nations like Italy and Iran that have reacted slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest infection and death rates .
While the Pentagon is n't a nation-state , it operates like one .
In addition to 1 .
million active-duty service members , the military runs fleets of planes and ships , operates grocery stores , staffs recruitment centers in strip malls and functions as the chief employer in many communities .
For now , the Pentagon is sticking with its position that local commanders are best-suited to make the right decisions , and warning that disruptions from the virus could last for months .
" I trust upon our commanders and our senior enlisted personnel to do the right thing particular to your unit , to your situation , to your mission , " Esper said during a virtual town hall on Tuesday .
" It 's up to the commanders and senior NCOs to make the right calls relevant to their situation to ensure that we protect our people while at the same time maintaining mission readiness .
