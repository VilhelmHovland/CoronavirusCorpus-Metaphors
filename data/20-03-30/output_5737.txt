Dated : 3/31/2020 12:54:11 AM  NEW DELHI , Mar 30 : Several social organisations and peace groups in the country have called for an end to racial hate crimes amidst the outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic and the lockdown .
The organisations referred to some of the incidents of harassment to women from north-east and the racist slurs that are being made on the social media .
The full text of the statement is as follows : " Besides fear , uncertainty and overwhelming shortages of food and medical resources , the Coronavirus global pandemic is also accompanied by numerous instances of bigotry and racism across the world against East and South East Asians .
With some regimes opting to deliberately refer to it as the ' Chinese ' virus , one can not miss the invisible conservative state approval of this cruelty .
mainland India , racial attacks and slurs have been directed at people from the North Eastern region of India , always .
They are politically appropriated as Indians and socially ostracized for not being ' Indian ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum by India and the Nepalese migrant workers , are victims of this racial targeting .
The times of Corona seem to have made matters worse , with multiple reports of physical and verbal abuse and racial profiling coming from Gujarat , Pune , Kolkata , Delhi , Mumbai and Dehradun , to name a few of the major cities .
from the community , including University students , have reported that they have been called ' Chinese ' , ' Corona ' and other racial slurs .
In some cases , when offenders were confronted for their racism , the response was to cover their faces and walk or run away , to show hysterical fear , or to laugh away the accusation .
There have also been instances when those with distinctly Mongoloid features have been spat at by miscreants from moving vehicles .
Many were maliciously targeted and attacked during Holi , being called ' Corona ' and such slurs .
Besides these widely reported racist attacks , families have also been asked to not come to grocery shops and other public places .
Delivery ' executives ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their restaurants and delivering to their homes .
The United North East Residents ' Forum also shared an incident where a family from Manipur was denied accommodation in Delhi because the house owners believed they were from China .
believe this racism is directed against the diverse lifestyle , dress , language , food varieties and cultural patterns of the different communities who have for long been inhabitants of the Brahmaputra/Siang basin .
A foundation of bigotry , cultural prejudice and racist attitudes among mainland Indians has long fostered such hostility and criminal ignorance .
Lack of knowledge , information and interest about the region , people , their culture and history has ensured such actions continued undeterred .
Adding to this historical lacuna of understanding are irrational social media circulations which claim , among other outrageous things , that Coronavirus is a global attack by China .
We condemn sections of Indian media continuing to use ' Chinese Virus ' language propelling and endorsing the racist hatred .
are also social media messages that are circulated about how the virus is an outcome of the eating habits of people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise people believe what they see on social media when the Prime Minister himself quotes from fake news in the Parliament .
We condemn such messages and urge the governments to take strict action against those who are indulging in such racial abuse using social media .
demand that central and state governments show no tolerance against offenders , responding with appropriate punitive action .
We also request citizens to intervene when members of the community are being harassed and intimidated , by speaking up against offenders and onlookers , as well as helping the aggrieved inform the authorities .
Government must address the racial prejudices within the police department and paramilitary forces and instructions be given for strict adherence to rule of law and protection of all citizens .
most media has been prompt in its reportage of racist attacks against people from the North Eastern states of India and authorities have taken some action in a few cases , it is unlikely to quell attacks and insults in the long run .
There is need for a deeper engagement , which involves mainlanders abandoning racial prejudices .
If India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' people ' and if the ' people of India ' comprise those living on all frontiers , then the mainlanders have no business selling their culture as the ' definitive and only ' Indian culture .
Either the culture of the frontiers is Indian culture or the frontiers do n't belong to India .
commit to make available , a list of written and audio-visual material for interested citizens to better inform themselves about the political history of the Brahmaputra/Siang basin , which has morphed into the ' north-east of India ' , in precisely those minds which do not even accept the people from the region as Indian .
Those interested in escaping the shroud of ignorance should also talk to their neighbours , children , and community members .
A sensible society , based on nuanced thought , scientific temperament , and access to information is the best deterrent against racial prejudice .
It is as important as Indians shedding casteism , xenophobia , and disrespect to people from lower strata of the society .
