My wife suffered complete memory loss at childbirth  " We noticed that she had lost her ability to speak , in addition to losing all her memory .
She was also completely paralysed on her right side and had incontinence issues .
"  Imagine having to relearn everything that was second nature to you for decades .
Forgetting who you were and the special moments that made up your life .
Well , Dorothy Mukui does n't have to imagine it .
She is living it .
But her face betrays no inner turmoil or trace of bitterness .
She smiles like a woman with the secret knowledge of what hell feels like but walked out undefeated .
A victorious smile .
Almost always at her side is her soon-to-be husband , at least officially ; Francis Mukui .
They are supposed to be exchanging vows next month , but due to the ripple effects of Coronavirus , the couple will have to hold off a little longer .
They are no strangers to waiting though .
They have waited for what seems to be a lifetime to get where they are now .
And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to remember a word mid-sentence .
Sometimes she will succeed and other times he will need to fill it in for her .
Francis has many a time patiently stood over her on the stove reminding her how to cook ugali or their favourite meal of beef stew and traditional veggies .
And slowly , with good humour and endless love , she has relearnt all the skills she could effortlessly do 10 years ago .
And if Coronavirus wants to delay their white wedding , it can bring it on , they can wait a lifetime if they have to .
Their journey began in 2004 .
When Dorothy and Francis met , their friendship blossomed almost instantly .
Francis had just been transferred to the office where Dorothy worked .
Theirs was a whirlwind romance , and soon , formalities were made .
However , they did n't set about starting their family immediately .
They chose instead to enjoy their time together as they worked hard at building their respective careers .
But during the Easter of 2009 , they discovered that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wild ride that none of them could have possibly imagined .
The baby was expected to be born in January 2010 , and the lovebirds were as happy as could be .
However , for Dorothy , the pregnancy was n't a smooth ride , but she was excited to take it all in if it meant holding a healthy baby in her arms .
When she was about six months along , her legs and face began to swell and the area around her eyes was very puffy .
" Because of the nature of my work , I had to stay in Nairobi while Dorothy stayed in Kiambu , but I would see her on my days off as well as on the weekends , " Francis says .
One Sunday in November , Francis was away for work but called his wife to check on her .
" I remember her telling me that she was experiencing a slight headache .
The headache still had not subsided when I called her the following day .
So we decided that she should visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday morning , Francis received a call from Dorothy 's friend telling him that she had been rushed to the hospital in Kiambu .
" By then , her headaches had become severe and her speech was slurred .
Her face and legs were also swollen .
The doctor recommended an ultrasound to check how the baby was doing .
They confirmed the baby was OK , " he recalls .
However , two hours later , at 1 pm , things took a turn for the worse .
Dorothy began convulsing and muttering unintelligible words .
That is when the doctors decided to deliver the baby .
Dorothy was only 28 weeks pregnant .
She was wheeled into the theatre around 3 pm .
To Francis , the world around him had ceased to exist .
All he cared about was seeing his wife and baby .
At 4 pm , when he could not bear the anxiety anymore , he went to seek answers .
He was informed him that the operation had ended 30 minutes earlier .
" I went in to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsive .
Jasmine , our baby was doing fine too , she only weighed 900 grams at that time , " he told My Health .
She was oh so tiny but perfect , and now , Jasmine , due to the comatose state of the mother , would have to make do with infant formulae until her mama was well enough to breastfeed her .
A few days later , the doctors recommended that Dorothy be transferred to a bigger hospital because she needed a neurosurgeon 's care .
" This meant that Jasmine would be left at Kijabe Hospital , where she was born , while I worked on getting her mum better treatment in Nairobi where she was put in the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) , " Francis recalls .
Days later , she would wake up .
But she was n't quite the same .
" We noticed that she had lost her ability to speak , in addition to losing all her memory .
She was also completely paralysed on her right side and had incontinence issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CT scan on Dorothy which revealed that she had suffered a severe stroke that had led to heavy bleeding on the right side of her brain .
It was the cause of her memory loss .
This bleeding kills brain cells and subsequently causes memory loss .
" She had no idea of who anyone was , including her dad .
She had no idea she had a baby .
She had no idea what a baby was , " explained Francis .
The distressed new dad took it all in and readied himself for the long road ahead .
Dorothy was eventually wheeled out of the hospital for home on December 23 , 2009 .
Dorothy , Francis and the now grown Jasmine .
Road to mend  Back at Kijabe Hospital , the baby was doing well , and three months after birth , Jasmine was released from hospital , cradled in her besotted dad 's arms .
And Francis had to patiently explain to Dorothy who the beautiful little girl was .
" She seemed perplexed by the sight of the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work .
At the time , she had to eat a special diet .
She also needed round the clock specialised care .
"  Albeit the challenges , they managed fine , until she began getting convulsions and seizures months later .
These , they were informed , were due to the stroke she had suffered earlier .
The convulsions eventually tapered down to every two weeks and since 2015 , rarely do they occur .
Also , life has gotten so much better .
" We have come a long way .
From having to task someone to wait outside the door as she showered , she can now write and read .
She can also talk well and do basic things like washing herself and cooking .
We do n't even need round the clock help any more as she can take care of our daughter and cook .
Sometimes she can even do laundry .
She is doing well , " he says beaming .
Dorothy is regaining her independence but remains under medication which is expected to taper off with time .

Now she is on 5 a day .
" He acknowledges that they are n't out of the woods yet , because she suffered one convulsion just a few weeks ago , but he is grateful for how far they have come .
Know one of the most surprising thing to come out of all these ? He asks .
" Dot used to be right-handed .
Now she 's left-handed .
" He laughs .
" Oh , and Dorothy and Jasmine are inseparable now .
It is amazing watching them together .
