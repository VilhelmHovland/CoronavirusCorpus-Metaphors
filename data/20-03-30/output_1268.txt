Alex Kane : The ordinary pleasures of these extraordinary times  The heir to the throne .
The prime minister .
Cabinet members .
A 21-year-old girl with no underlying symptoms .
People in their 30s , 40 , 50s , 60s , 70s and 80s .
A man who was born in 1919 , when the Spanish Fly pandemic was sweeping the world .
The fabulously wealthy .
The poverty stricken .
Brilliant academics .
Covid-19 does n't give a damn .
Not a single damn .
Your background and location is irrelevant .
If it can reach you it will strike you down : sometimes fatally , sometimes devastatingly -- yet stopping short of death , sometimes not much more than a passing blow .
And none of us has any certainty -- even guesswork seems pointless -- about which category we 'll fall into .
Right at the start of the scare there was a view -- no more than a form of urban myth , as it happens -- that older people , 65+ and maybe already regarded as ' vulnerable ' in one way or another , would be hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The i newsletter cut through the noise  Yet we soon discovered that the virus is no respecter of younger people , or those not regarded as vulnerable , either .
As I 've said , it does n't give a damn .
I actually took some comfort from the fact that , a few months short of my 65th birthday , I was probably more vulnerable .
Maybe not a dead cert ( apologies , I like awful puns ) , but certainly with less favourable odds than the others in my household Kerri , Megan Lilah and Indy .
I 'm certainly in no rush to shake the Grim Reaper 's hand anytime soon -- I 'm presuming he would n't go in for elbow-rubbing , even now -- but if Covid-19 comes into our house I dread the prospect of one of the others dying while I survive .
That would be truly unbearable .
Maybe it 's because I 'm in my mid-60s , or an older dad with children , or because the present crisis has made me revisit and reflect upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of the virus , or maybe even a combination of those and other factors ; but I do find myself unexpectedly upset , even weepy right now .
Sleep is difficult .
Relaxing is difficult .
Switching off and tuning out is impossible .
Politics and politicians no longer interest me .
Oddly , I 'm finding a quiet comfort in The Chronicles of Narnia , which I 've never read before .
Brilliantly written and hugely inventive .
I find myself watching the young blackbirds hopping around our decking and feasting on the cat 's food .
They 've got used to me and ignore me as I walk to and fro , often within inches of them .
We still have a couple of robins very happy to sit right beside me as I dig through the soil .
I lay in the hammock on Thursday lunchtime and listened to the noise : not of planes and traffic , but of glorious , wonderfully cheerful birdsong .
We have a grey squirrel who visits our tree-house and vegetable-patch barrels .
Last year I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat .
In one way this is all so matter of fact , yet in so many other ways it is extraordinary .
All of this is , quite literally , happening in my own backyard .
It 's like having a spacious outdoor extension where we can unwind , run around , play swing-ball ( or other games we 've invented ) and bounce on the trampoline .
As I say , very ordinary in one sense ( all those things have been there since we moved into the house about 18 years ago ) yet psychological life-savers right now .
We are always able , in a very specific , very important way , to ' leave the house ' and go outside .
We do n't need to walk to a park , or drive to a beach , or find a hill to climb .
Outside is through the kitchen door .
And it 's there anytime and every time we want it ; either separately or together .
We spend hours in it every day and Indy , 32 months , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the garden for granted again .
I 'll never complain again about mowing , digging , cleaning-up , watering , leaf-clearing , dead-heading , weed-killing , fence-fixing or any of the other dozens of little jobs I always tried to avoid .
At a time like this , we are blessed -- and I mean that in the real sense of the word -- to have the garden .
When this is all over maybe the developers , planners and architects who specialise in urban projects will consider the importance of your own , everyday , outside space , to our collective mental health ?  Like everyone else I also find myself focusing on the what-ifs from my past and present and the ' I wonder whats ' if I survive , or do n't survive .
One firm decision has been made : if I make it through to the other side of this crisis I will get all of my adoption files and background details and read them .
I had wonderful adoptive parents in Sam and Adelaide , who provided me with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed to have the life I have now .
But I exist because of two other people .
I hope I have n't left it too late to find out about them .
Whatever happened and for whatever reason I was placed in an orphanage the fact remains I still have a debt of gratitude to my birth parents .
I would n't be here without them .
I 've also begun a diary about what 's happening right now : the story of an ordinary family and how they coped in extraordinary circumstances .
I do n't know whether I 'll ever get to finish it , but as a writer it would be absurd not to record as much as I can about what is happening at this crucial moment in world history .
And precisely because these are extraordinary times it is important that as many of you as can , also keep a diary , or even just a notebook , about your own experiences , reflections , fears and memories .
What is happening now is happening to all of us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved and told .
Finally , stay strong , stay safe , stay healthy .
Be more patient with each other , particularly the children .
The next few weeks are going to be really , really difficult , I fear .
Best wishes to all of you .
And a huge thanks to all the News Letter team , working in very trying circumstances to ensure the paper is published every day .
