COVID-19 : What Is Antibody Test &amp; How Is It Different From PCR ?  In order to ramp up the coronavirus tests , India is now taking a cue from South Korea which has managed to flatten the curve by taking various unique measures including the one to perform more antibody tests .
Last week , the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) invited tenders for 5-Lakh antibody testing kits for the diagnosis of COVID-19 .
So far , India has only been relying on genetic tests which are time consuming and expensive .
Known as PCR test or polymerase chain reaction tests , these do n't have the ability to detect old cases of coronavirus .
On other hand , antibody tests are quick and can detect a case of past infection .
What Are Antibody Tests ?  Antibody tests or serological tests are conducted by taking the blood sample of a person .
Our immune system produces antibodies to neutralise the viruses in the body .
These antibodies remain present for some time in the body even after the infection generated by the virus is completely gone .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not .
A patient who could n't get tested earlier or self-recovered can be identified with the help of this test .
This can give the government a clear estimation of how much of the population is actually infected or was infected .
How is Antibody test Different From Genetic Tests ?  For the real-time PCR tests , swab samples of a patient are collected whereas , for serological tests , blood samples are taken to identify if the antibodies are present in the blood .
Swab samples are based on RNA which means they help find evidence of the virus ' RNA genome in a patient 's body .
As the patient recovers , RNA ca n't be traced .
Thus , PCR tests ca n't recognise if a person was infected by novel coronavirus earlier , but serological tests can do that .
At the same time , PCR tests are time consuming , complicated and expensive in comparison to serological tests .
However , it is important to note that if the samples are tested early , both of these tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICMR Guideline Say ?  A guideline related to antibody kit released by ICMR on 27 March says , " Positive test indicates exposure to SARS-CoV-2 .
Negative test does not rule out COVID-19 infection .
"  It further says , " not recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection .
" This essentially means that the ICMR still relies on genetic tests for diagnosis , however , to identify infection , serological tests will be hugely beneficial .
