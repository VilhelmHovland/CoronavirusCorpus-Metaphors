The cost of the deferred increase would be funded from savings , he said .
These savings will likely come from fewer claims while elective surgery , dentistry and other procedures are suspended to help hospital staff .
However Mr Fitzgibbon was concerned about a prolonged battle with the virus .
He said NIB saw the possibility of the crisis continuing much longer .
If customers continued to struggle , this may require NIB to postpone more payments , which would use up the money saved from fewer claims .
" At some point , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
He remains open to offering more help for customers if needed .
" If we think some sort of rebate to our members next year or whenever will help improve retention and preserve our ( customer ) base , that may be an option for us , " he said .
