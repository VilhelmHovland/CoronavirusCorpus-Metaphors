Comments  Dwayne Johnson Says Black Adam May Be Delayed Due To Coronavirus  There 's a lot of uncertainty in Hollywood right about now , with many major upcoming releases being pushed back to later in the year .
The same goes for those that were due to start shooting in the next few months as well .
When it comes to DC 's Black Adam , it 's hard to say at this point whether it 'll be able to go ahead or not , as the long-awaited solo film for The Rock 's anti-hero is n't supposed to kick off production until this July .
But will it have to be delayed ?  It turns out that 's something even the star himself does n't know .
Dwayne Johnson took to Instagram for a live video recently , in which he touched based on what looks to be happening with Black Adam .
He explained that he 's " excited " to get started on it , but he 's not sure whether things will be allowed to continue as originally planned .
" I 'm very excited about Black Adam by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that role .
We were supposed to start shooting it in the summer , in July , and we 'll see .
I 'm not quite too sure if it 's still gon na happen -- or , at least , if we 'll still start shooting in July but it will all work out the way it 's meant to work out .
"  MORE FROM THE WEB  Click to zoom  Johnson 's been keeping us updated on his Instagram in regards to just how hard he 's been training to get in shape -- or , in his case , even more in shape -- for the part of Teth-Adam , the ruler of Kahndaq .
It 's got to be a bit of bummer to be facing the possibility that the shoot will be pushed back , then , but he seems to be taking the news in a healthy way .
As most of you will know , Johnson has been attached to the character of Black Adam for the best part of a decade now , so it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , which would likely mean a delay to its scheduled release in December 2021 .
But , like the man says , we 'll just have to see how the global situation plays out .
Fingers crossed , though .
