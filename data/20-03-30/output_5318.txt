The balance between medicine and economics  The evolving policy response to Covid-19 reflects a vexed debate between epidemiologists and economists , moderated by the public-relations experts .
Are we getting the right balance ?  Initially , some economists thought that the doctors were exaggerating the seriousness of the epidemic , by quoting frightening figures of exponential growth .
Were the doctors calling for an excessive degree of containment because they did n't understand the cost of locking down large parts of the economy ? A gentler strategy would protect the economy by sequential staged measures , responding to the actual progress of the epidemic .
A scaling-up approach might allow us to get by with less damage to the economy .
The experience of Italy , however , has put an end to that argument .
No democratic government can maintain a light-touch containment/mitigation strategy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy experienced last week , with deaths rising from 400 , to 600 then 800 over three days .
It 's clear that this high toll was a direct result of an overwhelmed hospital system , with insufficient intensive-care facilities .
The idea of ' flattening the peak ' was already widely accepted , but the triage experience of Italy sharpens the idea .
The peak that needs flattening is not the total number of cases , but the number of cases needing IC facilities .
The elderly , the immunity-compromised and the infirm are the ones most likely to need IC care if they contract the disease -- one credible estimate is that 10% of cases in this vulnerable group will need an ICU .
This cohort must be protected , not just for their own good , but to avoid an all-out comprehensive lockdown , with the enormous economic damage this would cause .
This vulnerable group must be subjected to a rigorous , full-isolating lockdown , much tougher than at present .
Of course the rest of the population will still have to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( when we have enough of them ) .
' Super-spreaders ' should be understood to be events and environments , not individuals .
So no more football , concerts , or religious services with physical meetings .
Comprehensive testing ( when we have enough facilities ) will be needed to identify cases and isolate clusters in the general population .
Experts need to decide whether schools and hairdressers can operate .
What to do with public transport ?  These containment decisions need a greater degree of granularity than current measures .
But the objective here is clearer than at present : the bulk of the economy needs to get back to work ASAP .
Essential retail trade , factories , construction , and education via remote linkages .
All this can return to some kind of normality , with close monitoring for new outbreaks , provided the most vulnerable are protected .
The OECD 's forecast of global GDP produced early this month foresaw growth of 2 .
this year , or a ' worst case ' of 1 .
In just a few weeks , this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decimate ' is the word that springs to mind , in its original meaning of eliminating one in ten .
The first quarter of the crisis will see GDP fall by 10% or so , simply reflecting the closing down of a large part of the service economy -- airlines , restaurants and non-essential retail trade .
Unemployment will top 10% , probably substantially .
A successful flattening strategy would entail keeping GDP down , as the strategy spreads out the peak over time .
Easing off on containment produces a second wave -- already seen in those Asian countries which succeeded in containing the initial onslaught .
So ' low for long ' will not only apply to interest rates , but to GDP as well .
There is no ' V-shaped ' recovery in sight .
If this dramatic scenario is scary enough to get the policy-makers to agree to a more targeted containment strategy , the next task is to sell this unpopular idea to a reluctant public , that only a week ago was basking , cheek-to-cheek , on Bondi beach .
To separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy to sell such an unpalatable message ? A bevy of masked-and-gowned ICU surgeons pleading with us to stay at home clearly is n't enough .
Perhaps we need a ' good cop , bad cop ' approach .
The Prime Minister could go on assuring us that our ANZAC spirit will see us through and we 'll soon be back at the footy with a virus-free pie in our hand .
Who for the bad-cop role ? Who better than Peter Dutton ? Flanked by a couple of black-clad grim-faced members of his border force , he could issue a stern injunction : any elderly person found chatting face-to-face with their grandchildren , or slipping into a convenience store for a loaf of bread , will be disciplined .
Their names will be taken down and later , when they are waiting in the queue for the scarce ventilators at an over-stretched hospital , they will be placed last-in-line .
