Tales from the line : Restaurant owners work to stay afloat in the time of coronavirus  Every morning , Jason and Carolyn Roy open just one of their Biscuit Head locations -- the one closest to the hospital .
They do it to feed the doctors and nurses .
But they mostly do it to keep employees fed .
They 've turned the West Asheville store into a food pantry , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys for their children .
They had to lay off 95 employees .
Jason Roy cries when he talks about it .
But he also cries over the generosity he 's seen : people dropping off food , money for his displaced employees .

15 , 2019 .
The restaurant has seating both inside and outside .
( Photo : Angeli **32;670;TOOLONG )  " People are being so kind , " he said .
" The first day of letting everyone go , I probably cried 50 times that day .
But now -- it 's just awesome how people are coming together .
"  With his other locations closed , sales are down 95% .
But he will persevere , he said .
His landlords are generous , his supplies of biscuits and chicken nearly bottomless .
But he worries for Asheville 's restaurant scene .
" I think Asheville 's going to see a loss of some really great restaurants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already tough , and I think it 's going to suffer big time .
"  The National Restaurant Association reported that , by March 25 , 3% of restaurants nationwide had already permanently closed .
Buy Photo  Restaurants on Biltmore Ave , like Hana , had signs on their doors explaining closure or advertising to-go orders March 18 , 2020 .
( Photo : Angela **33;704;TOOLONG )  Meanwhile , 44% have temporarily closed their restaurants , and 11% anticipate permanently closing within the next month , the restaurant group said .
The association surveyed more than 4,000 restaurant owners , finding sales were down 47% from March 1-22 , with seven in 10 having to lay off employees .
During the first 22 days of March , the restaurant industry lost an estimated $25 billion in sales and more than 3 million jobs , the organization estimates .
A glimmer of hope  But there 's a glimmer of hope in Asheville 's kitchens , even as employees struggle to make ends meet .
Locals are still buying food , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hitting those who remain .
" Last week when it all hit , the stress really crumbled me , " said Eric Scheffer of Vinnie 's Neighborhood Italian , which has kept a skeleton crew to process up to 100 to-go orders daily .
" It really brought me to my knees .
"  Scheffer laid off about 40 employees .
" It took me a couple of days to pull myself out of my depression and anxiety , and I 've gone through some stuff in my life , " he said .
" But we 've been able to keep our heads down and push on through , even though obviously this is like nothing we 've ever seen .
"  About 11-13% of Vinnie 's nightly business was to-go before the virus hit , so the team already had systems in place .
Scheffer has about seven salaried employees making deep dishes of spaghetti with Sunday gravy and lasagna .
Still , the restaurant is barely breaking even .
" But I am able to feed every one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , " he said .
" The people supporting us are making it so we 're able to feed 40-some odd people , and that 's been tremendous .
"  This new world of service in the time of coronavirus also comes with a new perk for customers .
Vinnie 's now sells toilet paper at cost -- $1 -- with a two-roll maximum per customer .
Taco Billy owner Hunter Berry saw the writing on the wall , switching to to-go only days before it was mandated by the state .
He has an app that makes no-contact ordering and paying simple .
Tacos are comforting and lend themselves well to to-go food -- all you need is some foil and a brown bag .
Still , sales are down at least half , he said .
" Sales have dropped dramatically , but I think we 're going to be able to make it , " he said .
A generous city  Berry noted Asheville 's generosity in this time of crisis .
" I 've had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to buy gift cards , which is basically a zero-percent loan , " he said .
" And that really gets at the heartstrings .
"  In October , Berry donated money to the Astronomy Club of Asheville .
This week , a club member stopped by to give Berry some cash .
" He said , ' You donated to us , and I want to give back , ' " Berry said .
" This really is a lovely community , and I feel supported and loved by people .
"  Berry is making enough to keep the lights on , pay his vendors , and employ a handful of people .
He said at times he 's felt conflicted about staying open .
" But I have no backup .
This is it .
If I have zero cash flow , I have zero dollars .
"  He feels fortunate to have something , fortunate to feed the nurses who come by .
" It feels good to provide them some joy in what they 're eating , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a united front , he added .
" People are in a really tough time , when no one knows what is going on , and I 've just seen a lot of kindness , " he said .
" Asheville is already full of kind people , but it 's become more in the spotlight now that things are uncomfortable .
"  ' We 're doing what we can '  Terminating his staff was the hardest thing Roy has ever had to do .
He was following guidance that laying off employees quickly would get them unemployment benefits quickly .
" It was insane how many people were supportive and thankful and understanding , " he said .
He gives them oranges , produce , eggs .
" This week , we had kids ' toys , " he said , his voice cracking .
He and his wife bought employees vitamins , tampons , toilet paper , soap , candy , rice and other essentials .
Mills River has donated dairy .
The West Asheville store is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at a time , per social distancing guidelines .
Then the Roys clean up and accept another wave .
Most all of the money the restaurant makes after paying employees who remain goes to feed the staff who do n't .
The Roys are n't paying themselves right now .
" Our landlords are working with us , and that 's all good for the most part , " Jason Roy said .
" People are being kind .
we have no intention of closing , and we have a fair amount of reserves -- in the form of chicken and biscuits .
"  He ca n't see the future , but he worries it 's grim .
" People are going to go out of business , " he said .
" It 's too hard for some to do another ( supply ) order .
There 's not enough revenue .
"  But right now , what he sees is people standing strong , taking care of their neighbors .
" We 're just here to take care of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's our ultimate goal , and so far we 've been able to do it .
We 'll take any donation or help we can possibly get , and that 's where we stand right now .
