How coronavirus could change our working lives ( and the climate )  financial markets .
The epicentre of the shock is clearly being felt in travel related industries , as people cancel or put holiday plans on hold , and businesses cancel conferences and move to remote working .
Remote working tools widely available  As an investor looking at climate change trends , these changes in working practices are interesting in an environmental context .
Even 10-15 years ago it was clear that the tools to facilitate meetings and conferences virtually were becoming available .
In theory , they should dramatically increase productivity -- just think of all the unproductive time and cost associated with airports , planes , hotels and taxis .
Yet their use has not taken off as much as expected and business travel has been a major growth industry for the aviation and high end hotel business .
The behavioural changes that the coronavirus is forcing on people in such dramatic fashion are likely to lead to a re-evaluation of the necessity of many face-to-face meetings .
Many businesses have moved to remote working , and business meetings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Schroders ' London office , for some time now we 've had an emphasis on video conferencing where viable , instead of business travel .
This underpins our focus on sustainability .
It 's also normal for employees to work remotely , as our chief executive Peter Harrison discussed yesterday in his column : Covid-19 : the technology test for businesses .
New working practices could lead to permanent change  Being forced to work in this way for a period of weeks or months is focusing organisational resources on getting the systems fit for purpose .
It also means that employees , clients and customers will gradually become accustomed to it .
While some will not like it , the chances are that many people will , and managers will recognise the benefits of shifting more permanently in this direction .
For many services businesses , business travel-related emissions are the largest source of their carbon footprint .
But more and more companies are committing to manage down their own footprint in line with the Paris agreement to limit greenhouse gas emissions .
If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jet engines , the only way for businesses to reduce travel-related emissions is to travel less .
The investment consequences are more permanently negative for industries reliant on ever-growing long distance travel .
The International Air Transport Association said on 5 March that the 2020 revenue loss for the sector could be between $63 billion and $113 billion .
That was before the latest round of travel restrictions .
For the latest on coronvirus impact on markets and the economy click here  While it is tempting to think that this will just bounce back once the virus is contained , it is likely that behavioural habits will have already begun adjusting .
However , there will also be investment opportunities .
Remote working software , video conferencing technology , better employee personal technology , etc , will all experience greater demand .
For example , the chart below shows the spike in downloads of the video conferencing app Zoom at the end of February .
Climate targets mean behaviour must change  In a nutshell , until the aviation industry develops a technological solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we simply ca n't fly all over the place all the time and expect to solve the climate problem .
It is quite possible that 2020 will mark the inflection point where the corporate sector realises that it can do more with less travel .
In that respect , getting used to virtual meetings and the immense productivity gains it can bring will be a positive side-effect of the crisis response .
