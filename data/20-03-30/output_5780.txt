It is to be noted that PM Modi had on Tuesday announced a complete lockdown in the country amidst rising cases of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) .
Therefore , Railway services and domestic and international flights services are suspended till April 14 , 2020 .
In a letter to PM Modi , Sonia Gandhi said , " Lakhs of migrant workers are being forced to walk hundreds of miles as there is no public transport available .
Several others are stuck on guest houses or hotels and have run out of money to pay their costs .
This lockdown is beginning to have a detrimental effect on such fellow citizens .
It 's my earnest appeal that a national advisory be issued to assist those who are trapped in transit .
I am taking the liberty to suggest two such measures .
"  Suggesting two measures , Sonia Gandhi said , " One time State transport services be made available to those who are walking to their home towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those who can no longer afford to stay in lodges or guest houses .
"  " The citizens of our country are making tremendous sacrifices for a better tomorrow .
Therefore we must make all efforts to ensure that the purpose of the lockdown is not defeated by making the most vulnerable beat its cost , " the Congress president concluded .
Early today , Sonia Gandhi offered her MPLADs fund for the welfare of the people of Rae Bareli in fighting the coronavirus outbreak .
In a letter to the Rae Bareli district magistrate , Gandhi asked him to use the funds as per the requirement of the constituency .
In the meantime , Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also posted a video on Twitter seeking help from government for the migrant labourers .
The Ministry of Home Affairs ( MHA ) issued an advisory asking all states and Union territories ( UTs ) to prevent a mass exodus of migrant agriculture labourers , industrial workers and unorganised sector employees from their workplaces to hometowns .
The MHA also urged all state governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodities to hotels , working women hostels so that they continue to live in existing facilities .
