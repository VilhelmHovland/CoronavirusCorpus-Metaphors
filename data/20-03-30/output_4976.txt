In a world increasingly being taken over by a totalitarian right wing ideology ( and India is very much there , along with the USA , UK , Turkey , Brazil , Hungary , the Philippines , Poland ) the idea of patriotism has been distorted to serve the authoritarian tendencies of their rulers .
Autocracy does best when it has an enemy , real or imagined , to frighten its citizens with ; this enemy can come in various forms : a neighboring nation , terrorism , drugs , traitors from within , economic collapse , a different religion or ethnic community .
Its alleged purveyors are equally varied - contrary ideologues , intellectuals , artists , journalists , academicians- and they have to be countered with the force of " sovereign violence " and public denunciation in order to " save " the nation from their conspiracies .
But before this can be done it is necessary to acquire legitimacy for the state 's actions .
This is done by aggressively promoting an ersatz and aggressive form of Nationalism in which the autocrat 's ideology IS the national interest and any opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This nationalism is enshrined in a new concept of patriotism , a form of jingoism , where loyalty is sought for the ruling establishment and not for the country .
And to extract this loyalty from its citizens , this redefined patriotism has to be necessarily militarized- equated with hysterical support for the state 's coercive apparatus- the military , para military , police , even state sponsored vigilante mobs .
These forces are brought into play on every occasion- Parliamentary debates , election speeches , television programmes- to divert the attention of the populace from other unresolved problems , and any questioning of their actions is branded as unpatriotic .
In the Indian context we see examples of this everyday , whether it is the " unpatriotic " demand for withdrawal of AFSPA , reported excesses in Kashmir , questioning of the Rafale deal , the brutal conduct of the UP police against the anti-CAA protesters , recent actions and inactions of the police in Delhi , mob lynchings .
By militarising patriotism every coercive action of the state becomes legitimate , the agents of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state becomes secondary .
This is also a calculated effort by the rulers to coopt the armed forces to their cause .
Support for this militarisation becomes the only standard for judging one 's patriotism because the " enemies " of the nation ( as defined earlier ) can only be countered by these armed forces and de-facto militias .
This has worked well for Prime Minister Narendra Modi so far , ensuring that the bread and butter issues are put on the back burner , and garnering massive popular support for him and his party .
But the events around the Covid 19 pandemic may be about to change all this .
An invisible virus has locked down the whole country and generated an unprecedented fear and panic not seen since Partition .
It is an existential dread about a deadly present and a precarious future .
And suddenly , the jingoistic bogies created by the government to stir up nationalism appear inconsequential , hollow and petty in the face of threats to our very ways of life .
A realisation has also set in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its borders or in the jungles of Dantewada , but right here , in the air we breathe and the hand we touch .
It is not the govt 's militarised apparatus which will save the country but a new set of heroes and warriors .
The front lines today are not on our external borders but in every village and town , and those engaging in battle there are not soldiers but people who have been completely neglected so far by this militaristic government- doctors , nurses , para medicals , scientists , researchers , sanitation staff , pharmacists ( they are there in our uniformed forces too , though equally neglected there too ) .
It is these warriors who are the real patriots today , risking their own and their families ' lives in order to keep us safe ; their sacrifice is the patriotism we need to realise and recognise now , and in the future too .
There are others too , those who are fighting the parallel war to prevent our economy from collapsing , to ensure that the supply chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends does not collapse .
Humble entities we take for granted : store clerks , truck drivers , the grocer and the vegetable vendor , the milk man , the delivery boy , the bus conductor , the journalist , the private security guard- they too put their lives at risk every time they venture out .
And let us not forget those backroom , invisible boys and girls who are keeping our telecom and digital systems going at this difficult time , keeping us connected even as the government is compelled to snap these connections .
This eco-system of social media platforms , digital information and services fills the physical void , Sanjay Kapoor , former CEO of Bharti Airtel reminds us in an article , allowing us to remain productive even while avoiding the risk of contagion .
It enables families to stay in touch , access vital information , maintain everyday commerce .
These techies may not be risking their lives , but they ensure that our digital civilisation does not collapse .
It is these people who are the real patriots of today .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taught us , apart from exposing our fragility and stupidity as a race , it is that these hitherto unsung , unacknowledged professionals are the soldiers of the future .
It has , hopefully , taught us that whereas boots on the ground will always be needed , the next millennium belongs to biological , economic and cyber warfare ; while protecting our borders may still be required , the real challenge will be in protecting our ways of life , our natural environment , the health of communities ; while Pakistan may continue to be enemy no .
1 , the real enemy will be our inability to accept that the world will have changed irrevocably after this virus , and that we too need to change our politically expedient definition of patriotism .
One does n't have to wear a uniform , or march to the rhythms of jackboots , or chant Jai Shri Ram to be a patriot .
Of course , our armed forces will always occupy pride of place , but they now have to share this space with others on the new front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough to clap or bang pots and pans for two minutes to express our theoretical gratefulness to the many who are preventing our health and economy from collapsing .
What is needed is to discard this deviant concept of a militarised patriotism , recognise the new warriors and realign national resources so that the real patriots are better equipped to defend our ancient civilisation and modern economy .
As Mark Lawrence Schrad , the American author and Professor of Sociology hopes , in an insightful article in the POLITICO magazine : " Perhaps , too , we will finally start to understand that patriotism is cultivating the health and life of your community , rather than blowing up someone else 's community .
