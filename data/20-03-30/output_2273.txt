Rural doctors and mayors ask city-dwellers to stay home and not tax system  Rural health-care providers and small-town politicians are pleading with snowbirds and city-dwellers to stay at their primary homes during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than self-isolating in more remote locales and putting additional strain on a system that 's already stretched to the limit .
Doctors practising far away from large urban centres say they 're already grappling with serious shortages of testing kits , protective equipment and other tools necessary to battle the outbreak that 's sickened thousands across the country and brought everyday life to a virtual standstill .
An influx of new arrivals into their small communities , they argue , risks taxing those limited resources even further while greatly increasing the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus among an especially vulnerable population .

Harpur said many cottage-country communities , including his , have learned to ramp up staffing levels and services from hospitals to grocery stores during the summer months when affluent urban residents flock en masse to their secondary homes .
But those resources simply are n't in place at this time of year , he said , leaving communities poorly equipped to accommodate the early arrival of seasonal residents at the best of times .
Add a global pandemic into the mix , he said , and the situation becomes dangerous for all .
Harpur said clinics in rural communities are poorly equipped to address the COVID-19 situation , adding health-care workers are scrounging masks and face shields from local businesses to try and address a pressing shortfall of protective equipment .
Testing kits , he added , are " virtually non-existent " in his practice and beyond .

" We have limited Health resources , especially ICU beds and ventilators , " he said in a public Facebook post .
" Not only do we want you to stay home , but we also want you to stay in your hometown .
"  Harpur said the new arrivals pose a multi-faceted threat , since their recent sojourns in big cities and foreign countries make them more likely carriers of the coronavirus .
They also run a higher risk of infecting members of one of the most vulnerable demographics , he said , noting the year-round residents of towns like his often include a higher proportion of seniors .
Some local political leaders have also started appealing to city-dwellers and asking them to stay put as the pandemic runs its course .

They 're asking me , ' please , ask people not to come up to cottage country until we get through this .
