More than two dozen ShopRites throughout New Jersey are limiting the number of customers allowed inside at one time to help slow the spread of coronavirus .
At least 27 stores posted announcements on their Facebook pages about the new policy , which would restrict the number of customers to " roughly 30% of the store 's regular maximum occupancy .
" A security guard stationed at the store 's entrance will track customers entering and leaving .
" Please be patient and kind to one another as you may be asked to queue in a single line outside the store .
