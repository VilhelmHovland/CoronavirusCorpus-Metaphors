These four cars offer true self-isolation  Related Links  As governments around the world implore citizens to avoid unnecessary contact with others in order to curb the spread of the coronavirus , we know petrolheads long to be out on the open road .
But with social distancing being widely practiced by many people , the best thing to do if you 're really aching to go for a drive is do it solo - but even that will be limited with President Cyril Ramaphosa 's lockdown announcement on Monday eve ( March 23 ) .
So with that in mind , we racked our brains to find cars that are centred around the driver or are only designed for the driver .
The list is eclectic , from a rare supercar to a 1950s BMW , we 've found four cars that offer true isolation , except when you get to a petrol station .
Just make sure you do n't get out of the car , and remember to sanitise major touchpoints .
Renault Twizy  First up , the Renault Twizy .
It 's an electric quadricycle that 's offered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's space for a passenger behind the driver .
The Twizy has a top speed of either 45km/h or 80km/h depending on which model you choose , it was the top-selling plug-in electric vehicle in Europe in 2012 .
We ca n't think of a better vehicle for one to scoot to the grocery store or pharmacy in .

The McLaren F1 is unique because the driver 's seat is centrally positioned because designer Gordon Murray wanted the driver to feel special , like driving a Formula 1 car .
The F1 has a top speed of 389km/h and has an engine bay is lined with gold to reflect heat .

The Nomad is powered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 175kW .
This road-legal buggy is able to go anywhere at speed and is " a masterpiece of craftsmanship " .
The driver sits in a safety cage and the Nomad has an outboard , long travel suspension , double unequal wishbones , high rotation metallastic bushes and an aluminium quick steering rack to make sure your Scandinavian flick is precise every single time .

Tiny at only 2 .
in length and a crazy 1 .
wide , the Isetta was a sight to behold .
Just over 160 000 Isettas were built and it 's a special car because it was like no other car that had come before it .
The entire front end of the car hinged outwards to allow entry and the seat could squeeze two people onto it , with a parcel shelf behind it .
