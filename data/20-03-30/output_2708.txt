" This is wide open to potential abuse , " says landlord group , as tenant advocate publicly wonders if it makes sense to pay rent  A B .
emergency-response rental package that could balloon above $1 billion over the next 90 days will leave landlords exposed to huge losses , according to agents and LandlordBC .
Tenant advocates are openly wondering if it even makes sense to pay rent .
In a response to the COVID-19 crisis , the March 25 announcement by the provincial government will end virtually all rental evictions -- including those currently in process -- freeze rental increases , and pay $500 direct to landlords to help tenants battling job and income losses over the next three months .
" This is not the time to seek rent increases and there is just zero per cent chance of that happening , " said Premier John Horgan .
" Landlords will be prevented from legally raising rents starting April 1 .
Increases slated to take effect on April 1 will no longer be applied .
"  Despite the good intentions , many say the unprecedented program is wide open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose models concede that 100 per cent of B .
's 500,000 renters could theoretically qualify for assistance .
The new rental supplement is in addition to federal and provincial programs announced to offer financial aid to those who lose income due to the health crisis .
Mark Goodman , a multi-family real estate specialist with Goodman Commercial Inc .
Vancouver , estimates B .
's rental aid package could add up to more than $1 billion over the next three months , but argued it is landlords who could end up paying the most .
The $500 paid directly to the landlord will not compensate for losses from the rental increase freeze , Goodman said .
This is particularly evident in Metro Vancouver , he said , where the average rent is now $2,351 , according to Rentals .
While the $500 payment direct to landlords is welcome , David Hutniak , CEO of LandlordBC , said that , with no potential for evictions , landlords have little protection if a tenant refuses to pay the balance owing .
" This is wide open to potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common decency would keep abuses in check .
" Two-thirds of landlords in Metro Vancouver are mom-and-pop situations , " Hutniak said , which includes people renting out a basement suite or a condominium to help cover the highest mortgages cost in the country .
These owners are also struggling during the current crisis , Hutniak said .
According to a December 2019 survey by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp .
, there are 67,000 rental condos in Metro Vancouver .
Hutniak also noted a naivety in the potential of landlords qualifying for a mortgage payment deferral .
Premier Horgan encouraged banks to provide this , but Hutniak doubts most landlords would qualify or could afford such a deferral .
" We have heard advocates speak about landlords getting mortgage deferrals so they can ' pass those savings onto renters .
' But a mortgage deferral by a bank does not constitute any savings to the landlord .
It has to be paid back with compound interest on the deferred amount .
In other words , interest upon interest , " Hutniak explained .
Any deferred amount is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any security for deferred rent from a tenant , he noted , or from the loss of legal rent increases .
Angela Calla , mortgage broker with Dominion Lending Centres , said landlords are unlikely to get approved for a deferral from some mortgage lenders , even if their tenants ca n't pay rent due to lost income .
" Deferrals are not being approved on rentals at this time , " she said on March 25 .
" If/when they are , it will come with additional costs for the landlord , once determined .
" However , she updated this information March 26 with the news that Scotiabank is now allowing deferrals regardless of occupancy , and other banks may follow suit .
" It is the government 's expectation that all renters , including those renters impacted by the COVID-19 crisis , who have the capacity to pay rent do the responsible thing and pay their rent , " Hutniak added .
But the Vancouver Tenants Union noted that Premier Horgan conceded he could not guarantee that any rental aid will actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due .
" Every person should think towards the future , see where they are going to be in a few months and decide if it makes sense to pay rent , " said Mazdak Gharibnavaz , a steering committee member of the Vancouver Tenants Union , in a March 25 interview on CiTR 101 .
FM 's station at the University of British Columbia .
