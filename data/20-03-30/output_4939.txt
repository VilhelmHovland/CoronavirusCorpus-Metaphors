Features  Pilgrims of peace  Share  Pilgrims of peace  Monday , 30 March 2020 AP/One Good Thing  Virtual volunteers around the globe offer help to strangers amid virus stress  Sitting cross-legged in her living room , Donna Borak rested her palm on her heart as she guided a small group of virtual participants in meditation and deep breathing .
Notice where you might be holding tension , she instructed .
" Send your attention to your head .
maybe acknowledging it 's fine if you 've been worried and scared , " she told them and added , " Maybe finding comfort that we are all in this together .
"  From her Washington DC home , Borak has been hosting a free virtual meditation class daily for anyone who wants " a respite during such a moment of uncertainty .
" Attendees are encouraged to bring children , loved ones or pets .
" Even your plants .
"  " Inhale , maybe even a little bit more deeply this time , slowly letting the air out of your mouth , " she added .
As social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Coronavirus , ordinary people around the globe have turned to technology to overcome physical barriers .
In ways big and small , they are forging new connections and comforting others inundated by bad news about the virus or burdened by unpaid bills .
Borak wanted to carve out a space for togetherness -- for a stressed-out parent , a manager or a laid-off employee to take a break .
So far , attendees joining her class on Zoom video conferencing have mainly been friends and family , and she 's been sharing sessions on Instagram .
" While a meditation class for 15 minutes does n't solve financial stress or help to explain what will happen next or address serious health care concerns , to me , it 's an opportunity to not be alone and to not exist in isolation , " she said by phone .
" I did n't want anyone to feel alone .
"  A journalist and who had been attending yoga teacher training , Borak draws lessons from such testing times .
" Going forward , for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending an event or a happy hour or a dinner , we 'll hopefully feel differently about it when we come back together again , " she said .
" We need each other .
"  In Austin , Texas , Catherine Woodiwiss also took to online media to provide relief of a different kind .
She knew that the cancellation of South by Southwest -- a film , music and technology festival that attracts hundreds of thousands to Austin -- could hit artists and small business owners hard .
Her first instinct to help by buying local was n't going to work amid the social distancing and various shutdowns .
So she encouraged those who lost income to reach out online .
" I ca n't give a ton , but I can give something , and will as much and for as long as I can , " she wrote on Twitter .
She said takers included an 18-year-old pregnant woman who works as a cashier and said her store would be closed for a month and a musician whose shows would have covered rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money directly after doing a " light vetting " of recipients by looking at their accounts .
" I 'm comfortable erring on the side of being of help , " she said .
" In a moment of need , I am comfortable giving to who asked for it .
"  There are " times that I have been very much in need of financial support from other people , " Woodiwiss said .
" I am very lucky to be at a moment .
where that 's not true .
"  She 's been setting aside money for a while to help with different causes .
Now Coronavirus is her cause -- and she 's part of a bigger effort .
On her social media feeds , she 's seen people come together in new ways , holding " singing circles " or sharing self-quarantine recipes .
Borak and Woodiwiss are among an army of virtual volunteers worldwide donating time and money .
Some have used the internet to set up food delivery services to the elderly .
One mother issued an international call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People are trying to figure out how to belong with each other .
when we are physically separate , " Woodiwiss said .
" In this moment of real , relatively unanticipated crisis , it 's been really great to see people show up .
"  While unending global news about the effects of the pandemic of Coronavirus have become commonplace , so , too , are the stories about the kindness of strangers and individuals who have sacrificed for others .
