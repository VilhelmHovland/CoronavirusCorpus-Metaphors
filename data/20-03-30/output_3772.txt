Helium : Covid-19 cuts shortage as demand drops  Covid-19 has been dominating the news for the last few weeks and it is safe to say that most businesses have been impacted in some way .
While there have certainly been businesses who have benefited from the pandemic , far more of them -- and the economy as a whole -- have been hurt .
Global helium markets have been impacted by Covid-19 in several ways .
The most obvious and significant impact has been reduced demand .
Initially , demand from China , the world 's second-largest helium market , was reduced significantly when the Chinese economy was put on lockdown .
While China has begun to recover , Covid-19 has now spread to all of the world 's developed economies and the overall impact on helium demand has gotten considerably larger .
Certain applications , such as party balloons and diving gas , will be particularly hard hit .
Demand for party balloons , which represents as much as 15% of the US helium market and up to 10% of global demand , has dropped precipitously due to the implementation of mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helium segment that will likely experience sharp declines ( after a bit of a time lag ) is the offshore market , where a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia has resulted in the lowest oil prices in 18 years .
This will prove the catalyst for a sharp reduction in diving and oil service activity .
If we consider that most other applications impacted less directly by Covid-19 will experience reduced demand due to a global recession , my expectation is that worldwide helium demand has temporarily dropped by at least 10-15% due to this pandemic .
Disruption  While Covid-19 may have reduced the demand for helium , it has also created significant disruption for the helium supply chain .
As the Chinese economy went into lockdown , manufacturing and export activity were sharply reduced , many outbound sailings ( from China ) were cancelled , and ports were bottlenecked due to a shortage of manpower .
This made it unusually difficult for the major helium suppliers to get empty containers out of China and back to sources in Qatar and the US for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on container shipping made it difficult to maintain continuity of supply as suppliers were forced to scramble to secure empty containers for refilling .
As roughly 95% of the world 's helium is produced as a by-product of natural gas processing or LNG production , reduced demand for LNG would also result in lower production of helium to the extent that natural gas throughput at the plants where helium is produced is reduced .
Helium shortage 3 .
: Cut short by coronavirus  While there may be some negative impact on helium production due to Covid-19 , so far the impact on helium demand has been much greater .
What does all of this mean to helium market participants ? Of course , we are in uncharted waters with respect to this coronavirus .
We do n't know how long the pandemic will last , how deep a recession could be , how long social distancing will be practiced , or the choices that our governments will make between personal safety and restarting our economies .
" If that is close to being correct , helium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and demand in Q2 2020 -- and Helium Shortage 3 .
will wind down two quarters sooner than it would have .
"  The basis for my outlook is an assumption is that the world will experience a sharp recession that will last at least through Q2 ( second quarter ) and Q3 2020 , before we start to rebound during Q4 .
My expectation is that helium demand will drop by at least 10-15% during Q2/Q3 before beginning to rebound in Q4 .
If that is close to being correct , helium markets would transition from shortage to a tight balance between supply and demand in Q2 2020 -- and Helium Shortage 3 .
will wind down approximately two quarters sooner than it would have without the occurrence of Covid-19 .
In fact , the US Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) lifted its allocation of crude helium from the BLM System on 26thMarch , for the first time since June 2017 , providing a clear indication of reduced demand .
By the time this helium demand does begin to rebound , hopefully by Q4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Algeria source and/or the third plant in Qatar is expected to have entered the market .
This would facilitate a continued balance between supply and demand , instead of a return to shortage , even if helium demand rebounds sharply during Q4 .
Meanwhile , I continue to expect the start of production from Gazprom 's Amur Project in Eastern Siberia to restore a healthier balance between supply and demand by the middle of 2021 .
In summary , Kornbluth Helium Consulting believes that Covid-19 will cause Helium Shortage 3 .
to ease approximately two quarters earlier than it would have had we not experienced a global pandemic .
I would characterise this as an ' optimistic ' or ' realistic ' forecast , with greater risk to the downside ( lower demand ) if the pandemic lasts longer or causes a deeper worldwide recession .

With the launch of gasworld 's Helium Super Summit this October , the scene is set in more ways than one , writes Rob Cockerill .
Not only is the scene set in terms of the new normal helium business for post-2021 , we now have the stage confirmed for insight , discussion and debate around .
