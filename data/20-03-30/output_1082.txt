THE coronavirus outbreak threatens the UK 's economic prospects after Brexit because the pandemic could cause a deep recession among the European Union , says a professor of economics .
The UK entered a transition period on January 31 and opened negotiations with the EU to discuss its future relationship with the bloc .
But the talks had to be suspended as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the guidelines issued to stop the spread of the illness .
The EU 's chief negotiator Michel Barnier would later test positive for COVID-19 .
Trending  The coronavirus outbreak has forced countries to take hitherto unprecedented action by introducing quarantines and lockdowns , as well as travel bans and other restrictions on movement .
Professor Miltos Makris from the University of Kent 's School of Economics said these measures could potentially lead to a significant recession which will have an impact on the UK 's future post-Brexit .
He said : " The almost simultaneous lockdown of several countries will have a major negative impact on economic activity around the globe as the severe measures hit supply chains and consumer demand .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China with each other , and importantly with the rest of the world , this turmoil will have severe knock-on effects to parts of the world where lockdowns have not yet been put in place , such as South American countries .
" As a result , the world economy is likely to enter a deep recession this year .

According to Professor Makris , this coupled with the coronavirus ' impact on EU countries ' respective economies could deepen the recession .
He said : " The expected slowdown of European economies due to the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence by the sudden increase in the Italian spread .

" To make things worse , the EU 's relief coffers will be under profound pressure now that even the more robust economies , such as Germany and France , are facing a significant drop in domestic economic activity and are in need themselves of funding boosts to their own economies .

" A big part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative repercussions of Brexit was relying on sustaining UK-EU trade and expanding trade to the rest of the world .
" However , the expected slump in trade as well in domestic economies due to implications of COVID-19 , make this plan fragile and a prolonged and deep recession likely .
"  Brexit threat : People refraining from drinking in pubs has far more serious implications for economies like the UK 's as it relies on face-to-face service industries ( Image : Getty )  The UK has taken steps to attempt to prevent a recession in the form of an emergency interest rate cut by the Bank of England .
On March 12 , the Bank of England cut the interest rate down to 0 .
percent from 0 .
percent .
But Professor Makris says " more drastic measures " will be needed to dampen any long-term negative economic impacts , particularly in light of a reduction of disposable income among the British population .
He said : " The COVID-19 turmoil is expected to have severe consequences for the more advanced economies as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " People refraining from travelling , eating in restaurants , drinking in bars , going to the gym or sporting and music events , has far more serious implications for economies such as the US and the UK .
" The reduction in disposable income and demand for goods and services by a large segment of the labour force will have knock-on effects to other sectors , such as the food industry and retail sector .
" Therefore , an economy-wide downturn is expected for the mature economies like Britain .
" Preventing a painful recession is the crucial reason behind the emergency rate cut by the US Federal Reserve and the recent drastic cuts by the Bank of England as well as the multi-billion relief packages announced in the UK and elsewhere .
" Nevertheless , more drastic measures will be needed to prevent a long-lasting economic slump such as tax cuts and freezing of mortgage payments .
