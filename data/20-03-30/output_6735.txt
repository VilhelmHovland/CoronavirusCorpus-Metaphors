How FCB is working remotely to get ads out for clients during the pandemic  Last week , Kimberly-Clark 's Cottonelle brand released a simple ad urging Americans to stop hoarding toilet paper during the coronavirus pandemic and instead #ShareASquare with friends and neighbors in need .
Cottonelle partnered with United Way on the effort , donating $1 million and 1 million rolls of toilet paper to the organization 's COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund .
Plus , Cottenelle pledged to donate $1 for each example of toilet paper sharing that is posted on social media using the hashtag #ShareASquare , through June 1 , up to $100,000 .
It was a simple call to action to dissuade Americans from hoarding toilet paper or buying up a year 's worth of rolls to resell at a higher price .
It was also a fairly straightforward spot to put together for the creative agency behind it , Interpublic Group of Cos .
' FCB , which relied on a remote team of creatives , strategists , editors , designers , producers and others to get the ad out in a matter of just a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment from the client , it was four days , " says Kerry Hill , who has run FCB Chicago 's production for the past 10 years and was recently promoted to North America director of integrated production .
In her new role , Hill oversees production groups in Toronto , New York , Chicago and San Francisco , representing a team of more than 150 people who produce 1,000 pieces of content a week .
Hill says the Cottonelle spot " did n't require a ton of content " ( it even relied on some pre-existing content ) and her creatives worked with designers , editors and producers via Zoom and Slack through the weekend to get it done .
" People are working many hours in a day to get these things done , " Hill says .
" Everyone is remote .
We 're all active users and experts on Zoom .
The creatives have been really great about sharing screens with editors and designers .
Clients have been very , very good with feedback , in terms of responsiveness .
People are just so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we started working through this idea with FCB , we understood the urgency , " adds Stephanie Pines , global creative , content and design director for Family Care at Kimberly-Clark .
" This is a very real challenge we are all facing together .
So it needed to deliver the right message at the right time , and could be produced quickly .
We went from idea approval to having a fully produced video literally over a weekend , which we feel is a testament to the incredible partnership we have with FCB .
"  Hill notes that the transition to the new working reality has been made a little smoother because FCB was preparing for it , at least in some way , before it became a necessity .
For the past few years , the agency had introduced several key technological changes to how it delivers creative for clients , with the goal of making the process faster and more cost efficient .
Its efforts included transforming its production capability from being siloed by office into one , streamlined enterprise across the network .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief technology officer , to launch a proprietary content management system called MAIKER that leverages AI to capture , store and share assets across multiple channels and formats .
The same AI-powered tech is used by FCB to assist in editing processes to get work out in the market faster .
The FCB team leaned on MAIKER in its development of the Cottonelle campaign .
" We have for the past couple of years been focusing on making more content for less , " Hill says .
" One thing we 're thinking about now is repurposing the content we already have .
If we have content , how do we plan for different executions across different channels ? That 's something we 've been planning for , not just for the situation we 're in but to better deliver high-quality content for our clients .
It 's been very helpful for us in the past few weeks .
"  FCB also leaned on an existing disaster-recovery plan when the social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates began taking effect , designed to set creatives up in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " according to Hill , who notes that the agency already assessed what monitors , equipment and tools each employee needs to do their jobs remotely before it became a necessity .
Still , as FCB and likely countless other shops are learning right now , some things just ca n't be planned for or anticipated .
Like when a brief for an unnamed client called for pictures of people conducting " neighborly " acts while social distancing -- something FCB 's photographer assigned to the project thought would be simple , before being posed with the problem of getting talent release forms signed by the subjects without coming into contact with them .
Hill says the photographer 's solution was to shout to the people and record them on video giving their permission , as well as yelling their email addresses so the agency could then follow up with a form in writing .
" I was like , ' done , that 's happening , ' " Hill says , noting how " remarkable " it 's been for her to see how the team has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone is in this together .
I would say , though , that everybody definitely misses the in-person interaction .
