of Nigeria 's cattle utilised for dairy production '  In spite of the fact that , Nigeria is host to about20 million cattles , its spends a whopping $1 .
billion in the importation of milk annually , analysts at Financial Derivatives Company ( FDC ) Limited have lamented .
Nigeria is a major producer of livestock ( cattle and goats ) in Sub-Saharan Africa but is the largest importer of milk in the region , with an annual importation bill of $1 .
billion .
" The country 's cattle population is estimated at 20 million .
However , only 2 .
million cattle ( 11 .
per cent ) are utilized for dairy production " , said FDC .
Enhancing cross-breeding capacity , improving access to pasture and water and setting up of milk collection centers are some strategies that could be adopted to increase milk production .
This would help the country achieve self-sufficiency in milk production and support the on-going economic diversification agenda .
The reason for the low production of milk is that cows in Nigeria produce just about 1 .
to 2 litres of milk per day compared to cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cows in Israel which produce between 45 and 60 litres of milk per day .
In Israel , there are over 520,000 sheep and goats , and the standards for ruminant dairy farming are just as high as the standards for cows .
Israel 's goats produce over 11 million litres of milk every year .
Similarly , in August 2018 , the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization introduced a new high yielding goat breed ( Galla Buck ) that can produce up to eight litres of milk a day , four times more than what other goats yield and is good for meat production .
For Nigeria , unfortunately , virtually nothing in terms of milk comes from Nigerian goats and sheep while many countries are exporting cheese .
