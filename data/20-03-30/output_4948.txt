After US President Trump and WhatsApp forwards endorsed the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) to fight COVID-19 , authorities and chemist associations have cautioned people against buying it -- and other antiviral drugs .
On March 24 , the Delhi drugs control department sent out an advisory to chemists after observing that " some consumers were buying the medicines for prophylactic use " .
The National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority of India too put out a tweet warning against self-medication .
" Only by prescription , it will be sold , " Rajiv Singhal , general secretary of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists ( AIOCD ) , told Outlook .
Singhal says his association , which covers about 8 .
lakh chemists , has sent out strict instructions not to give out azithromycin , HCQ , chloroquine , lopanavir and ritonavir unless prescribed by a registered medical practitioner .
" HCQ normally is n't a medicine in high demand , but early this week there was a sudden spurt in queries , " he adds .
" Rumours are creating the issue .
Our doctors are doing a wonderful job and people should n't panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Medical Research ( ICMR ) had put out a note regarding the recommendation by the National Taskforce for COVID-19 on the use of HCQ as a prophylactic agent .
But this was intended for use only in exceptional circumstances that called for the protection of high-risk individuals .
" It is recommended only , and I mean only , for a healthcare worker who is treating a COVID-19 patient , " ICMR chief Balram Bhargava emphasised at a recent briefing .
The only other circumstance the recommendation applies to -- as a preventive measure -- is that of a person caring for a laboratory-confirmed positive case .
Meanwhile , in the US , Trump 's controversial description of HCQ as a potential " game changer " has drawn criticism .
An Arizona man died and his wife became critically ill , apparently after ingesting chloroquine phosphate , which they had been using to clean their fish tanks .
Across the world , researchers are testing several antiviral drugs for their efficacy in treating COVID-19 .
So far , no therapeutic drugs have proven to be effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing treatment studies in China using chloroquine , according to a WHO research blueprint in mid-March .
Chloroquine is being evaluated because it was reasonably active in vitro ( laboratory experiments ) against SARS-CoV , MERS CoV and SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID 19 .
But how that translates in vivo is n't clear , it said .
Chloroquine has shown in vitro activity against viruses causing chikungunya , dengue and influenzas , but in-vivo studies in animal models and randomised controlled trials in humans have been largely disappointing , it noted .
The novel coronavirus belongs to the family of SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) viruses , but behaves differently .
" The SARS virus receptors are in the lungs , none in the upper respiratory tract .
Therefore it did not spread efficiently , " writes T .
Jacob John , retired professor of clinical virology , in Current Science .
In this case , the virus receptors are in the upper respiratory tract and lungs .
" So , infection spreads easily and is more virulent than flu , " he adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritonavir , are being tested based on the learning from the experiments with SARS and MERS -- in Saudi Arabia , for instance , there is an ongoing trial using these drugs against MERS .
So far , only the results of an early Chinese trial on hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19 at the Jin Yin-tan Hospital in Wuhan are available , and the results are n't promising -- no benefit was observed with the lopinavir -- ritonavir treatment beyond standard care , say the researchers , pointing to the need for more trials to confirm or exclude the possibility of a benefit .
In India , the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has approved the restricted public health use of lopinavir-ritonavir combination among symptomatic COVID-19 patients .
The approval , explains a senior scientist , was based on the need to have some drug to be able to use on compassionate grounds , which is allowed in public health emergencies .
" There are a lot of global trials going on right now .
In India , we have n't yet started any trials , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
