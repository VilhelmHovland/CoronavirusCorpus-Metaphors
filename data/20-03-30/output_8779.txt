A Paws for Health : Pets and The Coronavirus  With the ongoing coronavirus crisis , it 's only logical we would question if our dogs and cats or other animals can contract the virus .
During a ' Paws for Health , ' Dr .
Jen Klabunde with Northwood Animal Hospital in Grand Traverse County explains the likelihood of this happening .
Plus , Dr .
Klabunde also talks about how now more than ever , with our pets quarantined with us , they 're picking up on our emotions and could be acting differently .
She says to be patient with them and notice these changes .
They 're experiencing our feelings we 're giving off and that , in turn , could directly affect how they respond to us .
Northwood Animal Hospital does have limited hours during the coronavirus crisis and is also only allowing a limited number of patients at a time .
