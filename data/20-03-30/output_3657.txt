Opinionista* Anton Cartwright * 30 March 2020  Crises expose us and remind us of what we value  Cyril Ramaphosa is South Africa 's president and a former businessman .
Unlike some other leaders , he is also a humanitarian with a sound mind and has placed the immediate task of preventing deaths ahead of the task of saving businesses in order to fight the coronavirus .
Crises come in different shapes and sizes , making comparisons unwise , but the Covid-19 crisis is already , before it has shown its full hand or economic impact , the most serious global crisis since the Second World War .
One thing common to all crises is their ability to expose .
Those politicians who have relied on spin , bluster and intimidation , rather than principles and facts , are self-identifying in the face of Covid-19 .
Crises test us all , and bring deeply held assumptions , biases and prejudices into the cold light of public scrutiny .
( I like to think of myself as a family man , but my kids might tell you otherwise after a few days of lockdown .
) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practised as a matter of pragmatic necessity in hospitals everywhere .
That long healthy lives matter more than short sick lives has no moral or ethical underpinning .
It is also mathematically intractable , as Kenneth Arrow 's Impossibility Theorem revealed when trying to solve for the " greatest good for the greatest number " back in 1951 .
Until now most of us were not the people being shuffled off on account of our age or co-morbidity , and it did not seem worth the effort to scrutinise whether life-saving resources to hospitals should be constrained in the first place .
The Covid-19 crisis is also exposing economic policy .
In South Africa , this is important as the economic policy has been mostly implicit and obscured since the advent of democracy , due to the need to accommodate very different ideologies within the tripartite alliance .
The political fudge is not unique to South Africa and has been enabled by the blurring of Cold War ideologies .
That confronting our economic assumptions has , until now , been considered inconvenient and untimely has seen the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deaths caused by toxic emissions for the sake of jobs and the country 's balance of payments , unsubsidised taxis and associated deaths while investing taxpayers ' billions in keeping our airlines safe , booming property prices while a growing number of people live without formal shelter or tenure .
And on the other side of the ideological spectrum , cases of fiscal plunder in the interest of patronage guised as creating a new black elite .
Both the left and the right have used the economic policy lacuna to state their claim and influence , and may even have become subconsciously vested in it .
It is the biases and blind spots that we subconsciously hold that can be simultaneously most difficult to change and most damaging .
Now , without the fiscal buffers , we had prior to the Zuma administration , Cyril Ramaphosa has had to take some excruciating decisions , all of them plagued by innate uncertainty about the virus ' impact on the future and exposing horrible trade-offs of relative harm .
In the process , he has had to lift the veil on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramaphosa is a humanitarian with a sound mind .
Unlike the self-revealing early policies of the United States and the United Kingdom , Ramaphosa has placed the immediate task of preventing deaths ahead of the task of saving businesses .
As a businessman , this must-have hurt .
He knows that business collapse and economic stagnation will in time cost lives too , but he has made the tough call .
This is much more complex and profound than placing people above profit .
It is an approach that values human life , and rightly understands the economy not as something to protect capital , but which exists , in the first instance , to protect and enhance the welfare of people in as direct a manner as is possible , rather than through any " trickle-down " .
In the ethics experiment taught to first-year students , a person observing a runaway train about to kill two people has the choice of pulling a lever and diverting the train so that it kills just one person .
Most leaders do n't pull the lever .
They would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in killing a single person .
To the extent that this applies to our current crisis , Ramaphosa has pulled the lever and we should all be grateful .
He has prioritised the immediate protection of life , not only backing businesses to find ways to limit the second-round impacts on life and well-being , but also getting them to redirect their resources to saving lives in the first round of viral harm .
This ethical decision is the closest South Africa has come to having a coherent economic policy since 1994 , and it is a good one .
Significantly , Moody 's chose to see it differently .
In the process , they exposed their own assumptions , as well as their inability to engage real-time data .
At a time when the capitalist realism is withering with every new policy announcement -- banks providing interest payments in an attempt to self-preserve , the Conservative government in Britain providing wage support , the Republican White House evoking the Defence Production Act to force General Motors to manufacture ventilators in a move that would have made Marx proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financialisation that will cost lives and deepen the crisis .
We know their lines -- " do n't shoot the messenger " , " this predates Covid " , " we only focus on the macroeconomic fundamentals " -- but they seem to be missing just how irrelevant , and unhelpful , their world is at this time .
Usury is an old-fashioned word that for most of civilisation has had pejorative connotations .
Somehow , concealed from public scrutiny , and almost certainly because it quietly suited the elite , we are now learning that so much of what we called " the economy " was really about sustaining the ability to pay interest on capital .
It is too early to assume that this changes everything ' 1912 , 1948 and 1994 should teach South Africans that some things stay the same even when everything else changes ; wealthy South Africans have a history of massaging the economic rules of the game in their favour .
It is for that reason that we should notice what is being revealed that was previously hidden .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between rich and poor , incubating another great ill in the process .
However , we now also have the opportunity to continue , with the same urgency , to build upon the economic foundation that we have been forced to create in order to save lives .
I ca n't think of a more solid foundation .
Now that any economic policy is thinkable , what thinking will we do ? We have shown that it is possible to marshal the available resources , with the same wartime conviction , to the things that , when stripped bare by circumstances , we all value : saving lives , building connections , preventing ecological collapse and in the process reimagining ourselves in a new economy .
