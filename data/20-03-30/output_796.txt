" Right now , all people are hearing about are the deaths , " Republican Senator Ron Johnson told the New York Times last week .
" I 'm sure the deaths are horrific , but the flip side of this is the vast majority of people who get coronavirus do survive .
" The problem with this line of reasoning is that " the vast majority " is not a useful standard when measuring a pandemic that is projected to infect at least half the population .
In a follow-up interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Johnson attempted to clarify his thinking , and managed to express it in an even more callous and stupid way :  " I 'm not denying what a nasty disease COVID-19 can be , and how it 's obviously devastating to somewhere between 1 and 3 .
percent of the population , " he said .
" But that means 97 to 99 percent will get through this and develop immunities and will be able to move beyond this .
But we do n't shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move about .
We do n't shut down our economies because tens of thousands of people die from the common flu .
getting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3 .
percent of our population ( and ) I think probably far less .
"  Johnson is comparing the virus to auto fatalities .
Around 37,000 people die every year in car crashes , which is certainly a lot .
But losing 1 to 3 .
percent of people who get the coronavirus would mean millions of deaths .
So no , we do n't shut down the economy to prevent 37,000 deaths , but we might shut down the economy to prevent 100 times that many deaths .
Johnson seems to fashion himself a cool-headed sophisticate who is using statistics to rationally assess risk .
What he does n't seem to grasp is that when you 're talking about the majority of the population of the United States , even a 1 percent chance of premature death is not a small number .
It 's a huge number .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragedy ; a million deaths is a statistic .
" It 's not reassuring to hear this philosophy espoused by high-ranking national officials .
CNN Health : According to CNN Health 's tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems , there are at least 151,680 cases of coronavirus in the U .
