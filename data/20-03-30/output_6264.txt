Much of life in America , and across the globe , has ground to a near halt as the coronavirus pandemic spreads , resulting in closing of schools , thwarting travel , forcing employees to work from home and shutting institutions .
The authorities now believe that the rapidly-spreading disease could fundamentally upend life for months .
Speaking to reporters on Friday , President Trump was asked what would he say to millions of school kids across the county who are staying at home .
" I would say that they have a duty to sit back , watch , behave , wash their hands , stay in the apartment with mom and dad , " Trump told reporters at a White House news conference .
Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online , but it is better in the classroom .
You know that , a journalist asked Trump .
" My kids , they want to crawl on the walls and climb of the walls and my wife is about to lose it .
So many of them are watching right now .
What would you say to those kids right now , elementary school , middle school , high school , what would you tell them right now who are watching from home ? " Trump was asked .
" I would say that you are a citizen of the greatest country anywhere in the world and we were attacked like nothing that 's happened possibly since 1917 .
" Many , many years ago .
We were attacked and we are winning the battle and we 're going to win the war and it 's not going to take , hopefully , not that much longer .
But we have to win the war , " Trump responded .
The kids should just sit back and be very proud of the country , the president said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultimately , we 're doing it for them more than anything else if you think about it , " he said .
Referring to his Friday conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping , he said both the leaders agreed that the young people were attacked to a much lesser extent by this pandemic .
" This whatever they want to call it .
You call it a germ , you can call it a flu , you can call it a virus .
You know , you can call it many different names .
I 'm not sure anybody even knows what it is , but the children do very well .
It 's almost the younger they are , the better they do , " Trump said .
He said he was happy that the immune system of youngsters was stronger .
" But they have been attacked .
For instance , the Spanish flu and if you look at the H1N1 , the spine if you take a look at the swine flu , which was , as you know , not so long ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , everyone .
Age is a factor here .
So your children should be in good shape .
Just tell them to be very proud of the country , " Trump said .
