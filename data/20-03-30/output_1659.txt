Thanks !  Richard Branson 's California-based rocket company has switched gears in order to develop a ventilator device that will be mass produced and sent to hospitals in need during the novel COVID-19 pandemic .
" Usually we 're working on rocket engines and launch systems that take satellites to orbit .
But with the looming COVID-19 crisis , we reached out to California Gov .
Newsom and asked ' what can we do to help ? ' " Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said .
Existing ventilators deliver air to the lungs through a pump placed in the windpipe , but due to the global shortage of these devices , Virgin Orbit hopes to get their device to hospitals as soon as possible .
These devices will compress medical ambu bags , thus helping COVID-19 patients to breath .
? It is a very , very simple and robust design that we can get out to the people who are in the most need , and the hospitals that are in the most need , of devices like these very , very quickly , " said Kevin Zagorski , Virgin Orbit 's ventilator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects to be able to create thousands of devices per week in the near future and while the space company is not necessarily in the medical device business , thanks to the guidance of doctors and engineers at the University of California Irvine and the University of Texas at Austin , the brand will be able to mass produce these devices at rapid speed -- although the company does not yet have a precise timeline for FDA approval .
" We at Virgin Orbit want to do everything we can for the broader community as we all prepare for the challenges ahead .
" Hart noted .
