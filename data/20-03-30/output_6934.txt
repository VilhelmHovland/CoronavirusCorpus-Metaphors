Letter : The COVID-19 , climate connection -- How will be respond ?  Published : 3/30/2020 5:52:24 PM  COVID-19 is giving us a dress rehearsal for climate change .
Both crises remind us how connected we are to each other .
They call forth our best -- our compassion and courage -- and also open the door for fear of " the other .
"  Just as the coronavirus was among us before we began to take it seriously , climate change is already here but the world has not yet taken it seriously .
Both COVID and climate affect everyone -- but not equally .
The poor and vulnerable will suffer most from both .
They are the least able to stay home and not work , or to leave their home for a safer place .
Just as COVID-19 is depriving millions of people around the world of their livelihood , climate change is already altering the economic landscape , particularly for farmers and those who live near the sea .
May we learn from this crisis the lessons that will help us to address climate change .
May we care enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighbors and our planet -- and bring us the gifts of greater connection .
