India is fifth country to isolate virus  India has become the fifth country to successfully isolate a strain of the novel coronavirus , after China , Japan , Thailand and the US .
In other words , Indian scientists have been able to obtain a pure sample of the virus outside the human body .
This scientific process is important in developing drugs , vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits , the director general of Indian Council of Medical Research Dr Balram Bhargava said .
He said the isolation of the novel coronavirus , the agent responsible for the outbreak of Covid-19 , was n't easy as India had fewer positive cases when the project started .
Raman R Gangakhedkar , head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases-I , had said earlier that it will take around one-and-a-half to two years for India to develop a vaccine even with expedited clinical trials and approvals .
