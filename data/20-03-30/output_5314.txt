" Who do I believe would be the best person for the job as mayor ? The answer is myself , and for many difference reasons .
Both Glen and myself wanted change in council ; with both of us wanting the top job ; hence why we both ran and wanted Mick 's job .
" I ran a positive campaign without pulling down either of the other candidates .
I made it clear from the outset that Glen could have those who wanted a protest vote , I would look to win by positive plans and policies .

" Glen Hartwig on 51 per cent of the vote has a clear lead and should win .
Congratulations to Glen , " he said .
" ( Division 5 ) with only 18 per cent counted the vote is extremely similar to 2016 , I am on 39 per cent with the two ( challengers ) on about 30 per cent each .
This I think reflects that while I support Glen Hartwig , many see me as being too close to Curran .
"  Mr Stewart said incumbent councillors Hilary Smerdon and Bob Fredman " will get back in " in a " firm prediction " , while Bruce Devereaux held a commanding lead in Division 4 .
He said " councillors seen to support Curran " all lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's preferences would be " crucial " in separating the neck-and-neck contest between Warren Polley and incumbent Bob Leitch .

" I know there 's a lockdown but if you say no to this and all the stuff that 's normal , we 've got non-essential workers at home beating their heads in for seven days , " he said .
" Some type of normality to get out of the house and go vote is important .
"  Mr Bates said this was one of the better elections as there was not a single volunteer handing out cards to those walking in .
There was no volunteers in sight at the 2020 local council elections , just placards and billboards .
Photo : Philippe Coquerand  " Heck yeah , it 's heaps better for the environment , " he said .
" They 've graffiti 'd the building with posters everywhere but I think the election should 've gone ahead as it 's important to have the best of a normal life .
"  Mr Bates slammed the Mary Valley Rattler calling it a " joke .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , " he said .
" If it was a normal company that was n't government backed , it would 've shut down a long time ago .
" It 's important for them to pull up their socks and get a result .
" I think the other issue to tackle is drug use and I guess youth disobedience .
" On a daily I see a lot of kids that should be in school and they 're up at the skate park , up to no good .
" I think there needs to be more investment in younger people rather than what 's going on in council with this or that , I care about statistics at school and that this is happening in our community and how can we address it .
"  Voting .
One idea was to merge three schools into one and call it a super schools .
" We 've got schools sitting at 1200 students .
Build a super school and merge three schools into one big school , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have land to build it .
I think that skate park is the best investment in a long time but it 's a little too late .
" There needs to be better awareness with drugs .
Drugs incapacitate you .
It 's a disease .
We need to invest more into it .
"  Asked whether or not the mayoral race would be a close one , Mr Bates said " between Glen Hartwig and Mick Curran " would go down to the nail .
" I think Mick 's done a sensational job .
I 'm not into politics but I think he has done a great job .
The town is still standing .
Yes the cost blowout in the latest budget was a bit disheartening saying there would be a $3 million profit and then all of a sudden there 's a massive deficit , like where did that come from ? "  Mr Bates said he was n't too concerned about the coronavirus impacting the Gympie region .
" Regardless of the current crisis that we find ourselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " We can see this not only by our population growth , but our building growth , the investment by the council into our future and also the change which has been made into council operations .
" Regardless of what has been said in the media by some this community should be very thankful that we have about 500 council employees who .
get out of bed each and every day , go to work and make our community a better place .
"  4:30PM : Ellen Kenman , who just returned to Gympie from Innisfail , says the election should 've been canned .
" It should n't have gone ahead as there are a lot of businesses who have closed down due to being non-essential and in my opinion , this is non-essential , " she said .
" It 's great to see nobody handing out cards .
It 's one of my dislikes .
"  Gympie resident Ellen Kenman says the election should not have gone ahead .
Division 8 voter Sean Murphy is battling heart and lung issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge risk to the vulnerable .
He also said it should 've been better organised and that people should be allowed to vote online .
" The bureau is all set up but is not being used properly , " he said .
" The coronavirus is a huge concern to me at the moment because if I get pneumonia , I could die .
"  4:15PM  THIS year 's council elections have undeniably caused quite a stir among Gympie region residents as the coronavirus pandemic continues a wave of destruction across the world .
" It 's greedy in my opinion , " said Gympie resident Paul Murray who was in a rush to cast his vote at the Gympie Civic Centre this afternoon .
" Under these circumstances , yes the elections should 've been cancelled because they are endangering people 's lives , " he said .
" I think the newly elected council need to focus on the younger people of this town , give them something to do .
There 's nothing for them to do .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were hopeful of new councillors this year .
" I 'd love to get a woman in charge , " Mrs Perks said .
" This election should 've been cancelled .
We 'd love to see more roads fixed and more focus on infrastructure .
They could also do a bit more on dealing with the coronavirus .
"  It was clear that the message of staying 1 .
away from each other and staying inside was being heard and followed as polling booths across the region were quiet .
Only several cars were parked outside the Jones Hill State School with voters dashing in and out as quick as a lightning bolt .
Nobody was seen chatting to each other .
Others were seen with face masks at the Gympie Civic Centre polling booths .
Gympie resident Lorraine Smith said she was relieved to see no candidates or volunteers handing out , how to vote cards .
" It 's a relief seeing volunteers not handing out , how to vote cards .
It 's good for the environment , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exit from Gympie Regional Council after only one term , mayoral candidate Glen Hartwig is happy to let his fate rest with the people  But his fight for change in the region 's elected leadership had been buoyed by a similar desire running as an undercurrent to the 2020 election , he said .
Glen Hartwig  " There are a lot of people frustrated with how ( the council ) do things , " Mr Hartwig said .
However the former Division 2 councillor declined to offer any definitive answer to how he felt his chances to win the top job were .
Mr Hartwig is vying for the top elected seat on the council .
" Whatever happens , happens , " Mr Hartwig said .
" We 'll know later tonight  " I 'm not one for gambling .
When it came to the pandemic-sized elephant in the room and whether these elections should have gone ahead in the crisis , he said " ( the government ) obviously believes it 's the right thing to do " .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " In an ideal world it would n't happen , " he said .
" But the decision has been made .
"  Despite the all-or-nothing risk of his run against incumbent Mayor Mick Curran and former federal and council candidate Tim Jerome for the top seat , he said it was the region 's choice to decide what direction they wished Gympie to head in .
