These are unprecedented times .
The Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) has wreaked havoc globally with the way we live and our way of doing business .
Our island was on the cusp of making major economic breakthroughs , but we are now suddenly facing the challenge of our lifetime , a challenge that affects Jamaica 's greatest asset : the wellbeing of its people .
The Jamaican government has been doing the right thing , making the creative and necessary decisions to thwart the spread of COVID-19 through the enactment of the Quarantine Act and implementing a number of measures to curtail the spread of the virus .
Further , the necessary preparations are being made to ensure that Jamaicans will have the health services needed if they do contract the virus by increasing both testing and treatment capacities .
The government has also put many fiscal measures in place to protect the economic gains that have been made , so that Jamaica can return to its growth agenda after addressing this health crisis and any resulting shock to the economy .
Faced with this national crisis , which threatens our economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth in the economy .
As Jamaica 's economic development agency , JAMPRO must support our most innovative and creative businesses to expand their production and access new markets , while continuing to build a more business friendly environment .
* Increasing our support of the agribusiness sector to attract and facilitate new technology driven investment , as well as , facilitate linkages between farmers , manufacturers , and service providers .
We must increase production to improve food security , raise productivity and create sustainable value-added food products .
* Driving the conversion to a digital economy , by upskilling our young people during this e-learning stay at home opportunity and accelerating the development of a National Digital Services Strategy * Improving our service and relevance to local businesses , who must become the drivers of Jamaica 's economic recovery , particularly with global FDI expected to fall by 5% to 15% .

This is just a snapshot of what the Agency will be doing during the crisis , amongst other activities in alignment with our mandate to facilitate investment and export , while advocating to improve the business environment of Jamaica .
We are ready to support our clients on their investment projects or export opportunities -- and we are looking at ways to identify and secure new opportunities for them .
Recovery is on the horizon -- if we work together  As Chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can assist the Jamaican people and business , if the conditions allow us to , we must .
JAMPRO is exploring innovative ways to support the people of Jamaica through this crisis and to provide a springboard for our business environment after the worst has passed .
We will continue to closely monitor the global economic situation to better advise our clients on investment and export matters .
Jamaicans can overcome anything , and if we take this threat seriously , and follow the recommended behaviours such as social distancing , increased hygienic methods , and protecting our loved ones ( especially those at risk ) , we will be able to come out of this stronger .
I urge all Jamaicans to work together so that we can overcome this global threat .
If we do this , Jamaica will recover , we will be safe and healthy , and we will minimize the impact to our economy .
Protect your families and loved ones at this time ; let us protect the advancements we have made , as we look forward to a new day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
