Coronavirus roils every segment of US child welfare system  NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Child welfare agencies across the U .
, often beleaguered in the best of times , are scrambling to confront new challenges that the coronavirus is posing for caseworkers , kids and parents .
For caseworkers , the potential toll is physical and emotional .
Child welfare workers in several states , including Michigan , Massachusetts , New York and Washington , have tested positive for COVID-19 .
Many agencies , seeking to limit the virus 's spread , have cut back on in-person inspections at homes of children considered at risk of abuse and neglect .
Parents of children already in foster care are missing out on weekly visits .
Slowdowns at family courts are burdening some of those parents with agonizing delays in getting back their children .
" There are real sad consequences for folks who 've been making progress toward reunifying , " said Boston social worker Adriana Zwick , who represents unionized caseworkers with Massachusetts ' Department of Children and Families .
She recounted how one supervisor broke down in tears after learning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from foster care was told there would be a delay because the food service job she 'd been promised was scrapped because of COVID-19 .
" She was almost there , " Zwick said .
" This has really thrown a wrench into things .
"  For workers , widespread shortages of gloves , masks and other safety gear are raising concerns , said Angelo McClain , CEO of the National Association of Social Workers .
" If a report comes in of a kid in danger , you need to go out and make sure that child is safe -- but you need a face mask , gloves , sanitizer , " he said .
In New York City , the nation 's worst-hit area , child protection staff are instructed mostly to use " virtual visiting , " even while investigating potential risks to a child 's safety .
The city 's Administration for Children 's Services has provided staff with questions to ask families to gauge whether any household member may have the virus .
If they do , the agency says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The CEO of one of New York 's biggest youth and family services providers , Michelle Yanche , says some of her 1,200 staffers at Good Shepherd Services have tested positive for COVID-19 , and she 's bracing for the number to rise .
" We 've had to triage , " she said .
" For the most high-risk families , there 's no other alternative than to see them in person .
"  Because of insufficient supplies , she said her staffers sometimes make urgent visits either with no equipment or gear that 's been used .
In Massachusetts , Zwick 's department confirmed Thursday that one of its Boston-based employees has tested positive for COVID-19 .
The union says at least three other workers are presumed infected after becoming seriously ill .
Many child welfare professionals worry the pandemic , by increasing stress on already fragile families , will fuel a rise in child abuse and neglect .
" You have families that do n't have stable housing , stable income .
Maybe there 's a mental health challenge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , " Zwick said .
" That is a recipe for disaster .
"  Teachers and other school employees normally offer a safeguard by reporting suspicious bruises and other warning signs , said McClain of the social workers association .
" Now you do n't have those eyes and ears , " he said .
In Fort Worth , Texas , Cook Children 's Medical Center recently admitted seven kids under 4 who suffered severe abuse , including two who died the same day .
Jayme Coffman , who heads the hospital 's child abuse prevention center , linked the surge of cases to the heightened stress on many families during the pandemic .
The Houston-based sheriff of Harris County tweeted his concern .
" We can not let a health pandemic become a child abuse pandemic ! " Ed Gonzalez wrote .
" The number one reporters of child abuse are teachers , but kids are n't seeing them right now .
Neighbors and other family members , PLEASE pay close attention .
"  Because older people are particularly vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kids have not been a focus of public health efforts .
That 's a mistake , according to University of Pennsylvania professor Marci Hamilton , also CEO of CHILD USA , a think tank seeking to prevent child abuse and neglect .
" Already some areas are reporting spikes in abuse , " she said .
" If caseworkers do n't have that protective equipment , it 's likely we 'll have fewer home visits , and fewer home visits mean more kids at risk .
"  For many parents whose children are in foster care , and who yearn to get them back , the pandemic has worsened their predicament .
Many family courts have postponed non-emergency cases , and many social services required for reunification , such as addiction treatment programs , have been disrupted .
" The courts do n't have the technology to hold virtual hearings , case files are n't available electronically .
There 's almost this sense of paralysis , " he said .
The disruption of services also can heighten concern about children 's safety .
Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clara County , said a boy was recently reunified with his mother , but now a drug-testing program has been suspended that would have let Novotny verify that the mom was staying off drugs .
" I hope the kid is safe , " she said .
Foster care also is facing upheaval , with the U .
Department of Health and Human Services easing its oversight rules .
Under longstanding law , caseworkers are required to make monthly in-person visits to children in foster care .
The agency now says caseworkers instead can do videoconferencing visits .
JooYeun Chang , executive director of Michigan 's Children 's Services Agency , said caseworkers should make in-person home visits only when " absolutely necessary .
" Her agency confirmed Thursday that six staffers had tested positive for COVID-19 .
As for visits between foster children and their biological families , Chang said they 're no longer required to be face to face but can be done through Skype or FaceTime .
These changes have confused many foster parents , said Irene Clements , executive director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodating frequent court-ordered visits from their foster child 's biological family and now are unsure about their obligations , Clements said .
She said school closures have created severe disruptions for foster parents who still need to leave home to work .
" But it 's not just about the foster families , " Clements said .
" Some of the birth parents are going to suffer the consequences of not being able to reunify because of lack of income .
It 's nobody 's fault , and it 's heartbreaking for all of us .
