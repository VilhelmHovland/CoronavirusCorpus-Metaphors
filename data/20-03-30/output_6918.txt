( Photo : Patricia Talorico , Delaware News Journal )  Instacart is a same-day shopping/delivery service serving stores such as Acme , Aldi , Giant , ShopRite , Costco , Petco , CVS and Safeway .
You can sign up for the service at the store 's website or on your phone through the app .
After signing up online at a store of my choice , I clicked on items I wanted , selecting favorite brands and amounts needed .
I got a window of time when the Instacart shopper got the list and began the order .
Then , I could follow the shopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is , however , a price for convenience and peace of mind .
It 's easier to find bargains when you 're the one in the store doing the hunting .
Also , you 'll be charged a service fee , a delivery fee and a tip in addition to the cost of the groceries .
Ferne D .
was my InstaCart shopper and did a good job , but she 's not a miracle worker .
The 5-pound bag of all-purpose flour I wanted ? Sorry , it 's not available at the Acme Market where she 's shopping , and there 's no substitution .
Here was the breakdown of my March 25 order : Cost of groceries ( 14 items , three replacements and two refunds ) was $65 .
A 20 percent tip was $13 .
( you can go lower or higher ) .
The service fee for me was $3 .
Ferne D .
, my Instacart shopper , sent me a photo of a store shelf in the grocery store to see if I wanted another selection for an item she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first delivery is free , then after that , it can start at $3 .
If you plan to use Instacart more often , it 's $9 .
per month .
There are some savings .
If you share your Instacart experience on Facebook or Twitter , you 'll get $10 off a future order , and a friend who uses it can also save $10 .
Having someone else do the shopping right now is a burgeoning need .
Instacart has said it planned to add 300,000 workers over the next three months to meet the demand for grocery deliveries .
But a nationwide strike from the approximately 150,000 Instacart employees expected on Monday could temporarily curtail the service .
The reason for the job action ? Shoppers say the company is n't providing them with masks , gloves and other protection from coronavirus .
They also want an extra $5 per order in hazard pay and expanded pay for workers impacted by COVID-19 .
How the order went  After placing my order in the morning , around 10 a .
, I receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to start looking for my items .
The text noted that I would be notified if there are any changes to my order , and perishables would be temperature controlled in the store and " carefully handled by " the driver until delivery .
I follow the play-by-play action on my phone , and , in some ways , it 's almost like a sporting event .
Is this the new baseball ?  Ferne D .
tells me the 2-pound bag of fresh lemons I want are not available , but she is replacing them with six loose lemons , each costing 79 cents .
I review her choice and approve it .
She also has no luck in finding basmati rice .
Uh , oh .
I start thinking maybe this was n't such a good idea after all .
But then Ferne D .
sends me photos of the shelves in the grains , rice and dried goods aisle .
" Is there a replacement in the photo you would like ? "  At first , I ask for a box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long grain rice .
Can you pick them up , instead ? No problem .
A loaf of seedless rye from my list is n't available , but rye bread with seeds is on the shelf .
I approve Ferne D .
's choice on that one , too .
Actually , it 's a win for me .
I did want the bread with seeds , but made the wrong selection when I initially ordered .
The only items not available ? The all-purpose flour and a package of paper towels .
I receive a refund on my credit card charge for those two items .
Interestingly enough , I scored both the flour and paper towels on a trip a few days later -- on my own -- to the same Acme where Ferne D .
was shopping .
Delivery comes much faster than I expected .
I get a text that the items are coming by 12:50 p .
and Ferne D .
leaves my bags on the front step as requested .
No face-to-face delivery .
Pawing through the bags , I find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemons I asked for are real beauties .
The two containers of grape tomatoes are n't bad , but I probably would have picked up packages that looked a little more ripe than the ones I received .
Would I use this service again ? Yes , but probably only in cases of emergency .
A co-worker said her Acme Instacart order came in just over two hours with no problem , but a ShopRite order was missing an item .
She tried letting Instacart know in the app and on desktop that she was missing an item , but the website/app did not seem to be working correctly .
She phoned and a message said there would be an 81-minute wait to talk to someone about a refund .
My co-worker said she also was told an order for BJ 's Warehouse could not be filled immediately , and would take a few days due to high demand .
