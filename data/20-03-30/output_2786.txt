Meili calls on province to ramp up COVID-19 testing and tracing of contacts  Saskatchewan NDP leader Ryan Meili is calling on the provincial government to increase its COVID-19 testing .
During the province 's COVID-19 update on Friday , Chief Medical Health Officer Dr .
Saqib Shahab said they 're prioritizing testing for " people who need it the most , " such as health care workers and those in long-term care facilities .
But Meili says this is n't a good move in the wake of community spread , which he says has been going on for weeks .
He referred to a snowmobile rally in Christopher Lake held on Mar .
14 , which has led to 20 cases as of Sunday .
Shahab , however , is saying cases are the result of " local transmission " if they ca n't be traced back to a source .
As of Monday , the province said at least eight cases are the result of local transmission .
The rest are travel-related or cluster-related from mass gatherings like the snowmobile rally .
" This is not the time to be rationing testing .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracing of contacts -- It is right now , " said Meili .
" I 've been talking to people who have called 811 , had symptoms , had a good reason to be tested and are getting told to just self-isolate .
"  Sask people , please take physical distancing very seriously .
It makes a huge difference .
He said he believes the province has the capacity to do so because there 's no shortage of testing supplies .
" At a certain point , if it gets so widespread , the testing does n't matter as much .
Right now , as we try to keep this under control and keep it from spreading , that testing and tracing is key .
"  Communication lacking from provincialgovernment , says NDP leader  In addition to ramping up testing , Meili said the province needs to release more information on Saskatchewan 's cases of COVID-19 .
Last week , the government began releasing more information on COVID-19-related hospitalizations , specifying how many patients are in acute care and how many are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a positive step , said Meili , Saskatchewan residents outside of Saskatoon and Regina still do n't know how their communities are being impacted .
" It 's happening in Estevan , the people in Estevan should know that , " he said , adding it further motivates people to prevent the spread in their own communities .
On Monday , the province announced two people who had COVID-19 have died in hospital .
It would n't release which part of the province the deaths occurred , however , placing ' N/A ' on the chart showing a province-wide breakdown of the cases .
COVID-19 cases as of Monday .
The provincial government is n't releasing where deaths occurred .
( Government of Saskatchewan/Website )  " I first want to say to the friends and family of those who have died that our thoughts are with you in this moment of loss .
To the rest of the province , I know that we are all anxious about the impact of COVID-19 on our lives and our families .
We will get through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow the spread , " Meili said in a news release in response to the deaths .
" Today 's news reminds us how important it is for us to maintain physical distancing measures , for people to stay home as much as possible and to avoid gatherings .
"  While the province is live-streaming its regular updates and sent out emergency notifications on cellphones , Meili added the province is n't taking advantage of further levels of communication .
" We need to see some public-facing ad campaigns , television ads , online , on radio so that people know exactly how serious this is , exactly what it is we 're facing and exactly what they can do , " he said .
He said many Saskatchewan residents are still unclear about the symptoms of the virus .
" The level of anxiety that people are feeling about what 's likely to happen here in Saskatchewan is going up and up , " added Meili .
This stems from patterns in other parts of the world such as Europe and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , currently has about 160,000 cases , while Canada has approximately 7,300 .
