Local law enforcement entities are uniting in opposition to the suggested release of inmates amid the coronavirus crisis , arguing against the proposals by criminal defense groups who claim the virus will rip through crowded detention facilities .
The Committee for Public Counsel Services and the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers are suing for the release of inmates with health issues , those nearing the end of their sentence and inmates eligible for medical parole , among other stipulations .
The sheriffs of all 14 Massachusetts counties countered in a brief , " The actual remedies Petitioners seek are short-sighted and are likely , in the end , to result in substantial harm to the inmates themselves , the already strained social services agencies still operating during this pandemic and the general public .
"  The sheriffs will join in a packed telephone conference before the Supreme Judicial Court Tuesday with the criminal defense groups , district attorneys and the Attorney General 's Office , which is suggesting temporary reforms that meet in the middle .
Cape &amp; Islands DA Michael O'Keefe , one of seven DAs opposing the releases , called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This idea of releasing whole swaths of people according to some political agenda is frankly a very irresponsible thing to do , " O'Keefe said Monday .
" It 's also an irresponsible thing to do to the defendants , many of whom have no place to go , who have no support services .
"  O'Keefe was one of several DAs who have told the Herald their offices are working on a case-by-case basis with the courts and defense attorneys for individual releases .
Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins , who wrote a brief in support of the criminal defense groups , declined to comment Monday .
Rollins and three local DAs signed onto a national letter earlier this month urging the release of inmates in similar circumstances .
Civil groups filed briefs citing widespread poor health conditions and care in detention facilities , noting the first recorded COVID-19 case in state facilities was diagnosed in a man serving a life sentence .
Attorney Ruth Greenberg , writing in support of releases , wrote of the medical parole statute , which could allow the release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has Stage 4 metastatic prostrate cancer and whose mother is willing to let him live with her in his final months .
" I 'm hoping the Department of Corrections will now understand that pandemic is always a risk , " Greenberg said , " and that the release of the terminally ill and the incapacitated under the medical parole statute decreases the risk .
