The business had twelve hours notice to close .
We complied with the directive .
This has been and is a very stressful time , the biggest stress being fixed-cost lease/outgoings .
In the seventeen years of trading all fixed costs have always been met , even in a heated overpriced market .
To be fair , the cash flow was ceased via a directive that went from good to $0 overnight .
The business could sustain three months of outgoings/rent .
We have decided to hold .
Advertisement  To be fair on all parties the burden must be shared via rent hold/holiday .
There is no current set start-up date .
The business needs current funds for start up , whenever that may be ?  There needs to be instruction/law that puts these costs to hibernation , if not many small businesses will cease to trade .
I am very hopeful the government will work on the issue with urgency .
Revenue burdens must be shared via a trickling-down stream .
If not , it is disaster for the Australian economy and Australian small business .
-- Carl Edwards  For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income stream generated by my residential rent to operate .
If I can not get this income , how can I accomplish my obligations to other service providers or retailers ?  I see it as the bank 's will be hit hard and everyone is affected by some degree .
Six months is half a year and how can ATO cope with no revenue ?  I hate to think what the future holds .
-- Frank Pakravan  On hoarding  I am concerned and would like to know and be reassured that none of the hoarded items stripped from our supermarket shelves are being exported overseas .
I trust that the Australian Government and all of our agencies such as Border Force , AFP and port authorities are on the ball with this and that these activities wo n't slip through the cracks as these activities need to be prohibited .
They need to keep their eye on this ball .
Advertisement  There are many of us who did not panic and hoard , and we are now not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Novak  This issue has been around for years .
The same group is always affected .
They were moved from West Tce , they then went in to one of the squares , then North Tce and now the south parklands .
The establishment of the dry areas has always been a whole of government approach .
The only problem is that the government agencies mandated to contribute to this issue , do n't .
It is left up to the police .
That 's like putting the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff .
Holding these other agencies accountable by having them identify how they are going to contribute to resolving the issues and then reporting their activity to government would be a good start .
This is not just a police issue .
-- Graeme Adcock  As a South Terrace resident living opposite Veale Gardens and running businesses in the city I use the parklands twice a day for exercise with my dog .
I have expressed my opinion in the surveys .
I 100% agree with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first survey undertaken -- they merely went about rigging it to achieve the end they desired .
We risk taking away our hard won freedoms in the name of Nanny State do-gooders who wo n't solve the underlying problem .
It is becoming more prevalent in our society where those that are comfortably well off do n't want to be reminded of the fact we live in a society made up of all sorts of people with varying backgrounds and economic circumstances .
If I so choose to take a couple of deck chairs across the road to enjoy a bottle of fine South Australian wine with my wife , why should I have to cut through red tape and contribute to council 's coffers for the privilege of exercising my freedoms ?  I 've had other residents suggest to me that " I 'm not the target " and that my behaviour would be ignored by authorities , to which I 've asked " So you are advocating I break the law and that there should be one rule for me and another rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position is hard to fathom .
As you can tell , I 'm quite passionate about this issue -- just another example of the Nanny State encroachment on the liberties our grandparents went to war to preserve .
