Experts have revealed sex workers could be at risk of ' slipping through the cracks ' as the government 's latest coronavirus measures come into effect .
Among the many services shut down in Australia 's latest measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 are adult entertainment venues , or sex work locations .
Now sex workers have been forced to get creative as physical services are closed down .
Mature Aussie sex worker Taylor Tara tells Yahoo Lifestyle says she is already looking for alternative work , as her income could dry up completely under the latest measures .
" I 'm looking for work because we do n't know what 's going to happen , " Taylor says .
" I 'm doing very little usual work at the moment .
I 'm taking on no new clients whatsoever and I 'm only taking on ones that I 've been seeing over the years .
"  Experts recommend all in-person services be halted where possible .
Stigma holding sex workers back  She says she is concerned that sex workers will struggle to access unemployment benefits due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment every industry is in as much jeopardy , it 's just harder for the sex workers to actually get payouts or funding because people do n't know , " she says .
" There are so many in the mature age bracket that are too scared to risk people knowing what they do .
"  It 's a fear shared by experts and industry bodies .
Cameron Cox , CEO of the Sex Workers Outreach Project ( SWOP ) , says many sex workers are non-citizens who wo n't be able to access Centrelink .
" The government payment does n't cover non-residents and there will be quite a number of sex workers who fall through the cracks , " he says .
The Australian Sex Workers Association ( the Scarlet Alliance ) , SWOP and other industry bodies have called for adequate crisis support for sex workers now at risk .
" Many sex workers are currently excluded from the stimulus packages announced by the government , " they said in a joint statement .
" We urge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex workers .
Like other Australians , sex workers have been devastatingly impacted by coronavirus .
"  Unstable status leaves no safety net  It 's not just access to benefits that is creating a unique problem for the industry , but also a notoriously unstable employment status at the best of times .
Dr Alice Orchiston is a lecturer at the University of NSW and an expert in sex industry law who says many sex workers are employed under a precarious status , meaning they can often be left without any safety net .
" Many sex workers have no savings or superannuation to draw upon in a crisis like this , " she says , adding many are treated as contractors by employers despite fitting the criteria of full-time permanent employees .
" As a result , these workers are often underpaid , do not receive superannuation , and do n't receive anything from their employer if they are stood down or dismissed , " she says .
It 's a sentiment reiterated by the collective statement from industry bodies .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomes diminish or stop completely , without access to sick pay , annual leave or superannuation , " they say .
Taylor says that with brothels now shut down , many of her former co-workers have had their lifeline cut .
" For a lot of them that one place brothels is the only place for them , " she says .
The Scarlet Alliance has set up a fund for sex workers unable to access benefits or turn to alternative work , you can donate here .
Meanwhile , other industries are also being rattled by the virus , with teachers recently revealing their fears over hygiene standards as schools are kept open amid the pandemic .
Experts warn , however , that maintaining mental health amid the panic is vital , with one expert sharing her top tips for balancing necessary precautions with all-out anxiety and depression .
Brothels , strip clubs and " sex-on-premises " venues have been added to the long list of non-essential services closing due to coronavirus but some sex workers in the private escort industry are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerless to stop , hundreds of advertisements for private sex workers are appearing on popular sites , a number of them citing the extra measures the escorts are taking to provide intimate services safely .
One online ad for a male sex worker in Melbourne reassured clients that hand wash and sanitiser would be provided on arrival .
" I disinfect all ' high touch surfaces ' between each client ' , " the advertisement says .
Another assured customers : " Usually I work for .
just 1-2 customers a day so I do n't meet too many people .
If you are fine , clean and safe so we 're fine .
"  But one advertisement warned : " Please do n't ask for or expect kissing or face to face services .
My premises are not accessible to anyone other than myself and extensive disinfecting will take place before your visit so please understand the necessity for a $20 rise .
"  Sex workers say that while many private escorts are opting not to work for the safety of themselves and the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money to survive .
" Many private sex workers are also international students who are n't eligible for Centrelink benefits , " one male escort explained .
" But it 's also a two-way street -- men are seeking out these services .
I 've decided not to work but even as I 'm speaking to you , I 've had two messages from clients wanting to hook up .
"  The trend highlights another challenge authorities face in keeping people socially separated amid the global pandemic , particularly when it comes to consensual sex and unlicensed sections of the adult industry .
Many of the online ads seen by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald appeared within hours of new measures ordering the closure of brothels and other licensed sex venues , which kicked in at midnight on Thursday .
However , while some sex workers and clients are flouting social distancing rules , others are following government directives , resulting in financial hardship for many .
Jane Green , from Vixen Collective , said the impact of travel restrictions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on the sex worker community , which has urged the state government for some form of emergency relief .
The national peak body for the industry , Scarlet Alliance , has also created a public fund to support sex workers to stay housed and fed during the crisis .
Much of the private escort industry is not formally licensed , partly due to the stigma associated with being a sex worker and because of the complex maze that people must navigate in order to be registered .
In Victoria , for instance , to work in the industry , you must provide your full identity to the government 's business licensing authority , which some fear would " out " them publicly , risk their privacy , or affect their future job prospects .
Figures show there are a total of 115 licensed sex work business operators and 616 approved brothel managers in Victoria , however , many individuals work in an " underground " market , advertising online without a license and meeting clients in their homes or at booked hotels and motels .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The complexity of the registration process means that many people are operating without a licence , and this makes enforcement and compliance a challenge for authorities , " said Sex Work Law Reform Victoria spokesman Roger Sorrenti .
On Thursday a Sydney massage parlour became the first business to be fined $5000 after being caught by police operating outside NSW 's new public health rules .
In Victoria , which recorded its first COVID-19 deaths on Thursday , a dedicated taskforce of 500 police has been set up to enforce restrictions , with fines of up to $20,000 for individuals who do not comply or $100,000 for companies or corporations .
As of 9pm on Wednesday , 88 spot checks had been completed in Victoria of which 12 people who were supposed to be in isolation were found to not be home .
A spokesman could not reveal if or how police could enforce the rules on private escorts , other than to say : " These are unprecedented times and Victoria Police continues to work with the government to ensure it has the right powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding private escorts should be directed to the Department of Health and Human Services .

Might be your last chance for a while , " a grizzled pimp mumbled in the hours before midnight outside one of the dozens of brothels dotted along Geylang 's streets , which are monitored by police security cameras .
Singapore announced massive stimulus measures on Thursday to soften the economic shock from the coronavirus outbreak , including generous cash handouts for locals .
But for the hundreds of low-income Asian migrant sex workers and nightclub entertainers in the wealthy city-state , there is huge uncertainty about their future .

REUTERS/Edgar Su  Singapore , known for its strict laws , does not explicitly criminalize prostitution although aspects of the industry are illegal , including soliciting , pimping and running a brothel .
That has not stopped the sex trade operating in the Asian financial hub , from rendezvous in high-end hotel bars to the infamous Orchard Towers , a drab 1970s commercial building in Singapore 's prime shopping district .
Orchard Towers is now closed with police tape around its entrances .
" What am I gon na do now ? " said one young woman in a sequined dress as men shuffled out of the tower 's drinking holes , including Naughty Girl Nightclub and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess we 'll work something out , honey .
People still got to have fun .
