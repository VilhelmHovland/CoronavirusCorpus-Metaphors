7 Mistakes of Grammar on Coronavirus  7 Mistakes of Grammar on Coronavirus  Monday , March 30 , 2020 8:36 pm  Farooq A .
Kperogi  By Farooq Kperogi  I know grammar is the last thing on most people 's minds right now , but for the few people who care ( and who have been sending me inquiries in private messages ) , here are six coronavirus grammar lessons :  1 .
People test positive FOR coronavirus , not " TO " it .
It is , " El-Rufai tests positive FOR coronavirus , " not " El-Rufai tests positive TO coronavirus .
"  2 .
Quarantine is pronounced KWO-RAN-TEEN , not KWO-RAN-TAIN , in both British and American English .
In other words , quarantine rhymes with " canteen , " not " valentine .
"  3 .
Coronavirus is a single word , although " corona virus " is an acceptable variant .
People tend to use ( " self- ) quarantine " and " ( self- ) isolation " interchangeably , but they 're different .
You ( self- ) quarantine yourself when you suspect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with people who have tested positive for it .
You go into ( self- ) isolation when you test positive for the disease .
If you stay home NOT because you came in contact with people who have the disease and NOT because you tested positive for it , but because your government insists you do , or you do so on your own volition just to eliminate or decrease your chances of getting the disease , it 's called " shelter in place .
"  5 .
An epidemic is a disease that temporarily affects a large number of people in a locality while a pandemic is a disease that has spread throughout a country , a continent or the entire world .
Coronavirus is obviously a pandemic .
Finally , the other name for coronavirus is COVID-19 , not COVIK 1 , 9 .
Do n't be misled by what a certain physically quarantined and mentally isolated " president , " now infamously known as " President COVIK " on social media , said a few days ago .
Nor should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's notoriously pliant rubber-stamp Senate President by the name of Ahmed Lawan did two days ago .
Well , this same man told the world of a woman who " killed her husband to death " ! Go figure .
