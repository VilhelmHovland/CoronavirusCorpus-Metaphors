Kristin Cavallari has come under fire after heavily promoting her business , Uncommon James , in the midst of the coronavirus crisis .
Getty Images  For anyone who 's been following the former star of Laguna Beach and The Hills in recent years , you 'll know that in 2017 she started a jewellery business -- the success of which has been charted on her new reality show , Very Cavallari .
E !  The company , which began in Kristin 's home , has quickly grown into a multimillion-dollar business with two physical stores and hundreds of employees .
Timothy Hiatt / Getty Images  So when Kristin went on Instagram in the middle of the coronavirus crisis to promote her business in a series of posts , people were not impressed .
However , shortly after the post went live , it became inundated with comments accusing Kristin -- who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the coronavirus crisis hit -- of focusing more on her brand than the outbreak .
" The narcissism is amazing , " wrote one commenter .
" This pandemic has shown how completely out of touch celebrities are .
"  " Why would anyone want to be texted by you daily , in an effort to further line your pockets ? " asked another .
" Is this not enough for you at a time like this ? While you 're sitting on a beach , and others are suffering ? Highly insensitive , self-serving and tone deaf .
"  " Stop posting and telling people to buy your products when the world is in crisis , " one commenter wrote .
" Donate or get off Instagram .
You have millions already .
"  " Stop .
Please find a balance between being a business woman and also using your platform for social responsibility , " another said .
" I 'm sorry , it 's hard to watch all your social media and not be angered by it .
"  Many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together " when countless people are " struggling to pay their bills or keep their jobs " .
Well , a few hours later , Kristin appeared on Instagram stories to show off some new stock that fans could find online , before explaining that she was promoting Uncommon James in order to drive sales and avoid losing staff in the financial fallout of the crisis .
Brittainy then reposted the message on her own Instagram account with a message saying how " proud " she was to be part of a team that " works together even in these times " .
" Thankful to everyone who buys and supports , " she added , " Thankful to these people working everyday with the current risk , and thankful to @kristincavallari for doing everything she can to make sure not one employee gets lost in this time of uncertainty .
