Corona outbreak : Force Majeure and the tussle in India 's TV industry  The IBF president wrote a letter urging agencies to maintain the " sanctity " of their contracts .
The ISA chairman replied saying that IBF 's intervention was " unwarranted " .
Have you heard , or read , about ' Force Majeure ' ? You must have , as it is making headlines almost every day lately .
In fact , Google Trends show that the search for this term is at an all-time high .
Force Majeure means extraordinary events , or circumstances , that are beyond human control -- an act of God , like a natural calamity or war or riots .
It does not include negligence or wrongdoing , ( predictable ) seasonal rain , and any other events specifically excluded in the clause .
A Force Majeure in the contract frees both the parties from contractual liability , or obligation , when ( they are ) prevented from fulfilling their obligations by such events .
The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) announced a three-month moratorium on term loans on February 19 , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance to invoke Force Majeure clause in the sector , and other industries are also contemplating the same .
So , where does the television industry , which has also been badly hit , stand ?  The three stakeholders as far as the Indian TV industry is concerned -- broadcasters , advertisers and advertising agencies -- are not in the same boat .
If sources are to be believed then many advertisers have asked their agency partners to stop ongoing media activity , considering the global pandemic .
Cola companies , automobile marketers , retail giants , e-commerce platforms have sent cancellation or postponement letters to broadcasters through their agency partners .
Since any step taken by the advertisers affects most of the broadcasters , so the agency body Indian Broadcasting Foundation ( IBF ) has intervened .
IBF president NP Singh wrote a letter to the Advertising Agencies Association of India ( AAAI ) stating that it has been brought to his notice , by the IBF members ( broadcasters ) , that agencies are sending cancellation or postponement letters to TV channels , sighting the outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AAAI to issue an advisory to its agency partners .
NP Singh  " I request agencies to maintain the sanctity of their contract , deals which are already signed between the broadcasters , agencies , and clients , including all short term deals confirmed by the issue of release order .
" Singh added , " IBF members shall not entertain cancellations , unless it in accordance with the cancellation policies of the respective channels .
"  This letter was sent to all agency heads and broadcasters .
The head of one of the agencies responded to the letter , asking the AAAI to advise .
The agency head went on to write that the print industry is backing the agencies by accommodating the cancellation or postponement requests , but the broadcasters are not ( doing the same ) .
Sunil Kataria , president of Indian Society of Advertisers ( ISA ) , found it essential to respond to Singh 's letter , as he was marked in the conversation .
Kataria wrote that he found IBF or Singh 's intervention " unwarranted " .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toughest challenge faced by the industry since independence .
" He added that it is important to recognise the uniqueness of relationships between each advertiser , agency and client , considering the past " transactions , commercials , support and contracts " extended to each other .
He asserted , " IBF forcing advertising agencies and advertisers to behave in a particular manner will risk this unique relationship .
"  Sunil Kataria  The best option , Kataria said , would be to respect the individuality of each transaction , considering the Force Majeure .
" It is of utmost importance at present to stay absolutely focused on mitigating the challenge and concerns around health .
I , therefore , say the intervention of IBF is not only unwarranted , but also diverting the attention from more important matters of national importance , and ask IBF not to do so .
"  A broadcaster , who wished not to be named , believes that the IBF is well within its rights to intervene , " Industry bodies are formed to intervene and take care of the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent on advertisers and if they pull out of ongoing deals then it will result in a massive deduction of manpower .
It is also important to take into account that a broadcaster , along with running its own business , contributes to the growth of production houses in the form of commissions for content .
"  The broadcaster added , " As far as the comparison with print is concerned , that is an industry with its back against the wall .
You have major urban cities where newspaper circulation is disrupted , whereas , on the other hand , television viewership numbers are growing because most of the population is indoors .
"  Sunil Lulla  Sunil Lulla , CEO , BARC India , along with Nielsen India , presented a report to explain the impact of COVID-19 outbreak on TV .
He said , " As a country , India does not believe in hoarding , nor do we have that much money so the consumption of essential commodities will continue to happen and , therefore , I do n't see a drop in advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent growth in weekly TV viewing minutes post COVID-19 detection in India and the subsequent lockdown .
However , an industry expert believes this ' poles apart ' stance between stakeholders in the TV industry is more than consumption and viewership .
According to his understanding , it goes back to the time when the New Tariff Order 1 was being implemented in February 2019 .
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( TRAI ) mandated that consumers must subscribe to the channels , instead of the cable operators bundling it for them .
This resulted in TV households switching off channels arbitrarily , and the broadcasters were under immense pressure .
" IBF wanted BARC to stop releasing data for a limited period of time , but the advertisers and the agencies did not agree to it , and now you have broadcasters not willing to cooperate with advertisers ' request .
Back then , the broadcasters were really under pressure and needed cooperation and today , the advertisers are in deep trouble and they need others to cooperate , " says the expert .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was their distribution partners who went hard on them .
If a broadcaster is able to generate good ratings , the cable operators willingly carry their channels to TV households .
However , for niche ones , they charge a higher carriage fee as the demand for those channels is less .
The low ratings , albeit temporary , were not helping the broadcasters while signing contract deals with the digital platform operators .
And that is why they were urging for a blackout of TV viewership data .
A few broadcasters say that they have already accommodated requests for retail chains and other advertisers who had to shut shop due to the ongoing nationwide lockdown .
" There are many advertisers who are trying to be opportunistic in a tough time like this .
There are businesses that are witnessing a significant spike in demand , why are they sending cancellation intimations ? By doing that , they are doing a disservice to the television industry in an already difficult period , " opines the revenue head of a broadcast conglomerate .
An FMCG marketer argues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brand , " You ca n't run an ad in which people are loitering outdoors , or where there is ' excitement ' in this current scenario .
You ca n't shoot a new TVC either .
The government is already promoting safety measures and too many people telling what to do will damage the cause .
Though we have not asked for cancellation or postponement , we are definitely not issuing new release orders , " says the marketer .
The discussion between the IBF , AAAI and ISA started before the country went on the 21-day lockdown .
And , as Indians remain indoors till at least April 14 , it remains to be seen if the stakeholders shake hands , or rather , considering the current scenario , simply say Namaste ! .
