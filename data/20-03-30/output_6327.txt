Strong PH economic fundamentals can address Covid-19 challenge  MANILA -- The government 's budget deficit and spending will exceed the program this year because of the need to address the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) , but Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said domestic fundamentals remain strong and can address this challenge .
In an interview by Bloomberg TV Wednesday , Dominguez said the enhanced community quarantine and the ban against the entry of foreigners for the meantime will have " very serious effects " on the livelihood of the people .
He said this is the reason why President Rodrigo R .
Duterte asked for emergency powers to be able to realign funds from both within this year 's national budget and outside of the budget which are with government-owned corporations to use to support the people who have lost their livelihood during the period of lockdown .
To date , the government has announced an initial stimulus package amounting to PHP27 .
billion to be used for the acquisition of equipment and medical supplies to address Covid-19 cases , as well as support for workers both in the tourism and non-tourism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) has also agreed to purchase PHP300 billion worth of government securities from the Bureau of the Treasury ( BTr ) , under a repurchase agreement to be paid within six months , to augment funds .
Another measure aimed to support the economy is the reduction in universal and commercial banks ' ( U/KBs ) reserve requirement ratio ( RRR ) by 200 basis points effective March 30 , 2020 , which is seen to ensure additional PHP200-billion liquidity into the system .
Dominguez said they are also in talks with lenders for a USD1-billion borrowing to further increase government funds for programs to address the economic and health impact of Covid-19 .
" The talks are going well and these will go a long way to support our efforts to combat this virus , " he said .
Dominguez said they are going to tap all markets , citing confidence that the government is " prepared , very well prepared to increase our debt levels .
"  " As you know we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( gross domestic product ) to only 41 percent of GDP now .
So we are in a very good position to combat this coronavirus and we have the debt capacity to do that , " he said .
The National Economic and Development Authority ( NEDA ) estimates that total loss from the impact of the pandemic on the economy 's supply and demand side amounts to about PHP428 .
billion to PHP1 .
trillion .
In terms of GDP , the NEDA estimates the figure to be around -0 .
percent to 4 .
percent this year .
" The way it looks it all depends on how long this emergency will last .
And we are certainly looking at a drop in our GDP growth possibly to one half of one percent negative .
That 's assuming that it will last the whole year and we do nothing , " Dominguez said .
In 2019 , domestic output slowed to 5 .
percent from previous year 's 6 .
percent due to the delay in the approval of the national budget , which was only signed on April 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower and the budget deficit is forecast to be higher than the programmed 3-3 .
percent of GDP , Dominguez said .
Revenue target for this year is PHP3 .
trillion , equivalent to 16 .
percent of domestic output while expenditures was set to be at PHP4 .
trillion .
Domestic output this year was set between a range of 6 .
percent .
The Finance chief said they continue to push for the achievement of an A-level credit rating despite the projected slower domestic output this year .
" ( But ) our main concern now , as I said , is no longer the credit rating agencies ' opinion of us but the survival of our people , the support to those whose livelihood are affected , and , of course , supporting our general economy to be ready to the inevitable return to normalcy , " he said .
In a video conference with journalists Wednesday , Dominguez said they are currently in talks with multilateral agencies like the World Bank ( WB ) , Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support .
" We want to do it early because all the countries in the world are trying to do the same thing .
I think we are a step ahead of the others at this point and we are well in the way of negotiations , " he said .
Dominguez said they are firm on having the budget needed to support the poor and lift the economy from the impact of Covid-19 .
" We are definitely in that mode right now .
We have a pretty good capacity and we will do what it takes , " he said , but declined to give figures on how much the programed targets will be surpassed since developments remain fluid .
He added foregone revenues are estimated to be about PHP286 billion if collections are flat , while these are seen to reach about PHP318 .
billion if revenues fall 1 percent .
