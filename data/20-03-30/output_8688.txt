We regret that our customers must either store their recyclables waste or dispose of it until further notice moving forward .
This temporary closure includes the closing of the 24/7/ drop-off drive through facility , as well as our Business and Residential Curbside pick-up services .
Our community trailers and inside operation at the Center had already been suspended prior to this new executive order from our Governor .
The COVID-19 pandemic is an evolving situation and we want to assure our community that the health and safety of our employees and volunteers is the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spreading of this virus .
Your Morehead Community Recycling Center is a small , non-profit organization and , like many others , we are facing tough times .
