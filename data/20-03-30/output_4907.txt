A prominent US hospital here has infused the blood of a patient , who has recovered from Covid-19 , into a critically ill patient , becoming the first medical facility in the country to try the experimental therapy .
The individual , who has been in good health for more than two weeks since being diagnosed with the deadly coronavirus , donated the blood plasma for what is known as the convalescent serum therapy at the Houston Methodist Hospital .
The concept dates back to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 .
" Convalescent serum therapy could be a vital treatment route because unfortunately there is relatively little to offer many patients except supportive care , and the ongoing clinical trials are going to take a while , " Dr Eric Salazar , a physician scientist with Methodist 's Research Institute , said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " Salazar said .
The treatment was fast-tracked to the bedside over the weekend as the death toll in the pandemic caused by the coronavirus soared to more than 2,000 people in the United States , including 34 in Texas .
Methodist on Friday began recruiting blood plasma donors from among 250 patients who have tested positive for the virus at the system 's hospitals .
Donors gave a quart of blood plasma in a procedure , much like donating whole blood .
Houston Methodist President and CEO Marc Boom said they felt obligated to try .
" There is so much to be learned about this disease while it 's occurring .
If an infusion of convalescent serum can help save the life of a critically ill patient , then applying the full resources of our blood bank , our expert faculty , and our academic medical centre is incredibly worthwhile and important to do , " he said in a statement .
Plasma from someone who has recovered from Covid-19 contains antibodies made by the immune system to attack the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient still fighting the virus may transfer the power of the antibodies into a healing , possibly life-saving therapy .
In addition to its use in 1918 , convalescent serum therapy was also tried during a diphtheria outbreak in the 1920s , a flesh-eating bacteria epidemic in the 1930s and other infectious disease outbreaks .
There are nearly 2,500 confirmed cases in Texas , including 810 in the Houston region .
Six people have died here and 47 have recovered .
A vaccine is in the works but will not be ready for the general population for at least a year and a half , and drugs are in clinical trials that might take eight to 10 months to produce convincing results .
Convalescent plasma therapy , if it works , could be a more immediate treatment with a relatively abundant supply source : to date , thousands of people have recovered .
