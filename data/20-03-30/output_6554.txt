As a result , Toyota began work on a hybrid adaptation it had initially investigated for fun in the mid- ' 60s .
I love old action movies , I adore Arnold Schwarzenegger , and I have patterned the aesthetics of my entire existence off of late ' 80s cyberpunk .
As a result , I re-re-re-watched Total Recall recently and paid attention to much more banal details than I had previously .
Specifically , these things .
Before I got my Aerodeck , I had a 1988 Toyota Supra Turbo with some door cards and a center console that had definitely seen better days .
I wanted to do something to freshen it up , but I unfortunately do n't know how to sew ( something I am now remedying during my time stuck at home ) .
