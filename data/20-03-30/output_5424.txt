YOUR SAY : Shut the north for our protection  Though Queensland has closed its borders in the south , regional areas are not as well covered .
Possibly illegal virus sufferers may try slipping across our exposed coastal borders seeking medical treatment for this stealthy sickness , without knowing what or how virulent it may be .
This will also bring investigative attention to the lack of medical facilities in outer areas to deal with this virus , and also others .
Australia is a surrounded by various groups which do not observe the same laws and regulations that are relevant here , which may offer them more immunity from the frequently occurring ailments noted in such places than perhaps we might .
The fact that this virus appeared to have been initially denied and suppressed is a source of global anger .
That delayed effect is having a violent upheaval in all forms of life in all countries and can not be ignored , with the final result yet to be reached .
Border closures and staying at home appear to be the best solutions advisable but for some that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have their " rights " , so are not bound by any restrictions .
Patricia Russell , Mackay  Fight of our lives  TIMES of crisis brings out the best and the worst of mankind .
During the past decade in Australia , we have seen devastation by natural disasters and at present , we are facing the coronavirus , which has spread globally and infiltrated into Australia .
It will take human lives and cripple the economy , with the annihilation or many industries and threatening the lives of the frail and elderly in its path .
Like none other than a war against humanity .
It is easy to condemn the leadership of the health ministers of any political party , or the premier of any state , or the prime minister .
Each one of us has an obligation to abide by the restrictions .
Everyone must follow the advice regarding the outbreak .
Everyone must play a part to control the spread from one person to another .
Life itself - young or old - is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by the breath we take but the " moments " that take our breath away .
birth of newborn ; sports award ; first home ownership .
We must rate health first above happiness before prosperity .
In this case , it is time now to place priority on the spread of COVID-19 .
Our greatest weapon is a truthful personal assessment and common sense to follow the guidelines set out for each of us to follow .
Bryan Scott , Andergrove  FIFO exemption  IT IS rare that I find myself in agreement with George Christensen MP but his suggestion that FIFO workers ' should find lodgings here ' is laudable .
While the rest of Australia is required to localise and minimise movement , it 's outrageous that workers from identified COVID-19 clusters are allowed to fly in to NQ towns and workers ' camps .
Anyone who has worked in the industry knows what mine workers ' accommodation is like - crowded canteens and rows and rows of closely packed dongas .
FIFO workers building the Carmichael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sense at all .
John Brinnand , Kiamba  COVID-19 import  REPORT of lack of control of airline passengers arriving at our international airports is pathetic and reprehensible .
Federal and State Governments and their administrations and agencies fail us totally .
The arrivals are the source of COVID 19 .
The Federal Government , the very best the world has seen lead by Scomo , solely focuses on creating slogans .
They have absolutely no understanding of how to govern , let alone any capacity to deliver .
But as our national consciousness of the need to adapt to our rapidly changing world falters , perhaps we have the government we deserve .
Massive developments in global communications and trade place us in a changed world .
We must be better prepared to deal with inevitable , impending pandemics .
To do this , we must participate more constructively in international affairs .
Our position and action on global warming is just one example of our current failings .

Ms Chris McMillan , CEO , Cancer Council Queensland  Mackay airport exit  THE exit from the airport needs to return to the signage which functioned for decades and gave a larger degree of safety than the present road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " junction sign represents East Boundary Road and the short arm represents Jack Connor Drive .
Place this " T " junction sign approximately 40 metres back from East Boundary Road on Airport land and a Give Way sign approximately 15 metres back from East Boundary Road on Airport land .
To allow these directional signs to function properly all the dangerous , confusing and laughable line markings would need to be painted over .
