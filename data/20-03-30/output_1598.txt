Chancellor Rishni Sunak unveiled a financial rescue package for the self-employed last week , which will give up to ? 2,500 per month in grants for at least three months .
It comes as millions of self-employed workers have struggled to cope financially amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown .
They have been hit by restrictions on travel , a cut in income from not being able to service customers and follow through with orders , and many report having work and jobs cancelled .
The help will prove invaluable for many , but while it has been broadly welcomed , there has also been criticism of gaps within it .
So , if you are self-employed can you get help ? We explain .
Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the scheme will be open to those with a trading profit of less than ? 50,000 in 2018-19 or an average trading profit of less than ? 50,000 from 2016-17 , 2017-18 and 2018-19 .
Announcing the support , Mr Sunak said : ' Self-employed people are a crucial part of the UK 's workforce who 've understandably been looking for reassurance and support during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-employed I 've outlined today is one of the most generous in the world that has been announced so far .
It targets support to those who need help most , offering the self-employed the same level of support as those in work .
' Together with support packages for businesses and for workers , I am confident we now have the measures in place to ensure we can get through this emergency together .
'  Share this article  HOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP  The package has largely been welcomed by several industry commentators , although there are gaps and people will have to wait until June for grants to kick in .
Emma Jones , founder of small business support network , Enterprise Nation said : ' This is a very generous package of support for the self-employed and I know our members will see it as an acknowledgement that the work they do is valued ' .
Emma Jones , founder of Enterprise Nation says the package for the self-employed is a generous one  The Association of Independent Professionals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic lifeline ' of financial support for the UK 's self-employed .
Derek Cribb , CEO of IPSE said : ' We welcome the fact that the government has heeded our calls and actively worked with IPSE in designing a historic lifeline of financial aid for the self-employed .
' This will offer essential support to the many hard-working self-employed people across the country who are losing projects and contracts because of the coronavirus outbreak .
' We understand this is an immense and complex undertaking and urge the government to get this vital support to freelancers as soon as practically possible .
' This is an unprecedented package and a very welcome response to our campaign for freelancers and the self-employed .
However , not all self-employed will qualify for this vital support and many will slip through the net .
Here we provide answers to key questions that several unemployed workers are asking following the announcement :  How do I qualify ?  The scheme is accessible to self-employed people with a trading profit of less than ? 50,000 in 2018-2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 50,000 from 2016 to 2019 .
To qualify more than half of a self-employed person 's income in these periods must come from self-employment .
Only those who are already in self-employment will qualify for the grant -- the Chancellor said this was to prevent fraudulent claims .
When will I get help ?  The grant will be paid in June in single lump sum instalments covering three months .
The HMRC will use the average trading profits from tax returns in 2016-2017 , 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 to determine the size of the grant .
I 've created a limited company and pay myself a salary ? Do I qualify ?  No .
In a statement , the Treasury said that those who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme .
We ca n't claim because we run a limited company  Matt Rann and his wife Annalise ( pictured here with their three children ) stated their jewellery business back in 2014 .
Even though they 've been operational for six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt Rann , 27 , and his wife , Annalise , 25 , from Portsmouth run Annalise Jewellery Ltd , which they stated back in 2014 .
He said that as it is a limited company and they are directors they will fall through the gaps of the rescue scheme .
' On paper we are employed by our own limited company and paid through a PAYE .
' Like many directors we pay ourselves the minimum salary and the rest is dividends .
' We 're told we ca n't furlough ourselves as we are directors , and we ca n't claim under self-employed as we 're not classified as such .
'  ' I think that the government have done a good job and done as much as they can but it 's almost like they have rushed a little bit .
' I think it leaves quite a big gap and a lot of people in the same situation as us .
'  What if I have n't made any profits ?  Unfortunately , you wo n't qualify for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are newly unemployed and that have n't filed any tax returns yet .
What happens if my profits came to ? 50,001 ?  Unfortunately , you will not qualify , as help only applies to those with profits less than ? 50,000 .
Anyone with trading profits over that amount wo n't get the grant .
The ? 50,000 cut-off is one of the strange elements of the scheme and will exclude many self-employed people who are not particularly wealthy and may be their families sole or main breadwinner .
Even if they are n't their income is often essential for household finances .
Self employed workers , from plumbers and electricians , to management consultants , photographers and freelance designers could end up being hit by this .
If they earn over ? 50,000 , they get no help at all .
What can I do if I ca n't get money from the self-employment scheme ?  Those in financial trouble could also apply for Universal Credit , which has been boosted by ? 7billion .
The self-employed working through their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they operate a PAYE scheme .
There are also business interruption loans available and there is other help on VAT and business rates that it may be possible to get .
I think I qualify but I need money NOW what can I do ?  Before grant payments are made , the self-employed will still be able to access other available government support if their income has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic including Universal Credit .
Business continuity loans can be accessed by those who have a business bank account .
I have n't filed a tax return yet so do n't qualify for self employed help  Julia Page , 50 , from Wales , became self-employed last May and works as a funeral and wedding celebrant .
She has n't filed any tax returns yet .
She said : ' From what I can make out there will be nothing for me .
Julie Page has just recently become a funeral and wedding celebrant and does n't qualify for the self employed grant  ' I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a funeral celebrant .
I am now wondering whether it was such a good idea .
Her business is likely to be cut further as the lockdown measures become more extreme .
She explains : ' Funerals have narrowed down to 10 people and it looks like in the next few weeks funerals I will have no mourners as the dead go straight to cremation .
' It looks like my income will be hit in the next few weeks .
A lot of celebrants are self-isolating but I ca n't as I need to work .
' So those who have not yet filed a tax return are not going to get helped at all .
I am hugely disappointed by that and distressed if that happens .
I am not entirely sure what I am going to do .
' I am going to have to keep trying to do funerals , going out there and working as long as I can .
I hope it wo n't be too long before everything goes back to normal .
'  What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fall into the 5 per cent that will lose out .
If you 're newly self-employed or have only just started your business and have n't filed any tax returns then you wo n't qualify for this particular grant .
Do I still have to pay my taxes ?  The Government has deferred income tax self-assessments for the self-employed until July and is deferring VAT until the next quarter .
Bills will still eventually have to be paid though .
We pay ourselves in dividends but we pay our tax - yet we get no help  Josh Memour , 29 , from Croydon in London says his family run business Eternity Home Finance , which he owns 50/50 with his dad , will not receive any support .
It was set up as a limited company and provides mortgage and protection advice .
He 's not covered by the Chancellor 's scheme that was announced last night as he is n't seen as self-employed .
Josh Memour ( pictured left ) part owns his family business Eternity Home Finance with his father  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can be the case .
We are clearly self-employed , we have none of the protections that come with being employed such as sick pay and holiday .
' We understand this risk , it is nothing new to us , but it feels like the government is making a direct attack on those like ourselves who run our business responsibly and in an entirely properly manner .
' We are made out to be tax dodgers , but how can this possibly be the case ? The dividends are paid from our profits , on which corporation tax is paid , and they are then subsequently subjected to income tax .
'  What 's the catch ?  The self-employed can expect that the government will go full throttle on IR35 tax changes , potentially raise national insurance and cut back further on self-employed tax breaks .
Emma Jones says : ' It comes with a warning shot that this will give the government a very good reason to change employment law and implement IR35 and other tax measures with renewed vigour as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated in the same way as employees .
If this applies to tax , there will be more changes ahead for the self-employed down the line .
'  I 've been reinvesting my profits , so I wo n't get help  Ruth Mary Chipperfield owns her owns her own jewellery company but she reinvested all her profits into the business  Ruth Mary Chipperfield , 30 , from Birmingham owns Ruth Mary Jewellery and has done so for three years .
But because she reinvests her profits she does n't believe she qualifies for the self-help scheme .
She said : ' Right from the start I chose to reinvest all my profits because I pay for gold so I am forking out quite a bit .
I have zero profit as far as my tax returns are concerned .
' I had ? 20,000 of leads coming in that have all dried up .
They may still go ahead after all this but the problem is that my clients ' own finances are drying up too .
' I was n't surprised about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get anything .
It makes things tricky , but I 'd rather think positively .
