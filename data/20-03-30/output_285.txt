Government must reverse ban on community newspapers quickly  The Government 's decision to close down all community and weekly papers must be reversed .
The decision that only paid daily newspapers can continue to publish during the lockdown is wrong .
It means that many New Zealanders will now be without the news they have come to depend upon and now need during the lockdown .
Compliance assured  The New Zealand Independent Community Newspapers Association represents more than 80 independent publications around the country .
Their President David Mackenzie has assured me his members fully accept and respect the Covid-19 social distancing and health and safety protocols .
Therefor , they should be allowed to continue publishing .
These businesses have invested heavily in making changes to the way they operate .
A majority of them are small publishers whose staff are now working safely and completely remotely .
Important platform  Many of our most vulnerable citizens rely heavily upon community newspapers for social interaction and access to news .
This is particularly true in our smaller communities , rural areas and within New Zealand 's ethnic communities .

Many elderly do not have easy access to internet or social media and are often not subscribed to or buy daily papers .
People should not be forced to pay for their news because of Government restriction .
While these are unprecedented times , media outlets should not be closed arbitrarily -- free speech is a pillar to a functioning democracy .
I call on the Government to revisit this decision and allow independent community newspapers that meet the requirements of social distancing and Covid-19 health and safety protocols to be allowed to continue publishing the news .
