Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying inside for almost eight weeks , Lisa Haydon , who is in Honk Kong , posted a video of her surfing and wrote a lengthy post with it .
It read , " Having a new born baby in a corona virus world had me very busy with a bottle of sanitizer .
thus have n't been posting that much lately .
But here is a video of me finally not staying inside after 8weeks .
Most of the world seems to be in self quarantine at the moment .
However , here in Hong Kong things are just about beginning to feel back to normal .
The way the ppl here in Hk handled this virus from the get go was commendable .
A very militant approach to wearing masks , social distancing , SANITIZER etc .
But , What I 've learned in these passed months is - it does n't take a lot , or cost a lot to be happy .
We 've had the pleasure of some quality family time , lots of home baking and cooking , mountain walks on Occassion , catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each other .
It 's been a break from the craziness of life and it 's many professional and social obligations .
A time to rest , and recoup .
in fact I wish I would learn to take breaks like this without it being enforced in this unfortunate way .
It also got me thinking .
Last year a lot of what I read in the news was about Brexit , US China trade war , Harry and Meghan leaving the royal family , and then experiencing the protests in Hong Kong .
But , all of that seems much less talked about in the face of a global health crisis .
Without good health it seems there is little place for any other perspective .
In all of this I pray we find the peace and patience to ride this out and hopefully be better for it .
In the meantime , here is some extremely rusty clumsy post natal surfing for a lol .
