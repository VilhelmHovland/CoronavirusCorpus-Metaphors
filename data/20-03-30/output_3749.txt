Speaking about the effect the pandemic is having on the lower reaches of the professional game in England , Martin said : " It 's hugely impacted us .
Everyone at the club has been furloughed , so none of the staff are now working .
Staff have taken wage cuts because of no business and no football .
" Daily contact with the players is difficult , so it 's affected everything .
People often say that out of all the things that are n't important , football is the most important one .
" I think it means so much to a lot of people and they really identify with their football club and it 's their release .
At the moment , nobody has that .
" For the people involved in football , the lack of routine , the lack of structure and the lack of controlled training is proving difficult for the players .
Obviously there 's lots of people who are worse off , but it goes to show how it 's affecting everyone .
"  Martin is aware that football pales into insignificance during this period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus .
" It 's completely surreal and completely different from anything I 've ever experienced .
It 's extremely humbling .
It makes you appreciate and realise what you have and what you miss , " Martin told BT Sport .
" I think it 's really difficult looking at the news but it 's helping people get a little bit of perspective of what 's really important .
? " The clap for the NHS was really emotional .
Everyone I spoke to about it or connected with on FaceTime or over the phone , everyone feels the same way , they 're coming together to get through this .
