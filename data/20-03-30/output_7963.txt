MOUNT VERNON -- Knox Community Hospital providers are making it easier to stay at home and see your doctor , the hospital has announced in a press release .
Many KCH providers have begun offering telemedicine options for their patients .
Telemedicine is a scheduled medical consultation , over the phone or other teleconferencing service , between a patient and a physician or other provider .
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to require social distancing and limit unnecessary travel and gathering , this new telemedicine option is an excellent way to receive professional and personal healthcare without the risk of leaving one 's home .
The first telemedicine visits were rolled out last week as just one small part of the KCH response efforts to COVID-19 .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep our patients and community safe while also recognizing that many people still need access to their provider for routine check-ups , prescriptions , and consultations about their health , " said Jeffrey Scott , Director of Marketing and Development at KCH .
" We understand that our community still has health needs , apart from COVID-19 , and telemedicine offers the opportunity to meet those needs safely for our patients .
"  KCH provider offices have begun contacting some patients and offering this telemedicine option for certain types of visits .
Patients can also schedule a telemedicine appointment , and should not neglect their own health needs nor assume that KCH providers are unavailable .
Patients who may be interested in a telehealth visit should contact their provider office to find out if it is being offered at that location and to get more details .
Patients should consider telemedicine for routine visits , follow-up appointments , or for minor illnesses .
Telemedicine is not for urgent or life-threatening situations ; those patients should call 911 or go the Emergency Department .
