Lynch and Sons has funeral homes in multiple locations around Metro Detroit .
Employees said right now , their job is divided into two categories : people who died from COVID-19 and people who did n't .
Those who died from COVID-19 have to be handled very differently , workers said .
" When you 're dealing with an airborne virus that can be found in the air particles surrounding a dead human being that may be expelled .
this can jog those particles from those orifices , " said Patrick Lynch , of Lynch and Sons .
" We have to be conscious of that .
They are in our cars and preparation facilities .
"  Lynch is a former state and national president of the Funeral Directors Association .
He said the profession has had to change just to keep funeral workers safe during the pandemic .
" What 's commonly referred to as a disaster pouch -- those bags are being encouraged to use to transfer the body , rather than our transfer cot or quilt or something akin to that , " Lynch said .
" We have to gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory for anyone working in and around the funeral home .
"  Workers are often uncomfortable handling the bio-hazard of someone who died from COVID-19 because so much is still unknown about the virus .
" This is all very brand new , " Lynch said .
To add to the grieving process , families have to do their part .
Think about immediate burial and planning a celebration of life months from now , experts said .
Ask funeral directors if they can do live streams of funeral services .
But question No .
1 should be if they are comfortable and equipped to handle someone who died from COVID-19 , knowing they might have to ask for a referral .
