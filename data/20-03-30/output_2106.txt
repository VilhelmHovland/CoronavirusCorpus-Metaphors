By Rodrigo Campos and Koh Gui Qing  NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks across the globe fell on Friday after a historic three-day run-up , as skittish investors kept indices on track for their worst monthly and quarterly performances since 2008 , while the dollar fell by the most in any week since 2009 .
Shares on Wall Street ended near Friday 's lows and the dollar fell further after the U .
House of Representatives , as expected , approved a $2 .
trillion stimulus package , the largest in U .
history .
After the markets closed , President Donald Trump signed the bill into law .
The dollar 's slump was seen partly as a sign that central bankers have been successful in easing stress in the money markets .
Market volatility is expected to persist as the coronavirus pandemic that triggered closures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States surpassed two grim milestones as virus-related deaths soared past 1,200 and it became the world leader in confirmed cases .
Worldwide , confirmed cases rose above 551,000 with nearly 25,000 deaths .
The stimulus " is not necessarily enough to make people say , ' I 've got to run out and buy stocks , ' " said Rick Meckler , a partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Jersey .
" That 's going to take more time .
"  Uncertainty over the overall human and economic toll was reflected in financial markets .
MSCI 's gauge of global stocks rallied by the most in any week since December 2008 , but is also poised for its largest month- and quarter- drops since 2008 , during the height of the financial crisis .
Nervous investors supported demand for gold , whose prices jumped by the most in any week since 2008 despite a Friday decline .
The coronavirus infection rate is driving much of the market at a time of great uncertainty , said Yousef Abbasi , global market strategist at INTL FCStone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang-up here is when the curve does start to flatten , that does n't mean we can return to normal human and economic behavior , " he said .
" If we do return to normal human and economic behavior , we risk the chance the curve goes parabolic again .
Just from the perspective of how long this potentially can last , there 's still a great deal of uncertainty .
"  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 915 .
points , or 4 .
, to 21,636 .
, the S&amp;P 500 lost 88 .
points , or 3 .
, to 2,541 .

points , or 3 .
, to 7,502 .

, and MSCI 's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2 .
Emerging market stocks lost 1 .
Stock markets have rallied over the past week on trillions of dollars of economic stimulus enacted or pledged by policymakers worldwide , from central banks to governments .
More may be needed as the virus slams the brakes on economic activity and increases healthcare spending .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the spread of COVID-19 - whether European cases are reaching a peak , how much of the U .
will be put in lockdown , and whether China can avoid a second wave , " said Ga ? tan Peroux , strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management .
The $2 .
trillion stimulus package signed by Trump will flood the world 's largest economy with money to stem the economic damage from the pandemic .
