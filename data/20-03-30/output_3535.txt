Robert Kritzman said many entities that support the cruise industry may be provided a lifeline by the CARES Act  How the CARES Act helps preserve the industry beyond the cruise lines  Robert Kritzman Mar 30 , 2020  Robert Kritzman is a corporate and transactional lawyer who has represented cruise lines and related businesses both in private practice and as a general counsel for more than 25 years .
He provided this expert analysis exclusively to Seatrade Cruise News .
On March 27 Congress passed , and President Trump signed , legislation known as the Coronavirus Aid , Relief and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act .
The cruise lines themselves may not benefit from this legislation and have accessed capital through other means .
However , the many organizations that form the distribution network for cruises , service the ships ; provide fuel , maintenance , food and other supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour operators and numerous others may be provided a lifeline by CARES .
Small business assistance  Paycheck protection .
The CARES Act establishes the Paycheck Protection Program , an expansion of the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) 7(a) loan program and appropriates $349 billion for the program .
The Act establishes the program 's eligibility to include companies with no more than 500 employees .
Both full- and part-time employees are counted .
For companies that fall into the North American Industry Classification System for accommodations and food service ( e .
, hotels , restaurants ) , the 500-employee maximum helpfully applies to each location .
Since many of the businesses that service the cruise industry are international organizations , it is important to point out that in some cases , a business owned/managed by a non-U .
citizen , foreign business entities or non-immigrant aliens can be eligible for SBA financing .
Eligibility for these entities will be determined on a case-by-case basis .
The maximum loan amount is the lesser of ( i ) $10,000,000 or ( ii ) the average monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the amount of any pre-existing SBA loan to be refinanced .
The loan proceeds may only be used for payroll , employer group health , interest on mortgage obligations , rent , utilities and interest on other debt incurred before Feb .
15 , 2020 .
The interest rate for the loans is set at four percent .
Collateral and personal guarantee requirements are waived .
Repayment is deferred for at least six months , and up to one year , based on guidance to be issued by the SBA within 30 days after the date of enactment of the CARES Act .
Loans made are nonrecourse .
The loans are actually provided by SBA participating banks and financial institutions on an expedited basis .
Most banks currently provide SBA loans .
Borrowers are eligible to have loan amounts forgiven to the extent the proceeds are used to pay for payroll expenses , interest on covered mortgage obligations , covered rent obligations , and utilities , during the period ending June 30 , 2020 .
The loan forgiveness , which would typically be included as income for tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forgiveness provision of this program , there is little reason for an eligible business not to take advantage of this benefit for itself and its employees .
Emergency economic injury disaster loans and grants .
The Act provides for Emergency Economic Injury Disaster Loans ( EIDL ) and grants for eligible entities for a covered period from January 31 , 2020 , to December 31 , 2020 .
Eligible entities are similar to those under the Paycheck Protection Program .
The applicants do not have to show that they can not obtain credit elsewhere .
The loan may be approved based solely on the credit score of the applicant ( no tax returns required ) , or SBA may use alternative methods .
Emergency grants .
Any eligible entity that applies for an EIDL can apply for a grant in an amount as requested by the applicant , but not to exceed $10,000 .
Grants are to be paid within three days after the SBA receives the EIDL application .
These grants can be used for any allowable purpose , including payroll , paid sick leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations that can not be met .
The grant does not have to be repaid even if the EIDL is denied .
Subsidies for certain loan payments .
The SBA will pay the principal , interest and any associated fees that are owed on certain existing loans ( SBA loans , loans from state and local development companies , and microloans ) for a six-month period starting on the next payment due ( taking into account any deferment ) .
Large businesses  Title IV of the CARES Act provides $500 billion in emergency funding to the U .
Department of Treasury 's Exchange Stabilization Fund to provide economic relief in the form of loans , loan guarantees , and other investments in businesses , states and municipalities impacted by coronavirus .
Airlines and national security .
The government has committed $29 billion for direct loans or loan guarantees to the airline industry and $17 billion for businesses deemed critical to national security .
We will briefly summarize these provisions since they do not relate to most businesses in the cruise industry .
Businesses eligible for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus crisis .
To be eligible for the funding , other forms of alternate financing must not be reasonably available to the business .
The Federal Reserve Bank will price assistance on a risk-adjusted basis and , if possible , at interest rates and terms based on market conditions for comparable obligations before the coronavirus outbreak .
Borrowers and their affiliates can not engage in stock buybacks , unless required under pre-existing contracts , or pay dividends , until one year after the date the loan or loan guarantee is no longer outstanding .
The Treasury Department will publish procedures for submitting applications and minimum requirements within 10 days of the date of the enactment of the CARES Act .
Other business and local government support .
The remaining $454 billion is available to support relief to all other eligible businesses , states and municipalities in the form of interest-bearing loans , loan guarantees and other investments , including equity investments in programs and facilities established by the Federal Reserve Bank .
Borrowers with direct loans under these facilities can not , absent a waiver , engage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay dividends , until one year after the date the loan is no longer outstanding .
The restrictions on compensation outlined above applicable to airline carriers and national security businesses likewise apply .
All applicable requirements under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act apply to these programs and facilities .
This includes a requirement that any borrower be solvent ( i .
, not in bankruptcy , resolution under title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act , or any other federal or state insolvency proceeding ) .
Medium-sized businesses  The CARES Act also provides for the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to work together to implement a special Section 13(3) Federal Reserve facility that provides financing to banks and other lenders that make direct loans to nonprofits and mid-sized businesses ( 500 to 10,000 employees ) .
Eligible borrowers applying for direct loans under this program will be required to certify , among other things , that the uncertainty of economic conditions makes the loan request necessary to support ongoing operations and the funds received will be used to retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with full compensation and benefits , through September 30 , 2020 , and the recipient intends to restore not less than 90 percent of its February 1 , 2020 workforce with full compensation and benefits no later than four months after the end of the coronavirus public health emergency .
The recipient must also agree it will not pay dividends or conduct stock buybacks while the loan is outstanding , except for pre-existing obligations , and the recipient will not outsource or offshore jobs for the term of the loan plus an additional two years .
To be eligible the recipient must be created/organized and domiciled in the U .
with significant operations and a majority of employees located/based in the U .
The recipient must not be a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding and must agree it will not abrogate existing collective bargaining agreements for the term of the loan plus an additional two years ; and the recipient will remain neutral in any union organizing effort for the term of the loan .
Businesses will need to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of receiving assistance given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of these large company programs for the Department of Treasury to determine in regulations .
Those regulations are required to be issued within 10 days and will provide greater insight into the implementation and terms of these loans .
Conclusion  The CARES Act also includes various tax benefits for individuals and businesses that are not addressed in this article .
The small business program in the CARES Act is much more favorable than those for larger businesses , an established system of banks that make SBA loans already exists and far fewer conditions/strings are attached to those benefits .
We will not understand the program for larger businesses well until the Treasury Department issues the implementing regulations .
In addition to these government programs , businesses should be speaking to their creditors to defer principal payments on loans , drawing down on or obtaining additional credit facilities , if possible , and otherwise conserving cash .
Many companies are dealing with and considering the implications of force majeure provisions in their various contracts .
Now that many have moved to remote workforces , businesses will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage and hour laws and other employment laws will impact remote workforces .
We all know that before long we will be addressing how to safely begin bringing employees back to work .
The industry bounced back from 9/11 and the great recession and will bounce back from this crisis , though it may take longer than some industries due to negative perceptions created early in this crisis .
In the meantime , the U .
government has provided some valuable assistance to certain companies and those who are adaptable and prepared will be better positioned when that recovery comes .
