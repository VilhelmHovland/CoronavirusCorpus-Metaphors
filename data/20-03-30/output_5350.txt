What do WhatsApp , Dropbox and Kickstarter have in common ? Why times of crisis breed invention  In the middle of the global financial crisis , a young Ukranian immigrant named Jan found himself out of work in California .
Many people at that time did .
It was , after all , a crisis .
Jan had grown up in a small village in Ukraine in a house with no hot water .
His mother was a housewife and his father a construction worker .
By the time the global financial crisis hit , he had become an orphan .
His father never made it across to the US in the midst of severe political turmoil in Ukraine , and his mother died of cancer .
And then , the global financial crisis hit and the world went into freefall .
Well , most of it did .
But we 'll get to that shortly .
In the early months of 2009 , in the midst of what economists considered to be the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression , Jan started a company .
In October of that year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company .
Two years later Sequoia invested $8 million , and then a further $50 million in 2013 .
By 2015 , the company owned the world 's most popular messaging application , and by February of this year , it had over two billion users worldwide .
The company , WhatsApp , was ultimately acquired by Facebook for $19 billion .
( Ironically , Jan had previously applied for a job at Facebook and was rejected .
)  There are many learnings from this story , but there are three core ones .
A good idea is a good idea , no matter the climate .
Entrepreneur grit and tenacity make things happen , even in a crisis .
When the right crowd supports a project , anything is possible .
So while most of the world was in freefall , an entrepreneur and those who backed him were getting on with business .
This is not an isolated example .
In fact , some of the world 's most valuable companies today were founded during the global financial crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kickstarter , Stripe , LendingClub , AngelList , and venture capital firm Andreessen Horwitz .
That was also the period when collaborative consumption took off and the now ubiquitous businesses that make up the sharing economy were born .
You know the saying ' a crisis brings out the best and the worst in people ' ?  That 's true , of course , but it 's not completely accurate .
It generally does n't bring out the best and the worst in the same type of person .
There are some people who will tend toward negativity , always .
Uncertainty sends them into a tailspin , causes them to panic and default to blame mode .
They 're the ones saying things like ' the government should be doing more ! ' while secretly stockpiling toilet paper .
But if you want humanity 's inspiring best-in-a-crisis , go and find an entrepreneur .
Good entrepreneurs thrive in crises and uncertainty .
They revel in the depths of the most complex global challenges .
Creativity is in their DNA .
It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social noise and meaningless political bullshit , good entrepreneurs have the unique capacity for silent clarity and unwavering determination .
In fact -- stay with me now -- this is exactly when entrepreneurs do their best work .
And so to COVID19 .
It 's a crisis , of course .
There is no certainty about when a treatment will be available or what the financial impact of the border closures and social isolation policies may be .
In the meantime , the way we do many everyday things will have to change and those changes will require new and creative solutions .
We will need new approaches to the delivery of health and education services , new manufacturing processes for basic items , new supply chain and logistic solutions , new remote-working and collaboration tools , and a treatment for the friggin ' thing .
Complex , global challenges .
So , here 's my prediction .
As most of the world goes into freefall over the coming months , global entrepreneurship will shift into overdrive as those who are wired to solve complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver solutions that create positive change .
As a result , we will see more purpose-driven businesses emerging in particular sectors .
Those will be the sectors that directly address immediate concerns of consumers , including in foodtech , healthtech , medtech and edtech ( among others ) .
Future-focused investors will back those opportunities , as they always have , and the base of people rallying behind these worthwhile projects will expand to include everyday investors via equity crowdfunding .
This will be particularly helpful for B2C companies , allowing them to raise capital and engage their consumers simultaneously .
Forced isolation will require new operating behaviours , and at the end of this period , productivity will be higher , driven by the technologies that have enabled these new behaviours .
Years from now , many of those new technologies will have become ubiquitous , just as many of those that emerged during the GFC have become .
Individuals , forced to be socially distant , will form new online communities to follow and support those that truly lead them toward a shared vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's biggest problems .
The Kardashians do n't matter in this environment , purpose does .
Each of us has a role to play in this unfolding story .
So when this period passes , and it will , you will have been either ( a ) part of the problem , or ( b ) part of the solution .
There is no third option .
Think about that for a moment and ask yourself , what story do you want to tell ?  I do n't know about you , but I 've decided , and I welcome you to join me .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses .
So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ? .
