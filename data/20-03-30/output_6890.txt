ARCREVO Japan 2020 , ARCREVO Korea 2020 , all DAREDEVIL events , and the Arc World Tour 2020 Finals have been canceled entirely , though ARCREVO Japan and the Arc World Tour 2020 Finals may be held as independent events later in the year .
" The health of our competitors , staff members and community members is our top priority , " AWS said .
" This decision also comes at the face of increased difficulty in facilitating a fair competition throughout the tour .
We regret to inform those who have been eagerly anticipating this tour of its cancellation .
We thank you for your understanding .
"  While AWS is the only developer to cancel its World Tour events , Capcom , Bandai Namco , and others very well may follow suit .
Arc System Works said it 's planning to take into account the state of global conditions when planning the 2021 World Tour , although the plan right now is probably to prepare like things will be ready to go at a normal pace next season .
