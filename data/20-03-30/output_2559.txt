Nathan Taylor/OrilliaMatters file photo  The local business community is cautiously optimistic after a virtual meeting with area politicians and health-care officials on Friday .
The Orillia District Chamber of Commerce hosted a video conference on Zoom , which included special guests Mayor Steve Clarke , Simcoe North MPP Jill Dunlop , Simcoe North MP Bruce Stanton and Orillia Soldiers ' Memorial Hospital president and CEO Carmine Stumpo .
Each provided an update on the COVID-19 situation , and politicians explained what supports were available from their respective levels of government .
It was a lesson in how quickly the situation is changing .
Stanton noted the federal government was offering a 10 per cent wage subsidy for businesses .
Not long after the conference , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that figure would rise to 75 per cent .
" Initially , it sounds great , " said chamber president Nathan Brown .
" How it 's implemented is the big thing .
"  Brown is curious to learn more details about the feds ' plans to help small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be released Monday .
He is wondering if it will mean some laid-off employees will be going back to work .
" Are we just putting more people at risk ? I 'm not sure it 's the safest thing to do , " he said .
He is also looking forward to learning whether businesses will be able to defer principal payments .
Currently , only the interest can be deferred .
Stanton told the more than 100 people taking part in the conference about some of the measures Ottawa is taking to assist people and businesses during the pandemic , including extending the tax-filing deadline to June 1 , with no payments due until the end of August .
Stanton noted the fluidity of the situation and said he expects there will be more changes to supports that have already been announced .
That 's a positive sign for business owners who were told at first to take out loans to weather the storm -- not an ideal option for many , Brown said .
" Initially , the response seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brown said .
Dunlop told the conference the province has a plan to double the employer health tax exemption in 2020 , which amounts to about $355 million in tax cuts for businesses .
The government 's plan also includes allowing employers to defer WSIB premiums for up to six months and lowering hydro rates .
Clarke explained some of the measures the city has taken since declaring a state of emergency .
They include a $100,000 emergency fund for " critical lead service providers on an as-needed basis " and the waiving of tax , water and sewer penalties until the end of June .
Asked what steps he 'd like to see governments take next to support businesses , Brown was n't sure , again referencing the rapidly changing nature of the situation .
" We need to put health and well-being first and then we have the business side to get to after that , " he said .
" I do n't know that we can say what we need going forward at this point .
