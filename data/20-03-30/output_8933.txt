Like many other states , California has deemed the cannabis industry an " essential " business that can remain operational during the state 's stay at home order aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19 .
For Graham Farrar , the founder and CEO of Glass House Farms , a vertically integrated cannabis operator based in Santa Barbara , Calif .
, this means cannabis businesses must step up to help those in need during this difficult and uncertain time .
" This is a time when we need everybody , " he told Cannabis Business Times .
" If you 've got a shovel , you need to get digging .
"  The way Farrar sees it , the industry gets to be the light in an otherwise bleak time , and this is a great opportunity for cannabis businesses to shatter old stereotypes and stigmas while giving back .
" Sometimes you need help -- and there have been a lot of people who have helped us along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helper , " he said .
" We 're happy to return the favor to society and show how we can help out .
"  Glass House Farms recently donated 1,000 lab gowns to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital , which needed masks , gowns and other personal protective equipment .
Glass House Farms operates 500,000 square feet of pesticide-free greenhouse space , so the company has a large inventory of gowns that are used as part of the company 's strict biosecurity protocols .
" We use protective gear on our employees , so we do n't inadvertently spread pests throughout the greenhouse , and that approach is basically the same thing doctors do as they go from patient to patient , " Farrar said .
Glass House Farms ' philanthropic efforts do n't end there .
The company 's dispensary , The Farmacy , is donating 5% of its sales to the local food bank , which is facing increased demand due to school closures , Farrar said .
With schools closed due to the COVID-19 outbreak , the food bank is providing meals to children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , Glass House Farms has partnered with CARP Growers , a local cannabis farmers industry group that Farrar presides over , to commit a $200,000 donation to support the food bank and the Boys and Girls Club .
The Glass House Farms team has also launched a Keep the Lights On program to help support the local restaurants in Santa Barbara that have been forced to reduce operations due to the pandemic .
" We 're a very tourist and hospitality town , and with every restaurant and bar closed , that 's probably 80% of our economy , " Farrar said .
To help keep the hospitality industry afloat , The Farmacy is buying its employees ' lunches from local restaurants through take-out orders .
In addition , all the cannabis farms in the area , which Farrar said represent about 1,000 total employees , are ordering take-out lunches for their employees , as well .
" They 've cut down to take-out only , so we 're going to try to step in and be their biggest take-out customers that they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them keep on keeping on throughout all of this , " Farrar said .
And while it works to help the broader community , Glass House Farms has not forgotten the safety of its customers and employees .
The cultivation facility is currently operating in compliance with all CDC guidelines , including social distancing of at least 6 feet .
Employees are working in shifts to limit the number of people working and taking lunch breaks at any given time , and anyone who is sick has been asked to stay home .
Handwashing and hand sanitizer stations are located throughout the cultivation facility , Farrar added , and at the end of each day , all surfaces are cleaned with a disinfectant .
Glass House Farms is also using a thermal camera to monitor the temperatures of employees in the cultivation facility .
" With the thermal camera , anyone over 99 degrees is being pulled out for a specific temperature check , so we 're keeping fevers and illness out of the scenario , " Farrar said .
At The Farmacy , budtenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispensary , but the company has since implemented express pickup and delivery only .
" The process now is basically you place an order online , we 'll drop it off on your doorstep , or you can come to the store to pay and we 'll give you a ready-to-go package , " Farrar said .
Budtenders are also available in The Farmacy 's parking lot with tablets , so customers can walk up and place orders without even entering the dispensary .
" We 're making quite a few adjustments , but keeping things going , " Farrar said .
The company has seen an uptick in sales , he added , and many customers have expressed gratitude that the business is operational during this time .
" I think it keeps the staff going , " Farrar said .
" It keeps the morale high when people say , ' Thank you so much for being open .
We 're so glad you 're here .
' "  So far , Glass House Farms has maintained a stable supply chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect its staff and customers while providing aid to the local community .
" We are working with the hospital to help them source things like masks , " Farrar said .
" We 've got some pretty good connections in China in terms of packaging , so we 're working with those suppliers to identify additional equipment for the hospital .
Then , on our supply side , we stocked up pretty heavily , anticipating any potential disruption there .
We diversified outside of China and other countries , as well , just trying to be as smart as we can to insulate ourselves for what 's to come .
" We 're one of the few businesses that have the horsepower to not just stay afloat but help out , and we want to do everything we can to put that to work and make the world proud and be contributing members of our community and help everyone else out .
