STRASBOURG , France -- The eastern French border city of Mulhouse was fought over by France and Germany across two centuries , but the horrors of the new coronavirus cluster tearing through this community of 110,000 is inspiring unusual solidarity .
While many countries have shut their borders to stem the march of the pandemic -- even some nations within the borderless European Union are instituting ID checks -- three German states have opened their hospitals to patients from eastern France .
Hospitals in bordering Switzerland have done the same .
The Grand Est region is now the epicenter of the outbreak in France , which has buried the third most virus victims in Europe , after Italy and Spain .
The crisis there can be traced largely to a dayslong evangelical church gathering in Mulhouse attended by hundreds of people at the end of February .
In a sign of the devastating toll , the local newspaper in Mulhouse has had to add extra obituary pages as the deaths from the coronavirus increase -- as has been done in some areas of Italy .
In France , only the area around Paris had confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital region has a population more than twice the size .
" Every day we have eight to 12 people who arrive .
We do n't know what to do , " said Dr .
Patrick Vogt , a general practitioner at the hospital in Mulhouse who recalled a shift just two weeks ago answering the city 's emergency hotline when call after call came in for respiratory problems .
In Germany , the states of Saarland , Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg have offered spare hospitals beds to treat French patients .
The spokesman of Baden-Wuerttemberg state 's health ministry said the state would " naturally try to help our French neighbours , " and authorities have asked all hospitals with free capacity to take in French patients requiring ventilators .
While Germany has many more confirmed virus cases than France , it has a much smaller number of deaths : 123 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University , compared to France 's 860 .
Today 's scenes in and around Mulhouse are sadly reminiscent of the bloodiest moments in the border region 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 19th-century Franco-Prussian war and a site of intense battles during the 20th century 's two world wars , which included bitter territorial disputes over the Alsace region , now part of what 's called the Grand Est .
The city was the site of France 's World War I opening attack against Germany in 1914 's Battle of Mulhouse , while bloody battles and burning villages tore it apart again during World War II as German and U .
forces fought each other .
Regional health officials say that Grand Est is approximately one week ahead of the rest of France in terms of infection rates : As of Monday , according to French government data , the region had recorded nearly 4,300 cases in an area with around 5 .
million people .
In contrast , the area around France 's capital of Paris , home to more than 12 million , had around 6,200 confirmed virus infections .
The analysis serves as a deadly warning for France , a nation of 67 million that has already seen a dramatic lockdown , that the worst could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help offered from abroad , Mulhouse has drawn the focus of French President Emmanuel Macron , who ordered a field hospital to be built to help tend to the sick .
Around 50 soldiers have been putting up the structure that will have equipment usually used to make surgery possible in combat zones retrofitted to treat patients with the coronavirus .
Authorities hope the five tents , each with six beds , could receive patients starting Monday .
About 100 military health personnel -- anesthetists , nurses and nursing assistants -- will be available to operate the field hospital .
In an unprecedented move during peacetime , the French army has also started evacuating critical coronavirus patients from the country 's east .
On Saturday , there was a new military airlift of patients hospitalized in Mulhouse .
The first one took place last week .
" The epidemic is in full swing .
The virus continues to spread .
The patients keeping coming in serious condition , " said Vogt , the doctor in Mulhouse .
" So far , there are no signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
