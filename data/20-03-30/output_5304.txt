Imagine it 's early 2021 .
The coronavirus pandemic ended months ago and life looks much like it did before any of us ever heard of social distancing .
And yet , when you reach out to shake a colleague 's hand at a business meeting , you get awkward hesitation and a suggested elbow bump .
The longer the coronavirus pandemic lasts , the more likely it is to change almost everything about the world as we know it -- including how we interact with other humans -- for many months , or even years .
" Handshaking may already be a thing of the past , " says Pamela Paresky , an author and visiting social sciences lecturer at the University of Chicago .
CNET Coronavirus Update  Keep track of the coronavirus pandemic .
Just as my 90-year-old grandmother and many of her Great Depression-era peers still fastidiously count pennies , the " COVID generation , " as it could end up being called , may remain nervous about greeting acquaintances with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
By late March , over a third of the world 's population -- nearly 3 billion people -- were under coronavirus lockdown , including nearly half the US population .
It 's uncertain how long the current dystopia of shutdowns and social distancing will continue ; estimates range from a few more weeks to 18 months .
But experts agree that the longer it goes on , the more likely the adaptations we 've made will stick .
If the lockdowns last less than six months , the only long-term changes in social behavior might involve increased hygiene , says Texas A&amp;M sociologist and former American Sociological Association President Joe Feagin .
" If it lasts 18 months or more , as the more pessimistic forecasts suggest .
more substantial changes are likely in both social distancing , social interaction and hygiene , " he says .
Hands are for sanitizing , not shaking  The longer we remain in a high state of vigilance against the coronavirus and COVID-19 , the respiratory disease caused by the virus , the longer we 'll fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Concerns about sanitizing surfaces might become more prevalent , " Paresky of the University of Chicago says .
She thinks the kind of " extreme physical distancing and isolation " that requires us to work and learn from home while only leaving for essentials is n't sustainable .
" There is a reason babies suffer both physically and mentally when they do not experience enough physical contact , " Paresky says .
" Human beings need physical touch , in-person social contact and interpersonal intimacy .
These things are necessary for our ongoing emotional and physical well-being .
"  It 's essential that children and adults maintain some kind of contact with peers while social distancing , she says , whether through video chats , virtual dinner parties or just phone calls and texts .
( Technology can also help you maintain your more intimate relationships .
)  Paresky is especially worried about the impact on college-age students who were just getting their first taste of independence , only to be sent back home into a family setting that could be filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may never go back to school .
This will have severe implications for their career and financial prospects , " she says .
Just as some students may never return to a campus , perhaps opting to finish up their studies online or not at all , millions of us currently working from home may scarcely set foot in an office again .
Dingwall sees a sustained increase in home-based working beyond the end of the pandemic .
" Our media are discovering that people do n't have to be able to come to studios in London , provided they have fast broadband and a decent quality webcam .
However , I think there will also be losses from the conversations around the watercooler that are often the wellsprings of business innovation .
"  Not all bad news  The social scientists I spoke to painted a vision of a world where increased suspicion , isolation and distance from others become the new normal , perhaps for years to come .
But Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks , a member of the UK Parliament , sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are going to come through this with young people and every single individual who lives through it feeling a much stronger sense of identification with others ; a much stronger commitment to helping others who need help , " he told the BBC .
Sacks believes the experience of living through a global pandemic and the radical measures taken to arrest its spread could lessen the expansion of highly globalized systems in favor of more local self-reliance .
He also thinks it will change how we think about major issues like health care and the environment , which is already breathing a little easier as humans withdraw to the indoors .
" I do n't think anyone who thinks hard about how one tiny microscopic virus has brought the whole of humanity to its knees can be indifferent to nature anymore , " Sacks says .
" So this is going to make us more sensitive to issues like climate change .
"  Of course , when it 's all over , most of us will certainly be happy to get back to the way things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screens more than ever before , we may emerge from our 21st century caves desperate for the kind of actual face time that does n't require Apple 's operating system .
Turkle says face-to-face conversation is important for developing empathy .
She thinks that when we finally begin to meet up in real life again , it might be a fearful experience at first until we become sure it 's safe .
" But when we get over that , I believe we will have a new appreciation of presence , " she says .
" Something far deeper than we had before .
