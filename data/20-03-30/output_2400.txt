As the devastation by the coronavirus on the economy continues , experts say , the pandemic may trigger a wave of mortgage defaults in Nigeria , which could affect the housing market .
Currently , mortgage servicers face a potentially catastrophic loss in the wake of coronavirus , because of the economic lockdown and the stay at home directives by governments .
Further upstream in the housing market , buyers and sellers are being affected .
While several government agencies in other parts of the world are providing loan forbearance that could delay housing payments for months due to COVID-19 , the same can not be said of Nigeria .
Also , financial institutions that invest in bundled mortgage securities are putting in protections , since it would be mortgage servicers and lenders that lose .
In Nigeria , the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) recently announced a credit relief of $136 .
to businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic but industrial watchers believed much still need to be done  Other interventions announced by the bank , include reduction of interest rates for the loan from nine per cent to five per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mortgage bankers in Nigeria , the Mortgage Banking Association of Nigeria ( MBAN ) want the country to take a cue from other countries to avert further default in mortgages .
He commended Nigeria 's Central Bank 's credit relief of $136 .
million to businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic .
According to him , many people who are taking mortgages are working in different sectors and COVID-19 affect their obligations .
" This is the normal thing , we expect that if the people , who are employed lose their jobs , it will affect their obligations since many companies are not able to meet up because of the supply chain in China .
" Several countries have taken actions by asking them to take off one to two months to meet their obligations and the banks are not expected to take them as defaults .
"  Akinlusi said since it is not something that is peculiar to Nigeria , " we can learn from what other countries are doing because the shock is global .
" If other countries are taking such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligations , not only mortgages even companies that have obligations they do not default in bank credits , at least they should be given a minimum of two months to ensure that they are able to pay because they are not doing any business now and , if there is no business they can not pay .
I think , it is only wise for us to borrow a leaf from that .
"  Specifically , the way to look at it is not to focus on mortgage default but to look at the entire effect on the economy as it affects Nigeria and other countries .
" If the economy is affected it will affect all sectors of the economy and some people not having cash flow , it can affect the payment of salaries which will result to mortgage defaults .
" What the United States is doing to plunging money into the economy to ensure that consumer demands are met , people can still buy goods , so that all those companies in the food sector do not sack their staff , the jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , the staff can pay their bills , to keep consumption going , apart from those people , there are also companies which government is binding their commercial papers so that they can have working capitals , to provide liquidity in the market .
" Beyond all of that , let us take a cue from what other countries are doing , you can not give Nigerians money , they can extend mortgage repayment by two to three months .
" It can be rolled over so that people will know , that even if you do n't pay now , it will not be seen as default , this kinds of thing can be done so that we can move forward .
" Until this thing is over , what ever thing they are doing in other countries in terms of mortgage can be done , let us be proactive rather than waiting , because the whole world is going to recession , we need to pump money because if there is recession , people will not be able to pay their debts , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added .
Akinlusi said with the mortgage rate still hovering between 15-18 per cent , the government needs to take a cue from other countries to arrest the mortgage default because if nothing is done , the pandemic will trigger recession , which will affect all sectors including the housing and mortgage markets .
Similarly , the Chairman , Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( RICS ) ( Nigeria ) and Vice President , International Real Estate Federation ( FIABCI ) , Nigeria chapter , Mr .
Gbenga Ismail said government should suspend tax for this month by giving a tax credit in a way to give back .
According to him , the pandemic is triggering defaults in many countries where monthly contract is the norm .
So those who have payments and have not been at work for weeks will definitely default .
" In Nigeria , we have few cases like that .
However there are some businesses who thrive on daily sales , with closure of business they will not earn if they can not earn then it will be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these paying mortgages will definitely be affected .
The cycle is viscous and really impacting on the economy , " he added .
