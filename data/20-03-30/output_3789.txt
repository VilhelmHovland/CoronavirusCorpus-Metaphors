Modes of transmission of virus : implications  GENEVA , 2 days ago  The novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) virus is mainly transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes according to current evidence , says a scientific brief from WHO .
Based on the available evidence , WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients and contact and airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures are performed .
Droplet transmission occurs when a person is in in close contact ( within 1 m ) with someone who has respiratory symptoms ( e .
coughing or sneezing , ) and is therefore at risk of having his/her mucosae ( mouth and nose ) or conjunctiva ( eyes ) exposed to potentially infective respiratory droplets ( which are generally considered to be &gt; 5-10 ? m in diameter ) .
Droplet transmission may also occur through fomites in the immediate environment around the infected person .
Therefore , transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur by direct contact with infected people and indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment or with objects used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , WHO said .
Airborne transmission is different from droplet transmission as it refers to the presence of microbes within droplet nuclei , which are generally considered to be particles &lt; 5 ? m in diameter , and which result from the evaporation of larger droplets or exist within dust particles .
They may remain in the air for long periods of time and be transmitted to others over distances greater than 1 m .
In the context of COVID-19 , airborne transmission may be possible in specific circumstances and settings in which procedures that generate aerosols are performed ( i .
endotracheal intubation , bronchoscopy , open suctioning , administration of nebulized treatment , manual ventilation before intubation , turning the patient to the prone position , disconnecting the patient from the ventilator , non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation , tracheostomy , and cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) .
In analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China , airborne transmission was not reported .
There is some evidence that COVID-19 infection may lead to intestinal infection and be present in faeces .
However , to date only one study has cultured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been no reports of faecal-oral transmission of the COVID-19 virus to date .
Implications of recent findings of detection of COVID-19 virus from air sampling  To date , some scientific publications provide initial evidence on whether the COVID-19 virus can be detected in the air and thus , potentially involve airborne transmission .
These initial findings need to be interpreted carefully .
A recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine has evaluated virus persistence of the COVID-19 virus .
In this experimental study , aerosols were generated using a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum under controlled laboratory conditions .
This is a high-powered machine that does not reflect normal human cough conditions .
Further , the finding of COVID-19 virus in aerosol particles up to 3 hours does not reflect a clinical setting in which aerosol-generating procedures are performed -- that is , this was an experimentally induced aerosol-generating procedure .
There are reports from settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients have been admitted and in which no COVID-19 RNA was detected in air samples .
In addition , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental samples based on PCR-based assays is not indicative of viable virus that could be transmissible .
Conclusions  Based on the available evidence , including the recent publications mentioned above , WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions for those people caring for COVID-19 patients and contact and airborne precautions for circumstances and settings in which aerosol generating procedures are performed .
These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines , including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine and those currently used in Australia , Canada , and United Kingdom .
At the same time , other countries and organizations , including the US Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , recommend airborne precautions for any situation involving the care of COVID-19 patients , and consider the use of medical masks as an acceptable option in case of shortages of respirators ( N95 , FFP2 or FFP3 ) .
Current WHO recommendations emphasise the importance of rational and appropriate use of all PPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour from health care workers , particularly in doffing procedures and hand hygiene practices .
WHO also recommends staff training on these recommendations , as well as the adequate procurement and availability of the necessary PPE and other supplies and facilities .
Finally , WHO continues to emphasise the utmost importance of frequent hand hygiene , respiratory etiquette , and environmental cleaning and disinfection , as well as the importance of maintaining physical distances and avoidance of close , unprotected contact with people with fever or respiratory symptoms , it said .
