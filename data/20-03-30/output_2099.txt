( File Photo : **26;482;TOOLONG )  WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is extending the voluntary national shutdown for a month as sickness and death from the coronavirus pandemic rise in the U .
The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government expires Monday and Trump had expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines at least in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic .
But instead he decided to extend them through April 30 , a tacit acknowledgment he 'd been too optimistic .
Many states and local governments have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings .
Trump 's impulse to restore normalcy met a sober reality check Sunday from Dr .
Anthony Fauci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the U .
could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic .
Trump 's decision to extend the guidelines reflected a recognition that the struggle will take place over the longer haul .
The federal guidelines recommend against large group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home .
People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants , bars , non-essential travel and shopping trips .
The extension would leave the federal recommendations in place beyond Easter on April 12 , by which time Trump had hoped the country and its economy could start to rev up again .
Alarmed public-health officials said Easter was sure to be too soon .
The U .
had more than 137,000 COVID-19 cases reported by late Sunday afternoon , with more than 2,400 deaths .
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE .
AP 's earlier story follows below .
As President Donald Trump looks for ways to restore normalcy in parts of the U .
, his foremost infection disease expert says the country could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronavirus pandemic .
Anthony Fauci , speaking on CNN 's " State of the Union " on Sunday , offered his prognosis as the federal government weighs rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been as hard-hit by the outbreak at the conclusion of the nationwide 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus .
" I would say between 100,000 and 200,000 cases , " he said , correcting himself to say he meant deaths .
" We 're going to have millions of cases .
" But he added " I do n't want to be held to that " because the pandemic is " such a moving target .
"  About 125,000 cases of COVID-19 in the U .
had been recorded as of Sunday morning , with over 2,100 dead .
It is certain that many more have the disease but their cases have not been reported .
One in three Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus , with schools and businesses closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the White House coronavirus task force , said parts of the country with few cases so far must prepare for what 's to come .
" No state , no metro area , will be spared , " she said on NBC 's " Meet the Press .
"  Fauci said he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if more testing is in place to monitor those areas .
He said " it 's a little iffy there " right now .
Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms , which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia , sometimes requiring hospitalization .
The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems .
Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies .
Fauci 's prediction would take the death toll well past that of the average seasonal flu .
Trump repeatedly cited the flu 's comparatively much higher cost in lives in playing down the severity of this pandemic .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U .
economy by Easter , April 12 , but in recent days medical professionals have warned that would be far too soon for the nation 's heavily affected urban areas .
Just on Saturday , Trump was discussing tightening restrictions , suggesting then backing away from an " enforceable " quarantine of hard-hit New York , Connecticut and New Jersey .
Instead , the White House task force recommended a travel advisory for residents of those states to limit non-essential travel to slow the spread of the virus to other parts of the U .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Trump should n't be so quick to reverse the social distancing guidelines , saying more testing needs to be in place to determine whether areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk .
Trump 's " denial " in the crisis was " deadly , " she told CNN .
" As the president fiddles , people are dying , and we have to take every precaution , " she said .
She promised a congressional investigation once the pandemic is over to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question that resonates through U .
political scandals : " What did he know and when did he know it ? "  Trump minimized the gravity of the pandemic for weeks .
Asked whether she is saying that attitude cost American lives , Pelosi said : " Yes , I am .
I 'm saying that .
"  It put Pelosi out of lockstep with former vice-president Joe Biden , the likely Democratic presidential nominee , who said he would n't go so far as to lay the blame for deaths on the president .
" I think that 's a little too harsh , " he told NBC .
Biden faulted Trump for holding back on using his full powers under the recently invoked Defence Production Act to spur the manufacture of the full range of needed medical supplies -- and for making erratic statements about the pandemic .
Meanwhile , governors in other hotspots across the country were raising alarm that the spread of the virus was threatening their health-care systems .
" We remain on a trajectory , really , to overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
John Bel Edwards said on ABC 's " This Week .
" " By the end of the first week in April , we think the first real issue is going to be ventilators .
And we think it 's about the fourth or fifth of April before , down in the New Orleans area , we 're unable to put people on ventilators who need them .
And then several days later , we will be out of beds .
"  He said officials have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors , but so far have only been able to get 192 .
