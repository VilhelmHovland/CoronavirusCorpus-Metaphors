Novartis CEO Vas Narasimhan said on March 29 that his company 's hydroxychloroquine drug for malaria , lupus and arthritis is their biggest hope for tackling the coronavirus .
" Pre-clinical studies in animals as well as the first data from clinical studies show that hydroxychloroquine kills the coronavirus , " Mr .
Narasimhan said in an interview with Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung .
Novartis is developing treatment protocols for clinical use of HCQ but Mr .
Narasimhan said it 's premature to definitely stand by the findings .
The company is donating 130 million doses of the drug and supporting clinical trials before the FDA approves HCQ to treat COVID-19 .
Novartis is also studying three of its drugs for their effect on complications related to COVID-19 .
