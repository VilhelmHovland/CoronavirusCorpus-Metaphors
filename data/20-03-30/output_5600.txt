Coronavirus has not only led to shortages of masks and sanitizers , but also of lifesaving medical equipment like mechanical ventilators .
As the number of infected people rise , getting hold of equipment will become harder .
Scientists have suggested that connecting two patients to one ventilator machine is a plausible option .
Scientists at the Technical Medical Centre of the University of Twente have come up with this idea after using a double artificial lung to design the prototype of ' splitting the ventilator ' , reported Tech Explorist .

AP  Following their experiment , they tested it on several types of machines using existing medical equipment .
Two patients can be connected to one machine simultaneously only during the phase of fully assisted ventilation , the report said .
The new system can also work in case of two patients having different lung capacities .
It will prepare the inflow of air , while also controlling filtering the outflow .
In this system , two patients will require two input and two output tubes and splitting of the input and output will be done using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result for one patient .
In an attempt to overcome this problem , the scientists have recommended including sensors in both sets of tubes .
Coronavirus has dealt a massive blow to the world infecting close to 6 lakh people and claiming lives of more than 27,000 .
COVID-19 has forced many countries to adopt partial or complete lockdown .
India is also under a 21-day lockdown to stop the transmission of coronavirus .
