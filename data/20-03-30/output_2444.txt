What laws regulate such activities ?  The authorities that take care of all the measures regarding this area are the National Lottery Regulatory Commission and the Criminal Code Act where gambling is defined by Chapter 22 .
The gambling activities that are defined as legal are lotteries , land-based casinos and sports betting .
Dice games , non-skilled card games and Roulette are illegal .
Slots machines activity is also regulated by the law and only licensed operators can provide such services .
However , Nigerian measures do not affect online operators , so there are no restrictions if people would want to access local or foreign websites .
But gambling sites must remember that the games they provide must be legal .
Three types of places where you can gamble  Nigeria allows only three categories of gambling establishments where you can have some fun : casinos , betting and pools and lotteries .
Casinos  Although is a large country , Nigeria has only three land casinos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two in Lagos .

Lottery  The majority of Nigerian lotteries are licensed by the Lagos State Lotteries Board .

What about online gambling ?  As stated above , there is no specific legislation that regulates gambling activities offered on the Internet .
Outside sports betting and lotteries , online casinos are not allowed to operate within Nigeria 's borders because they can not be licensed .
But since there is no mention of online wagering in any law , it 's presumed legal by residents and state officials .
While online casinos find themselves in an ill-defined situation , sports betting is a big business in Nigeria .
This type of platforms offers a wide variety of betting markets , mobile accessibility , lines and odds on local and foreign sports and withdrawals in Naira .
So , there is no wonder that there are more than 50 betting sites within the country .

What could be improved ?  Your first answer to this question may be " well , everything " and we could n't agree more .
First thing first , the Nigerian government must update the laws to create a well-regulated iGaming sector .
Besides that , other features can contribute to the development of online gambling :  Mobile optimization : Modern online casinos must be created to function on a smaller screen and provide products that can adapt to this interface .
Reliable payment methods : Digital banking options like Paystack , Flutterwave and Quickteller become more and more popular .
It 's definitely a plus to provide these methods as a newly launched online casino .
Investors : Foreign businessmen are more interested in the iGaming scene in Nigeria .
These companies can bring tax revenue to the state , which is a reason to celebrate .
