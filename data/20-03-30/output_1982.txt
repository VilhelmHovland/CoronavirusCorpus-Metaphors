Diplomacy and development are vital parts of strengthening our national security  Unless the Integrated Review changes course , its analysis of modern threats will be half-complete and the resulting strategy to tackle them half-baked .
When the Government announced its review of diplomacy , development and defence policy in December , even the worst Whitehall pessimist could n't have predicted that -- within weeks -- the three departments of government responsible would be facing the unprecedented tests triggered by coronavirus .
Ben Wallace did n't envisage his first major troop deployment being in support of NHS crisis teams .
Nor was Anne-Marie Trevelyan expecting the coming humanitarian crisis as the pandemic spreads to the poorest countries .
As for Dominic Raab , even his wide-ranging role could n't have prepared him for his immersion in the desperate plight facing a million British nationals , stranded after the imposition of overseas travel bans .
Nevertheless , we must assume that plans for the Integrated Review , the brainchild of Dominic Cummings and Mark Sedwill , remain as briefed to the media ahead of December 's Queen 's Speech .
First , that briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expenditure across the three policy areas .
No 10 summed up the review 's purpose as " making the best use of spending to ensure all our security forces are ahead of hostile powers , terrorists and organised crime " .
" Ahead " is a telling word , indicating an arms race mentality , where our enemies ' capacity to harm us is constantly increasing , and our job is to foil their threats and launch more advanced attacks of our own .
A vital objective indeed , but is it the sum total of what our " three Ds " approach is meant to achieve ?  Second , it was briefed that Cummings and Sedwill saw the review as a chance to drive down defence procurement costs , and perhaps -- reading between the lines -- to refocus spending on more modern security threats .
And finally , almost in passing , it was briefed that plans were again afoot to put the Department for International Development -- and more importantly , its budget -- under Foreign Office control .
When Boris Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jam jars when it came to DfID , ending the funding of " softer " development projects , and directing all expenditure instead to key diplomatic and security priorities , including tackling Jihadist terrorism .
So while that briefing on DfID 's future might have sounded like a simple sop for the right-wing media , it actually fit the overall strategy to reorient all three Ds activity around security objectives .
So , writing on behalf of the Labour party , and based on what we know about the Government 's plans for this review , will they have our support ?  Diplomacy and development can advance our interests in areas that defence and security never touches  In a spirit of consensus , assuming the cost-benefit analysis factors in the protection of jobs in our steel and ship-building industries , we will back Cummings and Sedwill when they review defence procurement costs , a job ignored after Philip Hammond left the MoD in 2014 .
However , beyond that , theirs is a backward-looking vision , which fails even when judged on its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the example of Iran .
After decades of isolation , Iran came to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme , not because of western threats , or a rating of its chances in conflict , but thanks to painstaking diplomacy , and appeals to its economic self-interest .
And it remains the case that only diplomacy will get the Iran nuclear deal back on track , and open the door for discussion around the other security threats that Iran poses to western interests in the region .
In the case of Iran , rather than reviewing our activity to ensure we are " ahead " of this " hostile power " , I 'd prefer to invest in the diplomacy that was slowly discouraging it from that hostility , and can do so again if given a chance .
Take a less obvious example : Ethiopia .
When Johnson talked about smashing jam jars , he was reacting to controversy over DfID 's funding of Yegna , popular champions of female empowerment dubbed " Ethiopia 's Spice Girls " by our furious right-wing press .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are cited as one of the factors leading to the " feminisation " of Ethiopian politics , as also seen in the election of reformist female president Sahle-Work Zewde .
Do securocrats like Cummings and Sedwill look at the problems besetting the Horn of Africa , particularly Jihadist terrorism , and wonder what -- by contrast -- explains an Ethiopia scarred for decades by war and poverty bucking the trend ?  If they do , they might better understand the role of development , including in strengthening security .
They might even understand that diplomacy and development can advance our interests in areas that defence and security never touches , including global efforts to tackle climate change or forced mass migration , and mitigate their effects .
I certainly hope so .
Because unless this review deals with those kinds of issues and responses , then its analysis of modern threats will be only half-complete and the resulting strategy to tackle them totally half-baked .
That brings us back to coronavirus , not just because deadly pandemic outbreaks must be added to that list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inadequacy of the Government 's approach .
Theirs is a review of the purpose behind our three Ds work , which deals entirely with threats from traditional enemies -- " hostile powers , terrorists and organised crime " -- and proposes the entirely one-dimensional solutions of staying one step ahead of those threats , in terms of our defences and our ability to strike first .
Even if Cummings and Sedwill challenge orthodoxies by focusing on new forms of warfare , their narrow analysis of " threats " and " solutions " looks anachronistic when facing the short- and medium-term risks posed by coronavirus and climate change .
It may pain them to admit it , but the Foreign Office and DfID have the lion 's share to offer when it comes to dealing with threats like those , and simply using them to fund the war on Jihadism is short-sighted at best .
What the Government must instead do is come back in a few months ' time , and ask themselves : in a post-coronavirus world , is it our current approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our planned approach to this review ?  If they are honest , they already know the answer .
