SALT LAKE CITY -- Blood donation centers in Utah and across the country are seeing a massive drop in donors since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak .
Some program managers are calling it a " crisis within a crisis .
"  Blood drives at schools , offices and churches account for roughly 80 percent of the blood collected by the Red Cross .
However , since the outbreak began , there have been about 2,700 drive cancellations across the country , likely due to fear of the virus spreading .
Officials in Utah say it 's hard to pinpoint exactly how many cancellations have happened in this state because the number changes on a daily basis .
Utah Red Cross Communications Director Rich Woodruff says , " I do know , from talking to our folks in blood services , that these cancellations continue to roll in on a daily basis .
It 's almost like a domino effect .
"  Demand remains , so blood drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still high , so , they 're still taking donations through remote drives .
He says if anyone still wants to donate , they can log on to the Red Cross ' website and find a convenient drive-by location by typing in their zip code .
" We prescreen everyone that comes in to make sure their temperature is OK .
They fill out a brief questionnaire , " Woodruff says .
The need is great , nationwide .
Red Cross officials say doctors in Ann Arbor , Michigan , report having only one day 's worth of blood supply for the entire hospital .
