Jerry Snodgrass would rather be speaking to your area 's Rotary club , recognizing Ohio high school administrators or handing out a trophy to a winning team on a field or court somewhere .
Instead , he 's working remotely trying to digest the constant curve balls the new coronavirus pandemic has thrown at the Ohio High School Athletic Association .
The OHSAA has already had to cancel winter sports tournaments , prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to win a championship .

Once football gets mentioned , heads turn with territorial rights at stake because of the predominance of football once the calendar turns to fall .
Preliminary look at fall  The OHSAA has given the fall season an early look as a precaution .
" It ( football ) affects people on a big scale , " Snodgrass admitted .
" Look at Ohio State and how many people go to football games vs .
how many go to basketball games .
"  Former Buckeye quarterback turned ESPN College GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit stirred the pot somewhat recently with his comments on ESPN radio stating he would " be shocked if we have NFL football this fall , if we have college football .
"  Just as the NBA shutdown led to the dominoes falling with colleges and high schools , such an occurrence could be catastrophic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind-sided .
" It 's a comment not based on a whole lot of medical advice I do n't think , " Snodgrass said of Herbstreit 's interview .
" But , it still is incumbent upon us to look at planning for all of the worst-case scenarios .
"  The commissioner was sent an email stating it was far too early to look at football , saying they should " hope for the best , expect the worst .
" Snodgrass disagrees .
" In our eyes , it 's hope for the best but PLAN for the worst , " he said .
" I think it 's imperative that we plan for every worst-case scenario .
It 's better than not planning .
It does n't mean that we 're canceling anything in the fall yet .
We do n't have to do that .
But , we also need to be prepared on all the ' what ifs ? ' .
"  The native of Upper Sandusky has served as a teacher , coach and administrator in Ohio at Defiance , Morral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years coaching basketball and serving 16 years as athletic director .
Snodgrass has been on the OHSAA board since 2008 .
He previously was Assistant Director and Director of Sport Management before becoming Commissioner in May 2018 .
The joy of competition has been temporarily stopped by an opponent whose scouting report was incomplete by no fault of anyone .
Unexpectedly , the unexpected has occurred .

" The responsibility of how many kids this has affected and how many community people this has affected has taken an emotional toll on me .
It 's been a challenge .
"  In that respect , Snodgrass has returned to his coaching roots trying to devise a plan to beat an opponent he 's not sure he should be able to beat .
" The key in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm trying to rally and get 350,000 kids and 65,000 coaches to defeat this so we can get it all back .
We as coaches like to be in control of everything .
Not being in control of it , everything from the Governor to the Department of Health to the President to the virus itself , we 're just not in control of it .
"  Spring forward ?  While looking long-term toward fall , the recent new school closings until May 1 still leave some hope .
Many schools and coaches have expressed the desire to still have a shortened spring season if at all possible .
In as short as a week , several have stated that would take whatever time was allotted to be back with their squads .
May 1 was a date the OHSAA had already anticipated before the school closures were extended from April 6 to the beginning of May .
Such a season may or may not result in scheduled state finals being adjusted depending on the status of the sites .
" We 're working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , " Snodgrass said .
" We at least need to be prepared .
"  The revenue hit for the OHSAA is considerable .
In addition to ticket revenue lost , there have been trophies already purchased that ca n't be repurposed , programs printed and not used .
A mild upside of the pandemic is the OHSAA has begun a further investigation in how to reduce expenditures .
One example is cheaper ways to conduct meetings , particularly with how busy athletic administrators will be when play resumes .
Other fall sports  Again , no fall decisions have been made , but the OHSAA is looking into all scenarios for all sports .
Where football could bring more hesitation with the contact involved , golf and cross country are sports involving wider spaces .
Golf courses in neighboring Greater Cincinnati counties have recently reopened with a few restrictions and precautions .
" We really have n't crossed that bridge yet , " Snodgrass said .
" We may face it in the spring yet , I do n't know .
That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Not all of his inbox is bad  With current COVID-19 concerns , the state wrestling tournament would have been difficult to administer according to Snodgrass .
With basketball , no former coach would take great pride in stopping a tournament , but for the greater good , games were halted and there will be no 2020 state champions .
Numerous fans have implored him to communicate to Governor DeWine and Ohio Department of Health Director Dr .
Amy Action the importance of high school sports .
With Dr .
Acton 's daughter being a softball player , Snodgrass believes the message is already clear .
Of the emails and texts he 's received , one , in particular , made him grin if just for a moment .
It was from the captain of Division IV Jackson Center basketball .
from Shelby County who had just made the regional finals .
Their next win would put them in the state semifinals .
" It brought me to my knees , " Snodgrass said .
" They had a chance to be in the state tournament .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America .
The captain sent me a note that said , ' We 're crushed and so disappointed , but every one of us understands that this is more important than anything .
We support you 100% .
Wow , wow , wow ! " .
