Most coronavirus statistics are depressing -- but not all  The global pandemic continues to ravage the world with ever-increasing infection numbers but there may be signs of hope , writes Alan Austin .
DID YOU KNOW that 37 countries with more than four million people still have not recorded a single coronavirus death ? Did you know four countries now have more recovered patients than those currently infected ?  Does this mean the end is in sight ? When will this happen ? And how can we be sure ?  This column often analyses obscure statistics to reveal things about the economy some people do not know .
We can try the same with the available coronavirus data .
The last week 's updates on the pandemic have mostly been gloomy .
Infections in the USA clicked over 100,000 .
Total infections exceeded 660,000 .
Deaths in Italy topped 10,000 .
Worldwide , deaths exceeded 30,000 .
Australia 's death toll doubled from seven to 14 .
But there was also good news , as we shall see .
Caveat : Data reliability  This analysis , as with all slicing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the validity of the numbers provided .
There is no certainty , however , that they are all up to date and reliable .
Data used here was current at the time of writing ( midday Sunday 29th March ET ) .
Updates are available here .
Countries worst hit  Nations across the globe are experiencing vastly different impacts .
Italy , Switzerland and Spain have been devastated , while Canada , Japan , New Zealand and others have been substantially spared -- so far .
Worldwide , the numbers of infections , deaths and recoveries are climbing steadily .
Infection rates for countries with more than ten million inhabitants are shown in the silver chart , below :  Caveat : Testing rates  A spike in infections does not mean the virus is suddenly spreading more rapidly .
It could mean simply that more testing was done than previously .
This happened in Australia on March 22 when a record 537 new cases were reported .
That flowed from increased testing on that day .
Global deaths keep rising  Coronavirus deaths in raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 5,982 , China 3,300 , Iran 2,517 , France 2,314 , the USA 2,211 and the United Kingdom with 1,019 .
They are the only countries with more than 1,000 fatal cases .
Ten nations have deaths between 100 and 800 .
They are the Netherlands , Germany , Belgium , Switzerland , South Korea , Sweden , Indonesia , Turkey , Brazil and Portugal .
Deaths per million population generate quite a different list .
Among countries with more than ten million inhabitants , Italy leads with 160 .
deaths per million , followed a fair way back by Spain on 116 .
No other major country has copped more than 40 deaths per million .
As yet , anyway .
The top 20 countries are shown in the pink graph , below .
Australia with 0 .
does not make this group .
Recent rapid rises in death rates  When we look at the shift over the last week , however , a different ranking emerges again .
The country with the worst increase in the death toll since 21 March is Portugal , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1,567% .
Next comes Turkey with a 1,100% increase from nine to 108 .
Then comes Brazil , Belgium and the USA .
The top 20 large countries -- with populations above ten million -- are shown in the green graph , below .
The USA has seen a huge rise from just 275 a week ago to 2,211 as this is written .
That is a disturbing outcome for a country so far from the epicentres , China and Italy , and which claims to be a global leader in medical research and technology .
This has fuelled considerable debate about the adequacy of the Trump Administration 's responses .
Caveat : Death rate factors  The data shown here does not identify the factors which affect the death rate including :  Positive indicators  In the last week , the Chinese city of Wuhan was reopened and many residents -- some of them recovered coronavirus sufferers -- returned to try to resume normal life .
Bahrain , South Korea and the Maldives joined China in recording higher numbers of recovered patients than those still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far  Among highly or very highly developed countries ( UN classifications ) with populations above four million , six countries have recorded no deaths so far .
They are New Zealand , Belarus , Bolivia , Georgia , Oman and Slovakia .
Surprisingly , few infections and deaths have been reported in Africa .
Libya has a population of ten million and is geographically close to Italy , but has reported only one infection .
Ethiopia has a population of 160 million and is not far from Iran , but has reported 16 infections but no deaths .
Other large African countries with few infections and no deaths include Uganda , Tanzania , Mozambique and Angola .
It is highly likely , however , these countries are not yet effectively monitoring , treating and reporting the virus .
The Economist has just published an analysis of the risk to poor countries , which concluded :  ' So covid-19 could soon be all over poor countries .
And their health-care systems are in no position to cope .
Many can not deal with the infectious diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contagious one .
Health spending per head in Pakistan is one 200th the level in America .
Uganda has more government ministers than intensive-care beds .
'  Case study : South Korea  Two countries now have graphs of daily new infections showing near-perfect bell-curves .
They are China and South Korea .
Relative to their high populations , new cases reported each day are now very low .
Current active cases in South Korea , at 4,523 as this is written , are fewer than the recovered cases , 4,811 .
So there is hope .
South Korea and China , along with New Zealand , Japan , Bahrain , Singapore and some others , show that infections -- and eventually deaths -- can be curbed with the right policies , when implemented in a timely manner .
Unfortunately , few countries have acted as swiftly as these .
Australia is one of many which have not .
