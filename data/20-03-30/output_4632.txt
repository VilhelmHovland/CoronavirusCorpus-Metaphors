So when the asteroid hit , causing a nuclear winter of epic proportions , the Tyrannosaurus -- along with all other dinosaurs -- could not cope .
Mass extinction followed and the world changed forever .
Advertisement  It was the smaller creatures , the developing mammals who had to scurry and scrape to survive , that emerged and came to the fore .
They were less bloated , sharper , nimbler and quicker thinking , able to adapt , change and alter course in a way that the bigger dinosaurs could n't .
Loading  Now I 'm not saying that the AFL and the NRL , Australia 's sporting equivalent of the Tyrannosaurus , will endure the same fate as the tyrant lizards .
In fact , it 's impossible to see them dying out and no doubt they will recover in the long term .
But it is possible that they will not rule in quite the same way when the modern-day equivalent of the asteroid , the COVID-19 pandemic , has passed into history .
The two dominant codes became , like the biggest dinosaurs , top heavy : their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available sponsorship money and media space in the fragile Australian sporting ecosystem .
Like the Tyrannosaurus , they assumed that the world would go on just the same as it always did -- especially the NRL , which spent like a drunken sailor and made no provision at all for the crisis no one saw coming .
Loading  But it 's worth considering whether some of the so-called minor sports -- or at least minor in this country -- might be able to adapt to these challenging times more adroitly than the behemoths .
For the AFL and NRL , size , an advantage in times of plenty , now looks to be no sort of edge at all as they stumble forward trying to stay upright as the world around them collapses .
Basketball and soccer are much bigger sports globally than Australian rules and rugby league , but in this country they are like the smaller adaptive mammals .
For decades they have had to scrounge a living alongside netball , athletics and numerous other sports as the dominant codes absorbed most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to be survivors , able to find ways of attracting funding and community support to keep going while the big codes sucked up most of the resources .
In this changed environment , those sports that have learned to survive on the smell of an oily rag might be able to absorb the horrific social and economic shocks that the coronavirus crisis has wrought more easily than those who were bloated on the fat of enormous television and media-rights fees for years .

Those media-rights fees are likely to be a thing of the past when normality -- whatever that will look like -- resumes .
Media companies are taking their hits alongside every other kind of business and there will invariably be less money sploshing around the system in the medium-term future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on gargantuan sums to buy the rights to footy games .
There are other issues too .
Loading  Will the giants of the AFL and the NRL be able to take fan support for granted in the way they once did ?  The unedifying spectacle of AFL players rowing with the governing body about what level of pay cuts they should take did them few favours in the public 's perception , especially at a time when many of those supporters are losing jobs , struggling to pay the rent and put food on the table for their families .
Watching the Richmond v Carlton game , the AFL 's season-opener played behind closed doors , made this viewer realise just how crucial the crowd was for Australian rules .
It felt devoid of context and theatre without a large audience to give each clash and contest meaning .
Fans should now realise that they have a power that clubs -- of all codes -- took for granted .
Without them the show is much diminished and lacks significance .
Loading  When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts of the forest should realise that the ecosystem is varied as well as fragile and that they are but one part of it .
A big one , a popular one , but not necessarily as big and dominant as they once were given the straitened economic circumstances .
Sport is going to be an essential element of a post-pandemic world , a joyful escape from a grim reality .
Let 's hope firstly that it survives .
And that it comes back leaner , less bloated , more adaptive , more focused on fans and their needs and more aware of its place in a world that will need everyone to work together if the future is to be rebuilt in a more equitable fashion .
