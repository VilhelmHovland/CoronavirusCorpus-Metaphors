FAA eases some flight crew requirements in response to pandemic  The Federal Aviation Administration has eased some flight crew training and medical requirements in light of the coronavirus outbreak .
The moves come after groups like Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association ( AOPA ) and Airlines for America ( A4A ) urged the FAA to grant regulatory flexibility , saying the pandemic has made complying with some requirements difficult , hazardous and in some cases impossible .
The agency on 30 March released a policy update saying that for three months it will not take enforcement action against pilots for the reason of flying with an expired medical certificate .
That change remains effective through 30 June and applies only to pilots whose medical certificates expire between 31 March and 30 June , says the update .
" This is because of the burden that COVID-19 places on the US healthcare system , and because these aviation medical examinations increase the risk of transmission of the virus , " says the FAA 's notice .
AOPA had lobbied the FAA to ease medical certificate requirements , and requirements related to flight instructor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated pilot examiners " have cancelled appointments , flight instructor refresher courses have been cancelled and some testing facilities have closed .
The FAA has also agreed to ease some emergency training requirements for pilots and flight attendants through 31 May .
For instance , pilots undergoing recurrent or upgrade training will not need to demonstrate the use of " emergency equipment that must be placed on or over the head " , such as oxygen breathing equipment and life jackets , says the FAA 's exemption notice , made public on 27 March .
The exemption , requested by airline trade group A4A , also allows flight attendants to use " alternative methods " to complete cardiopulmonary resuscitation training as part of recurrent performance drills .
The exemption gives crew one year to complete the normal training procedures .
The FAA tells Flightglobal it is " considering a number " of other requests for regulatory relief related to the coronavirus .
