Premier League players could isolate together to complete season  Premier League players could isolate together to complete season  A World Cup-style camp is one solution being considered by Premier League clubs as a means to complete the 2019-20 season amid the coronavirus pandemic .
It was reported on Monday morning that clubs could gather in a neutral location to play out the remainder of the season behind closed doors , with only those personnel essential to staging and broadcasting the games allowed to attend to minimise the chance of a coronavirus infection .
The PA news agency understands this is one of many ideas under consideration , with the 20 clubs due to convene again by conference call on Friday .
Bournemouth 's Wales international David Brooks provided a player 's perspective by saying he would be happy for the season to conclude behind closed doors .
" If the Premier League want to do that and the club are happy to do that then I personally do n't really have any problems with it , " Brooks told Talksport .
" No player will tell you it 's ever going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fans can be that extra boost to get you the three points or to the point you might need .

It 's not going to be good for any team to play without fans , but every team will be in the same boat .
"  The picture in the UK has changed dramatically since the last meeting on March 19 , when the decision was taken to extend the suspension of English professional football until April 30 at the earliest .
That suspension is almost certain to be further extended on Friday and , with the country now in lockdown , the league may prefer to follow LaLiga 's approach and suspend indefinitely rather than placing an arbitrary date on any return .
The clubs remain committed to completing the season and are keen to avoid facing any financial penalties from broadcasters for failing to fulfil fixtures .

The idea of clubs gathering in one or two neutral venues , in isolation from the wider world , is likely to be looked at again on Friday along with other scenarios which have been modelled at previous meetings .
There are a number of difficulties with the idea , not least how to deal with the necessity to have medical staff on hand during a public health crisis , and how the format could survive even one positive Covid-19 test .
But the idea of multiple matches being televised on a daily basis throughout June and July , if the infection curve has flattened by then , could have some merit .
