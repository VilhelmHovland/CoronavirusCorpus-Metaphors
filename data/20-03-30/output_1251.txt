The agency responsible for managing Scotland 's national forests and land has urged people to " stay local " this weekend .
Staff at Blairadam Forest near Kelty have been forced to close the area 's car park due to the influx of vehicles , while several instances of flytipping have been reported at woodland sites across the region , including at Thornton Wood , where what looks like the contents of people 's landfill bins have been dumped .
Reckless householders are dumping rubbish on Forestry Land and Scotland land after bins were not emptied locally .
Simon Hodgson , chief executive of Forestry and Land Scotland , which manages the sites , said : " Our staff where possible are now working from home , which means regional offices are closed , as are all of our visitor facilities -- including toilets , car parks and mountain biking trails .
" Government advice is for people to go outside to take physical exercise where it is safe to do so as this is not only good for physical health , but also can boost wellbeing and reduce anxiety too .
However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk a local one ; do not get into your car to travel to one of the woods we manage .
" The walking trails within these local forests will remain open but you must exercise alone or with your own household and , if encountering other people , maintain the social distancing rule .
" Remember our toilets , mountain biking trails , and car parks are closed .
"  Fife Coast and Countryside Trust , which manages many areas across the kingdom , urged people to heed the government advice and stay away .
A spokesman said : " We are still experiencing high volumes of visitors to some of our sites , we would ask that you stay local and do not drive to locations at a distance from your home to exercise dogs .
" Please be aware that all bins managed by FCCT are now closed , so if you are walking you dog on any of our sites , please take home any dog waste .
