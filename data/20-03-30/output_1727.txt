A motorist was stopped by a motorway patrol on a 224-mile round trip to buy a ? 15 item off eBay , police said .
The driver travelled from Coventry to collect the eBay purchase of windows in Salford , Greater Manchester , despite the public being warned only to make " essential " journeys due to the coronavirus pandemic .
After picking up his purchase in Salford , he realised his wife could n't fit in the car for the two-hour journey back home .
When police pulled the car over on the M6 in Cheshire , she was sitting in the boot , according to a tweet by the North West Motorway Police Twitter feed .
There 's a solid 7 up for grabs for Michael Gove for saying that we do n't know when this is going to end .

Even if the experts did know when it was going to end Gove would n't believe them .
Here in Spain , the stupidest thing I saw on TV recently was a man taking his " pet " electric oil filled radiator for a walk .
He used the cable as a lead ! This was due to the fact that people were allowed out to walk their pets .
This resulted in another citizen hiring out his dogs for 2 ? a walk .
I give the radiator walker a 10 and dogs for hire guy a 1 .
He had licked the public toilet as part of a social media challenge called " Coronavirus Challenge " which is about as dumb as it sounds , and involves licking stuff , like produce at the grocery store , for reasons unknown to me .
Instead of fining people just give them a Yellow then a red warning leading to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
