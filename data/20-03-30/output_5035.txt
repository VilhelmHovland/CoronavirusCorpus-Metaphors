Ebe Dancel to headline online concert in support of Earth Hour 2020  ABS-CBN News  MANILA -- He already lent his voice to a fundraiser which aims to help the country 's fight against the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
And this Saturday , former Sugarfree frontman Ebe Dancel will once again perform for a cause -- this time , as part of the annual Earth Hour celebrations .
He 'll be headlining a special online jam session , arranged by PLDT and Smart Communications , alongside Johnoy Danao and Bullet Dumas .
The digital gig is in line with a plea from Earth Hour organizers World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) to move this year 's celebrations online , in light of the worsening COVID-19 outbreak .
Watching streams is one of the recommendations in WWF 's list of things to do from the comforts of one 's home , in addition to the usual switching off non-essential lights , reading books and playing board games in candle-light , and trying yoga , among many others .
Locally , the goal of this year 's Earth Hour is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current global realities faced by humanity .
"  " Changes in rain patterns , for example , coupled with increasing population in the Philippines could result to severe water shortages before the year 2030 if there is no comprehensive and immediate action taken , " WWF Philippines , in partnership with the Department of Energy , said in a statement .
" The campaign is a timely reminder that in spite of current trends , we can still change the ending if we start acting now , " it added .
