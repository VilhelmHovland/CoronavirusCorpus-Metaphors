Yesterday , we reported that the North American International Auto Show ( AKA : Detroit Motor Show ) has been canceled .
The reason is that the venue for the show could be turned into an emergency field hospital to address the COVID-19 pandemic which is already overwhelming the existing healthcare network in the United States .
It seems the Philippine government is also looking at a similar strategy , and they 're proposing 4 large complexes for it .
One of which is the venue used for the Philippine International Motor Show ( PIMS ) and the Manila International Auto Show ( MIAS ) .
According to some information from the Department of Public Works and Highways , the 4 candidate public buildings include the Philippine International Convention Center ( PICC ) , the Rizal Memorial Coliseum , the Philsports Arena , and the World Trade Center Manila ( WTC-Manila ) .
" A proposal is already in place to convert available spaces of Philippine International Convention Center ( PICC ) , World Trade Center ( WTC ) , Rizal Memorial Coliseum , and Philippine Institute of Sports ( PhilSports ) Multipurpose Arena that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said DPWH Secretary Mark Villar .
If given the green light by the Department of Health ( DOH ) , the 4 facilities will be used as spaces for persons under investigation ( PUI ) and for persons under monitoring ( PUM ) .
Villar says that the conversion of the buildings as temporary treatment and monitoring facilities will be in accordance with certain protocols to prevent infection and the further spread of SARS-CoV-2 .
The large buildings should theoretically give the DOH and the overstretched hospitals the space they need to isolate or segregate patients depending on their status .
The flexibility afforded by the spaces will allow for certain areas such as contaminated zones for patients , buffer zones for medical staff decontamination and hand hygiene , and a sterile zone as a holding area for health workers to don their personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .
" As per guidelines provided by DOH , confirmed COVID-19 patients may be placed in shared space or rooms .
PUIs shall be separated in a different space or tent or room provided with individual enclosed spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these facilities have the necessary water and electrical lines for suspected COVID-19 patients .
All facilities are easily accessible to Level 2 and Level 3 hospitals that can take PUIs or confirmed COVID-19 patients .
As stated , WTC-Manila hosts two major automotive events .
Before the start of the quarantine and the enhanced community quarantine ( ECQ ) , the organizers of the Manila International Auto Show already decided to postpone the event to a later date that has yet to be disclosed .
The biennial ( read : every other year ) Philippine International Motor Show ( PIMS ) is scheduled for 2020 and is typically held during the third quarter .
There is no word yet as to whether PIMS will push through .
According to the DPWH 's Anna Mae Yu Lamentillo , they are also looking at other sites , including open spaces , should the need arise .
