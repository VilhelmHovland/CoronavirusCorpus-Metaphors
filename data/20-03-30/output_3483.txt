Sorrell - who founded advertising giant WPP and sits on the IOC 's Communications Commission - said delaying the Games was logical given the coronavirus pandemic and a resulting recession he compares only to that created by war .
" The ( local and international ) sponsors would prefer next year in any case given the chaos that is going on at the moment , " he said in a phone interview .
" So this works out for both sets of sponsors .
"  Sorrell , who left WPP in 2018 , concedes there are hurdles to be overcome such as the availability of the venues and the timetable - the IOC has left the door open to a spring Olympics - but believes the " extremely competent " Japanese organisers would deal with those changes .

" Q2 ( the second quarter ) will be very difficult this year , Q3 less so and Q4 better , so there will be some signs of recovery by the time the Games come round .
"  The IOC 's former head of marketing , Michael Payne , dismisses the belief in some quarters that IOC chief Thomas Bach and the organisers ' ultimate decision was beholden to the wishes of their respective commercial partners .
" Nothing could be further from the truth that the IOC decision-making process is driven by commercial partners , " the 62-year-old Irishman told AFP .
" They would have been informed but not consulted .
" However , the decision would have been 100% driven by sporting concerns .

"  Becoming a so-called TOP ( The Olympic Partner Programme established by the IOC in 1985 ) , does not come cheap .
INVESTED HEAVILY  The dozen current members , including Coca-Cola and General Electric , will have invested well over $100 million ( 91 million euros , Sh10 billion ) each to become one of the main providers for the Tokyo Games .

" The key concepts to make this unique situation work are flexibility and fairness .
" Fortunately , Olympic sponsorship agreements are precise and succinct as to the use of which Olympic intellectual property can be used where , how , and when .

"  Burns said the IOC provided clarity and thereby reassurance to those whose contracts were due to come to an end in 2020 .
" The IOC has already stated that sponsors of the Tokyo Games whose rights were set to expire this year will be extended through the Games next year , " he said .

" If the global crisis is contained and or is over by next year , I think the Games will provide for a unique and amazing celebration of humanity and triumph .
