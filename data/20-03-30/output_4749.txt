Blood is like milk , not toilet paper .
You ca n't just buy a lot of it and save it for later -- you need to have a regular , fresh supply for patients who need it .
At the moment , fewer Australians are donating blood than usual .
To a degree , we can understand why .
But blood donation is an essential health service , even during the coronavirus pandemic .
Donor centres have implemented new measures to ensure the safety of staff , donors and patients receiving transfusions during this time .
If you 're healthy , there 's a good chance you 'll be eligible to donate .
Why do we need more donors now ?  We need blood and plasma products every day to support cancer patients , new mums and babies , people with immune deficiencies or blood diseases , and people who need surgery or have suffered trauma .
We 're currently seeing an increase in cancellations and people rescheduling their appointments .
Around 900 donors are cancelling appointments each day , up from 800 earlier this month .
There are a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  At the start of 2020 , we saw a strong response from donors who came forward as a way to help with the nation 's bushfire response .
We 've seen this response to major events before and we know it can affect the supply chain down the track .
Because these donors need to wait 12 weeks before they can donate blood again , there are fewer people available to give blood right now .
Relating to coronavirus specifically , as people follow advice to stay home except for essential activities , they may be less inclined to donate blood .
And if the virus spreads to more people , fewer people may be eligible to donate because of new restrictions to keep our patients , staff , and donor centres safe .
Based on our forecasts for demand from Australian health providers , Australian Red Cross Lifeblood needs an additional 7,000 donors to make appointments to donate blood through to Easter Monday to prevent a shortage .
Who can donate ?  Australia currently has around 500,000 blood donors , but millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're aged between 18 and 76 , weigh over 50kg and are healthy and well , you may be eligible .
However , in keeping with government advice we encourage those aged 70 and over to postpone their donation during this period .
There are other eligibility criteria which remain in place to ensure our patients and donors are safe from the risks we already understand .
Notably , there 's no evidence coronavirus or other respiratory viruses can be transmitted by blood transfusion .
But to be on the safe side , Lifeblood 's strict screening process means people who are unwell ca n't donate .
During the pandemic , Lifeblood has introduced new rules to protect the safety of staff , donors and patients , in line with recent recommendations from the World Health Organisation :  anyone who has returned from overseas is unable to donate for 28 days after their return  people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 will have to wait 28 days before donating  people who have been confirmed as having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared by their doctor plus undergo an additional recovery period .
people with mild cold-like symptoms will be unable to donate until they are fully recovered .
Am I allowed to travel to a donor centre , and is it safe ?  As many states in Australia have limited non-essential activities , it 's important to understand blood and plasma donation is vital , and travel and venue restrictions do n't prevent people from giving blood .
Donor centres are strictly regulated spaces , monitored regularly by the Therapeutic Goods Administration .
There 's a specific code that sets out requirements for staff , premises , collection procedures , quality control and testing , among other things .
Staff adhere to strict sanitation protocols including wearing gloves , wiping down surfaces after every donation and using single use sterile collection kits for every donation .
In addition to the usual hygiene practices and new restrictions to who can donate , Lifeblood is implementing further measures to help protect donors and staff , including :  increased disinfecting of frequently used items  providing additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all areas in our centres including the donation floor , refreshment areas , reception and more  Trending Stories Right Now  I have been shaken to my core , and now you may be too .
It turns out that I 've been moving apps around on iPhones the hard way .
Not only was I an early adopter on smart phones , I literally review them for work .
Fortunately , I 'm not the only tech writer to admit this .
