Frank de Caro , a nationally known folklorist who taught in the LSU English Department over 33 years , is among those who have died and tested positive for coronavirus at the Lambeth house retirement home in New Orleans .
Trying to help lower anxiety from living in the coronavirus pandemic , Timothy Wade plays the bagpipes for Lambeth House residents Sunday , March 22 .
An epidemiology professor at the Louisiana State University School of Public Health warned Tueday that the pandemic could increase the number of cases of post-traumatic stress disorder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LSU professor and nationally known folklorist Frank de Caro died last week at Ochsner Medical Center , his wife , fellow retired LSU professor Rosan Jordan , was back at Lambeth House , holed up in her apartment on the fifth floor .
They 'd been married almost a half century , and for most of their 30-plus years as English professors at LSU , they shared an office , their names appearing together on the door , and in published work .
" He really was a scholar .
I 'm a good editor , " Jordan said .
De Caro , 76 , who had Parkinson 's , was living three floors down in a room at St .
Anna 's , the nursing care section of Lambeth House , when he was hospitalized March 20 with a fever and cough .
Jordan , 80 , said he was administered a coronavirus test while she stayed put in isolation .
Known cases of coronavirus continued to spread across Louisiana Saturday , with the virus now detected in 56 of the state 's 64 parishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim calling card of the new and greedy coronavirus , a pandemic that has left 151 reported dead and 1,127 hospitalized in Louisiana , with a third of them on ventilators , according to the state 's noon update Sunday .
And nowhere in the state has that forced separation appeared with more deflating repetition than at Lambeth House .
De Caro is among at least 13 Lambeth House residents -- 5% of the senior home 's population -- now dead from the COVID-19 outbreak , according to a memo that Lambeth House CEO Scott Crabtree sent Saturday evening to residents .
All told , Crabtree wrote , 53 residents have tested positive for COVID-19 or were presumed positive , about one in five Lambeth House residents .
There have been no numbers released on the number of Lambeth House staff who have been tested for coronavirus or fallen ill .
Crabtree also wrote , as an encouraging sign , that 21 of those 53 positive residents had " successfully completed the CDC-mandated isolation protocol and are now released from isolation according to CDC 's discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those now free to walk around the facility or in the parking lot , though not outside the gates of the complex .
" The halls of Lambeth House feel like they 're full of ghosts , there have been so many passing , " she said .
The number of known coronavirus clusters in Louisiana nursing homes and senior complexes rose by three on Saturday , according to health officials .
The death toll at Lambeth House in recent weeks extends beyond the 13 residents reported from Louisiana 's first known coronavirus cluster .
Another 10 such facilities across the state have been identified as of Sunday as coronavirus " clusters , " defined as those having more than one confirmed positive case .
The state Department of Health is now providing the names of homes where coronavirus clusters have arisen , but that information does not include the names of the dead or their numbers at each facility .
According to Lambeth House residents , at least five more of their neighbors have died , beyond those 13 , since the outbreak .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's rapidly growing roster of anonymous coronavirus deaths is uncertain .
A spokesman for Lambeth House did not immediately respond to a request for information Sunday .
At least four of the 13 people confirmed dead from the virus at Lambeth House , including de Caro , lived at St .
Anna 's , the nursing care section on two lower floors .
Lambeth House officials had worked in the early days of the outbreak under CDC guidance to shield those especially frail residents of St .
Anna 's from the spread of COVID-19 , but it has n't seemed to work .
Several other residents living on those floors also have tested positive , other residents said .
De Caro entered St .
Anna 's about a year ago , his wife said , after Lambeth House staff decided his Parkinson 's had finally left him in need of skilled nursing .
It had been a decline over years , though de Caro appears to be the youngest Lambeth House resident to die with COVID-19 .
Like many of the others , he 'd retired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple met in graduate school at Indiana University , " one of the big schools in folklore studies " at the time , and wed in 1970 , Jordan said .
Frank took a teaching job the following year at LSU ; Rosan finished her dissertation then joined him on the staff there , she said .
Rosan said they retired from LSU in 2004 and moved into a house on Camp Street in New Orleans ' Garden District , before Hurricane Katrina struck a year later .
They began what de Caro would describe in his writing as an " odyssey of displacement " that included stops in Texas , Oklahoma and Washington , D .
Marcia Gaudet , president of the Fellows of the American Folklore Society -- a seat de Caro once held -- said he was the first chairman of the Louisiana Folklife Commission , president of the Louisiana Folklore Society and edited the publication " Louisiana Folklore Miscellany .
"  " I also recall Frank 's fun side , such as his wonderful laughter while Cajun Mardi Gras women dragged him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , playfully attempting to rob him of his trousers , " Gaudet wrote in a tribute .
" Frank seemed to relish the Louisiana culture , and his articles on New Orleans Mardi Gras are invaluable .
"  De Caro 's work is included in a recently released book , " Downtown Mardi Gras : New Carnival Practices in Post-Katrina New Orleans .
"  " He was just really a nice , gentle and generous kind person who treated everybody the same .
He was really nice to everybody , " Jordan said .
" Of course , we both taught a lot of students at LSU in our years there .
"  The couple had no children .
They moved into Lambeth House in 2017 .
" I guess he had the idea it would be good ; we should be looking around for a retirement place , " Jordan said .
About a year ago , de Caro " had a couple of falls and they decided at Lambeth House he needed to be at St .
Anna 's .
He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He always liked to come back to the apartment , use the computer there .
He could still type and do email , things like that .
"  De Caro had grown up in New York City , attended college at St .
Francis College in Brooklyn and received a masters degree from John Hopkins University Writing Seminars , said a friend and co-author Robin Roberts .
After Katrina , he grew fascinated with stories and urban legends that had cropped up in New Orleans after the storm .
De Caro wrote of how he and other folklorists " ca n't stop thinking about what the narratives may be telling us about the future -- or at least our local visions of it .
"  De Caro might have made some sense of the pandemic , Gaudet wrote , had he survived it .
" It adds to this great sadness that Frank will not be here to help us understand the narratives we 're hearing now .
