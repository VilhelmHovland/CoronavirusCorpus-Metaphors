The spread of coronavirus is making 2020 a weird time for everyone , not least comic book readers .

" The final fight was definitely the most fun part of this first series .
We were building up to it , but we wanted the readers first to connect with the characters so that by the time we start dishing some epic blows they would feel them many times over .

Obviously coronavirus has made it difficult to buy comics in the traditional way , but there are several options .
Many comic stores are offering curbside pickup or mail delivery services ( use the Comic Shop Locator to find contact information for your nearby store , which you can use to find out what services they are offering ) .

" We 're not so arrogant as to think that a really , extremely awesome comic book can fix any of that , but our hope is that reading THE COMIC YOU ALWAYS WANTED can give you -- even momentarily -- a sense of escape .
"  Sitterson and Ossio have been referring to No One Left to Fight this way , as " the comic you always wanted , " because it is such a blend of their favorite genres and stories -- and given fan reactions , the same is true for many readers .
