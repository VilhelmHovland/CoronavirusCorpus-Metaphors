As a self-employed nail technician for the past eight years , Lara 's business was forced to shut up shop due to Covid-19 government restrictions .
" My career came to an abrupt halt .
In my line of work , social distancing is not possible .
My first thoughts were how do I keep my business going and what about the nails ! I had to do something to create an income for myself , and to retain my client base in hope of salvaging my business " .
Lara also says that she has built up a close bond with her clients and she wanted to look after them , even when she ca n't physically be there .
" My clients have become my friends , I care about each and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about how they were going to remove their nails at home .
I 'm a BIG believer in natural nail care so a professional removal is very important .
"  Since starting the drop-off gel service , Lara has been kept busy and was doing deliveries for a three-hour period yesterday , earning herself the nickname " The Nail Santa " from one delighted customer .
Chatting about the inspiration for her idea , Lara says  " Firstly , I 'm hoping that it keeps my clients happy , that their nails will be happy ! And keeps my business ticking over in these tough times " .
