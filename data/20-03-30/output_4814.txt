These Long , Slow Weeks  I usually check the news on my computer or my phone , but sometimes I 'll tap the New York Times app on my iPad , which is old and slow and prone to displaying headlines from several days ago .
Those headlines linger for several confusing seconds before the ones for the current day materialise .
This past Saturday , March 28 , it initially loaded March 10th 's front page : " Coronavirus Updates : Lockdowns , School Closures and Anxiety .
the number of cases in the U .
surpassing 700 .
"  Seconds later , the news for the 28th snapped into place : the number of U .
cases had surpassed 100,000 .
So much of what has seemed extraordinary over the past half-decade feels banal compared to what we 're living through now , as extraordinary moments occur by the minute .
We 're in one of those global disaster movies , at the moment when the whole world realises a meteor is going to bullseye the planet .
We 're learning what we would do , how we would feel , who we would call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorly -- our leaders would react .
How strangely time now seems to move .
Each day is dizzyingly fast , but each week is so long .
There 's a rush of news , the dawning discovery of family or friends or friends of friends who feel sick , who do n't know , who are worried .
My days -- working from home , splitting childcare of toddler twins with my working wife -- are a marathon , the end of each week now unfathomably far away .
I feel unmoored .
When will the worst come ? When will we know ? And when will anything like normalcy resume ? Weeks ? Months ? A year ?  Our disaster is paradoxically sweeping and subtle .
It 's a fight against a virus in which our best defence is distance , in which literally every person on the planet can help by avoiding others , in which nearly overnight , the notion of going to a restaurant or a movie theatre became the stuff of nostalgia ( well , at least to those of you who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who did , that stuff was already a fading memory ) .
No place and no part of life has been untouched .
My email inbox is a proof of that : there 's an alert from my alma mater that commencement is cancelled , a note from our paediatrician that if our kids are sick , they 'll need to do a virtual visit .
Tax day is delayed three months .
The Olympics got kicked back a year .
Here in our corner of interest at Kotaku , we 've seen our own version of the unthinkable on a daily basis : the postponement of the Game Developers Conference , the cancellation of E3 , the dangerous delay of caution by the country 's biggest gaming retail chain .
The makers of Star Wars Battlefront IIcranked up players ' rewards to encourage them to play more at home .
The developers of Final Fantasy XIV started sparing people from virtual evictions .
I even saw players on the Ghost Recon Breakpoint subreddit express happiness for a moment .
That nearly floored me .
It helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch this past Tuesday and that the game 's players recognised that people who made it had worked to provide it during a pandemic .
An epoch ago , on March 18 , I tweeted a question asking how the spread of coronavirus was impacting how people played and make games .
I knew , of course , that gaming was having a weird moment .
As other industries collapsed , gaming was increasing .
How many better things were there to do with all those hours cooped up inside ? My buddy Josh Fruhlinger , who runs a data-crunching website called Thinknum , had been sending me charts about increased Twitch usage and people scrambling to their local GameStops before they 'd be shut down .
I heard from a reader named Mark who was struggling to distract himself by playing the fanciful Xbox game Ori and the Will of the Wisps .
He liked the game , but it was n't providing enough distracting relief .
" Video games are n't so much an oasis in the desert as a glass of lukewarm tap water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick Popovich , who runs the 16-person studio Monomi Park , told me that his team had transitioned to working from home and that he knew that as hard as his employees tried to work , they invariably would not be able to get as much done .
He was fine with that .
" We know that in this current reality that we should expect much less than 100% from our team , " he told me .
" Not because of logistics , but because family and personal health must come first at this time .
"  I checked in with him six days later to find out how things were going .
We agreed that it felt like a lifetime since we 'd communicated the week prior .
" I think we 've adjusted OK to the day-to-day development stuff , " he said .
" But I already miss seeing everyone .
" He reminisced about interacting in person with his team .
" You miss saying good morning to people as they walk in the door , sharing meals , and sharing the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .
" Everything feels a little more mechanical now .
I see progress being made on our games , but it 's sent in over the wire , not seen over the shoulder .
I 'm a little old school in that I value that a lot .
I like to point at screens .
"  My own days have changed to working from home , hours shifted early so I can then take over care for our twins from my wife in the early afternoon .
That lets her work for a full shift before we then put the kids to bed and blearily try to work some more .
My conversations with colleagues are now peppered with apologies for the sounds of my children in the background .
I 'm in the middle of talking by phone with one of my bosses , when suddenly my daughter is in front of me , telling me the shirt she is holding " for boys , " and I 'm flowing from boss talk to letting my daughter know there 's no such thing .
On another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak for the next few seconds because I need to blow up a balloon that little hands have just given me .
And then I need to inflate another .
And another .
On a different call , on the other end of the line , I hear a child 's piano practice and hear that she 'll be having a virtual sleepover the following night .
Ori and the Will of the Wisps ( Screenshot : Microsoft )  All of this is so radically different than anything I 've experienced before , though I recognise the privilege inherent in the size of my discomfort .
The changes that have rippled through our lives may feel sudden , except that these problems are n't all that new .
Even outside of a pandemic , the stresses of childcare without external support , the worries about capricious disease and death , are common for many people .
The President 's callous complacency and his dangerous dismissal of science are not new discoveries .
Congress ' preferential treatment for corporations over citizens is numbingly familiar .
What they 've wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror and a national shame .
This rapid crisis was a long time coming .
There had been time to prepare , to get tests , to make more protective gear , to build some god damn ventilators .
We all knew , right ? Even us over here at the gaming site were publishing warning signs in our own way .
In January , our Kotaku East section , which publishes geek news about Japan and neighbouring countries , reported about the postponement of a Chinese League of Legends event and about a Chinese Chun-Li cosplayer treating coronavirus patients .
, in late February , Kotaku East covered coronavirus xenophobia on the rise in Japan and the decision of a Japanese idol group to penalise fans who did n't wear sickness masks during the pandemic .
There was time .
This meteor was spotted far , far away .
How do we measure the timing of recovery , for those of us fortunate enough to live through this ? When will we know ? I started the new in-game season of The Division 2 recently , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like when the season after is set to begin in July .
Should I suspend my hope until September , when my kids are set to star pre-school ? Or later ? I just got an email StubHub .
" Treat your future self , " it reads , and lists concerts in July , August and October .
None of those are fathomable right now , and they all feel so far away .
Events are racing by , even as time feels stuck .
Thousands are dying , millions are out of work , billions have had their lives changed .
On the other side , what will life be like ? In the movies , we 'd all rally .
In reality , I do n't know .
On the macro scale , I hope we see the will to take other potential global disasters such as climate change more seriously .
On a smaller scale , I hope that we 'll appreciate what can happen in a minute , what our government could do in a week , if it wanted to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe time will never seem the same again .
Maybe , at least , we 'll learn to use it better .
