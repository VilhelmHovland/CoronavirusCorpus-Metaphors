"  Fournier , who works in health and social services , is one of the thousands of Canadians who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 .
She and several other Canadians have shared their stories with The Canadian Press in order to demystify the illness and to urge the public to respect physical distancing measures .
In the days following the onset of her symptoms , Fournier felt panic creeping in as she struggled to get through to anyone on Montreal 's hotlines , which constantly disconnected her .
Later , she had to fight to get tested since she had n't travelled recently and did n't know who infected her .

" It 's scary going through this by myself , " she said .
Kyla Lee , a 33-year-old lawyer from Vancouver , takes issue with those who claim COVID-19 is no more than a bad flu .
Lee , who has no underlying health conditions , says she fell ill a few days after returning from a conference in Ohio and was diagnosed as a presumptive case by a doctor after she began experiencing a fever , fatigue and a deep cough .
The busy lawyer , who rarely pauses in her day and has never taken more than a day or two off for any illness , said that even nearly a week later , on her bad days she 's left gasping for breath on the edge of her bed after just a couple of phone calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said in a phone interview last week .

" It 's an incredibly alienating virus , " Fournier said .
" There 's shame associated with it , " she added .
" How many people did I infect ? Did I infect somebody ? Will I cause somebody to die ? "  At 61 years old , both Julien Bergeron and Manon Trudel are in an age demographic that is more prone to complications than either Lee or Fournier .

"  They say they 're still taking the risk seriously and are staying away from others as they return to life in Quebec .
