What we are watching in Canada .
The House of Commons has passed emergency legislation to free up $82 billion to help Canadians weather the COVID-19 crisis .
After a day of tense negotiations , MPs began debating the bill in the wee hours of Wednesday morning , and a vote took place shortly after .
Government house leader Pablo Rodriguez said it 's now up to the Senate to approve the bill .
Earlier on Tuesday , Conservatives raised objections to what they dubbed a Liberal " power grab .
"  An emergency sitting of the House of Commons was suspended moments after it began as Conservatives balked at provisions that would give the government sweeping powers to unilaterally spend , borrow and change taxation levels without Parliament 's approval for the next 21 months .
Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said early in the day that his party would support emergency efforts to get money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose any attempts by the Liberal government to expand its power .
His warning came before a small group of 32 MPs gathered in the Commons to debate and vote on legislation to deliver $82 billion in financial aid and tax deferrals to individuals and businesses , as proposed last week by the government to deal with COVID-19 and its ensuing economic havoc .
They convened as scheduled .
However , the sitting had only just begun when government the House leader asked that it be suspended so that the government could continue negotiating details of the legislation with opposition parties .

International Development Minister Karina Gould says Canada will spend millions to help the world 's most desperate people fight COVID-19 because it is in the country 's long-term security interest as well as being the right thing to do .
Gould says that 's why Canada has earmarked $50 million , part of its response to today 's launch of the United Nations COVID-19 humanitarian response plan .
In an interview with The Canadian Press , Gould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be focusing instead on Canadians hunkering down at home to limit the spread of the virus .
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is set to launch a $2-billion global appeal today , calling for a co-ordinated response to help the world 's war-torn , displaced and otherwise most destitute people who are facing new misery because of the pandemic .
Guterres has sent a letter to the G20 members , including Canada , urging them to spend more to prevent the virus from spreading like wildfire in developing countries burdened by poor health systems and massive refugee influxes .
Gould says the government needs to help Canadians at home with an $82-billion spending package , but it must also spend $50 million globally to protect Canada 's future security and economic prosperity from a virus that knows no borders .
" The world is connected .
Whatever happens over there , far away , is something that can very easily come to our doorstep .

The stars have n't aligned for astrologers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some writers and editors to move mountains -- or in this case , planets -- to have future horoscopes reflect the changing times .

Governors across the nation rejected President Donald Trump 's new accelerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impose more restrictions on travel and public life in an attempt to curb the spread of the coronavirus .
The dismissal of Trump 's mid-April timeframe for a national reopening came from Republicans and Democrats , from leaders struggling to manage hot spots of the outbreak and those still bracing for the worst .
Maryland Gov .
Larry Hogan , the head of the National Governors Association and a Republican , called the messaging confusing since most leaders are still focused on enforcing the restrictions , not easing them .
He accused the White House of running on a schedule made of some " imaginary clock .
"  The pushback suggests Trump 's talk of an early reboot is unlikely to gain traction .
In most cases , it 's state leaders -- not the federal government -- who are responsible for both imposing and lifting the stay-at-home orders and other restrictions intended to stop the contagion .

" Our people want to return to work , " he said .
