Allegations by the business rescue practitioners of SA Express that the government deliberately withheld financial support from them , and that the state 's approach to the business rescue process was unconstructive are baseless , the Department of Public Enterprises has said .
The department on Sunday issued a statement in reaction to an earlier court application by the business rescue practitioners ( BRPs ) to have the state-owned regional airline liquidated .
The state-owned airline 's business rescue practitioners on March 25 lodged an application in Pretoria High Court for SAX be placed in provisional liquidation .
The BRPs have indicated to the Department that R350 million will be required to save the airline .
They had not received an answer at the time of the liquidation application .
The department , meanwhile , has said it will determine its course of action after studying the liquidation application .
SA Express was placed under business rescue last month due to financial pressures that resulted from years of poor management and state capture , the department said .
The application to place it into business rescue was brought by ZieglerSA , a service provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than R1 .
billion in urgent financial support to SAX for the 2019/20 financial year , including R300 million released last October .
Before SA Express was placed under business rescue , government mandated the board and management to investigate and terminate a number of irregular contracts as a way to save money and root out corruption , according to the department .
In response to the BRPs claims in their liquidation application that they were not getting very far in their attempts to get financial support and feedback from government , the department said it had to follow rigorous legal public finance procedures .
The department said that , although it considered an initial funding proposal from the BRPs , it felt the plan did not meet certain basic requirements and did not set out a credible business case to allow the necessary funding to be unlocked so that a long-term rescue plan could be developed .
Such a long-term business rescue plan needs to take into consideration the commercial viability of the airline " in a competitive and volatile South African aviation sector " , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into consideration the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the airline and the aviation industry .
Earlier this month SA Express had to suspend operations due , in part , to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic .
Fin24 reported last week that the business rescue practitioners for struggling airline SA Express wrote a letter to staff to say that salaries will not be paid on time for March due to " adverse operational challenges " like the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the market .
" It is in this context that the department needed to see a business rescue plan that is resilient so the proposition could withstand a whole new business environment , " the department said .
" The damage done has turned out to be graver than initially assessed .
As a result , the government is not in a position to give further fiscal comfort especially in these difficult economic times and considering the competing priorities .

Fin24 has requested comment from the business rescue practitioners .
