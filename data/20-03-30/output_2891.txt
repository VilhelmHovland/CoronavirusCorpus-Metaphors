Freight Forwarders Beg FG to Waive Demurrage Charges  Due to the current outbreak of COVID-19 , the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders ( NAGAFF ) , on Friday urged the federal government to declare a 21-day force majeure to ensure waiver on charges in the seaports .
The force majeure grants the removal of liability for natural and unavoidable catastrophes that interrupt the expected course of events and restrict participants from fulfilling obligations , in this case the coronavirus .
This call was made by the association in a statement signed by its Secretary General of NAGAFF , Mr Dipo Olayoku , in Lagos on Friday .
" In times of emergency like this , the interest of freight forwarders should be strictly protected .
" This is why we want government to make a categorical statement that will allay the fears of freight forwarders , that they will not bear the brunt of the likely effect of delay in cargo clearance which is bound to occur in this time of national emergency .
" The transport ministry should declare a ' force majeure ' for at least 21 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Mr Olayoku urged the federal government and the Nigeria Shippers ' Council to ensure that shipping lines and terminal operators not exploit freight forwarders through arbitrary charges and demurrage .
Mr Olayoku then also used the opportunity to advise freight forwarders to observe all the precautionary measures announced by the government and agencies tackling the COVID -- 19 and curtail its spread .
" Freight forwarders are reminded of their strategic position in international trade and revenue generation for the government which forbids them from shutting down completely .
" However , at the same time , their health safety should be paramount if they must continue to function effectively and efficiently even after the scourge must have gone .
" For this reason , the NAGAFF management is urging freight forwarders to , apart from observing all the safety measures mentioned above , endeavour to be indoors and transact their freight forwarding businesses online , where possible .
" They should come out only when it is absolutely necessary to transact their businesses at the ports , " he said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping companies , terminal operators , and government agencies involved in port activities should upgrade their systems such that interactions with them could be done online to reduce human contacts in their operations .
He added that in fulfillment of its obligations to freight forwarders and observing social distancing policy of government , NAGAFF 's national headquarters would remain open , but with only few workers .
