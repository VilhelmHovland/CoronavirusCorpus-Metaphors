CS Kagwe dispelled allegations made by Dagoretti South MP John Kiarie that the government was " sugarcoating " the real situation of the Covid-19 pandemic spread in the country .
" Let me make this clear that there is no country on earth that has been able to contain this disease on its own just existing health facilities , and going forward we know , that it is indeed very likely that our health facility can and could be overrun , by just the demands , " said Kagwe .
He added : " And while this may ultimately be the case and even more people may get into quarantine it is simply at the moment not true .
So why would you wish as a leader of a society that 7,000 Kenyans should be in quarantine ? And why would you think that the government is not telling you the truth ? To hide it for what purpose ? It is really disheartening .
"  The Ministry of Health , in collaboration with the county government , is planning to expand the capacity levels in the country , to help accommodate the numbers if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that we are expanding our capacities of intervention measures particularly in the counties .
I continue to urge Kenyans to observe hygiene , given the fact that we have 42 people now who are spread in the counties that we have established .
If you look at the person next to you they might not have any sign that they are sick , but they could well be sick , " the CS added .
