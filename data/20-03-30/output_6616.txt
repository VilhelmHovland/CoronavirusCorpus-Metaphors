)  newestoldestmost voted  Guest  Mike Jasumback  Ok , I realize that we are in a Pandemic , but I hear lots of " I thinks " and " my experience has been " .
I get it , we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no good data , The level of data here is about the same that supports hydroxychloroquine .
The statement " within hours of intubation they need much higher peep than they would otherwise " is fallacious on its face .
I think , I agree that CPAP might be where we end up , and I hope this is true .
Just concerned that this is potentially an issue of selection bias .
Are we subconsciously able to pick out those folks that are sick and thus intubating those who will become sick , and so select those that crash ?  mentioned that it could be selection bias right up front .
Not sure who said , " than they would otherwise , " but I believe the intent of the statement was " then I would have projected based on their preintubation course .
"  The statement I believe I made was that immediately after intubation , these pts require dramatically more PEEP than they did just before intubation .
Many have noticed this phenomenon amongst the resus doctors who have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think it is some subtle spidey sense that is leading many of these pts to be intubated -- it may get to that point , but right now it is b/c we have been told explicitly 6 L NC and then tube as the protocol .
What 's Your Job ?  emcrit  Vote Up0Vote Down Reply  10 hours ago  Guest  Rahat  Hi , I think this is what we are witnessing also by default , what you discussed in this Wee .
We had to start putting patient ' s on BIPAP /CPAP , HFNC with face mask on the patient 's face ( ti limit aerolisation ) and 15 litres NC with 100% mask , rather than letting them die , as we are running out of vents .
We even put 1 patient on BIPAP after intubation .
We are tolerating and watching patient 's with O2 saturations up to 84-85% and the patient 's when patients are talking on their phones , while we stand outside stressing about the question of when to intubate and we cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to whatever we are doing in this desperate /war like situation and trying to do the best we can .
We have to be accepting and adopting new things at a fast pace and just have to learn from each others experience .
We do n't have the luxury of data /trials to come out .
Also things are moving so fast , essentially we are innovating/changing things daily doing things which were initially deemed risky .
Some of the innovations we .

As you guys mention in the podcast and as other commenters have stated , we have to stay flexible and approach this with a open mind and solution-oriented mindset .
I think the enthusiasm for early intubation comes from two places : 1 ) Traditional thinking about sat levels , P/F ratios , etc .
, as you guys discussed ( i .
, cases where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling the drain without aggressive resp support ) .
2 ) Early anticipation of the need for invasive resp support to avoid having to do crash intubations with the attendant risk of suboptimal infectious precautions , resulting in spread of infection to healthcare workers .
I think ( 2 ) maybe has some merit , especially as things get crazier and we start to have people on stretchers in corridors and other non-negative pressure environments .
What do others think about this ?  What 's Your Job ?  Anesthesiology resident  Vote Up1Vote Down Reply  4 hours ago  Guest  Ethan Kunstadt  What 's your recommendation if you do n't have enough negative pressure rooms to do HFNC/CPAP throughout your hospital ? Having following this COVID oxygenation discussion since the beginning , it seems we 've been recommending strongly against NIPPV given concern for aerosol production which led to the : titrate NC O2 to 6L and then intubate idea ; as all these intermediate options were thought to be dangerous to healthcare workers ? It does seem logical that some of these patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need intubation thus if we can avoid it , that would be ideal for many reasons , however now I feel like we 're getting mixed information ( I .
early COVID mantra being early intubation ) .
Any thoughts on keeping a patient on the device you 've posted about earlier rather than just using it as a pre-oxygenation strategy ? I do think this may be technically challenging as the BVM may need to be supported or otherwise pull down on the NIPPV mask , etc .
Based on the paper below -- what 's happening is the virus destroys much of the body 's Hgb , irreversibly deoxygenating it resulting in low SpO2 readings , which can be tolerated if the pt is not anemic .
This is why it is drawing comparisons to HAPE -- which starts out as purely low Hgb O2 saturation AND THEN pulmonary edema develops .
Could a PRBC transfusion provide new Hgb ? Assuming the viral load is low enough to prevent this from recurring  Interesting podcast and I also began wondering about the possible template of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral pneumonia slowly leads to hypoxia beyond which a HAPE-like presentation dominates ) .
I have always been amazed at how well some HAPE patients appear with horrible sats and HAPE does have some similar ground glass findings on CT .
Has there been any data on pulmonary artery pressures in the sickest folks ?  Maybe there is a subset of patients with an exaggerated hypoxic vasoconstrictive response ( these patients are prone to HAPE ) that are worse off .
If so , this might open up a possible therapeutic intervention with nifedipine or sildenafil ( ? )  Best ,  Larry  What 's Your Job ?  Emergency Physician  Vote Up0Vote Down Reply  6 hours ago  Guest  Rikki Lane  That podcast was exactly what I needed to hear before my shift in two hours ! The tachypnea is the crazy thing for me -- pts w breathe over 50 for a while &amp; seem to be pretty ok w it .
Makes me feel better about staying the course .
Do you find any meds help them settle down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using 20 ketamine hoping it might positively affect their respiration and facilitate sort of a trial of of they are going to be able to go w CPAP plan or will require intubation ( conveniently also buys me a few minutes to run to stabilize next patient ) .
If they do n't do well I have been adding more ketamine while I try to optimize preox for intubation .
Thoughts on if there is a role for fentanyl in this " trial " period ?  Thank you for bringing this information into the open .
At a time when rigorous randomized control trials will not express information in a timely , effective or articulate manner , in the interests of providing the best and most up to date care for our patients , " letters " and experience reports from those that have been on the front-line must be seen for their true value .
I concur that " early intubation " may not benefit the individual patient , all the time , every time , COVID or otherwise .
Intubation , like ECMO , can nearly always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upfront to treat a single number or reduce one 's own anxiety -- prior to trialing less harmful modalities -- is poor practice .
Premature intubation carries risk to the patient and the community -- VAP , critical illness neuropathy/myopathy , risk of aerosolization to staff during the intubation/extubation period , sympatholysis associated hemodynamic compromise , and over-utilization of a valuable resource .
In the COVID era , the tools necessary to overcome a difficult ventilator run are often missing -- overworked staff are less capable of titrating the ventilator to the patient , and access to physical therapy is limited due to the risks to the therapists .
Let us not forget the oxygen content equation .
Oxygen content = ( 1 .

sounds like possible major component of vasoplegia of the pulmonary vasculature .
i note reported histology of an adenoca removed -coincidentally from covid patient -- articulates prominent vascular engorgement ! ! maybe something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we usually see in respiratory failure due to other pathologies/pathogens .
we are more often looking for drugs that lower pulmonary vasc resistance .
a brief look for agents that might be used to counter this reveals quite a list of potential agents , some of which have quite favourable risk:benefit profiles eg tramadol i work in a relatively small regional unit with no research facilities or supports and am yet thank goodness to have any covid patients admitted to our icu , so this is entirely hypothetical .
i understand the merits of RCTs and expect there would be opposition to using drugs not proven to work .
nevertheless , with mortalities 40-60% for ventilated patients , is it not unethical to NOT try something with little likely risk .
with the massive numbers of patients currently , it might be possible to power a study relatively quickly .
thanks for giving this hypothesis , your consideration .
btw , thanks too for all .
