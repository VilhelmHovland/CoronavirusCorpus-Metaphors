--  Every Sunday , my husband and I drive 45 minutes from our house in Cambridge to our son Finn 's residential home in Framingham .
Finn is 12 .
For the last three years , he 's lived there with eight other boys .
They are kids , like him , who attend the New England Center for Children .
It 's a school that serves children with autism .
Finn lives there because his needs are beyond what we can provide .
It would be physically dangerous for us , and for him , to keep him at home .
Our weekly visits are sacred to my family .
Every Sunday is crossed off our social calendar .
When we bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to all his favorite spots -- to CVS to buy Tic Tacs and Shaws to buy fried chicken wings .
We go to the local park to watch the dogs run and play .
But our Sunday routine , like many others , was disrupted this month .
Finn 's school has suspended all day programs .
They plan to keep the residential program open as long as possible -- as long as the staff is healthy , they 'll stay open .
In a letter the school wrote us , it read : " If you want your child home , then you are taking them for the duration of the crisis .
"  We ca n't do that .
So , it means that we ca n't see Finn in person anymore .
At least for now .
Now I can only connect with my son through Skype .

Instead of our visits , I sing to him .
I blow him raspberries and make our dog bark .
Anything to make him laugh , a sound I crave .
I ask him : " How much do I love you ? " And he shoots his hands up in the air : " SO much ! " I answer .
I 'm incredibly grateful to Finn 's school .
We are lucky .
His caregivers are dedicated and energetic and considered essential workers by Governor Baker .
But nothing can replace the feeling of his soft touch , his hand in my hand , my fingers through his hair .
We 're all suffering right now .
So many of us are vulnerable .
Please keep the physically , intellectually , and emotionally disabled members of our society in your thoughts , too .
