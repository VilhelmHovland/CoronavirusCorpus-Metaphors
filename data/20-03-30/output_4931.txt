Here are the different stages of Coronavirus spread and how they determine the status of a country :  Stage 1 : Imported Cases  This is the stage when the virus has just entered a country through someone who returned from a foreign country .
India confirmed its first Coronavirus case on January 30 , when a student from Wuhan University returned to Kerala .
In this stage , most of the cases diagnosed are those of people who have traveled history to foreign countries .
Stage 2 : Local Transmission  Since the virus is highly contagious , local transmission takes place when people come in contact with the infected .
Hence , only those people who have been in touch with Coronavirus patients are tested .
