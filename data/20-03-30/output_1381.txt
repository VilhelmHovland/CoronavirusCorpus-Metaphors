Funerals in churches are too risky , say bishops  TO PROTECT people further from the coronavirus , clerics and licensed Readers should only conduct funerals at the graveside or in a crematorium chapel , a letter from the Archbishops and bishops of the Church of England says .
Though current government guidance states that funerals may continue to take place in church buildings , the Archbishops of Canterbury and York , and diocesan bishops , believe that this presents an unnecessary " layer of risk " , owing to the difficulty of cleaning churches .
In a letter to all C of E clergy last Friday , they state : " The medical , epidemiological , and public health advice we have received clearly indicates that this represents an additional layer of risk that we do not need to take .
Cleaning a church building after a funeral is much harder to do than a crematorium chapel .
" Furthermore , the ability of a parish priest to control the number of mourners will always be compromised by the proper instincts to care for the bereaved at the moment of a funeral .
Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost is less likely to be in human lives .
Consequently , we are continuing to ask clergy to conduct funerals at the graveside or in a crematorium chapel .
"  The letter makes no mention of Readers .
It is understood , however , that the central advice applies to anyone licensed to take funerals and that it has been widely circulated to the relevant groups .
The Bishop of Southwark , the Rt Revd Christopher Chessun , who chairs the Church 's coronavirus task group , writes in a separate letter to Readers in his diocese : " The Coronavirus Task Group has been reflecting on the demand for funerals which is sadly going to be inevitable over the coming months .
Readers who have a licence to conduct funerals are going to be much in need .
"  Reader training for funerals is in two parts : a classroom-based module and a practical module that requires experience participating in services .
Bishop Chessun asks Readers who have undergone the first part to contact the Discipleship and Ministry Team to " discuss whether it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already authorised to take funerals and wish to be more involved in this ministry should contact their area dean , he says .
Advertisement  He continues : " We are sending this email to licensed Readers only and not to Readers Emeritus because most of our Readers with Permission to Officiate ( PTO ) are over 70 and are advised to stay at home in all circumstances .
However , if our PTO Readers under 70 want to be involved in this way they should contact their area dean .
"  Church House has published new resources to accompany the latest advice , including specific guidance for clerics on conducting funerals and caring for the bereaved .
Present public health regulations , it states , permit only " a short service at the crematorium , with or without a very small congregation , which may only include spouse/partner , parents , and children of the deceased ; a short service at the graveside , under the same conditions .
"  How many people constitutes a " very small congregation " is not stated .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is providing a PDF copy of the order of service for people unable to attend .
A separate two-page guide includes prayers and suggestions on how people can mourn the loss of loved ones without attending a funeral .
This might be sitting quietly , finding a photograph of the person who has died , writing down memories of the person , or playing a piece of music that has a connection to the deceased .
The Archbishops ' Council 's Head of Welcome and Life Events , Canon Sandra Millar , said : " You might have wanted to support a friend , or show respect , or to say your last goodbye .
Many will not be able to do this now .
" When this time of social distancing is over , there may well be a time to share memories with others , but , for now , people can find comfort from setting aside time at home for a simple reflection , lighting a candle online , or sharing a prayer card with someone else .
God can feel very close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a not-for-profit company that works for the interests of dying and bereaved people , has called on the Government to ban funerals altogether .
A blog post published on its website last Friday stated : " With the heaviest of hearts , today we are going against everything that the Good Funeral Guide has become known for over the years and calling for funerals to be stopped completely .
" The decision to exempt funerals from the current ban on social gatherings was undoubtedly made for compassionate reasons , but the current lack of clear instruction and direction is leading to anguish and suffering beyond imagination .
"  Mourners were risking their lives to gather for funerals that were so stripped-back that they were " almost unrecognisable " , it said .
" What we are left with is worse than nothing .
"  The lack of clear guidance meant that funeral directors and companies were all responding differently , the blog continued .
" Crematorium staff in some places are being required to monitor the numbers of people arriving and restrict entry -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked and the police called if more than a certain number of people gather for a funeral .
Yet in other crematoria , no restrictions have been imposed .
Everywhere is doing things differently .
"  It concluded : " The current confused and confusing situation is dangerous .
It is frightening .
It is unfair on everyone .
Unattended burial or cremations are the safest , kindest , simplest way to deal with our dead right now .
"  Canon Millar responded on Monday : " C of E ministers can still take funerals at graveyards and crematoria , keeping all physical distancing , attendance and hygiene restrictions and encouraging families to record the service and to find ways of being present at a distance .
" We know that it is a very difficult time indeed to be facing death and grief .
Not being able to go to a funeral because of the strict rules on attendance makes it even harder .
The Church is committed to helping people through this , with resources to use at home .
When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memorial service .
" We are also praying for our funeral director colleagues .
They are at the frontline , having to explain the situation to grieving families , manage expectations about graveside and crematoria services , and care for their own staff .
Together , we all want to help in these strange times and help everyone to find comfort and hope in their grief .
