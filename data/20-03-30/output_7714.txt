The West 's COVID-19 Learning Curve  If central bankers and governments can keep financial markets working and prevent mass bankruptcies during the COVID-19 pandemic , then the now unavoidable global recession could be followed by a vigorous recovery once the virus has been contained .
But protecting public health requires Western societies to learn and adapt quickly .
BERKELEY -- Politicians sometimes belittle military leaders with the charge that they always fight the last war .
But that potted wisdom applies equally to policymakers -- and it 's not always a bad thing .
For example , because the memory of the 2008 global financial crisis ( GFC ) remains fresh , governments and central banks have a keen sense that financial markets might collapse at any time .
Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic , they are using every lever at their disposal to avoid a repeat of the financial-market freeze that proved so damaging a decade ago .
The policy reaction to the GFC was somewhat delayed and initially confused , especially in Europe , because policymakers and the public had not experienced a financial crisis or government defaults .
But governments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessons , and are now applying them on a vast scale in an effort to mitigate the pandemic 's economic impact .
Therein lies a second lesson from military history : Armies that have actual combat experience tend to be much stronger .
And it is lack of experience that largely explains the delayed public-health response to COVID-19 on both sides of the Atlantic .
Neither Europe nor the US have experienced a public-health crisis of this magnitude since the 1918-19 Spanish Flu pandemic .
By contrast , Asian countries that had to deal with the severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) epidemic less than 20 years ago reacted much faster to the COVID-19 outbreak , implementing drastic containment measures that enabled them to flatten the contagion curve relatively quickly .
The emerging narrative based on China 's experience -- that dictatorships are better at fighting an epidemic -- is thus wrong .
What made the difference this time was that China and other Asian societies had experienced a similar problem to COVID-19 within living memory .
Project Syndicate is conducting a short reader survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated .
Take Survey  Democracies such as South Korea and Japan can fight a virus as efficiently as a dictatorship .
Indeed , open societies have a distinct advantage over authoritarian states , because unpleasant information can not be denied or suppressed for long , as it initially was in China .
But for Europe and the US , the COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a surprise attack by a hitherto unknown enemy .
So , it is no wonder that governments ' initial public-health response has been belated and disorganized .
This botched response is also why financial markets are now reacting so violently .
Initially , investors had expected a sharp but short recession , followed by a V-shaped recovery .
But as European and US public authorities dithered , the virus took hold -- and markets started to panic .
Without intervention , COVID-19 cases seem to multiply by a factor of 4-5 in one week and 20 in two weeks , and potentially can increase by a factor of more than a hundred in a single month .
The price of a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the current crisis has not been caused by a build-up of internal imbalances , such as excessive lending to US homeowners or to weak peripheral states in Europe .
Rather , it is the prospect of a prolonged period of enforced inactivity -- and of waves of bankruptcies , from airlines to restaurants -- that is driving valuations down .
Given the uncertainty about how the health crisis will evolve , investors are trying to sell all risky assets and hunker down .
This " mad dash for cash " leads to a chain of fire sales that disrupt normal commercial relationships and threaten the very functioning of markets .
Fortunately , central bankers , with the GFC firmly in mind , are trying to prevent this kind of doom loop .
The US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have initiated enormous programs to buy everything that scared investors want to dump right now .
The hoarding of cash in a crisis has been compared to the panic buying of toilet paper currently in evidence almost everywhere .
But whereas the supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , central banks can create unlimited amounts of money instantaneously .
There is thus little doubt that monetary policymakers ultimately can calm markets .
But restoring calm will not be enough , because only larger companies depend on capital markets for financing .
By contrast , small and medium-size enterprises , which even in the US employ over four-fifths of the total workforce , rely on bank financing and the continuous cash flow from sales .
This crucial sector is thus not much affected by financial-market gyrations .
So , while central banks can ensure that the financial plumbing continues to function during the COVID-19 pandemic , they can not do much to help millions of small businesses survive a lengthy period without sales .
Governments must step in with generous loan and other support programs to prevent mass bankruptcies .
And with the experience of 2008-09 still fresh in their memory , they are doing so on a grand scale , albeit in very different ways from one country to another .
The global economy eventually will restart , because all its capital , technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests that consumers will largely resume their previous spending patterns , as happened even after the Spanish Flu .
Although that virus returned more than once , mainly because of the patchy nature of public-health systems at the end of World War I , the globalrecession lasted less than a year .
If the combined efforts of central bankers and governments can keep financial markets working and prevent mass bankruptcies , then there is a good chance that the now unavoidable global recession will be followed by a vigorous recovery once the virus has been contained .
But this requires Western societies to adapt and learn quickly how to protect public health .

After the 2008 financial crisis , we learned the hard way what happens when governments flood the economy with unconditional liquidity , rather than laying the foundation for a sustainable and inclusive recovery .
Now that an even more severe crisis is underway , we must not repeat the same mistake .
