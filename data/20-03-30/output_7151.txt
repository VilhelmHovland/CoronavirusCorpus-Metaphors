NEW YORK ( AP ) -- A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived Monday in New York City as the number of deaths in the state from the outbreak climbed quickly .
Mayor Bill de Blasio said President Donald Trump 's suggestion that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals is " insulting " to front-line medical workers .
The latest coronavirus developments in New York :  -- -- --  DEATH COUNT RISES  The number of reported coronavirus deaths in New York shot up by 253 in a single day to just over 1,200 , a number Gov .
Andrew Cuomo called " staggering .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of pain , that 's a lot of tears , that 's a lot of grief that people all across this state are feeling , " the governor said at a briefing in Manhattan .
Cuomo sounded the mournful note even as a Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived in New York City .
State officials expect the number of deaths to continue to rise as the outbreak reaches its projected peak in the coming weeks .
" Whatever the numbers is , it 's going to be staggering , " Cuomo said .
" We 've lost over 1,000 New Yorkers .
"  " To me , we 're beyond staggering already , " he said .
The state has already confirmed more than 66,000 cases , mostly in New York City .
There are 9,500 people in New York currently hospitalized for COVID-19 .
-- -- --  HOSPITAL SHIP  A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived Monday morning in New York City to help relieve the coronavirus crisis gripping the city 's hospitals .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City after 9/11 , will be used to treat non-coronavirus patients while hospitals treat people with COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus .
Andrew Cuomo told reporters the ship will relieve stress on city hospitals as the massive white vessel pulled into a cruise ship terminal off Manhattan .
In addition to the 1,000 beds , the Comfort has 12 operating rooms that could be up and running within 24 hours .
The ship 's arrival comes as New York state 's death toll from the coronavirus outbreak climbed Sunday above 1,000 , less than a month after the first known infection in the state .
Most of those deaths have occurred in just the past few days .
New York City , the epicenter of the U .
outbreak , reported Sunday that its toll had risen to 776 .
The total number of statewide deaths is n't expected to be released until Monday , but with at least 250 additional deaths recorded outside the city as of Sunday morning , the state 's total fatalities was at least 1,026 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City health care workers have died of the coronavirus , days after the first confirmed death .
De Blasio announced Sunday the deaths of Freda Ocran , a psych educator at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx , and Theresa Lococo , a pediatric nurse at Kings County Hospital .
Ocran was previously the head nurse of the psych unit at Jacobi and was working , in part , to support her mother in Africa , de Blasio said .
On March 20 , Ocran changed her profile picture on Facebook to include a mantra familiar to people on the front lines of the coronavirus fight : " I ca n't stay home .
I 'm a healthcare worker .
"  Lococo had worked for the city 's hospital system for 48 years , de Blasio said .
Last week , Mount Sinai West emergency room nurse Kious Kelly died Tuesday after a 10-day bout with the virus .
-- -- --  MEDICAL MASKS  De Blasio and others criticized Trump for suggesting with no clear evidence that thousands of medical masks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sunday briefing , the president told reporters they should be asking , " Where are the masks going ? Are they going out the back door ? "  Those remarks are " insulting " to hospital workers on the front lines of the city 's coronavirus crisis , de Blasio said Monday .
" It 's incredibly insensitive to people right now who are giving their all , " he said .
" I do n't know what the president is talking about .
"  Hospitals had warned staff early on during the outbreak to not take masks home with them , but no evidence has emerged of large-scale looting of supplies .
Kenneth Raske , president of the Greater New York Hospital Association , said in a statement that the workers " deserve better than their president suggesting that protective equipment is ' going out the back door ' of New York hospitals .
"  -- -- --  BAR BUSTED  Police in New York City have caught the first bar owner to violate a coronavirus shutdown by running a speakeasy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York Post said that officers arrested 56-year-old Vasil Pando after they found a dozen people drinking and gambling at a Brooklyn sports bar that was supposed to keep its doors closed during the crisis .
It said Vasil was facing illegal sale of alcohol and other criminal charges .
A name for an attorney was n't listed in court records on Monday .
The report comes a day after Blasio warned of more stringent social-distancing measures , including fines of up to $500 if they refused police orders to disperse .
New Yorkers have " been warned and warned and warned again " and deserve fines " if they have n't gotten the message by now , " he said .
