Edcon says it lost R400-million in the two weeks prior to lockdown and expects to lose R800-million more during the 21-day lockdown .
The giant Edcon group , which owns the Edgars and Jet retail brands , is on the brink of business rescue and possible collapse as the state of national disaster and subsequent lockdown dries up the cash flow of the already troubled business .
CEO Grant Pattison told suppliers late last week that there was only enough money to pay salaries in March and creditors would therefore have to wait to be paid .
He said March was always a difficult month for the company 's cash flow and this had been exacerbated by a 45% drop in sales as consumers began cutting back on non-essential purchases in the two weeks prior to the lockdown being announced .
Pattison estimated that R400 million had already been lost and a further R800 million could be lost during lockdown .
Edcon also expects a rise in customer bad debt due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic .
Post-lockdown reopening strategy being planned -- but may be unsuccessful  Edcon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the post-lockdown period , but Pattison is on record as saying that he was unsure if this would even be possible , given the group 's long-standing woes and the general state of the economy .
" We will be heavily dependent on business support packages offered by government and other agencies and funders , " said Pattison .
According to Business Day , he noted that while the company was counting on government support , everything was happening so fast that the government also needed " breathing room " to work out how to kick-start the economy when the lockdown ended .
Business rescue for Edcon may be on the cards once lockdown ends  Suppliers were also warned that business rescue could be on the cards once lockdown ends .
Business rescue is a procedure aimed at rehabilitating a financially distressed company and would typically involve the restructuring of the business and its finances and processes .
Should this be unsuccessful , liquidation will usually follow .
" I am unable to make you any promises other than keep you updated of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning it would be prudent to consider that orders already placed with you may be cancelled , " Pattison told suppliers .
In an interview with Fin 24 , Evan Robins of the Old Mutual Investment Group said Edcon was the weakest of the retailers and had been on life support for a long time .
" It had no safety net because it was in financial difficulty for a long time -- a bit like SAA South African Airways in a way .
When it was ' saved ' , everyone wondered how long it would last .
"  In 2019 , Edcon received R2 .
billion from the Public Investment Corporation and other lenders .
It was also given a rent reduction by landlords in return for equity .
