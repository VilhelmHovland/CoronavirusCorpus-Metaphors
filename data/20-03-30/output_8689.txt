" Though news of the coronavirus pandemic has been discouraging , NBA executives still cling to hope of arranging a one-site , fan-less , 16-team playoff and a five-to-seven-game regular-season prelude , according to multiple NBA sources .
The playoffs could be reduced to a slew of best-of-three series across the board .
A single-elimination format has been all but ruled out -- only under consideration as a last resort , " Berman reports .
Las Vegas , Orlando , Atlantic City , Hawaii and Louisville have been mentioned as possible place to host the playoffs .
" They 're very determined to have a champion , " one industry source said .
" Nothing is off the table , " another league official said .
The NBA wants to do whatever it can to finish the season , but everything will be dictated with how bad COVID-19 gets from here on out .
