Wuhan hedge funds show traders in virus lockdown can still make money  As some of the world 's biggest hedge fund stars watch returns evaporate , managers in Hubei , the original epicenter of the coronavirus , are weathering the storm .
Even though the central Chinese province has been under lockdown since late January , funds based there managed a 1 .
return on average in February , data compiled by consultancy Shenzhen PaiPaiWang Investment &amp; Management Co .
show .
That 's almost on par with the average 2% for hedge funds nationwide in China and significantly better than the 3 .
slide in the benchmark Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index that month .
Some of Hubei 's top performers chalked up returns above 30% , and almost 80% posted gains for the month .
Every money manager in Hubei was trapped at home for the period , trading from their personal computers , with some video-taping transactions with their mobile phones for compliance reasons .
Market moves were analyzed and dissected on WeChat .
" The internet connection was certainly slower but the impact on trading itself was n't that significant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wuhan-based Fenghong Asset Management , a hedge fund with about 30 million yuan ( $4 .
million ) under management .
Fenghong 's Ziteng No .
, a low-frequency fund that trades commodities futures , gained 31% in February after its algorithm-based model captured price trends from pure terephthalic acid ( a compond used to make polyester ) to iron ore and rebar .
WeChat Meetings  That made Fenghong Asset the top performer among 146 Hubei-run strategies tracked by PaiPaiWang .
The province is home to about 100 hedge fund firms , with 87 based in the capital city of Wuhan .
Although Chinese stocks were down overall last month , February was a volatile period .
A rally in 5G telecom firms and new-energy automobile stocks helped Shangyang Asset Management , which manages around 30 million yuan .
Two of its products rose as much as 41% through Feb .
25 , according to Chief Risk Officer Hong Yin .
Hong said the team , which meets daily on WeChat , decided to pocket gains over the next few days and switch into other stocks .
As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 16% respectively , she said , making them the second- and third-best performers in Hubei .
Still , while the lockdown helped limit panic selling , as well as the spread of the virus , it has hindered hedge fund firms ' plans for new product launches .
Most are small and do n't have established partnerships with large distributors .
Before the outbreak , Fenghong Asset hired a team from Shanghai for a new quant stock product but that 's been put on hold because the staff ca n't come to Wuhan for due diligence and to hammer out cooperation details .
" We should be launching that fund right now , " Wan said .
Red Tape  Wuhan Youwin Capital , meanwhile , planned four new products for the first quarter , which the firm hoped would double assets under management from about 50 million yuan currently .
It only managed to launch one product before the outbreak started .
A second is caught in red tape after Youwin Capital could n't open a trading account over the counter in person at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other registration procedures were complete , according to Chief Investment Officer Li Jin .
Investors who have pledged money to the new products can only wait , anxiously watching the market moving up and down as brokerages remain closed , Li said .
As stocks rallied , clients were " nagging us like everyday " to start trading , Li said .
" Now they 've stopped , after having avoided the recent declines in an unexpected way .
"  Hubei 's campaign against the virus is making steady progress .
After a few days of no new infections , residents are gradually being allowed to walk around inside their neighborhoods .
That gives Li hope .
" Maybe in one or two weeks " the securities brokerages will re-open for business , he said .
" We 're finally seeing a light at the end of the tunnel .
