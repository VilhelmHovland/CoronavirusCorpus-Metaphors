As she still could n't breathe properly , she decided to book a face-to-face appointment with a GP on Friday March 20 .
" I manage to walk there but that was painful and made me super tired , " she said .
" I had almost no energy and any movement like positioning my body -- sitting more or less -- going to the bathroom would exhaust me and it would make me cough and then I would not be able to breath properly .
" Any type of movement would make me exhausted and cough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop coughing .
My body had difficulties handling the little walk to get there .
I avoided taking paracetamol since the day before so we could check my temperature .
" I was sweating so much because my cough was so intense .
My abs and most of my body could n't stop contracting .
"  Ms Clement said she had been simultaneously coughing and crying the three days before she could finally go to hospital .
