Seanna Adcox/Staff  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant hurricane , carving a destructive path in other places first but soaking us in a familiar kind of anxiety .
Would the coronavirus really hit South Carolina ? Was it a bunch of hype ? Was n't it just like the flu ? Maybe it will just brush by , like an outer band ?  Mike Schmidt , an epidemiologist in Charleston , had seen it coming .
On New Year 's Day , he was at home , going through emails when a report caught his eye : an outbreak of pneumonia in China .
Probably from a new coronavirus .
That could be bad , he thought .
Days later , he bumped into a business manager at the Medical University of South Carolina .
" I think you should plan on virtual classes in a few months , " he told her .
She looked back at him as if he was nuts .
At about the same time , the Rev .
Jeremy Rutledge was listening to the BBC when he heard a story from China about a new virus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lung disorder that requires him to take medications that suppress his immune system .
But it was an exciting time at his church : new programs , new budget , guest speakers , church trips .
And that virus was an ocean away .
That January and February , Brooke Warden also was busy : preparing her restaurant Pink Cactus for the spring 's tourism surge .
She hired new employees , tweaked the menu .
The state 's economy was booming , nowhere more than in Charleston .
Her restaurant would finally blossom , as she 'd dreamed .
And across the Cooper River in Mount Pleasant , Renee Smith juggled her two young children 's schedules with her clothing boutique .
She 'd heard about a virus , but with her store opening soon , she barely had time to think about anything , much less a faraway illness .
But , from China , storms of contagion soon struck South Korea and Italy .
At first , the Trump Administration downplayed the risk to the United States .
Then , in late February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , killing 35 people .
Like twisters , cases popped up in Boston and New York and Louisiana .
The NBA suspended its season .
Major League Baseball cancelled spring training .
The White House halted travel from China , then Europe .
On March 6 , South Carolina health officials announced our first two cases , one in Charleston and another in Kershaw County .
Henry McMaster and Linda Bell , the state 's epidemiologist , urged residents not to panic .
On Sunday , March 15 , the state logged nine new cases , bringing the total to 28 .
The governor closed all public schools .
As we barreled into Monday , South Carolina was firmly planted in the cone of uncertainty .
Then , over the week that followed , for four people in Charleston -- for all of us really -- everything changed .
Michael Schmidt , a professor in the Medical University of South Carolina 's Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology , has been studying the antimicrobial benefits of copper for more than a decade .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , Mike Schmidt watched the coronavirus cases spread as he 'd first predicted .
He was frustrated by the sense of denial he saw from the White House .
It seemed to him that the president did n't want to think about it .
At a late February rally in North Charleston , Trump had called the coronavirus the Democrats ' " new hoax .
" Schmidt was appalled by the finger pointing at China .
A new virus could have just as easily been created in the Midwest .
But Schmidt was fascinated by the scientific challenge .
He 'd always wanted to understand how things ticked .
When he was 6 , his mother bought him a telescope .
He shocked her by taking it apart instead of gazing at the stars .
In college , he got hooked on studying microbes .
One day in the lab , he watched a mixture turn colors , from beige to fire engine red as bacteria converted a poison into selenium , a natural and neutral element .
The power of microbes in action .
That Halloween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
These microbes , viruses and bacteria , were so small you needed a microscope to see them , but they had immense powers to heal as well as harm .
Over time , Schmidt built a national reputation for his microbe research .
As an epidemiologist and immunology professor at MUSC , he worked on ways to coax bacteria to eat carcinogens polluting groundwater at the Savannah River Site , the sprawling nuclear reserve near Aiken .
He and his colleagues did groundbreaking research into copper and its ability to kill microbes .
He pushed hospitals to coat doorknobs and bed rails with copper , a move that could save tens of thousands of lives .
At first , researchers used form-fit copper covers attached to hospital beds to test how effective the tool was in killing bacteria .

Sarah Pack/MUSC/Provided  Sarah Pack/MUSC  Now , with the coronavirus spreading , the stakes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were disturbing -- between 1 and 3 percent .
A pandemic could easily affect hundreds of millions of people , meaning millions of lives hung in the balance .
He knew the scientific community was in a furious race to understand the disease , which now had the vaguely corporate name , COVID-19 .
In a matter of weeks , scientists had mapped its genetic structure .
Scientists and clinicians were working on vaccines and new treatments .
Sharing discoveries and innovations would be key to winning this race , so Schmidt began organizing an international summit on the disease .
But he knew the coronavirus was moving faster .
In early March , when state health officials announced the first two cases , Schmidt told people that he expected cases to double every six days .
THE PASTOR  On the surface , the Lowcountry still felt normal last weekend , even as it hid an undercurrent of uncertainty .
People still flocked to the beaches .
At Sullivan 's Island , hundreds put down blankets , strolled in the surf and tossed tennis balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sat elbow-to-elbow .
Along nearby Coleman Boulevard in Mount Pleasant , diners still packed Page 's Okra Grill .
In downtown Charleston , carriages and tourists still clogged streets .
But the Rev .
Jeremy Rutledge , pastor of Circular Congregational Church , sensed a shift .
It had gotten real for him just a week before .
He 'd been standing in Lance Hall , the church 's historic reception space , for an exhibition of retired surgeon Richard " Duke " Hagerty 's paintings , surrealist renderings of the Stations of the Cross , a story of suffering .
The two men had bowed to one another instead of shaking hands , amused by these new changes in social norms .
Rutledge had taken such recommendations to heart early on .
He 'd lived with a lung disorder for almost a dozen years .
Two immuno-suppressant medications kept him stable and healthy , yet left him at high risk of catching sicknesses .
As they chatted , Rutledge mentioned his diagnosis .
With each word of explanation , he watched the doctor 's expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of here , " Hagerty warned .
" You 're exactly the person this virus is looking for .
"  Rutledge had thought hard about that , then about his congregation : the elderly , the people he knew on chemotherapy .
Church is an intimate place .
People hug , kiss , hold hands , cry , laugh , share loaves of bread and -- at some other churches -- even drink from the same cup , a wipe of a white cloth between them and the next person 's viruses .
For a few days , Rutledge mulled options , then decided he had no choice .
He 'd call off the March 15 Sunday services , the in-person kind at least , and instead record a video .

Whitaker/ Staff  By Andrew Whitaker **28;2492;TOOLONG  THE MOM  Monday answered some questions but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast , but its true presence remained cloaked by the state 's failure to do widespread testing .
South Carolina now had 33 likely COVID-19 cases , the Department of Health and Control said .
The state also recorded its first death , an elderly patient in a Lexington County long-term care facility .
But hospitals had only started testing people , MUSC the week before in West Ashley and Roper St .
Francis today at a new drive-thru operation in North Charleston .
More tests likely meant more cases .
No one knew how bad it really was .
McMaster repeated in a press conference : " There is no shortage of testing capabilities in South Carolina .
" Yet , time and again , hospital staffers told people with suspicious symptoms to self-quarantine instead of come for tests .
Some reported that they could quickly run short of testing supplies .
So Monday was a mix of the normal and surreal .
A Carnival Sunshine cruise ship bellied up to the port terminal at the foot of Market Street , returning from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their belongings , social media sites ignited with furious comments from locals .
How could the city and port let a bunch of passengers come ashore without any screening ?  Every hour brought more news , more changes .
The Dow sank almost 3,000 points , a one-day collapse we had n't seen since the Black Monday dives in 1929 and 1987 .
The nation 's high-flying economy was grounded .
Across South Carolina , cancellations and postponements flooded us like another rain bomb : the Bridge Run , the Summerville Flowertown Festival , our rites of Spring washed away for the year .
Cities and towns , including Charleston and Columbia , declared states of emergency .
State leaders began to talk in more dire terms .
During the previous week , Gov .
McMaster and Bell , the state epidemiologist , had urged residents to remain calm .
But on Sunday , McMaster had ordered schools to close .
And on Monday , after the White House declared a national emergency , McMaster declared one in South Carolina , as well .
Parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasant .
***  With school canceled , Smith stared into the eyes of her two young children and wondered how she would fill the hours .
She was a former elementary school teacher , so her instinct was to make a schedule .
She knew the importance of keeping a routine for children -- and their parents .
She grabbed a white board and crafted a new way of life : Wake up at 6:30 a .
, eat breakfast , morning walk , academic time , iPad time , creative time , chores , academic time , outside time .
She hung the board above a bottle of hand sanitizer .
The family 's overall plan : She would stay home with the children , while her husband went to his job at Boeing .
They would all eat dinner together , then she would do her work at night .
She 'd run Subtle and Sass , an online clothing boutique , from her house , but had just opened a brick-and-mortar version in a Mount Pleasant shopping center .
She 'd been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been her biggest sales months so far .
But the coronavirus had reshuffled her priorities .

He 'd rather meet you in a coffee shop than talk over the phone .
He 'd rather talk on the phone than send an email .

He pulled out one with a picture of a bird , a painted bunting .
Inside , he wrote to an emergency room nurse in his congregation .
Rutledge , a former hospital chaplain , knew what it meant to work with those in pain .
He penned his thanks , then added a prayer for strength .
He knew these people -- our nurses , doctors , emergency room workers -- they would be our front-line defenders as the storm worsened .

Whitaker/ Staff  By Andrew Whitaker **28;2551;TOOLONG  THE MOM  By Tuesday , Renee Smith had rearranged a room in her house to create a homeschool classroom .
Initially , her first-grade daughter Juna and , especially , 4-year-old Collin were n't down with this new schedule , new teacher .
Juna was ornery , and Collin threw a tantrum .
As Smith made one decision , another arose .
She and her other friends with children were debating how much they should let their kids play together .
A close friend had just called , a nurse , who said she was n't allowing any play dates .
None .
Alarmed , Smith hung up , wondering how worried she should be .
How dangerous was this virus ? Her children would be beyond stir-crazy in just a few days .
So would she .
And Juna 's birthday ? It was on Wednesday .

Usually , they held big parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house .

And presents .
And giggling .
Until now .
Smith settled on a compromise .
She would allow each child to have one " quarantine friend , " in Juna 's case , her best friend Polly Dietrich , who lives a few streets over .
Polly -- and Polly alone -- could come over for Juna 's newly downsized party tomorrow .

Email  THE RESTAURANT OWNER  Brooke Warden had mostly ignored the news about the coronavirus .
Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get scared ; there would be lots of hype , then it would come and go .
She was from Charleston , a place with a long history of storms and traumas and scars .
And she had a restaurant to run .
She 'd gone to the School of Arts in North Charleston and then the College of Charleston , studying art but finding a sense of mission and camaraderie in the city 's exploding restaurant scene .
She started first as a server at EVO Pizza in North Charleston , then worked at McIntosh , S .
and Chez Nous .
Soon , she dreamed of opening her own restaurant with a Mexican theme .
She found an investor who was impressed by her determination , and on March 8 , 2019 , they opened Pink Cactus on Spring Street .
She was just 29 at the time , and she liked to tell people that she was probably the youngest restaurant owner in Charleston .
She hired a chef , Caroline DuFresne .
Just 20 years old , DuFresne liked to say she was the youngest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , business had mostly been normal until the weekend .
Suddenly , more of her friends and customers were talking about the disease .
She called her investors and accountants for their thoughts .
It 's going to be bad , they told her .
She normally closed the restaurant on Mondays , and when she reopened Tuesday , her world had changed .
She did just $100 in business that afternoon .
Her payroll costs were more than $400 .
Her anxiety rose .
She spoke in rapid bursts , her mind spinning with questions and scenarios .
She knew that other cities had ordered their restaurants to shut down .
That could be catastrophic .
The restaurant business was all about momentum : buying food , preparing food , serving food .
Stop that momentum , and it would take time to recover .
Some restaurants would stop forever .
Would hers ?  That Tuesday afternoon , she thought about her options while checking the news on her phone .
Then word came from the governor 's office : Gov .
McMaster had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still offer delivery and takeout .
At 4 p .
, she sent Caroline home .
Caroline was aggravated .
Brooke was near tears .
The entire industry seemed to be collapsing on itself .
Two large restaurant groups , Indigo Road , which she had worked for , and The Neighborhood Dining Group , were shutting down across the board .
A trio of carriage tour companies announced similar plans .
Suddenly , 1,600 people were out of work .
She thought , what else could they do ? They were large operations with large expenses .
Not much flexibility .
What could she do ? Her voice quivered .
" I 'm freaking out , " she said .
" We 're in survival mode .
"  The scene replayed itself across the city in one restaurant after another .
By nighttime , many restaurants were closed .
Upper King , the lifeblood of the city 's nightlife , was all but shuttered , save for a bar serving takeout and a lone worker scooping cones in Republic Ice Cream .

ILE/NIAID-RML/AP  THE VIROLOGIST  Wednesday morning , Mike Schmidt sat in his office at MUSC in front of his laptop , about to teach class .
Behind him , books filled shelves and a white coat hung from a hook .
At 11 a .
, about 100 dental students signed on .
Today 's lecture ? Microbes and their amazing ability to wreak havoc on our teeth , even invade our brains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his students had lots of questions about the pandemic , as well .
" We 're going to be dealing with this virus for the rest of the summer , " he said into his laptop 's camera .
" It 's going to disrupt the plans of many of you .
" He predicted that there will be more social distancing " and maybe a hard quarantine here as they 're having in San Francisco .
"  A student asked : Would it be as bad here as Italy ?  " The answer to the question is yes .
We are trailing Italy literally by two or three weeks .
I feel your frustration as much as anyone else .
" You all are under 45 years old , and you might get it and it will probably be like getting a bad cold .
But for those of us over 60 , we 're in bad shape .
We 're not afraid of you .
We 're afraid of the virus .
"  After the lecture , he urged his students to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , he said , in the morning before you drink coffee or something cold , midday and at night .

Gavin McIntyre/Staff  By Gavin McIntyre **28;2611;TOOLONG  THE RESTAURANT OWNER  After Tuesday 's shock , Brooke Warden had an idea .
She knew that many food and beverage industry workers relied on " staff meals " or " family meals " made by colleagues in the restaurant .
So she posted a notice on her Instagram account : The restaurant would give away free bowls of rice and beans to food and beverage workers .
" I know the struggles financially and the fear of not knowing when you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday .
By Thursday morning , more than 250 people liked the post .
She went to the US Foods Chef Store in Charleston 's Neck to stock up on rice and beans and carry-out supplies .
In the kitchen , her chef , Caroline DuFresne , started cooking .
Friends and acquaintances stopped by to encourage her .
One who had just been laid off said he 'd work for free .
For a moment that day , a beam of pride broke through her clouds of anxiety .
This was what Charleston was about , she thought .
Resilience , people supporting each other , the Charleston that made it through hurricanes , the Charleston that unified after the Emanuel AME Church shooting , the Charleston that had seen traumas come and go for 350 years .

The stock market continued its swan dive .
Unemployment claims in South Carolina rose 400 percent .
The College of Charleston postponed Spring commencement .
On-campus students were supposed to move out by Monday .

Beach communities began making plans to shut them down altogether .
More test results rolled in : 21 new likely cases Thursday , 45 on Friday , including two more deaths , and 46 on Saturday -- at least 173 cases now in two-thirds of South Carolina 's counties .
The changes came at such speed that it seemed to distort time .
Major events , such as South Carolina 's Democratic Primary , felt as if they 'd happened long ago .
At the same time , with workplaces and schools closed , many of us were confronted with a different and slower pace , as if we were evacuating in place , waiting .
By week 's end , Mike Schmidt had begun to solidify how he would teach his students in the coming weeks .
His international summit on COVID-19 was coming up this Monday .
He 'd fielded calls from journalists across the country about his copper research .
Preliminary evidence showed that copper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More reason than ever for hospitals to install copper bed rails and door knobs .

But things would likely remain uncertain for a while .
Football season ? He figured there would n't be any real contact sports until 2021 .
Late Friday , from his home near Hampton Park , he continued his plans for the summit .
It would be a late night .
In Mount Pleasant , Renee Smith loaded her kids into their minivan .
It was a beautiful spring morning , and they were headed to the beach .

" Chicken , steak , queso , feeds four people , " she shouted to Caroline in the kitchen .
At his home , Jeremy Rutledge pondered his sermon , trying to put the 23rd Psalm into the new context of this new world .

He spoke of reducing forever into days .
