Chemical and oil companies to slash capex  DUBAI , 7 days ago  In the wake of the coronavirus and collapse in crude oil prices , chemical , and oil and gas , and midstream companies will all slash capital spending ( capex ) for growth projects to preserve cash .
As a result , the US and global chemical investment wave looks to slow considerably in the years ahead , writes Joseph Chang , Global Editor , ICIS Chemical Business .
While major US chemical projects under construction should continue , the fall in Brent crude oil prices and the shrinking of the Brent/US Henry Hub natural gas ratio from the 30s to the mid-teens " puts into question the economics long term " , said Kevin Swift , chief economist of the American Chemistry Council ( ACC ) speaking on an ICIS webinar on the economic outlook on March 19 .
" This creates an awful lot of uncertainty , and decision-makers do n't like uncertainty , " he added .
This year , US-based Dow had already taken down its capex plan to $1 .
billion for 2020 from $2 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on CNBC 's Mad Money programme with Jim Cramer , CEO Jim Fitterling said the company would struggle to meet even the lowered $1 .
billion capex target because of limitations on the movement of contractors and engineers given the coronavirus outbreak .
On March 18 , Shell announced the temporary suspension of work on its 1 .
tonne/year cracker under construction in Monaca , Pennsylvania to prevent the spread of the coronavirus .
No timeframe was given for when work would resume .
For Dow , after having paid down around $2 billion in debt in 2019 , it would like to pay off another $500m-$1 billion in debt in 2020 , said Fitterling .
At the end of 2019 , Dow had net debt of $14 .
billion .
Dow is in the process of starting up its Texas-9 cracker expansion adding 500,000 tonnes/year of ethylene capacity in Freeport by mid-Q2 .
Among other project plans are a 130,000 tonne/year ethylene expansion in Western Canada by H1 2021 and a 600,000 tonne/year polyethylene ( PE ) plant on the US Gulf Coast for an H2 2022 start-up .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all capital and operating spending , including its planned Geismar 3 project in Louisiana which would add 1 .
tonnes/year of methanol capacity .
Construction on the plant started in late 2019 with planned start-up for mid-2022 .
In late January , Methanex announced it was broadening its search for a strategic partner for Geismar 3 .
OIL COMPANIES TO PULL BACK  Major oil companies will also cut capex plans for 2020 and beyond in response to the collapse in oil prices .
Importantly , many of these companies had aggressive plans for petrochemical capacity expansion , as they shifted their focus away from transportation fuel and towards chemicals for future growth .
While oil companies have not yet specifically mentioned cuts to chemical projects , all investments should see an impact .
Saudi Aramco , the world 's largest oil producer , is slashing 2020 capex from an expected $35-40 billion range indicated in its IPO prospectus , to a level of $25-30 billion .
This is also down from capex of $33 billion in 2019 .
Aramco 's capex plans for 2021 and beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one knows precisely the impact on economic activity and energy demand from the coronavirus outbreak , especially in the longer term , and additional efficiencies may be required , " said Aramco chief financial officer Khalid Al-Dabbagh , on the company 's Q4 earnings conference call .
Aramco has the most ambitious petrochemical expansion plans of any company , with multiple new cracker and derivative projects in Saudi Arabia , China , India and the US .
It had planned to spend around $100 billion towards petrochemical expansions over a decade .
US-based ExxonMobil said on March 16 it is considering significant cuts to capex and operating expenses .
The company is building a 1 .
tonne/year joint venture cracker complex with Sabic in Corpus Christi , Texas with a planned start-up in H1 2022 , and is planning a cracker complex in China as well .
Other oil companies have also announced capex cuts , including Occidental Petroleum , Apache and Marathon Petroleum .
More will surely follow .
MIDSTREAM CAPEX CUTS  North American midstream energy companies are also busy taking down capex plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chopping 2020 capital spending by between Canadian dollar ( C$ ) 900m to 1 .
billion ( $625-764m ) to a level of C$1 .
billion .
A number of projects will be deferred , including Pembina 's investment in the Canada Kuwait Petrochemical Corp ( CKPC ) petrochemicals joint venture -- which involves building an integrated propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene ( PDH/PP ) complex in Alberta .
A number of other midstream energy companies have announced plans to cut capex , including Targa Resources , Hess Midstream , Enlink Midstream and ONEOK .
Enterprise Products is also reviewing its capex programme .
Major cuts to capex plans for oil and gas , and midstream energy companies are a long-term problem for the US petrochemical industry , as access to abundant and low-cost natural gas liquids ( NGL ) feedstocks is its lifeblood .
The US shale gas cost advantage has spurred hundreds of billions of dollars in chemical investment .
With the crash in crude oil prices , which has severely diminished this advantage , the investment boom is clearly under threat .
" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start up in 2025 .
Companies can certainly afford to delay a decision by a quarter or two , " said the ACC 's Swift .
Planned US cracker projects for start-up further down the road in 2023-2025 where final investment decisions ( FIDs ) have yet to be me made include those by FG LA LLC ( Formosa ) , PTTGC/Daelim , Chevron Phillips Chemical/Qatar Petroleum , and Motiva ( Saudi Aramco ) .
