WATCH : Talks under way to avert closure of popular Limerick community centre  Reporter :  Nick Rabbitts  24 Mar 2020  Email :  nick@limerickleader .
0  Centre manager Linda Ledger PICTURE : DAVE GAYNOR  TALKS are under way to prevent the closure of a popular Limerick community centre -- and the end of its meals on wheels service .
Linda Ledger , the manager of St Munchin 's Community Enterprise Centre in Kileely Court , Kileely , was sitting down with HSE and council bosses in a bid to avert the full shutdown of the facility which at the moment is slated for April 5 next .
St Munchin 's had been open on a limited basis since the outbreak of the coronavirus to allow pick-ups , and the meals on wheels service for elderly people across Limerick .
However , in a video message this morning , Ms Ledger said : " Unfortunately I 'm here with some bad news .
I 've had to close the age friendly campus and let more staff go today .
Financially , because it costs ? 19,000 a week to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to stay open until April 5 .
I 'm really sorry about this .
But financially we just ca n't do it .
"  She did confirm this afternoon that rescue discussions were under way .
Since the outbreak of Covid-19 , which has seen people stay at home , Ms Ledger has been forced to lay-off the majority of her 26 staff on temporary basis .
It meant the social enterprises and the cafe which provide income to the centre were no more , leaving St Munchin 's unable to function as a centre .
But a permanent closure would see the meals on wheels cease , leaving hundreds of elderly and vulnerable people without a service .
Ms Ledger said she would welcome support from the council , the public , the health service and government to keep the show on the road .
As news broke this morning that we 'll have to shut our doors from the 5th April 2020 as we financially are n't able to keep going .
are a social enterprise , we depend on our enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we 've had to close those the enterprises .
