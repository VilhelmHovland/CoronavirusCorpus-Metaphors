That comment highlighted the United States can not reverse its hostile policy toward North Korea " no matter how excellent and firm the relationship " their two leaders have , state media KCNA said , citing an unnamed foreign ministry official responsible for the negotiations .
" Hearing Pompeo 's reckless remarks , we dropped the interest in dialogue with further conviction , but have become more zealous for our important planned projects aimed to repay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has inflicted upon our people , " the official was quoted as saying .

Pyongyang has touted the letter as a sign of " the special and very firm personal relations " between the two leaders despite recent frictions .
" This makes us misjudge who is the real chief executive in the U .
, " the diplomat said .
