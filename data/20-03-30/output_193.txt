Coronavirus sorts out the good , bad and ugly of NZ 's brands  OPINION : It 's an ill wind that blows no one any good , and Covid-19 will prove no different for some whose brands will ride this storm and come out way better off than they went in .
It seems that building a brand during a crisis comes in a few waves .
There are those who are either first to market with a product or idea , or they hit the zeitgeist of the moment .
These are the individuals and organisations who are confidently riding the Covid-19 wave because they do the right thing , at the right time .
Let 's call the first group the ' surfers ' who 've got ahead of the wave and are confidently riding it .
We can firmly place Dr Ashley Bloomfield , Director-General of Health , in the surf-champ category .
I think we 've all developed a bit of a soft spot for Dr Bloomfield , who 's become the calm and reassuring face of New Zealand 's reaction since this started .
Another is comedian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week talking about their time in self-isolation .
From the dad who is n't finding it easy being stuck at home with kids , to the flatter pent-up with her mates and going stir crazy .
Sainsbury 's characters hit the sweet spot of saying what we 're all feeling , but are pretending we 're not .
In the UK , fitness coach Joe Wicks has taken first mover advantage .
His daily YouTube kids ' PE class has gained a million viewers since it started streaming last week .
At the weekend , he announced he was giving the associated advertising revenue to the UK 's National Health Service .
You see : it 's that ' right thing , right time ' thing again .
Then there 's the second wave who realised , all too late , that they should 've caught the swell earlier and failed .
We will call these the Frubes - those who 're out there bobbing around , but missing the waves .
This group includes all the tech and online education companies who suddenly saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking off their to-do lists like learning Croatian , playing the guitar or mastering Excel spread sheets .
KEVIN STENT/STUFF  Dr Ashley Bloomfield , Director-General of Health , has become the calm and reassuring face of New Zealand 's reaction since this started .
This group finally cottoned on and went into marketing over-drive last week .
The volume of offers almost drowning us , so we ignore them .
The third lot we 'll call the Tombstoners - those who are reputationally wiping out .
Their brands are only hanging on by a leg-rope .
Vodafone is a definite Tombstoner .
Dudes -- you are just oblivious .
And there are probably other mobile phone companies in the same trough , so if you 're reading this and want to comment on that , please do .
For goodness sake , even the banks are making you look bad .
SUPPLIED  Supermarkets literally rake in the cash as we panic-buy .
At a time when we are all more dependent than ever on our phones to stay safe , informed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step up , not hang back .
Have I had a single message from Vodafone offering me free , or cheap , data for the next month ? Anything ? .
