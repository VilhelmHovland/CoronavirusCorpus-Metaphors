Global health professional sees pandemic from different view  Updated Mar 24 , 2020 ; Posted Mar 23 , 2020  By Allison Spensley Global health professional  I saw two pieces of news footage today that concerned me .
The first happened on the Today show on NBC , and it was a clip of the cars lined up in Birmingham for testing for coronavirus .
The second was an informal interview that took place by AL .
from Orange Beach , AL , where there are throngs of people because it is supposed to be spring break .
Granted , it was not as busy it usually it , but still , I was floored .
Many of the comments I saw from this clip fell along the lines of " this is no worse than the flu " , " I have an immune system " , " this is a hoax by the media .
"  I am a home-grown Alabamian .
I grew up in Birmingham .
I live in Birmingham now .
I am married with three children .
I have siblings and parents and nieces and nephews that also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am like you : an Alabamian .
I would like to speak to the people of Alabama , on the chance that my message might get to even one family that would make different choices which can change the domino effect of this epidemic .
In addition to being an Alabamian , I am also a public health professional with over 20 years of experience in global health , focusing on maternal/child health and prevention of HIV in lower and middle income countries .
I have lived and worked in countries that experience public health crises the likes of which we do not normally experience in the US .
I have participated in national working groups to formulate government strategies to prevent and mitigate diseases like HIV , to strengthen health care systems , and to improve quality of care for all people .
I have participated in epidemic response planning for other countries .
I am also a social worker .
I have a strong foundation for several concepts related to the health of the public including the realities of the challenges of planning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to doing hard things that do n't have easy answers ) , and a strong sense of empathy which has been built over time working with people from all over the world dealing with critical health issues .
I , along with millions of other Americans , have been following the Coronavirus situation .
We 've watched as the messaging has progressed from a mild alert to the current severe warnings .
I know how challenging it can be to formulate public policy that is appropriate for the entire population of a country , and I also know how hard it can be as a community member to adhere to recommendations that directly impact your daily life and change routines .
I understand how distant the national experts can seem and how confusing the messages can be .
I understand that the messages we currently hear every day are scary and cause an internal reaction of fear that plays out in different ways , some of which is pretending that life should go on as usual and feelings of denial .
Last week , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama .
Thank goodness it has been a mild case and they are on the mend .
This surprised our entire family as our family member that tested positive has n't traveled outside of the US recently , never had a fever , and did n't have the usual symptoms .
And yet they tested positive .
Most of the rest of our family were tested as well , and our results have come back negative ( but to reiterate Ambassador Birx : testing negative one day does n't negate your risk ) .
Watching the news and my social media , talking to people , from all the data I have gathered -- completely anecdotally -- I feel the need to share some messages to Alabamians :  * Public health is not a right that is guaranteed : Public health authorities can do their best to provide the most up-to-date and data-informed information , tools , knowledge , strategies , to help ensure public health .
But in the US , it 's up to individuals to decide to act .
This is a privilege we take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uptake is less than optimal : people are n't taking this seriously .
I 've experienced people trying to work their way around recommendations , using excuses that are not defensible ( my kids are bored , my schedule is disrupted ) .
The US system relies on the individual use of common sense to make the best decisions for the sake of the community ; and in this current situation , it 's not going very well .
We have to earn the health of our public , and many communities are showing us they are not upholding their end of the bargain .
* There is a continued " Us " -- " Them " divide : there is a lack of connection between people .
Coronavirus does n't discriminate between the " haves " and the " have-nots .
" Prevention measures are easier to implement the higher your socioeconomic status is , so the likelihood of people with less money , which can then translate into minority , immigrant and/or " other " status , will bear the brunt of the impact .
Soon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in the " Us " category are going to be surprised that there are cases identified in their neighborhoods .
The lack of sense of solidarity in this country is frustrating .
We Americans feel we have the right to do what we want -- and that includes putting ourselves and others at risk .
However , just because we may consider this a " right " , does that mean we act on it ? Do n't we want to do what is best for our whole community , even if it means smaller individual sacrifices ?  * There is a clear lack of understanding that we are all in this together : there are no winners in this scenario and it does n't matter what your political opinion is .
We will all experience consequences in some way unless and until we take collective action .
The fact is , we function together as a society and my actions impact others .
My decisions have a direct consequence for someone else .
And turning our heads away from this reality is irresponsible and incredibly frustrating ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Despite my frustration and feelings of the need to shake some common sense into people , I also see signs of hope .
We can do better as a state to come together ; here are some things we can do :  * If you have the means to do so , follow all of the recommended CDC guidance .
This is updated as the information changes , so make sure you stay up to date .
The guidance can be found here : https : **39;4128;TOOLONG .
This includes actions that might inconvenience you , might shift your schedule , might prove frustrating and scary ; still follow the guidance .
The guidance is our roadmap to resolving this epidemic as quickly and with as little fall-out as possible .
Take responsibility for your actions and take ownership of the idea that each of us has individual power to make a difference .
I do n't care if its inconvenient , uncomfortable , unsettling , boring .
Do it ; stop making excuses .
Parents , knock some sense into those kiddos that are headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  * Stay up-to-date on world news : While it can seem overwhelming , it is important to understand how this is impacting other countries : are you aware of what is happening in Italy ? Of how South Korea is handling this ? This information is helpful to keep a perspective of how we are approaching this as a country and how easy some of these recommendations might be compared to the alternatives .
It certainly makes temporarily postponing travel plans or dinner parties a better option than martial law and lockdown scenarios .
I know its very hard to even conjure this type of scenario in the US , but do your best .
the current recommendations are there precisely to avoid this situation .
* Do not base your decisions and actions on something you hear from a friend on social media : Jjust because your friend texted you with some information , that does n't make it true .
Follow-up to do your own research and do n't assume that the rumor just spread by a social media contact is true .
* If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow community members : let me be clear : I am not limiting community to those who live in close proximity to you .
I am defining community as those who live in your county , your state , and your country .
There are fellow community members who do not have the means to implement the recommendations : they do n't have the funds to " stock-up " on supplies , their kids rely on school-based meal programs to get fed , they ca n't afford to miss work .
There are multiple ways to contribute as a community member to help others : look to your faith community , look on your social media pages , google " help out in .
" ; you will find many opportunities to support your fellow community members .
Doing something to help others can give you a sense of taking back your control -- you are contributing to the solution which is empowering .
If we can stop turning a blind eye to our current situation , we have the collective power to make it better .
We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to be able to say that you did everything you could during this time to help ?  Thank you in advance !  Birmingham resident Allison Spensley is a global health professional who spent the last five years in Zambia .
