This Indiana couple watched the pandemic spread from aboard a cruise ship  Mark and Elaine Rongers are seasoned veterans when it comes to cruises .
The couple , who live in Hobart , Ind .
, boarded a Holland America cruise ship in New Zealand on March 1 for what was supposed to be a month-long journey to see some of the world 's most beautiful sights .
They 've taken 55 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unlike any other .
New York reported its first COVID-19 case the day they left .
The Diamond Princess cruise ship , which had 621 infected people aboard , had already grabbed headlines internationally .
But those concerns did n't register for the Rongers .
" Right before they flew to New Zealand , it was n't such a thing here yet , " their daughter Corey Girnus , who lives in Avon , said .
" I said to my parents , kind of half joking but half serious , ' Are you guys sure you want to go traveling right now with what 's going on ? ' They were like , ' No , we ca n't cancel .
We want to go ahead and do it .
I 'm sure we 'll be fine .
' "  Things started normally  The beginning of the cruise was normal enough .
But as the coronavirus began to spread around the world , things began to change .
The ship was supposed to stop in Tahiti on March 13 , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Hilo , Hawaii .
By the time they got there , the ship was n't allowed to make port .
They were denied entry in Honolulu , too .
The chaotic journey finally ended in San Diego , where the ship docked on Saturday .
COVID-19 : Resources  The Indiana State Department of Health hotline is 317-233-7125 from 8 a .
to 8 p .
and 317-233-1325 afterward .
And yet , despite the madness , the couple had little to complain about .
Except for minor changes like not being allowed to serve themselves with tongs at the buffet , not much on the ship changed .
Were it not for televisions on the ship and internet access that gave a window into what was happening at home , they could have just as well not known panic was flaring at home .
No one on the ship was sick .
" There 's been a lot of wondering what 's going to happen , but I mean , c'm on , I 'm on a cruise ship , " Elaine , 64 , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot , feeding me like a king .
the crew could not be more hospitable and wonderful .
We 're in a bubble .
"  There was some disappointment over not being able to make several stops , including in Bora Bora and Oahu .
But there was an understanding among the passengers -- 1,100 boarded in New Zealand and 832 remained Saturday after several hundred had gotten off at other locations -- that there was something bigger going on .
" Some of these places we 've been to before , and we know how wonderful they are , " Elaine said .
" We know what we 're missing .
But when the port says you ca n't come here , you ca n't come here .
"  Elaine said Holland America will refund half the cost of the cruise , as well as give the passengers a voucher for a future cruise .
And she emphasized they 'll take advantage of it .
" This is our 56th cruise , and it wo n't be our last , " she said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was much more concerned about what waited on the mainland than what she was going through at sea .
They would take charter buses straight from the port in San Diego to the airport .
" I 'm not in a big hurry to get off the ship myself , because I know what I 'm going to go home to , " she said .
" I believe that with my whole being , that I 'm way safer sitting on this ship than getting off and going to the airport .
Come on .
"  While the Rongers had to make minimal adjustments to their travel plans , some were n't so fortunate .
" There 's definitely been tension .
For some people , this is stressful , " he said .
" You can see it in their interactions .
We met a couple from Germany who had to reschedule their attempts to get home several times .
There were concerns they would n't be allowed to pass through the United States .
Some sweet woman from Germany is crying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for stressful ? Girnus went from March 5-14 without hearing from her parents .
Meanwhile , the news was filled with stories of passengers on cruise ships being infected .
" I 'd look at their itinerary and say , ' Oh , they 're in this little island , they probably do n't have a signal , ' " Girnus said .
" My dad does n't generally purchase an internet package when they go on those voyages .
first day or two , it was like , ' Maybe I 'll hear from them tomorrow .
' As the days progressed , it got to be more worrisome .
"  Other cruise ships were impacted in major ways by the coronavirus , adding to Girnus ' concern .
More than 3,600 passengers were quarantined on the Diamond Princess , a cruise ship in Japan , in early February .
A total of 621 passengers were infected .
Seven died .
Of the passengers that traveled on the Grand Princess cruise that set sail in late February from San Francisco , 103 people were infected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported 189 people experiencing flu-like symptoms Monday .
Two people had tested positive for the virus and four people have died .
" All I wanted to know was , ' Are they OK ? ' To go a week without knowing one way or another definitely made my anxiety go pretty high .
"  Holland America gave the passengers access to free internet on March 15 , so the Rongers were able to contact friends and family .
For the latter part of the trip , Marc posted frequent updates on Facebook , including videos of him playing his guitar and pictures of the view from the ship .
" That was a big reassurance .
It was proof they were able to be out and about on the ship , " Girnus said .
" They were n't relegated to their room , which validated that everybody on board was healthy .
It made me feel , in the slightest way , a bit connected .
"  Meanwhile , passengers on the ship watched what was happening in America with a sense of disbelief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? I ca n't relate , and I 'm going to have to , " Elaine said .
" And I 'm probably going to have to get some toilet paper .
"  She described it as " some sort of sci-fi thing .
"  " Here we are in this little bubble of , ' What am I going to wear to dinner tonight ? , ' " she said .
" You turn on MSNBC and they 're showing people shoving people at Costco over toilet paper .
It 's dumb .
I do n't get it .
I do n't want to get sick either .
But the toilet paper thing , I do n't get .
"  But that 's the reality the couple faced Saturday night when they returned home to Hobart .
All of the sudden , they were left to deal with the uncertainty of what comes next like everyone else .
" Being away from the reality of what 's going on with the rest of the world , I feel especially lucky , " Elaine said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality .
" Things could be worse than to be stuck on a cruise ship during a pandemic .
