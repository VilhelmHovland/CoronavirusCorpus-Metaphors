It all started with online storytime for kids through Facebook .

The library kick-started an online writing workshop .
Even if the library is closed , people can still read and check out a new book .
There over 32,000 books available online for people .
" During this time where people are confused and scared the library can be a source of information to make sense of what 's going on , " said Todd Deck with the Tehama County Library .
The library is also offering free movie streaming services for its members .
