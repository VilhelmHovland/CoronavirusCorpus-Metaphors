The Covid-19 situation and , in particular , the closure of the PAP Community Foundation ( PCF ) Sparkletots centre at Fengshan Block 126 are stark reminders that the current childcare leave entitlement is insufficient during the current pandemic .
For many working parents , childcare centres are the only option for looking after their child .
As the parent of a child who has been affected by the four-day closure of all PCF centres in Singapore due to the Fengshan cluster , I am left wondering how any parent without a helper or relatives who can care for the child is realistically expected to deal with a 14-day closure .
If the parent works a five-day week , this would still mean recording 10 days of absence from work to care for the child .
The current annual childcare leave entitlement is only six days , and would not be enough .
Medical leave would not apply , either .
Why has the Ministry of Manpower not prepared employers and employees with a better support system regarding how to officially process absence from work due to the Covid-19 situation ? The ministry has provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absence or stay-home notices .
If a childcare centre closes for 14 days due to an outbreak , are all children who attend the centre , and their parents , given a leave of absence ?  All we have been told is that " employers should be empathetic " .
This leaves the response entirely to the discretion of the employer , and does not answer the question of how the absence will be officially processed .
The Government needs to state clearly that all parental absence from work because of the closure of childcare centres due to Covid-19 , regardless of the number of days , will be officially covered .
