As the COVID-19 pandemic shuts down day cares and schools , countless parents have been left with no child care at all .
Some are trying to do their jobs remotely , while also changing diapers and helping bored teens figure out online courses and brainstorming games to distract toddlers .
Some essential workers are still going in every day , while exhausted family members take on child care duties or school-age kids find ways to entertain themselves .
So we picked a single weekday -- last Thursday -- and asked a bunch of parents all around the country to record how that stretch of time unfolded for them without child care , hour by hour .
Here 's the combined timeline of their days .
5:30 a .
Rachel , San Francisco , consultant : My husband , a surgical resident , sneaks out into the darkness to the hospital .
6:15 a .
Aviva , Brunswick , Maine , English and film professor : I wake up and stress-check news before anyone else wakes up .
I do this under the covers because my 9-year-old daughter is in our bed .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwright : I wake up before the kids to get some writing done .
I do n't write .
I read about the coronavirus instead .
Emily , Maplewood , New Jersey , creative director : I hear one of the twins yell from his room " Do n't wake up .
" OK thanks .
Karla , Denver , account manager : My husband and I chat about the changing job climate in the travel industry and how many people could be let go .
Our 5-year-old hears us and breaks into her best Elsa version of " Let It Go .
"  Amanda , North Pole , Alaska , stay-at-home mom : Eight-year-old , 9-year-old , 12-year-old , and 13-year-old are drawing up snow fort plans .
They start working on sugar-cube-and-glue models of forts .
It 's 20 degrees outside , so I 'll let them go build the winner before lunch .
7:26 a .
April , Los Angeles , works in advertising : Woke up downstairs because we were " camping " in the living room .
7:40 a .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film professor : I make the first of my five daily calls to my parents in NYC .
They have both contracted the virus and are quarantining themselves in their apartment .
I have no words for how scary and difficult this has been .
7:45 a .
Allison , Indianapolis , works in commercial lending:The rest of the household is still asleep except for my 19-year-old son .
His sleep schedule is off -- he has been up all night .
This is his spring break from IUPUI , but we now know he is not going back to campus for classes for the rest of the semester .
Cris , San Francisco , middle school English teacher : I tell the kids we 'll have toast with lots of butter for breakfast .
I then realize I coronavirus-stress-ate the rest of the bread late last night .
8:40 a .
April , Los Angeles , works in advertising : We are being paranoid and take our temperatures every day .
My daughter 's temp reading is 99 .
What 's with the slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brunswick , Maine , English and film professor : My daughter comes in and announces she has completed her work for the day .
There are 12 hours until bedtime .
Paul , Richmond , California , computer programmer : Writing code feels like the easiest thing in the world when you can concentrate and like pushing a shopping cart up a hill when you ca n't .
My daughter hovers at my shoulder and every minute or so holds out her latest design from a drawing app .
" Look at this , Daddy .
Look at this , Daddy .
"  9:15 a .
Emily , Maplewood , New Jersey , creative director : I start yoga in the family room .
One of the boys is on the iPad and screams that he 's pooped in his pants .
Why ? Because he did n't want to abandon the iPad so his brother could get it .
I clean up the poopy pants .
Rachel , San Francisco , consultant : I pull out all my daughter 's favorite toys -- from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to respond to emails .
I lose all confidence in day care 's reports that she " is very good at independent play , " as it seems I am barely allowed to break eye contact .
9:30 a .
Estela , Philadelphia , home health aide : My daughters wake up .
One of them wants toasted bread with garlic for breakfast .
The other one says , " I do n't like that , I want a waffle , toast with nutella , an apple , and a glass of milk .
" I say , " Wow , you want a lot of things .
"  April , Los Angeles , works in advertising : My daughter joins me in our daily ad-ops morning huddle and says " Hi " to the team while showing them her latest YouTube discovery .
Today it 's Nyan Cat .
" My daughter joins me in our daily ad-ops morning huddle and says ' Hi ' to the team while showing them her latest YouTube discovery .
"  April Joy Castillo  10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The state of Kansas has already canceled school for the year , so we 're jumping right into home-schooling .
It 's a bit ad hoc .
I ask the girls to write an essay comparing the movie Pocahontas with the actual history .
Paul , Richmond , California , computer programmer : We pull up the Google Doc where my daughter is composing an assigned report on cats , and right away the writer 's block begins .
She rolls her eyes , slouches in the chair , gets distracted searching for images , leaps out of her chair every time anyone says something .
Of course I 'm doing the same thing , reloading the news every few minutes .
" Daddy , " she says , " you 're touching your face .
"  11 a .
Emily , Maplewood , New Jersey , creative director : I sit down in my office , close the door , and unbutton the uncomfortable pants I mistakenly decided to put on so I would n't be in pajamas all day .
Aviva , Brunswick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grade the papers my students handed in before spring break .
I 'm writing comments like , " Not in MLA format " or " Add a comma here " and thinking to myself , " Who cares ? " My son is trying to lift all 45 pounds of our dog up to his screen so his classmates can see her .
Meanwhile , my husband is trying to create a " math scavenger hunt " for our daughter , who is super bored .
I both appreciate and resent how good he is at crisis parenting .
11:30 a .
Karla , Denver , account manager : While I 'm on a call with the VP of a supplier , my 5-year-old decides to ignore my sign that says , " Do not enter Mommy is on a call " and come in to ask for help putting on her shirt .
We have resorted to paying our fifth grader $5 a day to help keep the 5-year-old more focused and busier .
I consider docking her $1 for this interruption .
Cris , San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mood to cook .
We eat yogurt with maple syrup , canned pineapple , and tortillas .
Sarah , Portland , Oregon , high school history teacher : My 3-year-old daughter loves imaginative play and now wants to play school .
She has me play the teacher and her brother plays her friend Jason ( also known as her husband ; they got married awhile back ) .
While I used to love seeing how much she adores her school and friends , it now makes me heart ache a little bit .
Noon  Amanda , North Pole , Alaska , stay-at-home mom : I try to comfort my 16-year-old , who is upset that she thinks prom will be canceled and the guy she 's crushing on asked her .
Liz , Seattle , works at a radio station : We did n't really discuss who would be on child care duty this afternoon , but my husband is on a marathon call .
Mac and cheese it is .
Plus a smoothie .
Cris , San Francisco , middle school English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap .
She goes through her ritual of pointing out that we all have a butt , that her brother has a pee-nus , and that she does not have a pee-nus .
I ask her what she has , and she yells VAGINA !  12:45 p .
Emily , Maplewood , New Jersey , creative director : We eat lunch and have a dance party .
The boys " go crazy , " which basically means run around like maniacs and jump on each other .
Karla , Denver , account manager : I am analyzing a contract while hearing my 5-year-old sing " ice cream ice cream cherry on top , who 's your boyfriend I forgot " while jump-roping .
I try not to cringe too much when I hear her stop singing because it is very likely she hit something in our house with the jump-rope .
Catherine , Hays , Kansas , playwright : We go for a hike on the trails beside our local natural history museum .
No one is there .
It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frogs of every size .
My daughter , who adores all things amphibian and reptilian , delights in trying to catch them .
We actually laugh .
Paul , Richmond , California , computer programmer : After lunch , my daughter and I take a bike ride .
Magnolias and cherry trees are flowering .
" Are these the best workdays you 've ever had ? " she asks .
How do you explain to her that they could be , if all these duties were n't impossibly combined ? On the way back , she wants to talk about which of her stuffed animals are most vulnerable to coronavirus .
reminds me that some of the animals are much older than others .
1:15 p .
Allison , Indianapolis , works in commercial lending:My 15-year-old announces that he saw on Instagram that school is closed until May 1 .
I am not surprised but ugh .
Makes it hard to concentrate on this BRAND NEW JOB I 'M TRYING TO DO MY BEST AT WHILE WORKING FROM MY DINING ROOM .
Rachel , San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in my daughter 's life .
We do n't have paper so I let her draw on an Amazon box .
" We do n't have paper so I let her draw on an Amazon box .
"  Rachel Sam  2 p .
Paul , Richmond , California , computer programmer : My daughter does a 15-minute lesson and quits .
I ca n't force her to keep going and I ca n't give a good speech on why it matters .
Why does she have to learn equivalent fractions ? Why do I have to write computer programs ? The whole household is suffering a crisis of legitimacy .
Catherine , Hays , Kansas , playwright : I give the girls over to screen time and make a trip to the grocery store .
The atmosphere is more odd than panicked .
There 's no ground beef , frozen vegetables , or toilet paper , but there 's asparagus for days .
3:15 p .
Cris , San Francisco , middle school English teacher:I 'm on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his nap and yells about how he 's taking a poop .
He calls me over minutes later to explain how some poop came out but there 's more poop that still needs to come out .
Meanwhile my younger daughter says MESS ! every time she sees a section of our home that needs to be cleaned , which is our whole home right now .
Liz , Seattle , works at a radio station : I finally brush my teeth .
Aviva , Brunswick , Maine , English and film professor : We cave in and order pizza for dinner .
We are very , very , very careful about washing our hands after touching the box .
Liz , Seattle , works at a radio station : Part of our new routine is to let the dishes pile up in the sink through the day , then scramble to figure out a dinner plan around 6 or 7 .
It 's really working for us .
we ordered takeout from a burger place a few blocks away .
Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco , consulting : My husband comes home from the hospital , but we have a new rule that he must shower before touching us , so I blast music so our daughter does n't hear him , otherwise she 'd run to him .
When I can finally hand her over , I just stare into space for 10 -- 15 minutes .
It feels really nice .
Sarah , Portland , Oregon , high school history teacher : We finish dinner and the kids fade .
My daughter is looking sick .
We take her temperature : 103 .
degrees .
My husband and I start to fret about the possibility that she could have coronavirus .
We had a video appointment with a pediatrician yesterday .
He said it was n't worth bringing her in to test because she would then be at risk of contracting other diseases .
daughter has all the symptoms , though : fever , dry cough , chills .
I went to the grocery store yesterday .
what if I unknowingly passed it on ?  7 p .
Cris , San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes between dinner and bath time , my wife uses the Calm app on the couch to listen to the sound of falling rain .
About 90 seconds in , the kids rush over and our daughter hits her in the face .
Estela , Philadelphia , home health aide : I eat a fast dinner , an arepa .
Then I leave for work .
At home , my husband makes dinner for the girls -- rice , eggs , salchicha .
I take care of a 99-year-old man , so I 'm being very careful to wash my hands a lot .
My older daughter would sometimes come visit him to say hello , or to help me out on weekends if I needed to eat lunch or something , but now she ca n't do that because we 're trying not to let too many people come into his apartment .
Steven , New York , tax law professor : We play bingo with a college buddy of mine .
I send her a photo of a bingo card and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning and our son comes in second , followed by a team of stuffed animals that was also playing .
Catherine , Hays , Kansas , playwright : I could work , but I do n't .
It 's hard to summon the energy when all the theaters in the country are shuttered anyway .
8:30 p .
Emily , Maplewood , New Jersey , creative director : Bedtime .
I answer lots of questions including " But how loooonnnggg do we have to be in this house ? "  Aviva , Brunswick , Maine , English and film professor : We watch the original Freaky Friday on the couch .
I fall asleep after 20 minutes .
Amanda , North Pole , Alaska , stay-at-home mom : All eight kids are in bed .
Lights out in 30 minutes .
Steven , New York , tax law professor : Simpsons !  Cris , San Francisco , middle school English teacher : I continue working .
I 'm a seventh grade English teacher and I 'm thinking about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student responses from their Google survey today .
" My dog is making me happy .
" " I 'm sad/worried because I ca n't see my grandma .
I 'm happy because I have my brother and sister .
I 'm not really laughing , not yet .
"  9:30 p .
Liz , Seattle , works at a radio station : I cave , and tell my son he can sleep in our bed tonight .
That means I 'll be in the guest bed .
10 p .
Emily , Maplewood , New Jersey , creative director : I pour a glass of wine and log back onto work .
I attempt to discuss important things with my wife , look at bikes for the kids online , email my parents to convince them to be diligent about washing their hands and not going out .
Estela , Philadelphia , home health aide : The man I work for needs 24-hour care and I 'm sleeping over tonight .
He stays up late .
He loves baseball so much , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he watches Shark Tank .
