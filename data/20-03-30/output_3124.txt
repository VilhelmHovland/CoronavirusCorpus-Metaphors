Share  NEW YORK - US President Donald Trump has extended the national social-distancing guidelines aimed at fighting the coronavirus pandemic to April 30 , walking back from his previous remarks that he wanted the country to reopen for business by April 12 -- the Easter Sunday .
" Nothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory has been won , " Trump told a White House press briefing in Washington on Sunday evening which was broadcast live .
The revamped timeline came on the same day a top American infectious disease official issued an ominous warning as New York state approached 1,000 deaths and U .
fatalities from the coronavirus pandemic climbed to almost 2,500 .
The U .
death total has doubled in two days .
Anthony Fauci , the official who has been a leading voice in the effort to curb the outbreak , said 100,000 to 200,000 Americans could die before the crisis is over .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , citing " extensive community transmission " of COVID-19 in New York and its neighbouring states -- New Jersey and Connecticut -- late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days effective immediately .
The advisory does not apply to employees of critical infrastructure industries such as trucking , public health professionals , financial services and food supply .
" Just a little bit of separation can stop a fire from spreading , " CDC Director Dr .
Robert Redfield said .
The U .
counted more than 142,000 cases of coronavirus by Sunday evening , the world 's highest total , and there were 2,493 deaths , according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard .
More confirmations are expected as the U .
continues to ramp up testing .
More than 722,000 people are known to have been infected with COVID-19 globally , and almost 34,000 have died .
The social distancing guidelines were put in place March 16 with an initial time frame of 15 days , but Trump tacitly acknowledged Sunday that was n't long enough .
" The peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks , " Trump said at the briefing .
The announcement comes after Trump said last week he hoped to open up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 .
He said that would be a " beautiful " time to ease up on restrictions geared toward slowing spread of the virus , but that have hurt the economy .
Trump said Sunday the White House task force would be sharing further data and finalized plans Tuesday , and that he expects by June 1 , " we will be well on our way to recovery .
"  The guidelines call on Americans to avoid social gatherings involving groups of 10 or more , to stay away from public spaces like restaurants and bars , to avoid discretionary travel and to practice increased hygiene .
They also asked Americans to stay home if they are sick and for older individuals to stay away from other people .
Millions of Americans will be infected by the coronavirus before the crisis is over and 100,000 to 200,000 could die , Dr .
Fauci said Sunday .
Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said on CNN 's State of the Union that computer models generally overestimate the final numbers , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Fauci sought to clarify his earlier remarks at the afternoon briefing , saying the numbers he provided were based on models examining the impact of the disease .
However , he pointed out the possibility of 100,000 to 200,000 deaths hinged on limited measures being taken to reduce the spread of the disease .
" It 's possible .
What we 're trying to do is not let that happen .
" Fauci said .
" So instead concentrating on the upper and the lower ( estimates ) , we 're saying we 're trying to push it all the way down .
" We feel that the mitigation that we are doing is having an effect .
It 's very difficult to quantitate it because you have two dynamics things going on at the same time .
You have the virus going up and the mitigation trying to push it down .
"  As the number of coronavirus-related deaths in New York state gets closer to 1,000 , Governor Andrew Cuomo is trying to prepare residents for the bleak reality that the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Cuomo said the latest total of deaths -- 965 people as of Sunday , up 237 deaths in one day -- combined with the rising number of positive cases will likely lead to a significant increase in casualties .
" I do n't see how you look at those numbers and conclude anything less than thousands of people will pass away , " Cuomo said .
" Remember who it 's attacking .
I do n't see how you get past that curve without seeing thousands of people pass away .
I hope it 's wrong .
"  The majority of the deaths , 678 of them , were in New York City .
Cuomo warned that while the city is the most acute problem , the death toll will grow in the coming weeks across the state and the nation , calling it a " rolling apex .
"  Metro areas across the nation must assume they " could have an outbreak equivalent to New York and do everything right now to prevent it , " White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr .
Deborah Birx said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every piece of equipment is .
"  " Mitigate it now , before they start seeing cases in the emergency room and in the hospital .
Once you see those , the virus has been spreading days to weeks , " Birx said on NBC 's Meet the Press .
" This is my call on every mayor to prepare now .
"  New York City has become the epicenter of the U .
spread of the coronavirus .
One healthcare expert warns that " New York is not an outlier " and the virus is on track to hit " every city in America .
"  Meanwhile , the Trump administration is airlifting medical supplies from Asia and other parts of the world to areas of the United States hardest hit by the coronavirus , the White House said .
A flight from Shanghai carrying more than 10 million surgical gloves , 130,000 N-95 masks and other equipment landed Sunday at John F .
Kennedy International Airport in New York .
It was the first of what is expected to be about 20 flights over several weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement that the flights would bring " massive amounts of masks " and other gear to " better equip our health care workers on the front lines .
" The effort comes as state and local officials say hospitals are running short of medical equipment needed by front-line health workers .
