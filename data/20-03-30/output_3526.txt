Coronavirus : Council leader introduces weekly info bulletin  The situation with coronavirus is changing daily and we are committed to keeping residents updated regularly with essential information .
We will be publishing weekly updates here in the Camden New Journal , including changes to council services and information about the support available in the community through the Council and its partners .
I know this is a really unsettling and worrying time , so I want to update you on Camden Council 's plans to respond to the coronavirus outbreak .
We are one community and we are determined no one is left alone to deal with this crisis .
To do this we will need a whole community effort including the Council , our partners , voluntary , community and faith organisations , businesses and most importantly you , our residents .
It is now clear that the coronavirus pandemic is challenging us all in ways many of us have never experienced before .
I know everyone will have worries and concerns -- I feel these too -- and we do not know exactly what the coming months will bring .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on a personal and collective level .
It is vital that we all remain within our homes and reduce social contact as much as possible to protect our own health , and particularly the health of the most vulnerable in our community .
We can prevent the spread of this virus if we work together .
Staying at home will save lives and protect our NHS .
This is going to be a tough period and things will change every day -- but we can get through it by thinking of each other with every action , and taking care of our neighbours along with ourselves .
Our communities make Camden -- and together we can get through this .
Please look after yourselves and think of your neighbours -- and please keep following the latest advice from the government and Public Health England .
