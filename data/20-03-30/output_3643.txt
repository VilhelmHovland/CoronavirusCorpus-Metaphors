Picture : CEM OKSUZ/GETTY IMAGES  Paris -- With careers spent scratching around dusty outposts , sometimes with " just $100 " in their pockets , tennis 's unheralded army of foot soldiers say they are struggling to afford food after being made unemployed overnight by the coronavirus pandemic .
Now Georgian player Sofia Shapatava is pleading with the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) to dig deep and help out the hundreds of players who lost their livelihoods when the men 's and women 's tours went into a three-month lockdown .
" Players lower ranked than 250 will not be able to buy food in two-three weeks ' time , " warned Shapatava , who is not optimistic the ITF will look favourably on her plea .
" I honestly do n't think so , " she said .
" They replied that their plate is full and they will come back to me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not reply with anything .
"  Shapatava , the world No ? 371 , is a 16-year veteran of the tour .
But she plays mostly secondary ITF events , a world away from the gilded grand slam world inhabited by multimillionaires Serena Williams , Roger Federer , Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal .
Shapatava has banked $354,000 in career prize money from almost 1,500 singles and doubles matches .
Barely $3,000 has come her way since the turn of the year after events in Andrezieux-Bouthion in France , Midland in Michigan , Nicholasville in Kentucky and the Californian venue of Rancho Santa Fe .
However , compared with many , the 31-year-old is well off .
There are comfortably more than 1,000 players in the WTA rankings .
The men 's ATP Tour has just as many .
Among a batch of women locked in the lowest rank of 1,283 is 27-year-old Ksenia Kolesnikova of Russia .
In 2020 she officially made only $68 .
Many players outside the lucrative top 100 traditionally supplement their meagre incomes by coaching or playing in European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried up after governments worldwide banned large gatherings to combat the spread of the deadly coronavirus .
" I started the petition to help tennis players to be heard by ITF , after I talked to many of the people I know and about their plans for the next three months and I realised that some people wo n't even be able to have food , " said Shapatava in her online blog .
" My problem is that my sport will die as it is , it will die , because players who are ranked lower then 150 in the world will not be able to play .
"  Coronavirus has brought all tennis to a standstill until June 8 at the earliest .
The entire clay court season has been wiped out with the French Open shifted to September-October instead of its traditional May-June slot .
Wimbledon could follow suit this week when organisers may postpone or even cancel completely the grass court grand slam event scheduled to start on June 29 .
Britain 's Tara Moore , the world No 233 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $473,500 , boosted by lucrative wild cards into the main draw at Wimbledon .
In 2016 , she made the second round at the All England Club and pocketed a welcome $62,000 .
" There are more important things like life and death , but a lot of players from smaller countries , are unable to earn any income , unable to say benefits as they are considered self-employed , " wrote the 27-year-old Hong Kong-born Moore in support of Shapatava 's petition .
" It will be tough for many players to survive the next couple of months .
"  Former world No ? 15 Alla Kudryavtseva sympathised with the plight of the current crop .
The 32-year-old Russian , who famously dumped Maria Sharapova out of Wimbledon in 2008 , made more than $3m in her career , accrued mostly from success on the doubles court .
" I have savings , I 'm not worried .
What about those juniors that chose tennis as their career and are making the transition to pros ? Who did n't have a chance to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
