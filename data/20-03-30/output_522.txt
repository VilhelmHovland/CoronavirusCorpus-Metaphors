With European countries under lockdown slowing down its usual circulation and production to fight the coronavirus pandemic , atmospherical pollution seems to have reduced .
Though too early to gauge its effects on the long term , pictures coming from satellites clearly show the difference of NO2 ( greenhouse gas emissions ) concentration in France , Italy and Spain throughout March , AFP reported on Friday .
In February , Nasa showed how greenhouse gas emissions drastically dropped in Wuhan , epicentre of the epidemic .
From red/orange , China 's map turned to blue .
The European Space Agency ( ESA ) has observed the same phenomenon in Italy since the beginning of March - the nation has been under lockdown since March 9 .
According to the European Environment Agency , the Spanish cities of Madrid and Barcelona are following the same pattern , and have also been under strict confinement measures since mid-March .
Such radical falls are unprecedented .
" It is the first time that I have seen such a significant change in such a large region linked to an event , " said Fei Liu , a researcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Even during the economic crisis in 2008-2009 , the decrease " had been more continuous over time " , added Alberto Gonz ? lez Ortiz , an air quality specialist at the European Environment Agency .
In northern Italy , " the average NO2 concentration levels have reduced by half , " noted Vincent-Henri Peuch , from European Earth monitoring program Copernicus .
What 's next ?  For other countries or regions that have decided to go under lockdown - France , Belgium , Argentina , California , Tunisia , Bavaria , Colombia - researchers are waiting to see developments .
However , this does not mean that the air is clean : in China , Beijing experienced episodes of fine particle pollution in February , according to the Nasa Earth Observatory .
Ditto in Paris , which recorded an average index pollution despite the lockdown - once again because of fine particles .
The concentration of pollutants can indeed vary depending on the weather , explained Peuch to AFP .
" Some emission sources , such as energy production and those related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay at home , " he added .
However , PM2 .
and PM10 particles as well as carbon monoxide " should also decrease over time " due in particular to the reduction of transport and industry , he said .
