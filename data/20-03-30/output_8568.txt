Some expansions made to unemployment insurance in response to the coronavirus pandemic should be made permanent after the recovery to better mesh with a modern economy , U .
Ron Wyden said Monday .
Oregon 's senior United States senator said gig workers , independent contractors and freelancers should continue to benefit from unemployment insurance even after the country has begun to recover from this economic and health crisis .
They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest emergency relief package in modern American history being signed into law on Saturday .
The legislation contains $2 .
trillion intended to buoy workers and businesses impacted by the growing coronavirus pandemic .
This was the third coronavirus stimulus relief package passed by Congress .
Among the provisions are one-time $1,200 checks to individuals , $367 billion in loans and grants to small businesses and more than $130 billion for hospitals and community health centers .
Through his position as the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee , Wyden was at the center of hours of negotiations between both parties and the White House .

( Photo : MADELEINE COOK / STATESMAN JOURNAL )  The Statesman Journal spoke with Wyden on Monday to ask how Oregonians might be impacted by the new stimulus and what 's next in the country 's response to this pandemic .
This conversation was lightly edited for clarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the checks that are going to be sent out and the increases to unemployment insurance , but what 's something in this package that is important , but people might not know about ?  Wyden : They might not know about the expansion of telemedicine .
I 've been the Congressional leader on this and it 's particularly appropriate when you 're dealing with the coronavirus , but it 's important all the time .
If an Oregonian gets tested and might be asymptomatic but their doctor says , " Be careful , stay at home for a while , " they can stay at home with telemedicine -- Skype , Facetime and the like -- that allows them to get good care and also keep themselves and others safe .
That 's something that I 've championed .
SJ : What was the goal with this package and where do you go from here ?  Wyden : As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee I was very much involved in negotiating these kinds of pieces .
The idea was to try to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help small businesses meet payroll , keep their workers on , offer benefits and together between workers and businesses to , in effect , bring about something of a pause in terms of the harm and pain that workers and small businesses were feeling .
As the economy began to recover , ( and we ) get the virus situation dealt with -- you 've kind of got to pause so as economic recovery sets in we 're able to build up from there .
That 's why I 'm focused on the unemployment insurance provision -- $600 more per week each week for four months so that workers could pay rent and groceries and employers could be in a position to use that tax credit , the ( Small Business Administration ) loans and the amount that was forgiven , for example , on SBA loans , so that they could get back on their feet .
There are some real reforms in there .
The unemployment package , for example , reflects the fact there has n't been any real change in unemployment since about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930 .
That got covered .
Self-employed independent contractors , gig workers and part-time freelancers .
So , that was what this whole effort was all about .
You talk about what happens from here : I want to take the foundation we laid in this emergency pandemic unemployment insurance package and , in effect , build on some of those principles like covering gig workers and the independent contractors , self-employed persons , permanently .
SJ : What 's the latest you 've heard about how long the pandemic might last ? When might the country be able to begin recovery ?  Wyden : I think we 're all hoping for the soonest possible beginning of a recovery .
To a great extent , it revolves around health measures , the health efforts to deal with the pandemic .
On the Finance Committee , we have jurisdiction over Medicare and Medicaid , paying for much of American health care , so I was very involved in working on that hospital insurance assistance .
I had a call this morning with all of Oregon 's hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are deferring elective procedures paid for by commercial insurance , in many instances , in order to focus on COVID-19 patients .
I walked them through the provisions of the hospital portions -- more than $100 billion -- that would help them .
Apropos of your question , how soon will there be a recovery -- recovery will really take off as the virus is controlled .
SJ : How would you rate President Donald Trump and his administration 's response to COVID-19 ?  Wyden : Well , people ask me kind of areas I 've agreed on .
I sure agreed with the president on Saturday when he told that grandstander over in the House of Representatives to let the bill pass .
I certainly agreed with him a couple days ago .
I think it 's clear that when they shut the pandemic office , that was a mistake .
I think it was a mistake to compare it to the flu , for example , for an extended period of time .
But what I 'm interested in now is helping us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to the Trump administration , including the vice president , about getting the federal agencies to give Oregon clear guidance on what the rules are for our companies .
You know , we 've got companies like Nike , for example , that want to make a lot of what 's called PPE -- the protective gear .
What I 'm interested in now is getting solutions and helping people .
There are too many folks hurting .
We just got to focus on getting folks help .

( Photo : MADELEINE COOK / STATESMAN JOURNAL )  SJ : You pushed very hard for the unemployment insurance aspect .
Why is that such a critical part of this for you ?  Wyden : I think we all understand the way markets work .
Markets are demand driven .
If workers do n't have that money in their pocket -- the money that they would get from a wage -- then they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent , and they ca n't pay out-of-pocket medical .
Then all the businesses that do n't have that money , they ca n't employ people and they do n't have money coming in so they ca n't order more goods and services .
Economic recovery is two sides of one coin .
One side is what I was doing with expanding unemployment insurance , putting money into the pocket of workers .
The other side is the well-being of our small businesses , which is why I wrote the employee retention credit and the Small Business Administration loan forgiveness and those provisions to try to help small businesses .
SJ : Are there any talks happening about what else to do in immediate response to COVID-19 ?  Wyden : The Congress is out , per Mitch McConnell 's judgment , until April 20 .
So , no , there are no formal talks that are underway .
I , of course , work closely with my colleagues as the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee .
But I think there 's a growing awareness that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what might be in that package ?  Wyden : Well , the bill was signed on Saturday and we 're at Monday .
I do n't think anyone can crystal ball yet what 's going to be in the package .
There 's certainly going to be a lot to do on both the health care and economic fronts .
