Share this :  Many were horrified to see huge numbers of people ignoring government advice in the UK recently , enjoying a weekend in the sunshine swarming markets , city parks , national parks and beaches .
The advance of COVID-19 has triggered a broad-scale mission of " responsibilisation " .
This means that political leaders , health experts and even celebrities , neighbours and loved ones have called upon us all to act responsibly in order to slow the spread of the virus , and to minimise the damaging effects of the pandemic .
And while many people did follow advice and stay at home , those who did not were enough to cause alarm , and now prime minister Boris Johnson has put Britain in lockdown .
The reckless and selfish behaviour witnessed around the world from Florida to Hong Kong has drawn much ire .
Why do some people dodge their responsibility in these difficult times ? And should we rely on individuals making responsible choices to begin with ?  I am a researcher of consumer responsibilisation , which means I study how consumers come to accept -- or reject -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , my work looks at how culturally prevalent views on , and emotional reactions to , social problems affect consumer responsibilisation -- as well as how consumers can be motivated to accept responsibility .
This work has inspired me to consider current developments in COVID-19 from this particular vantage point .
In Denmark , where I live , the queen delivered a heartfelt appeal to the nation , stressing that breaking the chain of infection requires that " we all behave sensibly " , and lamenting those who continue to behave irresponsibly .
It was the first such crisis address since the end of the second world war .
Like many others , Queen Margarethe is troubled by the reckless and inconsiderate actions of some .
Irresponsible behaviour  Partying , stock-piling essentials , panic buying and " escaping " to rural areas have all been criticised in news outlets and social media .
These examples reveal some of the challenges the government has faced in making the public take responsibility .
As consumers we have been told that there is no need to panic .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue pretty much undisturbed .
As responsible citizens , we have been told that our lives must change radically .
To continue our old ways is to endanger ourselves and those who are vulnerable .
In the wise and somewhat paradoxical words of the singer and self-styled " responsibiliser " Billie Eilish : " Do n't panic , but also do n't be stupid " .
The young people partying for spring break on the streets and beaches of Miami excelled in the " do n't panic " part , but unfortunately failed to appreciate the social distancing side of things .
The young and healthy have not appeared to be fazed by the dangers of COVID-19 , which is commonly believed to threaten only the old and the frail .
To make matters worse , the likelihood that we are not so much stopping the virus , but merely slowing down its spread has acted as a disincentive , aggravated by the absence of compelling communication -- until now -- about the critical value of slowing the virus .
Although commonly thought of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge , responsibilisation is as much a matter of emotion , as it is a matter of reason .
Emotions such as hope , shame and pride play a decisive role .
Do we feel responsible ? Do we feel that our actions can make a real difference ? Are we ashamed when we fail to act responsibly ? It is one thing to be indifferent to statistics and expert warnings , and another to experience shaming for contributing to the suffering and death of others , as hospitals run out of beds and respirators ? Personal responsibility is often based on the ability to relate emotionally to other human beings -- their hopes and fears , their pain and suffering .
Collective and individual responsibility  Besides issues of empathy , when it comes to COVID-19 responsibilisation goes against the grain to a certain extent .
In contrast to recent crises caused by terrorist attacks , weather events and political division , this time we are asked to stand together by standing apart .
Instead being called to occupy the streets in protest , and frequent shops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked to stay in and to keep our distance .
Acknowledging this difference might help us move forward .
Yet this sense of responsibility has not materialised in some people .
In our haste to find better ways to make the public embrace its responsibilities -- especially the reckless and the inconsiderate -- the focus on personal responsibility and individual choice should never prevent society from taking necessary collective action .
The UK government has now taken that action .
As New York Times commentator Charlie Warzel observed recently , one reason COVID-19 advice has been framed as a matter of personal choice and responsibility was to avoid the costs and duties of political and collective intervention .
Political-economic research has taught us that responsibilisation entails a shifting of burden from the state and corporations to individual citizens and consumers -- a shift that does not always serve the public interest .
Governments , corporations and other institutions must accept their share of responsibility too , even when this requires taking unpopular and costly measures .
Clearly Prime Minister Boris Johnson has decided that decisive collective rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the soft " nudging " of individuals to make the right choice .
Yet , as with other countries that have taken this action , further dilemmas arise as to how to ensure compliance with the new measures .
More than ever , the delicate balance between collective and individual responsibility should be at the forefront of public and academic debate .
