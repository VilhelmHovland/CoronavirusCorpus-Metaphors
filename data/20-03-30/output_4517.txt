Breakfast with Bongani Bingwa  There has been some contradictory directive from government in dealing with parents who have joint custody of their children and how they are to maintain access to their kids during the Covid-19 lockdown , says divorce and custody specialist Shando Theron .
Theron says the parenting plan generally sets the rules on how to navigate joint custody but it does not deal with what the world is currently going through .
I think government itself is also grappling a little bit .
There have been contradictory messages coming out .
here you have got two sorts of communications from government , one is being made into law , the other one is a directive from the minister which are in direct contradiction to each other .
-- Shando Theron , Divorce and custody specialist  For once I do n't blame government , this is a new situation for everybody .
-- Shando Theron , Divorce and custody specialist  What should happen in this time of uncertainty ? What do you do in a situation like this ?  In situations of uncertainty , common sense should prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Act .
it is quite clear on what the yardstick is of anything to do with children and that is the child 's best interest .
-- Shando Theron , Divorce and custody specialist  Would it be in their best interest to be exposed to twice as many people ? What if I am currently asymptomatic and I am a carrier ? Common sense would dictate that the less people are exposed to , the less chances of infection .
-- Shando Theron , Divorce and custody specialist  There are times where it would be essential for the other parent to go to the children .
what if the other parent falls ill and has to go to hospital ? It is difficult .
-- Shando Theron , Divorce and custody specialist  Theron insists that there is no one-size-fits all in the situation there is no clear cut answer .
What is in the children 's best interest in one situation is certainly not going to be in the children 's best interest in another situation , so there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the children 's best interest , not what is convenient .
