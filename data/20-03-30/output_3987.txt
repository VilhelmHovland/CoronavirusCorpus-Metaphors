The Expert View : ' We will pull out all the stops .
And we will prevail '  In early January 2020 I first became aware of a new flu-like illness that had broken out in Wuhan , Hubei Province , China .
A good friend of mine regularly travels to China for work .
He would often be there for five or six months at a time .
I made a joke about how he might now be in line for " a six month holiday , twice a year " .
" You 've got to be joking , sure it 's only a bad cold " he replied .
" The only thing that would stop my work from sending me back to China is if it was something pure lethal " .
Three weeks later his employer terminated his contract .
I am ashamed to admit that when I first heard of this new Coronavirus I was firmly of the Donald Trump school of thought .
Advertisement  I 'm a vocationally trained GP .
I have ten years experience in practice as a GP .
And thirteen years as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I first heard of this new Coronavirus I was firmly of the Donald Trump school of thought .
A new Coronavirus in town  " Sure it 's only a cold " - " It 's just a new kind of mild flu " - " What 's all the fuss " - " You 'd be better off just to catch it and get it out of the way " .
These are all examples of things I actually said , as a Doctor , to real-life patients .
If I could take them back , believe me , I would .
As community physicians GP 's are very familiar with Coronaviruses .
Coronaviruses by-in-large cause the common cold .
Every year we spend an inordinate amount of time managing them .
With , or hopefully without , inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions .
They are almost always self-limiting and relatively benign .
So when I heard there was a new Coronavirus in town ; I was not all that interested or impressed .
After a number of weeks of ignoring the situation ; other than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife advised me to consider taking it seriously .
She advised me that she had been looking into it , and that in her opinion , I was being an idiot .
She was correct .
Instantaneous paradigm shift  I started doing some research .
I can clearly remember the first time I opened the " worldometers " page on the internet .
The worldometers page is based on the work of Johns Hopkins University in tracking the disease .
It gives a live tally of the number of active cases .
The number of deaths .
The number of serious or critical cases .
The number of mild cases .
And the number of recovered cases .
A nauseous sinking feeling overwhelmed as I read that the percentage of cases which were , at that time , classified as " Serious or Critical " was 14% .

Any medic will know that there is absolutely no way that ANY health system in the world , no matter how well funded or advanced , could come even close to coping ; if 14% of all patients , suffering from an easily transmissible infection , were to end up in a " Serious or Critical " condition in a short space of time .
Thankfully as time has passed that all-important number of 14% has been steadily dropping .
Today it stands at 4% .
As testing for the virus has increased we are getting more valuable and representative data to work with .
Extended testing will inevitably pick up more of the cases which are mild .
Every mild case is vital .
They help to correct the data and give us a truer picture of what is actually happening .
Prepare for the storm  Let me walk you through some numbers ;  If 40% ( a very conservative estimate ) of the Irish population were to contract COVID-19 more or less simultaneously then 1 .
people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serious or Critical " then 76,000 people would , at a minimum , need a hospital bed and Oxygen .
Advertisement  The task ahead of us to prepare for this coming storm is huge .
We have 14,200 Hospital beds in Ireland ; total .
As you already know , these beds are pretty much all permanently occupied .
The task ahead of us to prepare for this coming storm is huge .
This is not a drill  The experts say that our trajectory is some weeks ahead of Italy and Spain .
We MUST use this precious time wisely .
We must heed the lessons of our Mediterranean friends and compatriots .
We must prepare .
We must Slow The Spread of the virus .
The single best thing we can do , at this time , is to manage the spread of the disease in the community .
We must test - test - test .
And we must trace - trace - trace every positive case .
Thankfully our scientific and political leaders have shown impressive empathy , understanding and intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health policy .
We must - every last one of us - heed all Public Health advice .
We have one shot to get this right .
As Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has advised us ; " This is not a drill .
Not the time to give up .
Not a time for excuses .
This is a time for pulling out all the stops " .
I firmly believe that this is exactly what the people of this great country will do .
We will pull out all the stops .
And we will prevail .
