EU LEADERS HAVE given eurozone finance ministers a fortnight to come up with a stronger response to the economic havoc wrought by the coronavirus pandemic .
During six hours of fraught discussions by video conference , the 27 leaders struggled to agree a unified response to the Covid-19 crisis .
Nine countries , including hardest-hit Italy and Spain , had pleaded in a letter ahead of the summit for " corona bonds " , and pooled borrowing to cushion the economic blow of the virus , which has sent economies into hibernation and markets into chaotic flux .
But the call was given short shrift by northern countries , and instead a summit declaration tasked the Eurogroup of single currency zone finance ministers with coming up with options within two weeks .
Taoiseach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU heads of state and government yesterday evening ; this is the third such meeting in the past two weeks .
Among the things they did agree on , was to coordinate joint actions on containing the spread of the virus , on procurement of vital medical equipment , on facilitating critical supply chains , on funding research into vaccines and new medicines , and on getting EU citizens home .
They also agreed to a joint statement on their common approach :  These proposals should take into account the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 shock affecting all our countries and our response will be stepped up , as necessary , with further action in an inclusive way , in light of developments , in order to deliver a comprehensive response .
Recognising the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 pandemic , they welcomed the financial commitments of the European Commission , the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank .
' Adapted to a war '  The talks dragged on as Madrid and Rome blocked the statement , holding out for a stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , the Italian leader wanted a " strong and sufficient " financial response that would deploy " innovative financial instruments truly adapted to a war " .
And Spain 's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned : " If we do not propose a unified , powerful and effective response to this economic crisis now , not only will the impact be harder , but its effects will last longer and we will be jeopardising the whole European project .
" We can not make the same mistakes of the 2008 financial crisis , which sowed seeds of disaffection and division with the European project and caused the rise of populism .
We must learn that lesson , " he said , in a statement that recalled " the need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European institution to raise funds on the market .
"  But northern countries led by Germany and the Netherlands were against what they see as efforts by their southern neighbours to push their long-standing demands for eurozone members to pool public debt .
German Chancellor Angela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all member states , while Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte gave a more blunt assessment .
" We are against it , but it 's not just us , and I can not forsee any circumstances in which we would change that position , " Rutte said .
Rutte and Merkel both pointed to existing crisis tools such as the European Stability Mechanism as more suitable to the task .
At a video conference last week , Conte suggested the creation of corona bonds to pool the debt of the 19 countries in the eurozone .
France , Spain and Italy have long called for some kind of eurobond that would in effect allow joint borrowing by the 19 members of the euro single currency .
They say it could serve as the bedrock of a safer and more unified European economy and would become a globally respected asset on par with US Treasury bills .
