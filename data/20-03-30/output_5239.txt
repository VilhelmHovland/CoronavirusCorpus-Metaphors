( Photo courtesy of Barangay San Antonio , Pasig )  MANILA -- A barangay in Pasig City is boosting its mass surveillance tools -- especially during these times when government authorities are hard put in implementing social distancing and curfew in the fight against coronavirus -- by equipping its 73 closed-circuit television cameras ( CCTVs ) with an AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) software that enable them to monitor people 's movements in real-time .
Barangay San Antonio Chairman Raymond Lising said the new monitoring system , which utilizes smart CCTVs , intends to closely monitor the movement of residents along the streets in the barangay during the quarantine period .
Lising said Barangay San Antonio has dozens of existing CCTVs in their command center and just adopted a new system using a dashboard and AI software provided for free through Project Greengrass of Things .
and RxR Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity monitoring map powered by Al-based CCTV analytics , enables the local authorities to keep an eye of areas covered by the quarantine .
It helps in ensuring residents to stay indoors to stop the spread of the dreaded coronavirus disease .
" Mayroon na kaming 73 CCTVs .
We just added AI software para maging smart CCTVs sila na kayang mag-monitor ng galaw ng tao if tumatambay man sila at nag-uumpukan or hindi sumusunod sa social distancing at curfew ( We have 73 CCTVs .
We just added AI software to make smart CCTVs that can monitor the movement of people at this time , whether they observe social distancing and follow curfew hours ) , " Lising said .
The people-counter feature of the AI software enables the map to display how many people are actually moving in a certain area of the barangay .
Lising said the CCTVs have an indicator of the number of people who are out on the streets .
It is also color-coded : green when there is one person in an area or no person at all or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 persons ; and solid red when there are 11 persons or more .
" Makikita namin kung may kumpulan or kaunti ang tao kasi nagkukulay sa monitoring system namin dahil may indicator , mas maging epektibo ' yung implementasyon ng enhanced community quarantine sa aming barangay ( We can now monitor a gathering or grouping of people through the color-coding on our monitoring system and this makes the implementation of quarantine easier in our barangay ) , " Lising said .
When personnel manning the command center are alerted by the indicators of the smart CCTVs , they will inform the security personnel through radio so that they can dispatch personnel to the specific area and remind the public to observe social distancing .
Since the new technology provides the movement of people in real-time , Lising said it is a " big help " in the monitoring and implementation of social distancing and curfew in the village .
" Pagdating sa curfew zero talaga ang tao sa kalsada , no moving out sa homes agad-agad ' yung security personnel na ma-aalert parai-enforce ang physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been no curfew violators as our security personnel can immediately proceed to a particular place to enforce these Covid-19 measures ) , " he added .
Lising said the technology would soon include a vehicle-counter feature as well .
" Before we just use conventional CCTV system , now we have added artificial intelligence through a software company to make this possible , " Lising said .
The barangay will soon launch its short messaging service ( SMS ) -blasting platform in collaboration with one of the country 's largest telecommunications companies .
