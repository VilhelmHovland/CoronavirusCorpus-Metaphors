The former San Diego State golfer and Instagram sensation is still finding time to practice her swing .
Not on the links , but in her apartment .
Spiranac posted video of her firing off practice shots in her apartment .
Thankfully , she 's using plastic golf balls and not the real things .
We would n't recommend hitting a full shot indoors with a real ball and one of your irons .
" Just working on shot shaping and ball flight , " Spiranac wrote as a caption .
Like we said , it might be a while before Spiranac can get back out on a real course .
Even when she does , she has to pick and choose where she plays .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been shunned by the golf community because of her " cleavage .
"  " It 's like my whole life I 'm trying to find a place where I can fit in and that I feel comfortable and that I feel at peace with myself and I have n't found that .
Golf is the absolute worst place for me to be because I am the exact opposite of everything that a golfer should encompass , should be , and I 'm not , " Spiranac said .
" I 'm not refined , I 'm raw and real and I wear what I want and I have always been so different and golf is not that way .
