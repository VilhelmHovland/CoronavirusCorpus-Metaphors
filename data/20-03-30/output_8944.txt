Speaking with Sky Sports Germany , German Tennis Federation VP Dirk Hordorff said this year 's edition of Wimbledon will be canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic .
Previously , All England Lawn Tennis Club officials had indicated the 2020 tournament would not be played behind closed doors and that postponing it to a later date would be difficult to do .
Now , according to Hordorff , Wimbledon will simply be canceled outright .
" Wimbledon has stated that they will have a board meeting next Wednesday and will make the final decision there , " Hordorff told Sky Sports .
" I am also involved in the bodies of the ATP and WTA .
The necessary decisions have already been made there and Wimbledon will decide to cancel next Wednesday .
There is no doubt about it .
This is necessary in the current situation .
It is completely unrealistic to imagine that with the travel restrictions that we currently have an international tennis tournament where hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world would travel .
That is unthinkable .
"  Instead of canceling , organizers of the French Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
However , that move has been with criticism because the French Open 's new date conflicts with several other scheduled tennis events that are already on the calendar .
Wimbledon , which can not be held past late summer , was scheduled to begin on June 29 .
