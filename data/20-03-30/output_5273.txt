Remember December 2019 ? That innocent age before our kids knew how to spell ' Covid ' , when all we were worried about was the terrible bushfires and the ongoing climate crisis ? In only three months , the novel coronavirus has spread everywhere and all of us are engaged in a continual , rolling recalculation of its mind-boggling implications .
The virus may have emerged in China , an authoritarian state , but it does n't distinguish between political systems : democracy and dictatorship alike have staggered under Covid-19 's frightening spread .
Dozens of nations are in lockdown , infections keep climbing and a global recession looms .
China was first into the pandemic , so it may be one of the earliest out .
A geostrategic risk out of all of this is that the perceived ' lesson ' of the pandemic will be that authoritarianism works and democracy is chaos .
Anywhere you look , government is back , in a big way .
Most national governments , both democratic and autocratic , have concluded they need to fight the virus by throttling the freedoms underpinning market economies .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures curtailing civic freedoms are evidently necessary for curtailing the outbreak in the absence of a vaccine , autocracy has no monopoly on an effective response .
The lack of transparency and accountability , the restrictions on freedom of speech and the lack of a free media in authoritarian countries may in fact make things worse on the ground , as it seems to have done in China in the early days of the outbreak , with consequences we are all now living with .
More important in predicting the efficiency of a nation 's response might be whether it has a population and a public health system with a fresh memory of an epidemic , as in Taiwan and Singapore , which were hit by SARS in 2002 and 2003 , and South Korea , which was hit by MERS in 2015 .
In the past month , South Korea has managed to flatten the curve without resorting to China 's heavy-handed tactics .
The death rate and rate of transmission have been dramatically reduced and the country 's approach has been hailed as an example to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing ( almost 360,000 of 51 million citizens tested ) has been crucial in restraining the outbreak .
Laws enabling aggressive contact-tracing enacted after MERS mean epidemiologists can act ' like police detectives ' and quickly track down and quarantine infected people .
Mass text messaging , effective public mobilisation and a nationalised healthcare system have also been important factors .
After the SARS outbreak , Taiwan empowered a central command centre for epidemics , implementing lessons from that crisis .
Taiwan moved fast on Covid-19 , establishing health checks for passengers from Wuhan in early January .
It is employing a mobile phone location tracking system to keep people who 've been exposed to the virus quarantined in their homes .
As of 29 March , Taiwan -- which has a population the size of Australia 's and much closer ties to China -- had reported just 298 confirmed cases and two deaths .
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told his people in a national address on 8 February that the experience of SARS had prepared them for the next epidemic .
Singapore has a National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other medical equipment , a cadre of trained medical personnel and strong research capabilities .
As of 29 March , the global transport hub had reported 844 cases and three deaths .
It has cast aside privacy considerations , launching a public health app which creates a record of virus spread risks by analysing the Bluetooth connections of users ' phones .
It 's been reported that those not using the app could be prosecuted .
An app linked to the popular payment system Alipay assigned tens of millions of Chinese users a green , yellow or red code based on opaque data the users were not aware of , the New York Times reported .
Those without green codes , whether sick or not , found themselves arbitrarily forbidden from travelling anywhere , even , in some cases , from entering their own apartment buildings .
The Times found the app shared user information and location data with the police each time it was used .
It 's still early days .
The risk of a second wave of infections in Asia , including China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopping transmission .
But the narrative battle matters , because the pandemic risks shaping a more illiberal world .
The deaths and suffering from the virus itself , combined with extraordinary public health measures like isolating people in their homes , are likely to tip most of the world into an economic downturn , bankrupt innumerable small businesses , decimate industries and deepen inequality .
All of these factors risk exacerbating existing impulses towards a dismal , nativist politics as fear heightens and nations turn inwards .
Distrust in internationalism is likely to increase just as it 's most needed .
Leadership can make a difference to this bleak prognosis , as can tangible international cooperation at this time of crisis .
But that kind of leadership has been in short supply so far .
The pandemic is also likely to hardwire our dependence on technology , making our reliance on digital connectivity so absolute that we become more willing to tolerate the downsides of life in a post-privacy age .
Democratic governments may be tempted -- or driven -- to emulate the techniques of autocratic ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of ' deviance ' will shift with political priorities : this year the government may want your data for a public health emergency ; next time it might be because they do n't like your opinions .
The story of which system wins the battle against Covid-19 will have vernacular power around the world , and it seems likely that -- even with strong , fact-based counter-messaging and clarity and transparency around democratic responses -- great-power competition will accelerate and a more fractured , more dangerous world will result .
