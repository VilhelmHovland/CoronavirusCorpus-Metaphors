Blessed are the bean brewers .
The sacred bringers of the hot buzzy drink we love to slurp .
Especially those from a Sydney cafe who have racked up a whole heap of prepaid coffees from its regulars , because they wan na give away free coffee to locals who work on the medical frontline , or have lost jobs or homes due to the national shutdown .
Saint Marks in Randwick has been collecting prepaid coffees from its regulars , who are chucking on an extra coff on top of their daily bean , and have tallied up an incredible number of brews for locals who are doing it a bit tough at the moment .
Think nurses , doctors , ambos , receptionists , pathology units , cleaners , GPs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and flatten the curve at home .
People who also , absolutely , 1000% deserve a free hot coffee to keep them caffeinated and sharp-minded while on the job .
I 'm pretty sure we all know someone who 's out there every day , working in essential services to make sure people are getting the care and support they need , so this is just a really damn precious way the locals can pay it forward in a very hands-off kinda way .
We 're also super well aware that millions of Aussies have lost a lot in a short couple of weeks , so this is something to warm the heart ( and your guts ) if you 're having a bit of a hard time at the moment .
Apparently there were over 150 coffees chalked up by people nipping into the cafe for their daily bean , and at the time of writing that 150 is the number yet to be claimed .
So if you 're in the Randwick area and you 're having a bit of a rough trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop over to the cafe with all the roses painted on the front for your free coffee .
And if you 're not , think about throwing in some extra cash on top of your morning brew to shout someone else their AM kicker .

When Scott Morrison chastised ABC journalist Andrew Probyn during a televised press conference , TikTok turned it into a meme overnight .
It was only a matter of days before a dance remix dropped , and now Melbourne art director Jeff van de Zandt has found himself as the unintended face of it .
Van de Zandt had been lip-syncing online for years , back since the days of Dubsmash .
Currently on self-isolation at home , the 30-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Work completely dried up and I was like , I have nothing to do and I 'm stuck at home .
So I just decided to start doing one TikTok a day and then people started sharing that particular dance and now it 's gone mental , " he told PEDESTRIAN .
" I feel like such a fraud because all I 'm doing is lip-syncing to the track ; I 'm actually doing nothing but dancing to it , " he said .
The original remix of Scott Morrison 's lecture over the beats of Duke Dumont 's Red Light Green Light was uploaded to TikTok by Triple J a day earlier .
It 's been liked over 44,000 times .
Van de Zandt 's TikTok , by comparison , has around three thousand likes , making it the sound 's third-most-popular upload .
But off TikTok , Van de Zandt has become the face of the tune .
Within just two days it had gone viral on Facebook , Twitter and even Instagram .
While his video did not take over TikTok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet .
" The message that I get the most is that it 's .
a moment to laugh about something rather than their feed that 's constantly full of drama all the crap in the media , " he said .
Sometimes watching a cute boy bop with a fan -- even if the tune is the Prime Minister berating a journo at a coronavirus press conference -- is enough to take your mind off the pandemic for just a moment .
Van de Zandt has been watching some of the PM 's press conferences while cooped up at home , but even he admits it all gets a bit too much sometimes .
He 's been off work in self-isolation for two weeks and said he 's " not into the politics but literally just doing it for the fun .
"  Since the video went viral , Van de Zandt 's mates have been pinging him every time someone famous shares it on social media .
He lists Zo ? Foster Blake , Matty J and the ABC 's own Leigh Sales as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm getting sent the Leigh Sales one the most , because she 's such a legit , hardcore journalist on the ABC , I was like ' wow that 's that 's a big deal for someone to be sharing something as silly as this ' , " he said .
Old friends and even acquaintances have also been coming out from the woodwork , now that his face is all over social media .
" People who 've had anything to do with me are all-of-a-sudden like ' OMG we had so much to do with each other .
that one time ' , " he added .
It 's not the first time Van de Zandt has poked fun at Scott Morrison 's prolific coronavirus press conferences .
When Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney from Get Krack ! nparodied the PM 's vague lockdown rules on Twitter , he uploaded the audio to TikTok .
It 's now been lip-synced by countless other Aussies on the app .
He 's also the first person to lip-sync Sammy J'stake on the press conferences .
Van de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dancing has blown up is simple : " It 's so out of character for a prime minister to have a go to someone like that publicly .
It 's like he 's a teacher in a classroom of children .
"  As for whether he 's Team Andrew or Team Katherine , Van de Zandt has cast his lot with Guardian Australia 's Katherine Murphy , even whipping out a fan when the PM mentions her name .
" It gives her even more power ! "  Feeling a bit deflated that it 's only Monday ? Reminiscing about Saturday night on House Party ? Let me give you something to look forward to -- Fitzroy 's Mr West Bar &amp; Bottle Shop are delivering 1 .
' bagnums ' of espresso martini &amp; negroni to the doors of Melbourne , Sydney and Brisbane folk .
For all you local Melbourne folk , if you order between 12-8PM -- for $7 .
flat rate -- you can get these blessed sacks of joy delivered to your door within the hour .
Check the below ' gram to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sydney folk , you 'll have to wait a smidge longer -- 3-10 days depending on where you reside .
( Still worth it , in my opinion .
Do I need to remind you that it 's 1 .
fucking litres of joy ? )  Coronavirus has wreaked havoc on many aspects of our daily lives , but its easy to forget about the not-for-profit organisations that have been hit hard by the virus that has shaken up society .

Coronavirus has wreaked havoc on many aspects of our daily lives , but its easy to forget about the not-for-profit organisations that have been hit hard by the virus that has shaken up society .
But it turns out you can do your part for a NFP by simply tuning in to an adorable livestream of baby farm animals having their breakfast .
Yes , it really is that simple .
Victorian animal shelter Edgar 's Mission has unfortunately had to cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the ongoing coronavirus crisis , but you can still support their efforts by tuning into and sharing their adorable feeding sessions .
Founder Pam Ahern and the team at Edgar 's Mission regularly live-stream their feeding sessions , giving you enough cute farm animal content to have you signing up for Farmer Wants A Wife .
Obviously , as unemployment rates skyrocket around the country , not everyone has a few dollars to spare to help out a not-for-profit .
Thankfully , Pam from Edgar 's Mission has advised that supporting the sanctuary with a simple follow or share on social media can also help to spread their message while most of us ca n't really afford to donate .
We 're all bored out of our brains , and most of us have already exhausted every good show on Netflix and Stan , so why not tune into some cute animal videos and spread the word about a good cause ?  Not to mention , they post a tonne of adorable content like this workout video that has me in tears .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adopt a pet goat right now .
If you 're fortunate enough to have some extra cash , you can support the organisation by purchasing their cruelty-free cookbook , or making a donation on their website .
But even if you do n't have any money to spare , you can help out Pam and the team at Edgar 's Mission by simply sharing their adorable animal content with your friends and family .
We could all use a bit of cute animal content to brighten up our days , and this way you 're helping to keep a much-needed animal sanctuary running .
When the coronavirus situation is over , you can take a tour of the sanctuary in Lancefield and live out your Farmer Wants A Wife dream alongside some of the cutest animals of all time .

Australian renters can breathe a little easier thanks to a temporary moratorium on evictions during the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , but questions remain over how tenants , landlords , and the banks are meant to cooperate during the public health crisis .

Australian renters can breathe a little easier thanks to a temporary moratorium on evictions during the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , but questions remain over how tenants , landlords , and the banks are meant to cooperate during the public health crisis .
In case you missed it , Prime Minister Scott Morrison last night announced that for six months , landlords will not be permitted to turf out residential and commercial tenants who are facing financial distress .
It was a big move , intended to shield individuals and businesses who have been absolutely clobbered by mandatory industry shutdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure landlords actually have tenants when the shutdowns come to an end .
The turmoil has seen vulnerable tenants enter rent relief negotiations with their landlords , often with mixed results .
One South Melbourne tenant told PEDESTRIAN .
her " incredibly greedy " landlord asked for a rental increase of $50 a week from April .
She successfully negotiated a rental freeze and a new month-to-month arrangement .
Another tenant living in Sydney 's North Shore said she has submitted a request to pay reduced rent for two months after one housemate experienced a serious drop in rostered hours .
A separate Sydney resident said she is pursuing a deal with her landlord after a potential housemate , who was scheduled to move in , lost her job entirely .
Both are yet to hear back from their landlords .
Other punters are sharing their own stories on social media , highlighting how some landlords are coping with the current crisis ( not well , as it turns out ) .
We understand you may be in financial strife .
Have you considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your continuing rent payments .
Kind regards **26;1746;TOOLONG  The moratorium is " obviously a positive step , " said Leo Patterson Ross , Senior Policy Officer at the NSW Tenants ' Union .
" This is what tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands , if not millions , frankly , of tenants have been calling out for .
"  But the plan is n't fully fleshed out -- yet .
While Morrison urged landlords to compromise to keep vulnerable Australians from losing their accommodation and businesses , the Government is yet to release clear guidelines for how the moratorium should actually work .
" Some landlords are coming to the table and saying ' I understand it 's both morally the right thing to do , but also commercially in my interest to keep you as a tenant , ' " Patterson Ross said .
" But unfortunately some are coming back and saying ' No , pay your rent or I will start eviction proceedings .
' They are playing hardball , and they probably are n't thinking about it entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require a " mind-shift " from landlords .
" Unfortunately , the rental sector in Australia is very much weighted towards landlords ' interests , and they 've gotten used to that , " Patterson Ross said .
Next month 's rent is n't the only concern , either .
There are real fears that tenants who go into arrears may face whopping repayments to their landlords once this is over , plus concerns that renters could incur black marks on their rental history for coming to an agreement in the first place .
So our RE did n't waste much time .
This email received this morning .
Note as predicted , a stay of execution with an expectation that tenants will be able to catch up potentially 6 mths rent in one hit .
And reinforcing that the landlord is their interest , not tenant well being .
**26;1774;TOOLONG  There 's more , too .
While the National Cabinet agreed to let tenants terminate their leases " on the grounds of financial distress , " we do n't yet know if doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're still not sure what mechanisms will be put in place to protect renters after this six month period , if anything is on the way at all .
It 's clear that ironing out those details will be crucial going forward , as every level of the system -- that is , tenants , landlords , and the banking system -- looks to take a massive hit because of the crisis .
Speaking last night , Morrison said there is " no rule book " for the dire situation we 've found ourselves in .
Patterson Ross hopes that changes soon .
" I think there are some landlords who will compromise and that 's great , " he said .
" But I think we 'd be very skeptical that it would be a widespread phenomenon without more clear direction from the Government .
"  As more and more Aussies turn to Centrelink during the coronavirus pandemic , the system remains pretty tricky to navigate .
You had questions , we had answers , then you had more questions , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , answering your questions once again to help you get what you 're entitled to .
Here 's .
When does the Centrelink money come in ?  If you 're on the Youth Allowance , Newstart , Austudy or similar , the $550 coronavirus supplement will be included in your fortnightly payments starting on April 27 .
You can see a full list of who is eligible for the $550 fortnightly payment here .
Most Centrelink recipients will also receive a one-off payment of $750 from March 31 .
Centrelink reckons most will receive the cash by April 17 , and some people may also receive a second payment of $750 in July .
You can see a full list of who is eligible for the payment here .
How do I get a CRN ?  First things first : you do not need a CRN to lodge your intent to claim .
Do this first on MyGov so that your payments will be backdated to that day .
Now , after you 've lodged your intent to claim , you will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be processed .
In the past , this involved physically going into a Centrelink service centre and showing ID .
Because of the coronavirus , this has been scrapped .
Now all you need to do is state your identity over the phone , but this is of course easier said than done .
After you 've lodged your intent to claim , you should call Centrelink 's online accounts hotline on 132 307 .
It operates between 7 AM-10 PM from Monday to Friday , and between 10 AM-5 PM on weekends and public holidays .
Because of the huge influx of new customers , expect to be put on hold for ages .
There 's nothing wrong with your claim , the system is just overwhelmed .
I 've lodged my intent to claim but have n't heard back yet .
When will Centrelink contact me ?  The official line from Centrelink is that you should wait for them to contact you .
We know that many hundreds of thousands of Aussies have already lodged their intent to claim , so there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think something has gone wrong in the process , you can in theory ring Centrelink at the relevant phone number .
Unfortunately , you 're unlikely to get through as the phone are totally backed up at the moment .
If you lodged your intent to claim before today , your payments will be backdated to March 23 .
This is the Centrelink 's way of compensating for the fact MyGov had been down for many days .
If you lodged after today , your payments will be backdated to the day you lodged .
This gives you some breathing room to supply the info you need , and for Centrelink to work through the massive influx of new claims .
The best thing to do in most cases is to just wait .
Centrelink is still asking for documents .
Did n't they waive these requirements ?  After a rough start , Centrelink did axe means testing and other requirements during the coronavirus pandemic .
Centrelink applicants now no longer need to provide a bank statement , Employment Separation Certificate or proof of rental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these documents and wo n't let you progress your claim otherwise , you 're in a pickle .
Normally , your best bet would be to call Centrelink , but that 's not really possible at this time .
You may have luck starting your claim over from scratch .
Just be sure you 've already lodged your intent to claim so that the payments are backdated .
The government has already announced that it intends to make changes to means testing , so that your partner 's income wo n't disqualify you from claiming Centrelink payment if you 've lost your job due to the coronavirus pandemic .
While this has not been finalised yet , it is expected to be set at around $70,000 .
If you or your partner also receive Centrelink payments such as the Family Tax Benefit , you will still be able to claim new payments such as the Jobseeker Payment ( formerly known as Newstart ) during the coronavirus pandemic .
This is n't new , as many payments are not mutually-exclusive .
The only way existing payments can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be entitled to additional payments .
For example , people who receive the Family Tax Benefit will automatically get the $750 Economic Support Payment sometime in April .
I have n't lost my job but my shifts have been reduced .
Am I entitled to anything ?  Yes !  As we 've covered in the past , the claims process has been simplified so that most people earning less than $1,075 a fortnight will be eligible for some kind of payment .
If you 're technically still employed , that 's fine -- you no longer need to provide an Employment Separation Certificate anyway .
I 'm crashing at a mate 's place with no fixed address .
Can I still claim ?  The address you provide to Centrelink is not super important .
Although you might not have a fixed address , your bank account should still have one listed already .
The government has waived the need to supply proof of rental arrangement , which means people informally paying rent to a mate or relative have been spared of an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what your rent expenses are in order to make a claim .
In terms of receiving important info , remember that most letters are sent via MyGov nowadays .
Are new claims being fast-tracked ?  Yes and no .
It 's true that waiting times have been cut .
Previously , if you had over $5,500 in funds as an individual or over $11,000 as a couple , you 'd have to wait between one and 13 weeks before your claim was processed .
Due to the coronavirus pandemic , this has been abolished for the time being .
Services Australia , which oversees Centrelink , Medicare and more , is also in the process of hiring around 5,000 additional staff to speed up processing times .
However , other rumours that certain people 's claims have been " fast-tracked " are not based in fact .

I do n't know about you but just looking at the Totti 's instagram has got my stomach growling .
BRB quietly weeping because I have n't been able to sit in the sun outside a nice pub with a bottle of wine and a bunch of snacky treats for what feels like forever .
And not only that , but the geniuses behind the bar have picked out a few wines to pair with your take-home dinner , or if you 're feeling like leaning right in -- bottled cocktails .
Honestly one thing I 'm really loving from the shutdown is how many bars are bottling their cocktail menus .
Genius move , and I truly hope it lasts beyond the shutdown .

With Premier Daniel Andrews announcing this morning that Victoria will be placed under what he calls " stage three " coronavirus restrictions as of midnight Monday , it 's worth taking a moment to decipher just what in the blue hell that actually means .
With confusing messaging coming in a constant stream from Canberra , and each individual State and Territory largely left to decide what part of what recommendations applies to them , it can be hard to interpret just what exactly you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restrictions .
We 've taken the time to sift through all the regulations set to be brought into effect in Victoria so you have as clear an idea as you can about what life is gon na look like tomorrow .
What does " Stage 3 " actually mean ?  The short answer there is that Stage 3 lockdowns mean the most recent Federal recommendations on social gatherings are being made legally enforceable in Victoria .
Last night , Prime Minister Scott Morrison recommended all indoor and outdoor gatherings be limited to two people maximum .
In Victoria , those limits will be enforceable by police from midnight Monday , with on-the-spot fines of over $1,600 to apply to any individual found to be flouting them .
Are there any exceptions to that ?  The two-person indoor and outdoor gathering limit does not apply to family households of more than two people .
It also does not apply to existing households ( read : sharehouses ) with more than two people in them .
The gathering limit also does not apply to workplaces and schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
What does this mean for me ?  You are not allowed to have any visitors at all -- a person living by themselves is allowed one non-family member to visit , though it is heavily discouraged .
You and your housemates are allowed to leave the house together , as a group , provided you are performing any one of the four basic functions of food shopping , seeking medical treatment , exercising , or commuting to unavoidable work or study .
I live in Abbotsford .
Can I visit my family or partner if they live in Prahran ?  This remains unclear for now .
The Federal Government messaging on the matter is muddy , although they did clarify this morning that you can visit your siblings or parents , or your partner if you consider them to be " family .
" Conversely , the official Victorian Government directive is " if you can stay home , you must stay home .
" The State Government does consider leaving the house for " compassionate " reasons to be a compelling reason , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more information becomes available .
Can my housemates and I go outside for a walk ?  You sure can ! Members of your immediate household are permitted to gather together outside for the purposes of daily exercise .
This includes things like going for a walk or a run or whathaveyou .
Social distancing measures still apply , mind you .
So keep some space between you all .
All other forms of outdoor gathering in public are banned , however .
If you 're loading up an esky and plopping down on a picnic rug to sink a few fresh air frothies at the park , you 're gon na cop a big fine .
Are there any more closures under Stage 3 ?  Playgrounds , skate parks , and outdoor gyms will close as part of Stage 3 restrictions .
All previous business closures remain in place , per Federal Government guidelines .
Cafes and hospitality businesses are still permitted to conduct takeaway only business , although it 's unclear at this stage how that will be reconciled with the " shopping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and funerals ?  The two-person gathering limit does not apply to weddings and funerals .
Previously-announced gathering restrictions of 5 people per wedding and 10 people per funeral apply .
I 've been stood down from my job and ca n't make rent this month .
What happens now ?  Victoria has this morning accepted and implemented the moratorium on money-based property evictions for both commercial and residential tenants .
You will not be booted from your house because the coronavirus pandemic has caused your income to bottom out for the next six months .
There is reportedly more rental relief on the way for tenants , but for the time being if you are experiencing financial stress , it is best to contact your property manager and landlord and attempt to come to some sort of arrangement , be that a rent reduction , a rent pause , or a rent holiday .
Whether that occurs is up to the discretion of your landlord at this stage , however .
What happens to any selfish turd who decides to ignore the new restrictions ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not just the 500 officers assigned to coronavirus restriction enforcement last week -- will be directed to hand on-the-spot fines to anyone caught ignoring the social movement restrictions .
For individuals , this fine will be $1,652 .
For a business , that fine climbs to $9,913 .
Those fines can also be exponentially increased through the courts in severe cases .
Will other states follow suit ?  That 's a big fat TBD .
It 's suspected that NSW and the ACT may implement similar measures at some point , although that remains largely unconfirmed .
Ultimately , it 's a decision for each individual state to make .
The frequent handballing by the Federal Government has made it abundantly clear that a nationally-mandated lockdown is not going to happen .
Victoria , in moving to Stage 3 , is the first state to take that step .
If you think you may have coronavirus , either call your doctor ( DO N'T visit ) or contact the national Coronavirus Health Information Hotline on 1800 020 080 .
If you 're struggling to breathe or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please remember to wash your hands frequently ( for at least 20 seconds ) and keep at least 1 .
metres between you and those around you .
As if the pandemic was n't bad enough , state and local utility providers are urging Australians not to flush anything but human waste and toilet paper down the drain after a dramatic surge in festy sewer blockages .
SA Water yesterday urged South Australians to avoid flushing anything but the " Three Ps " -- that is , pee , poo , .
SA Water yesterday urged South Australians to avoid flushing anything but the " Three Ps " -- that is , pee , poo , and ( toilet ) paper -- lest residents unwittingly clog sewers and make life that much worse for everyone .
Speaking to ABC News , Scott Moorhead of Townsville Water said the region usually drops about $2 million each year to clear such blockages .
Demand for blockage-clearing services is currently much higher than average , he said .
" Chokes can occur in our mains or your internal plumbing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe breaking out into the environment or unfortunately coming back up through your toilet or drain , requiring a plumber or one of our crews to clean up the mess , " she said earlier this month .
Consumers have been assured by supermarkets and manufacturers that there 's enough TP for everyone , if we handle this situation with a bit of calm .
All in all , please do n't go overboard with the loo roll .
Someone out there might be thinking about putting carpet where carpet should never go .
Please do n't flush wipes , paper towels or facial tissues down the toilet .
ca n't break down like toilet paper and can cause a sewer spill .
you need to use them put them in the bin instead .
