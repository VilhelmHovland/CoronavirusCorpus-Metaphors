On day eight of the theater shutdown , I spoke to an unnamed managing director at a New York theater whose panic was beginning to consume her .
She was furious and terrified and bewildered -- how was theater going to survive ? Why did n't people understand the existential threat ? Even the fast-growing community efforts and GoFundMe campaigns and digital arts initiatives did n't offer her any comfort -- if anything , they heightened her anxiety .
" The best of those is , say , raising $30,000 , " she said .
" The need for these workers is so much much greater than that ! They need an agency with more power to step in and address the needs they have , and theater institutions , who are themselves in free fall , are not necessarily able to do that .
There needs to be serious government advocacy ! I do n't know who that advocate is , and the peers that I 'm talking to now do n't know who that is .
"  On day fifteen , we know .
Theatre Communications Group ( TCG ) has long been a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and individual members ( 10,000 , give or take ) .
It offers conferences , webinars , research and data collection , networking , the magazine American Theatre , and , crucially , advocacy .
" We have an advocacy team of one ! " laughs executive director Teresa Eyring , referring to Laurie Baskin , the director of TCG 's Research , Policy &amp; Collective Action department .
" But with a lot of support from the staff and the board , " Eyring says , " Baskin is working tirelessly to make sure that on the federal level , someone is supporting our arts ecology .
" What that actually means is being part of a complicated web of co-advocacy mechanisms , like the Performing Arts Alliance ( PAA ) , a megagroup of trade organizations .
( It also means conference calls of staggering length .
)  Regardless of membership , in the current crisis , TCG 's constituency is now .
all of American performance .
It 's not that TCG and the PAA are the only ones fighting for theatermakers .
A powerful multipronged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come from unions like SAG/AFTRA , IATSE , and Actors ' Equity , while issues particular to playwrights are being funneled through the Dramatists ' Guild , since multiunion agreements do n't cover them .
But when I spoke to resident theater organizers , many agreed that when it comes to speaking for their concerns , TCG is at the point of the spear .
The actor and playwright Nikkole Salter is a board member of TCG and sits on the council of the Dramatists ' Guild .
If it were a normal March , Salter says TCG would be gearing up for Arts Advocacy Day , when arts lobbyists descend on the Hill to argue for everything from the protection of wireless microphones from interference to improving the artists ' visa process .
" That 's the work they 've always done , " says Salter , " and now that whole department has ramped up .
A lot of what I learned about advocating with my senators in New Jersey is that they need evidence of care -- in other words , written notices and letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the request , what they have to do is rally that support , that physical evidence , when they take to their legislative body .
So TCG is pushing people to use their voice , use the forms , sign onto the Action Alerts .
That becomes a kind of currency as they fight for our request .
"  There has been a huge effort to communicate the specific harms and vulnerabilities in the arts , and news about the government response is mixed .
After conducting a fieldwide survey , Americans for the Arts estimated the immediate damage caused by the coronavirus and presented the result to Congress : $4 billion .
It was n't the amount that would make every wound whole , but it was ambitious and it would stanch the bleeding .
Of course , you never get exactly what you ask for in negotiations like these , and several of the advocates I spoke with did n't expect to here .
But in the current $2 trillion relief package , the only performing-arts-specific allocations come in at $150 million -- $75 million to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other half by the National Endowment for the Humanities .
( A further $25 million goes just to the Kennedy Center .
) Although $150 million is n't chump change , it 's only 3 .
percent of the original ask .
You could film a season of Westworld with that money ; you will obviously not be able to restart an entire sector .
A government relations consultant for cultural organizations , who asked to remain anonymous to protect future efforts , described the bill as totally insufficient , a " drop in the bucket .
" ( Germany is giving its arts sector $52 billion , for a fun comparison .
) There will reportedly be yet another relief package , which does offer hope , though there 's ample evidence that Republicans in the Senate do n't feel that the arts are a critical need .
Look at a recent tweet by Nikki Haley , for instance .
She lists the meager quantities going to arts groups and asks " How many more people could have been helped with this money ? " That betrays a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts industry hires human beings in the same way a healthy airline does .
But if the rumblings are true , there might be yet more aid on the way -- some language has apparently already been drafted , and we should look for something at the end of this week .
Still , even the current bill , as it stands , has provisions that Baskin greets with something like optimism .
For instance , when it comes to unemployment insurance , those thousands of emails and petitions actually succeeded .
Salter points out that , in New York specifically , the eligibility requirements for unemployment benefits have often been ill-suited to the way a theater artist works : in spurts , in and out of the state , and for multiple employers .
The relief bill has made it so that freelancers , gig-economy workers , and contract workers will be covered , and the federal government will add $600 per week to each state 's payout .
That battle to enfranchise gig workers in the social net has been a long one , and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a one-bedroom in Brooklyn is $2,950 , though , so there 's still more work to be done .
Salter suggests turning your activist energies to state and local politicians .
" Those are state sessions of the assembly where many of those unemployment insurance decisions are made , " Salter says .
" Local things happen faster .
The federal concessions take a minute to pass , but if the state decides to expand it , by next week people can apply .
and the following week they can have a check .
"  The allowances in the current bill for loans through the Small Business Administration also look promising .
Both nonprofits and for-profits that have fewer than 500 employees can get loans , and if those monies are used for payroll , then up to $100,000 will be forgiven outright .
For the small places trying to keep from furloughing employees , that 's wonderful news , though it 's a puzzle how it will apply to the big ones .
If a 500-employee office spent it on payroll , for instance , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also not money that can be used to get that little business back on its feet .
How , the government consultant asks , will we pull people back into civic life after stay-at-home orders expire ? In New York , at least , the consultant muses , the giant corporations with their comparatively light tax burdens may need to step into the gap .
Baskin notes that the allotments to the NEA , NEH , Smithsonian , and so on are getting attention , but " we do n't need to look only to them for relief -- there are multiple avenues in a $2 trillion package , it 's not solely in terms of grants from the NEA .
" Another win that arts advocates had been pushing for since 2017 , for instance , is the ability to write off charitable deductions even if you do n't itemize your taxes , which , for the small donor , will be a big deal .
" I do n't want to paint too rosy a picture , " Baskin says .
" The package does n't solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ; theaters have had to cancel seasons , cancel galas , furlough their workers .
I do n't want to minimize what 's going on .
All I am trying to suggest is that it 's not just the $75 million .
There are other opportunities beyond that .
" For more information , and a provision-by-provision breakdown of the bill , it 'll be posted on TCG 's Advocacy News tab in the next few days .
Activism can be a mighty shield against helplessness and fear .
In a recent memo to an embattled staff , a doctor in the thick of fighting the coronavirus referred to the " rapture of action , " and I know many quarantined people who are desperate to taste it .
Certainly the advocates that I 've spoken to have more vigor in their voices than most .
Eyring and Baskin refer repeatedly and warmly to the collective nature of their efforts on behalf of the field , and Salter , who has watched job after premiere after opportunity fall into the COVID-19 void , has been taking strength from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network and the ecology of the theater because of this work , " Salter says .
" And seeing how it intersects with government structures has given me perspective , given me hope .
I think it 's because I know just how many people are working to provide the net to catch us .
"  In a moment when everything breaks down , there 's also a possibility to build something new .
Eyring points out that " there is an opportunity now for leaders at the institutional level to rethink how they 're doing things -- what their seasons look like , how the art 's delivered , what their partnerships are , both with other organizations and the community .
" The not-for-profit model is riddled with its own hierarchies and assumptions , and it could use an overhaul .
Corinna Schulenburg , TCG 's director of communications , chimes in from a personal perspective .
" As an artist who had a show canceled , as a mother who 's now working as a half-time kindergarten teacher , as a trans woman whose medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot about this moment , " she says .
" I feel this too is a moment of transition , and just as the other one was marked by grief and loss but ultimately led to liberation and joy , we can move into this national transition with some intentionality .
We can find joy .
"  " One of the things we 're talking about internally , " says Schulenburg , " has been the way in which the scale of this catastrophe -- a wholesale shutting down of the field -- is only really comparable is the Great Depression .
We 're looking at 20 percent or higher unemployment ! So what lessons can we find in the Federal Theater Project ? " Under the New Deal , the government 's super-spending effort that put America back to work in the ' 30s , the Federal Theater Project only accounted for 0 .
percent of the Works Progress Administration spending , which , if you applied that to the current bailout , would come to $10 billion .
Schulenburg has dreams for that money .
And oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heady thought .
We 're still surrounded by the structures the WPA gave us , including dams , bridges , airports , roads -- and , yes , our regional theater system .
Maybe a new one could bring it back .
