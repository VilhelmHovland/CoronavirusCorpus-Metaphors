Can China Return to Normalcy While Keeping the Coronavirus in Check ?  Life is almost back to normal in much of China .
Shops , restaurants , bars , and offices are open for business .
Manufacturing activity is picking up .
Traffic once again jams the highways of major cities .
Three-quarters of China 's workforce was back on the job as of 24 March , according to one company 's estimate .
Wuhan , where the COVID-19 pandemic originated , is lagging , as is the rest of Hubei province -- but even there , the lockdown is set to lift 8 April .
China has done what few believed was possible : Bring a blazing epidemic of a respiratory virus to a virtual standstill .
On 18 March , the country reported zero locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 for the first time .
Since then , only six of such infections have been reported , only one of them in Wuhan .
Now , the key question is : Can China keep it that way ?  Public health officials worldwide are watching closely .
" China is addressing an issue every country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to normalize and restore societal activities , while at the same time minimizing disease-related dangers from the outbreak , " says epidemiologist Keiji Fukuda of the University of Hong Kong ( HKU ) .
New infections now mostly come from outside : More than 500 cases have been confirmed in incoming air passengers since 18 March .
At midnight on Friday , China banned virtually all foreigners from entering the country and required all returning Chinese to be quarantined for 2 weeks , whether coming by air or over land .
But there is still danger within the country , as well .
The smattering of locally transmitted cases shows severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) is n't entirely gone .
And the very low case numbers may be deceptive .
In its tally , China 's National Health Commission does not include people who test positive for the virus but have no symptoms , and local authorities are reportedly suppressing information on new infections to meet the target of zero local cases .
Still , " I believe that there are few local cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the population still susceptible to infection , fresh outbreaks remain a constant danger .
" How to balance getting back to work and a normal state versus maintaining the current status of few new cases is certainly critical , " says Ding Sheng , director of the Global Health Drug Discovery Institute at Tsinghua University .
Officials are relaxing restrictions very slowly and methodically , Ding says .
Many restaurants at first reopened with shortened hours and for a limited number of customers ; now , doors are open to all .
Primary and secondary schools in several provinces have reopened , but only in communities free of the disease , and schools must check students ' temperatures and watch for symptoms .
Universities , where students from around the country mix , remain closed , with classes taught online .
Events that draw crowds are still banned or discouraged .
Live music venues and gyms in many cities remain closed .
There are temperature checks at subway entrances and factory gates .
A number of local governments had allowed cinemas to reopen , but last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed all theaters for the time being .
And habits developed during the epidemic persist .
Face masks are ubiquitous .
People keep their distance in public and at work .
Millions continue to work from home .
To guard against flare-ups , investigators trace and quarantine close contacts of every newly confirmed COVID-19 case , including those who may be asymptomatic , Wu Zunyou , an epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( China CDC ) , told the communist party newspaper China Daily earlier this week .
In another precaution , everyone visiting fever clinics in Beijing and other major cities is now tested for the virus .
And many provinces check the health status of migrant workers and others crossing their borders .
" Any new transmission will be identified quickly and controlled swiftly , " Ding says .
Friday 's travel ban -- which the government implemented even though it strenuously objected when the United States banned visitors from China in January -- addresses the other main risk : reintroduction of the virus from the rest of the world .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens who arrive undergo strict screening en route and upon arrival and go into quarantine for 2 weeks .
A European academic who returned to China 1 week before the ban took effect described the process to Science .
His temperature was taken twice during the flight and he filled out a form detailing his recent whereabouts , the health status of family members and colleagues , and his use of medications .
Another temperature check followed at the Beijing airport , after which the scholar -- who asked not to be identified -- was escorted to his own apartment for a 14-day quarantine .
A community official pasted a quarantine notice across the door jamb , which was removed and replaced for grocery deliveries .
Authorities ordered him to a " quarantine hotel " 3 days later , after a fellow passenger on the plane turned positive for COVID-19 .
The academic remains " very understanding , " and says he was treated well .
( He says he also got a lot of work done on COVID-19 -- related economic studies .
)  " China is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eventually face : how to normalize and restore societal activities , while at the same time minimizing disease-related dangers from the outbreak .
"  - Keiji Fukuda , University of Hong Kong  China 's strategy " seems to have been effective thus far in preventing a resurgence , " says Benjamin Anderson , an epidemiologist at Duke Kunshan University .
But with the virus now circulating around the world , " repeated importations to China will inevitably lead to local transmission , " Cowling says .
" Authorities will need to get on top of the cases very quickly , " he says , in a game of whack-a-mole .
Remaining pockets of local infection could be a problem as well , says Ira Longini , a disease modeler at the University of Florida .
" The models say the disease will come back once the restrictions are lifted .
I hope that 's not correct , but I ca n't imagine why it would n't be , " Longini says .
Much is at stake .
Economists predict China 's gross domestic product may shrink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst contraction since 1976 .
With Europe and the United States wrestling with their own epidemics , demand for China 's manufactured goods has collapsed -- aside from masks and medical equipment and supplies .
Recurring COVID-19 outbreaks in China would compound the damage .
The Chinese strategy is aimed at buying time until a vaccine or drugs are available , says George Gao , director of the China CDC .
A group led by Chen Wei of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences has already started a phase I study of a candidate vaccine , according to China Daily .
Trials are expected to last at least through the end of this year .
Dozens of other vaccine studies are underway around the world .
Ding , who lived in Beijing through the worst of the crisis , believes China can keep its guard up until these efforts bear fruit .
Although minor flare-ups could happen any time , he says , a large-scale reemergence of COVID-19 " is very unlikely given what we have learned .
