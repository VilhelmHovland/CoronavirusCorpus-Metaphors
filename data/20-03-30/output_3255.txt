COVID-19 : The Legality and Limits of the President 's Emergency Powers , By Victoria Ibezim-Ohaeri  As clearly seen from the letters of the law , President Buhari 's order for a total cessation of movement , except for essential supplies , in Lagos , Ogun and the FCT do not seem to align with the constitutional requirements laid down in Section 45 and 305 .
President Buhari did not declare any state of emergency , but went ahead to order the immediate implementation of measures that curtail rights and freedoms .
Yesterday , Sunday , March 29 , President Muhammadu Buhari addressed Nigerians on the COVID-19 pandemic , detailing some of the stringent measures and restrictions the Nigerian government would implement to contain the further spread of the coronavirus .
Among other things , he ordered the cessation of all movements in Lagos and Ogun States , alongside the Federal Capital Territory ( FCT ) , Abuja , for an initial period of 14 days with effect from 11 p .
on Monday , March 30 .
The affected locations recorded the majority of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria .
The above presidential fiat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the legality of the president 's orders .
While some lawyers have argued that in the absence of a law enabling restrictions to civic freedoms , the legality of the COVID-19 containment measures is questionable .
For instance , the learned Olisa Agbakoba ( SAN ) argued that it is illegal to seek to impose sanctions or restrict citizens ' movement , without a legal framework anchoring this .
Agbakoba recommended that the National Assembly should , as a matter of urgency , pass a Coronavirus Act 2020 .
Legal minds sympathetic to this view urged the president to issue regulations pursuant to the Quarantine Act of 1926 for the safety and protection of Nigerians .
On the other hand , however , legal scholars like Olu Adegboruwa ( SAN ) contend that rather than resorting to presidential fiats , the president should invoke his powers under the Constitution to declare a state of emergency , which must be approved by the National Assembly .
Two issues arise from this debate : First , whether a new law is required to legitimise the litany of COVID-19 containment measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently covers the field , granting necessary executive powers to the president to act and respond to a health emergency like COVID-19 .
Section 45 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution provides a prism for determining these two questions .
Section 45 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution provides that :  ( 1 ) Nothing in sections 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 and 41 of this Constitution shall invalidate any law that is reasonably justifiable in a democratic society  ( a ) in the interest of defence , public safety , public order , public morality or public health ; or  ( b ) for the purpose of protecting the rights and freedom or other persons  ( 2 ) An act of the National Assembly shall not be invalidated by reason only that it provides for the taking , during periods of emergency , of measures that derogate from the provisions of section 33 or 35 of this Constitution ; but no such measures shall be taken in pursuance of any such act during any period of emergency save to the extent that those measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation that exists during that period of emergency :  Provided that nothing in this section shall authorise any derogation from the provisions of section 33 of this Constitution , except in respect of death resulting from acts of war or authorise any derogation from the provisions of section 36(8) of this Constitution .
( 3 ) In this section , a " period of emergency " means any period during which there is in force a Proclamation of a state of emergency declared by the President in exercise of the powers conferred on him under section 305 of this Constitution .
does the president require any new law to act in light of the provisions of Section 45 and Section 305 of the Constitution ? The power granted to the Nigerian president under these sections are broad and expansive .
By virtue of these provisions , the president is already empowered to take extraordinary measures to avert any danger that threatens public safety .
The material sections of Section 45 have been underlined for emphasis .
To understand the full import of Section 45 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1999 Constitution .
Section 305 ( d ) and ( e ) in particular empower the president to declare a state of emergency when there is a clear and present danger of an actual breakdown of public order and public safety in the Federation or any part thereof requiring extraordinary measures to avert such danger ; and when there is an occurrence or imminent danger , or the occurrence of any disaster or natural calamity , affecting the community or a section of the community in the Federation ;  Does the COVID-19 pandemic come within the definition of Section 305 ( d ) ' s clear and present danger of an actual breakdown of public order and public safety in the federation or any part thereof , requiring extraordinary measures to avert such danger ? The answer is in the affirmative .
Why ? During a during a March 11 press briefing , the World Health Organisation declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic .
The virus has spread so rapidly across the world , bringing countries with well-performing healthcare systems to their knees .
As of March 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 5,690 , with 832 patients dying within 24 hours .
Likewise , over 104,000 cases have been confirmed in the United States , with deaths surpassing 1,700 .
Nigeria 's considerably low-infection rates witnessed in the early days of the pandemic dramatically turned around with over 97 confirmed cases and one fatality recorded as of March 29 .
In light of the above , the COVID-19 certainly pandemic fits within the definition of a public emergency which threatens the life of the nation , entitling the Nigerian state to invoke derogation measures .
So , does the president require any new law to act in light of the provisions of Section 45 and Section 305 of the Constitution ? The power granted to the Nigerian president under these sections are broad and expansive .
By virtue of these provisions , the president is already empowered to take extraordinary measures to avert any danger that threatens public safety in the federation or any part thereof .
The phrase , ' extraordinary measures ' , extends and legitimises state powers to initiate a variety of actions that are not imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Arguably , the combination of Sections 45 and 305 further serve to restrain any urge ( by the executive or legislature ) to push for repressive legislation that stifle democratic freedoms and shrink the civic space in times of emergency .
Declaring a state of emergency is the only **25;3495;TOOLONG requirement needed to confer legitimacy on the derogation of civic rights .
In other words , the derogation from civic rights and freedoms is only allowable during a period of emergency .
( See Section 45 ( 2 ) of the 1999 Constitution ) .
And therefore , declaring a state of emergency in the federation or any part thereof , and transmitting copies of the gazette containing the proclamation , including the details of the emergency to the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House of Representatives , confers the necessary legitimacy on any containment measures taken during the period .
To this extent , no new law will be required for the president to act .
And by extension , existing law sufficiently covers the field , and grants necessary executive powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this nature .
As clearly seen from the letters of the law , President Buhari 's order for a total cessation of movement , except for essential supplies , in Lagos , Ogun and the FCT do not seem to align with the constitutional requirements laid down in Section 45 and 305 .
President Buhari did not declare any state of emergency , but went ahead to order the immediate implementation of measures that curtail rights and freedoms , putting a big question mark on the legality of governmental actions .
the COVID-19 pandemic is the first of its kind , and particularly the first to test Nigeria 's legal framework in very provocative dimensions .
There is also a lot of confusion regarding the appropriate procedure to take and what constitutes reasonable limits on emergency powers .
That probably explains why President Buhari has been slow in making any public pronouncement regarding the pandemic .
Nothing demonstrates the tensions between fundamental human rights and containment measures during health emergencies more than the blanket directive for the cessation of movement .
Declaring a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two major way ways .
First , the emergency period is only in force for a specific period of time .
It is not indefinite .
The derogation is not permanent .
The maximum period allowed by the constitution is six ( 6 ) months .
( 6 ( C ) ) .
By limiting the period of emergency , it precludes overreach from the executive arm of government .
It also means that the president lacks the power to derogate from civil liberties in perpetuity , thereby , limiting any disposition or potential descent into autocratic rule .
The second way the declaration of a period of emergency protects citizens ' rights is by insisting that measures taken during this period are reasonably justifiable for the purpose of dealing with the situation that exists during that period of emergency .
( Section 45 ( 2 ) ) .
This requirement is sacrosanct .
It proceeds upon the premise that derogations can not just be ordered for the sake of it , but rather , must be reasonably justifiable .
In its General Comment 2936 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritative interpretation of the components of Article 4 ( a counterpart provision of Section 45 of Nigerian Constitution ) , the United Nations Committee on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) laid down a number of requirements and procedures stipulating how valid derogations may or may not be undertaken .
According to the Committee , any State invoking Article 4 of the ICCPR to justify derogation from **26;3522;TOOLONG guarantees must comply with rigorous due process provisions relating to proportionality , notification of derogation measures , exclusion of the non-derogable provisions , non-discrimination , temporariness of exceptional measures and consistency of those measures with the state 's existing obligations under international human rights law .
Nigeria ratified the ICCPR in 1993 , and as such is bound by the Committee 's recommendations .
Recognising the propensity of state agents to overreach statutory authority is a continuing concern across the globe , what the above interpretation means is that COVID-19 measures initiated by the Nigerian government must be time-specific , proportionate to the threats posed by the pandemic , reasonable , non-discriminatory , and respect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , Nigeria is not excused from its international human rights obligations during periods of heath emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic .
In conclusion , the COVID-19 pandemic is the first of its kind , and particularly the first to test Nigeria 's legal framework in very provocative dimensions .
There is also a lot of confusion regarding the appropriate procedure to take and what constitutes reasonable limits on emergency powers .
That probably explains why President Buhari has been slow in making any public pronouncement regarding the pandemic .
Now that he has done so , it needs to be emphasised that any decision taken at this time must align with the dictates of the law .
Accordingly , the president needs to take steps to exercise his powers under Section 45 and 305 of the Constitution as required by law .
Standing on that high moral and legal ground , the president can then deploy his presidential powers to rein in the excesses of various state governors in the name of containing the coronavirus pandemic in their states .
SPACES FOR CHANGE has observed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governors , reinforces fears of deliberate governmental clampdowns on civic freedoms using COVID-19 as an excuse .
Closure of state waterways , air and land borders fall within the realm of federal jurisdiction .
Various state governors are invoking the doctrine of necessity , exercising powers ungranted by the constitution in the name of containing the spread of coronavirus .
Something needs to be done to stem the tide of surging executive recklessness at the state levels .
Urgently too .
