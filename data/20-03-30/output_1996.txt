Valuations  The FTSE 100 currently trades at a similar level as it did in the late 1990s .
Furthermore , many of its members have valuations significantly below their long-term averages .

Risks  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller companies , in an economic crisis is that they are generally less risky .

True , the FTSE 100 is sometimes viewed as an index lacking growth appeal .
But its present risk/reward ratio may prove to be very attractive for investors who wish to capitalise on the current bear market .
