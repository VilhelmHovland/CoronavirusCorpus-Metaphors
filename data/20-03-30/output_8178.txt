The White House Is Asking Millennials -- Yes , You -- to Stay Home to Stop Coronavirus  The administration unveiled new nationwide guidelines Monday that call for all Americans to avoid crowds of 10 people or more for at least two weeks .
WASHINGTON -- The White House issued an urgent message to millennials : If you want to help fight COVID-19 , you must chill with your partying .
The administration unveiled new nationwide guidelines Monday that call for all Americans to avoid crowds of 10 people or more in any situation for at least two weeks , in the latest attempt to stem the spread of the new coronavirus that is grinding normal American life to a halt .
The new rules call for Americans to take a 15-day hiatus from eating and drinking in restaurants and bars , to avoid non-essential travel , and to engage in schooling from home when possible .
The new guidelines are especially targeted at young people , a group thought to be much less susceptible to the negative symptoms of the illness but still fully capable of spreading it around even if they feel perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will stop this virus , " Dr .
Deborah Birx , a member of President Trump 's coronavirus response team , told the White House press briefing room on Monday afternoon .
" Why do I think millennials are key ? because they 're the ones out and about .
"  The new rules promise to distort regular Americans ' daily routines to a degree that would have seemed unimaginable just a few weeks ago .
And things might stay weird for months , President Trump said Monday .
Asked how long the fight against the novel coronavirus might continue , Trump replied that the experts are telling him it could last until July or August .
Trump 's team did n't mention Gen Z specifically , but easily could have .
That generation , younger than Millennials , is defined by the Pew Research Center as those born between 1997 and 2012 -- making them between 7 and 22 years old today .
The recommendation to avoid big parties and bars arrived on the eve of St .
Patrick 's Day , a holiday typically celebrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for scenes of drunken craziness , and smack in the middle of many universities ' spring break .
Only hours before the new guidelines were announced , the mayor of New Smyrna Beach , Florida declared that the local St .
Patrick 's Day festival would proceed with a 250-person cap .
Dozens of other events through the end of March were already cancelled by the city commission , but Mayor Russ Owen had drawn the line at the Flagler Tavern St .
Patrick 's Day beer garden .
" That event is a private event , " Mayor Owen told the Daytona Beach News-Journal .
" Canceling the event would do nothing , because basically , people are going to show up at Flagler Tavern for Saint Patrick 's Day .
This gave us some control and parameters around it .
"  But any such wild celebrating , the Trump administration insisted Monday , had damn well better stop for a while -- or , at the very least , take place in groups of nine people or less .
" The reason we are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before there are symptoms , " Birx said .
A large group of people is thought to continue to spread the virus despite not showing any signs of being sick .
" We really want people to be separated at this time , " she said .
There will be far fewer venues for any such festivities this year , even without the administration 's new national recommendations .
States and cities across the country are shuttering restaurants and bars , including California , Ohio , Illinois , Massachusetts , Maryland and Washington .
The Attorney General of Michigan warned bars that operate at more than 50% of their capacity could face negative consequences .
Schools , universities , gyms , concerts and other public spaces have likewise been closed in many places .
A dynamic in which young people continue to socialize while unafraid of the disease could help spread the virus , prolonging the outbreak and threatening older , more vulnerable people , members of Trump 's coronavirus task force said on Monday .
" We have an invisible enemy , " Trump said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Cover : Patrons sit outside a bar along the Venice Beach Boardwalk Sunday , March 15 , 2020 , in Los Angeles .

Gavin Newsom on Sunday called for all bars , wineries , nightclubs and brewpubs to close in the nation 's most populous state and urged seniors and people with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves at home in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus .
