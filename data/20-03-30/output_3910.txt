Russia 's National Welfare Fund steps up again to $157 .
, or 11% of GDP , in March  The amount of money in the NWF reserve fund has risen twice this year from $127bn to $150bn and now again to $157 .
thanks to a series of transfers by the Russian Ministry of Finance  By bne IntelliNewsMarch 27 , 2020  The Russian Ministry of Finance announced on March 19 that it has transferred last year 's budget surplus to the National Welfare Fund ( NWF ) , which now amounts to about RUB12,200bn ( $157 .
) , or 11% of GDP , reported Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition ( BOFIT ) in its weekly update .
The reserve fund can be used to cover a budget deficit in times of crisis , and held some RUB8tn ( $123bn ) at the start of March , or 7% of GDP .
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said earlier this month that the current crisis would blow a RUB3tn hole in the budget that will be covered by withdrawals from the NWF .
If nothing changes and Russia continues to run RUB3tn budget deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fund to last four years -- and that is without cutting spending from the planned budget due to run to 2022 or raising taxes .
Siluanov said earlier that the amount of money in reserves was enough to endure a decade of low oil prices .
The reason for the sudden jumps in the NWF recently is due to an accounting quirk .
The fund is administered by the CBR which reports on its size ; however , the Ministry of Finance is the one that collects the taxes and oil duties that feed the fund , which it holds in special accounts before formally transferring this cash to the fund periodically .
Normally that money comes from surplus revenues earned from oil exports when the prices are over $42 per barrel , but this latest uptick was due to Ministry of Finance transferring the budget surplus left over from 2019 to the NWF war chest .
( This so-called budget rule has been suspended until April , allowing the Ministry of Finance to spend surplus oil revenues rather than send them to the NWF .
) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) crisis as a planned sale of the CBR 's stake in retail banking giant Sberbank to the Ministry of Finance will mean the transfer of another dollop of money to the NWF .
In February , the CBR and the Ministry of Finance agreed that the central bank would sell its stake ( 50% and one share ) in Russia 's largest bank to the Ministry of Finance , which increases the central bank 's distribution of profits to the state .
In the meantime , the CBR has continued to build up the gross international reserves ( GIR ) .
As of Friday , March 13 , Russia 's foreign exchange reserves ( including gold ) reached $581bn , their highest level since August 2008 .
However , in the last week the CBR has begun to sell currency from its reserve to prevent rapid fluctuations in the foreign exchange market .
But what selling is happening has been relatively small , of the order of $75mn a day , as the CBR remains prudent and would rather let the ruble 's value fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency 's value .
The CBR manages the liquid assets of the National Welfare Fund as part of its foreign exchange reserves .
If the Treasury needs money from the fund , it will withdraw it from the central bank in rubles , so the size of the foreign exchange reserves will not change , according to BOFIT .
