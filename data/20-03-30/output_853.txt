4 Maryland vs .
6 Michigan  In his first season as Michigan 's ( 19-12 , 10-10 Big Ten ) head coach , Juwan Howard has picked up where John Beilein left off in routinely getting the Wolverines to the Final Four .
This run puts him on a prestigious list of people who have both played and coached in a Final Four along with Billy Donovan Joe B .
Hall , Bobby Knight and Dean Smith .
Michigan lost its only matchup with the Terrapins ( 24-7 , 14-6 Big Ten ) in the final game of the season 83-70 in a contest that Maryland controlled from beginning to end .

Michigan did n't end its regular season on a high note dropping three of its last four .
3 Seton Hall vs .
10 Rutgers  Rutgers ( 20-11 , 11-9 Big Ten ) serving as the cinderella of this year 's March Madness seems like the sports gods finding a way to bring balance to an athletic program whose football team has n't won a conference game since 2017 and a basketball team that has n't had a .
record in over a decade .
Or it may be that the bracket is brought to you by nj .
, which covers the school and suggests most of the people voting are probably Rutgers fans .
Either way , the hypothetical tournament has done its part to showcase how deep the Big Ten is that finishing eighth in the conference still makes you a national title contender .
The Scarlet Knights ' run has been impressive , especially with who they had to beat to get to this stage , but that might come to an end against fellow New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The Pirates are led by first-team All-American Myles Powell , who averaged 21 points per game this season .
