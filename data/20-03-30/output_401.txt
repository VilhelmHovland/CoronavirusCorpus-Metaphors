Medical staffing firms are racing to help meet the demand for doctors and nurses in states with the worst coronavirus outbreaks .
What they need most in order to build up medical staff quickly is for states to ease licensing regulations , they said .
Thirty states have temporarily eased requirements , allowing doctors and nurses already credentialed in other states to practice across state lines without having to apply for licenses .

But what they need most to build up medical staff quickly , they say , is for states to ease licensing regulations .
" That 's really where we need the help from everyone , is to make sure we have a quick licensing process and that we can get people on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chief clinical officer at staffing firm AMN Healthcare .
AMN Healthcare is seeing the biggest demand right now from major hotspots for coronavirus infections , including New York , Los Angeles , San Jose , California , and Spokane , Washington .
" We are seeing an increase in demand , in particular , for nurses in intensive care unit and emergency room care -- but every specialty is really increasing the need right now , " Edmonson said .
The firm is also seeing a higher demand in Houston and Atlanta , though those areas are not considered major hotspots right now .
Nomad Health , a staffing firm with more than 100,000 registered clinicians , is seeing demand for COVID-19 staffing across more than 30 states , with facilities in places such as Spokane , Washington , offering up to $120 an hour for medical ICU nurses , a number that 's well above normal pay .
Nazem says while states are moving to ease credentialing , under the current emergency it would be more helpful to have a uniform national policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday , 30 states had temporarily eased requirements , allowing doctors and nurses already credentialed in other states to practice across state lines without having to apply for in-state licensing .
More than two dozen states have also taken steps to make it easier for retired medical professionals whose licenses have lapsed to be recertified during the pandemic , according to data compiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards .
New York has done both as the number of cases in the state has surged .
Andrew Cuomo praised the outpouring of response from retired doctors and nurses in New York .
The state saw 10,000 volunteers sign up in a single day , after asking for help and announcing that the state is easing rules for reinstatement .
" These are people who are retired , who did their duty , who could just sit at home , but they are coming forward , " said Cuomo .
In all , New York has more than 62,500 clinicians who have volunteered to help with the pandemic response .
Beyond state licensing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states may need to help hospitals meet the anticipated nursing shortage by easing credentialing rules around the nursing requirements in hospitals during the crisis .
" People are going to have to be creative about what types of nurses are caring for which types of patients at any given time , " said Christopher Kerns , Advisory Board vice president and director of health care strategy .
Kerns said hospitals may need to let licensed practical nurses , or LPNs , take on duties that are typically done by registered nurses , or RNs , who have more training .
LPNs typically have two-year degrees and assist with primary-care needs in doctor 's offices , while RNs have four-year degrees .
" A second way to manage this is to relax nurse-to-patient ratio .
so that nurses could care for more patients .
In some areas that might be the only alternative , " Kerns said .
But putting more pressure on an already stretched staff could lead to more staffing issues .
Potential absenteeism headwinds  For hospitals already facing unprecedented demand , maintaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 4% of clinicians in hospitals became infected with the virus over the last two months .
" In some areas we might expect .
almost 19% absenteeism , depending on the confluence of how much demand is on the system and how little childcare is available to those workers , " said one of the study 's authors , Dr .
Sanjay Basu , Collective Health head of research and population health .
Bosu said he and his wife , who is an emergency physician , are trading off shifts right now to care for their young children .
He is based in San Francisco .
For temporary medical workers , those benefits may be harder to access than for full-time hospital staff .
But some staffing firms are also changing some of their policies to offer support during the coronavirus outbreak .
Nomad Health is offering the clinicians it places in jobs up to two weeks pay and coverage of their health insurance , in the event they become infected with COVID-19 on the job .
" We 're doing it because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding " that is going to burn through our cash , if that ends up being a substantial portion of our staff on the front line .
