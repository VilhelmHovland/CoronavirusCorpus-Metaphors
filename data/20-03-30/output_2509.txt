Healthcare groups such as the Milan based Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato have shown that private healthcare groups can be fully integrated into the public health system  MILAN , ITALY -- Media OutReach -- March 30 , 2020 -- Covid-19 concerns humanity as a whole .
No nation has been spared , and humanity as a whole must unite and face the situation as one if we are defeat this invisible enemy .
We must open our metaphorical borders even though our physical ones are being closed daily .

Covid-19 has shown the world the importance of strong healthcare systems and emergency response systems .
It has also shown that collaboration between governments , international institutions , civil society , and the private sector are all possible with the right will .

For too long now wealthy , developed nations have paid lip service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For too long we have ignored the plight of our brothers and sisters in places like Africa , where epidemics have struck weakened populations with merciless efficiency .
In the past , the devastation of epidemics was confined to the poorer nations of our world , while the wealthier ones were protected by easy access to advanced , often universal , healthcare systems , vaccination programmes , and technology .
COVID-19 is an invisible and unwelcome guest that respects no boundary and has swiftly and relentlessly smashed through all barriers , manmade or otherwise .
Cooperation and collaboration among nations is of critical importance now .
We must forget our individual nationalities and come together as humans of equal value .
What is important today is to create an alliance where we are all kin to each other , a true league of nations that knows no borders and that is open to all and refuses none .
As we now know , perhaps a little too late , healthcare systems are the first line of defence against invisible enemies such as COVID-19 .
Our healthcare workers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible battle and are having to deal with a mass casualty situation that in recent years has only ever been witnessed in war .
We must protect our healthcare professionals ; we can not allow them to take the immense risks that they are taking today in the future .
These modern day heroes have on occasion had to make the ultimate sacrifice , often due to a lack of resources and medical materials that leaves them open to contagion .
The world was caught off guard this time , but we will not have this excuse once the pandemic is over .
We can no longer pretend that cuts in healthcare investments are justified , and we must never , ever leave our medical professionals so cruelly exposed again .
We need to revisit our healthcare models together and apply the most efficient systems .
The private medical sector holds the key .
Take the example of Lombardy , where the private sector has been contributing immensely towards helping the government cope with this crisis .
Healthcare groups such as the Milan-based Gruppo Ospedaliero San Donato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the public health system .
The private healthcare system can play a central role during a crisis by treating a high percentage of patients .
Take GSD , for example : although it makes up 13% of the system it has taken on 18% of COVID-19 patients in Lombardy during this emergency .
Such figures demonstrate just how efficient the private sector can be in terms of responsiveness when properly integrated into the public system .
I am hopeful that we can learn from our mistakes .
In a post COVID-19 world , we will have no choice , as the alternative does not bear consideration .
Yet when I think of the human capacity for love and altruism , I am filled with hope for the future .
When I think of those I have seen in the developing world struggling for life against all odds , and see it happening today in the developed world , I remember that it is not the weakness or cruelty or venality of people that comes out in times of crisis , but the generosity , humanity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
