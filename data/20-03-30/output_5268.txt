Classes include hip-hop , ballet and jazz for beginners , and a Friday Feel Good party .
And the best bit according to Broadsheet Sydney 's arts writer ? For a whole 60 minutes she did n't once think about the c-word .

Jacopo Grabar , the talented Italian Sydney Dance Company ( SDC ) dancer I 've been watching on stage for 18 months , was in my living room .
I repeat , in my living room .
Not in the flesh , sadly , but right there on my computer screen .
He was teaching me the basics of classical ballet as part of SDC 's virtual dance studio .
With the Covid-19 social distancing restrictions leaving us all housebound , SDC has adapted its existing public dance class program for digital delivery using web-conferencing software Zoom .
It means you can learn just about any dance style you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own home .
SDC now offers around 45 digital classes a week in real time , from hip-hop to jazz to contemporary and stretch , with more to come .
It 's particularly great if you 've wanted to do a class but have felt embarrassed or shy .
All you need is a mobile device ( you can even turn off the camera ) , an area of clear floor space and a good attitude .
And at $28 for unlimited weekly classes , it 's quite affordable .
SDC 's open classes , which have been operating for many years , attract more than 80,000 participants a year and is a vital source of income for the dance company .
For more than five years it 's discussed launching a virtual studio , but it 's always been put on the backburner .
" When you 're not a fully-funded dance company like they have in Europe , you have to be a lot more resourceful about how to make an income , and education and teaching have always been the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rafael Bonachela .
" Online learning is a great tool , we know that , but there 's always been something else to worry about because arts companies are always in crisis .
Coronavirus is just a bigger one .
Suddenly it was like , ' okay , all the work has been done .
Let 's do it ' .
"  The response to the digital classes has been overwhelming .
While many existing students have transitioned to the new format , there are plenty of newcomers too , and not just from Sydney but interstate and even abroad .
Bonachela says the reason for the popularity is multifaceted .
" You can do it in your living room , so many barriers to attending night classes have been broken , and you can turn off your video camera if you feel shy , " he says .
" But it 's also that sense of community .
We 're all talking about social distancing , but you do n't have to be socially distant , you have to be physically distant .
You can still stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballet beginner , but the weekly all-ages and all-abilities dance party Feel Good Friday run by acclaimed former dancer Charmene Yap proved a particular hit , with 98 people joining the zoom class on March 27 .
The high-energy class is supposed to be the class equivalent of a Friday shake-off-the-week club visit .
The dancers choose the music and each week a different theme is announced ( last week 's theme encouraged dancers to wear an outfit they 'd always wanted to , but never had the courage to wear ) .
Bonachela says the feedback has been phenomenal .
" It 's good for the spirit , it 's good for the body and when people are isolated physically , it 's good to be able to come together .
"  The open classes have always given punters the extraordinary opportunity to learn from SDC 's accomplished teachers and 18-strong troupe .
But Bonachela says the digital classes have also offered the professional dancers something , too .
" Company members are usually so busy -- there 's so much they 'd love to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But now they can say what they 'd like to do .
It 's wonderful to be able to stay engaged with our community in a way they never have before .
"  Which takes us back to Mr Grabar in my living room , encouraging me and my 38 classmates to keep trying for that elusive perfect pirouette .
His instructions are clear , the music is pitch perfect and the steps manageable , even for someone like me who has n't taken a classical ballet class since I was 10 .
It 's fun watching the others give it a go too , and it really does feel like a community .
It offers a good workout , and a great sense of achievement .
But the best bit ? For a whole 60 minutes I did n't once think about the c-word .
" This is why art and culture are so important in the world .
Because life as it is is not enough , particularly with situations like this .
It has n't even been a week , but the virtual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's kept us going , in many ways .
