( Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP )  In communities where most coronavirus tests are coming back positive , it 's a sign there are many more cases there that have n't been found , say World Health Organization officials in a press conference on Monday .
" If 80-90% of the people test positive , you are probably missing a lot of cases , " says Michael Ryan , executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program .
That 's because more positives means the tests are being used mainly to confirm obvious cases , and as a result health authorities are not getting a clear picture on the scope of the epidemic in their area .
In places where every close contact and suspected case has been tested , the percent of negative cases is high .
Ryan says in countries that have extensive testing , fewer than 12% of their tests are positive .
" We would certainly like to see countries testing at the level of ten negative tests to one positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing enough testing to pick up all cases , " Ryan says .
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says that testing is important for both the care of an individual , and for public health officials who are trying to slow the spread of the virus .
" Without knowing , without testing , it 's like moving blindfolded , " he says , pointing to how South Korean health officials identified religious gatherings and hospital settings as hotspots for disease spread -- and were able to take corrective actions as a result .
Coronavirus testing is inadequate in many places because the tests themselves are in short supply .
Communities have had to ration them based on need .
Maria Van Kerkhove , technical lead of the WHO Health Emergencies Program , says the WHO is working with countries to increase the number of coronavirus testing labs , and to train more people to run the tests .
They 're also working to help increase the production and availability of tests and testing materials .
