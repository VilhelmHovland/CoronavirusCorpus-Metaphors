SA 's Solidarity Fund for coronavirus raises R500m in first week , aims to buy 5 million masks  14:07 30/03/2020 Londiwe Buthelezi  The Solidarity Fund that President Cyril Ramaphosa announced last Monday has raised over R500 million from corporates , government and individuals who have donated their own money in its first week in operation .
Launched with R150 million seed capital donated by the state , the fund is run by the private sector and allows individuals , companies and members of the international community to make tax-deductible donations .
It is aimed at supporting vulnerable South Africans by focusing on containing the spread of the virus and providing care for ill individuals .
However , the fund will not be funding small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , said deputy chairperson of the Solidarity Fund , Adrian Enthoven , on Monday .
It is also not a mechanism to fund non-governmental organisations , added the fund 's chairperson , Gloria Serobe .
Updating the media on the first week of the fund , Enthoven and Serobe clarified that it would focus on health response , humanitarian efforts and on driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight the spread of the coronavirus .
" In relation to the SMMEs , I think there 's been some confusion .
Our direct focus is not to provide and support SMMEs .
There 's an initiative between Business for South Africa and the Command Council to try and come up with support measures and packages with government to support SMMEs .
But the fund is not in a position to provide soft loans or support SMMEs , " said Enthoven .
As far as its focus areas are concerned , the Fund has made R100 million available as working capital to urgently fund purchase of critical medical supplies to protect health workers .
R52 million of this will go towards purchasing 5 million surgical masks .
Governance  The Solidarity Fund is not administering donations made by some of the country 's wealthiest families .
In the past week , the Rupert and Oppenheimer families , as well as the Motsepe Foundation , each donated R1 billion towards solidarity efforts but they will administer those themselves , said Enthoven .
As for the donations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will frequently report on all donations received and how they are spent .
The Fund will be administered by Old Mutual , while auditing firm EY and law firm Edward Nathan Sonnenbergs ( ENSafrica ) have developed a framework that will determine how and where donations received are spent .
" We will be in a position to announce the board members very soon , " said Serobe .
" We think that it is a board that this country will be excited to see because it is a combination of all the skills that we are talking about , auditing , financing , skills on working with the civil society and working with the social partners .
It will be a combined board that makes sense to all South Africans .
