Europe , US endure darkest days of corona crisis  Top Story  **29;2907;TOOLONG : The global coronavirus death toll surged past 33,600 with 2,800 new deaths over the weekend while 715,000 infected cases reported worldwide as Europe and the United States endured their darkest days of the crisis .
back-flip from US President Donald Trump on quarantining New York highlighted the panic and confusion across many parts of the world in trying to contain the pandemic , which has seen more than a third of humanity placed under unprecedented lockdowns .
The virus continued to leave a devastating imprint on nearly every aspect of society : wiping out millions of jobs , overwhelming healthcare services and draining national treasuries .
The ongoing situation can take six months to improve in several countries .
Europe alone accounted for more than 20,000 fatalities , where hardest-hit Italy and Spain each reported more than 800 dead in one day .
Pablo Rodriguez , a radiologist at a Madrid hospital , described the influx of patients as " a total tsunami " .
" It 's like going to the front line in a war , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst is yet to come .
But in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus first struck late last year , officials took tentative steps back towards normality , partially reopening it after more than two months of near-total isolation for its 11 million residents .
Trump decided late Saturday against imposing a broad lockdown on New York and its neighbours after a strong pushback from local political leaders and warnings of the panic it could spark .
" A quarantine will not be necessary , " Trump tweeted , about eight hours after he stunned the New York metropolitan region -- the epicentre of the US outbreak -- with a proposal to place it under quarantine .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , however , asked area residents not to travel except for essential purposes .
Trump 's reversal came on the same day the US death toll topped 2,100 , more than doubling in just three days .
Of the fatalities , more than a quarter were in New York City .
Health officials say they fear New York may follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hospitals desperately short of protective equipment and ventilators .
" It 's abysmal , " said Andrew , a psychiatry resident in a New York hospital who spoke on condition his name be changed .
He is now quarantined at home with a likely case of the virus himself .
European nations have been harder hit than the US on a per capita basis with over 20,000 deaths -- around half in worst-hit Italy .
Spain , with the world 's second-highest toll , added 832 deaths on Saturday for a total of 5,812 .
Madrid toughened a nationwide lockdown , halting all non-essential activities , though officials said the epidemic in the country seemed to be nearing a peak .
Russia said it would close its borders on Monday , despite reporting relatively low levels of the virus .
In France , which has seen close to 2,000 deaths , Prime Minister Edouard Philippe warned the " battle " was just beginning .
The British toll passed 1,000 on Saturday while Belgium saw a steep climb in deaths , with 353 recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Elsewhere , Iran announced 139 more deaths , and India sealed a dozen villages that had been visited by a guru now known to be infected and a possible " super-spreader " .
South African police used rubber bullets in Johannesburg to enforce social distancing on a crowd queuing for supplies outside a supermarket during a national lockdown .
In Italy , a cardiologist from Rome who has recovered from COVID-19 recalled his hellish experience .
Infection rates in Italy are on a downward trend .
The head of the national health institute Silvio Brusaferro predicted a peak " in the next few days " .
Europe has suffered the brunt of the coronavirus crisis in recent weeks , with millions across the continent on lockdown and the streets of Paris , Rome and Madrid eerily empty .
As even rich countries struggle , aid groups warn the toll could be in the millions in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen , where healthcare systems are in tatters .
Meanwhile , Thomas Schaefer , the finance minister of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " deeply worried " over how to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus , state premier Volker Bouffier said Sunday .
Schaefer , 54 , was found dead near a railway track on Saturday .
The Wiesbaden prosecution 's office said they believe he died by suicide .
" We are in shock , we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad , " Bouffier said in a recorded statement .
Hesse is home to Germany 's financial capital Frankfurt , where major lenders like Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank have their headquarters .
The European Central Bank is also located in Frankfurt .
A visibly shaken Bouffier recalled that Schaefer , who was Hesse 's finance chief for 10 years , had been working " day and night " to help companies and workers deal with the economic impact of the pandemic .
" Today we have to assume that he was deeply worried , " said Bouffier , a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel .

Spain has toughened an already tight nationwide lockdown by halting all non-essential activities .
In the ground zero-city of Wuhan , however , life is creeping back to normal .
Officials say the biggest threat to public health is now imported cases .
" Initially we were more scared and maybe thought it was safer overseas , " said Han Li , who is helping process the flood of locals returning to Wuhan after having been were stranded elsewhere during the more than two-month lockdown .

" If we are successful , we will have squashed the top of that ( infection ) curve , which is brilliant , " she told the government 's daily press conference .
" But we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living -- that would be quite dangerous .
If we stop then , all of our efforts would be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak .

Britain has been on lockdown for a week , with non-essential shops and services closed and people told to stay home except for daily exercise or to get groceries .
