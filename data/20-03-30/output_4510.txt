prize  A player who won the R7 .
Lotto jackpot on Wednesday will most likely have to wait until after the coronavirus lockdown to claim the money .
This as national lottery operator Ithuba on Thursday announced a shutdown of its offices amid the coronavirus outbreak .
" During the lockdown ? our head office and all regional offices will be closed .
This means that no winners will be able to claim their winnings at any of our offices .
Players should not be anxious about this because all winning tickets have a lifespan of 365 days .
It is therefore imperative that players keep their tickets safe until they can claim ? " Ithuba said .
Those with smaller winnings could claim from supermarkets remaining open during the lockdown .
" Winnings below R2 ? 000 can be claimed at participating retailers ? while bigger retailers such as Checkers can pay up to R10 ? 000 and approved prize-payout centres up to just under R50 ? 000 .
