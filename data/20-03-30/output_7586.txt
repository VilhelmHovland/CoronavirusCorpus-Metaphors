Cincinnati Streetcar Shuts Down Monday Night  Cincinnati 's mayor and the city 's health commissioner are ordering that the streetcar system be shutdown because of concerns about the coronavirus .
When service ends at its regular time tonight , the streetcar will not be running again until the city 's state of emergency has been lifted .
" We are closing the streetcar during this time to protect the public from increased exposure risks to COVID-19 , which can survive on metal and other hard surfaces that are routinely used by streetcar riders , " said Mayor John Cranley .
The mayor said the Federal Transit Administration ( FTA ) had been notified about the decision .
That 's required since FTA grant money was used for the streetcar project , and the system has to operate by a service schedule that was provided to the agency , or the FTA could ask for the grant money to be returned .
Cranley said the temporary action should not be seen as an attempt to permanently shutdown the streetcar .
He said this a response to a public health crisis .
