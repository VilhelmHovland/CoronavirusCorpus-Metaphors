That followed an order from Romanian government authorities on Friday that coronavirus victims must be buried on the day of their death or cremated .
Cremation of the dead is not allowed under religious Jewish law , and a burial can not take place on Shabbat .
The community turned to Rabbi Yaakov Rojah of the Zaka volunteer community emergency response organization for the allowance , called a heter , and he identified a possible precedent that would allow a non-Jew to bury the body on Shabbat , the Hebrew-language Haredi 10 news website reported .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbi of the Old City of Jerusalem and the president of the Rabbinical Council of Zaka .
He ruled Friday that the Bucharest Jewish community would be permitted to have a Christian bury a coronavirus victim who dies on Shabbat to prevent the body from being cremated .
" We 're receiving dozens of appeals from Jewish communities around the world to prevent cremation of bodies in the wake of government directives , " Zaka head Yehudah Meshi-Zahav told the news website .
" We will make every effort to preserve Kavod HaMeis the honor of the dead like we constantly battle to do .
We daven every day and hope that the pandemic ends and we can assist in happy events only .
"  On Thursday , the first Jewish victim of the coronavirus in Argentina was cremated by local authorities despite protests from the local Jewish community .
