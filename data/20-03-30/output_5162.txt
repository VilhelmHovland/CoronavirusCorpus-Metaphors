Desperate measures in desperate times  Foxing the system and its checks , empty vehicles of essential supplies are now being packed with migrants and their families , for a hefty price , all to ferry them back to their native towns  Tracing the overnight journey of vegetable trucks from Mumbai and its suburbs to Satara , Sangli and Kolhapur , Mirror explores the new system that has sprung into place in the age of the lockdown  While cases of COVID-19 continue to manifest in bigger cities and towns , the desperate wave of rural folk headed back to the perceived safety of their native villages swells every day , leaving in its wake a looming threat .
With their jobs unstable or completely gone in metros , despair has led thousands of migrant residents of Mumbai and neighbouring suburbs to do almost anything possible to get to their hometowns -- to at least not starve to death alone , they have fearfully cited .
This includes foxing a system that has imposed tremendous curbs on social fabric to prevent the disease from spreading .
And so , these migrants have started huddling in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity , and heading back to their villages , paying a hefty sum for transport that is far from safe or comfortable .
This became evident on Saturday night , when a Mirror team spotted migrants -- sometimes whole families -- hopping onto empty vegetable trucks returning to villages in Satara , Sangli and Kolhapur .
As soon as a willing truck driver to any area is available , dozens queue up .
They are ready to spend hours huddled together without a single break to escape infection ; PICS : NIKHIL GHORPADE  The truck operators as well as desperate citizens have come up with a mechanism that works smoothly .
It all begins with a citizen roping in a truck driver willing to ferry passengers to a particular destination .
Typically , he would have a truck that has come into the city with a supply of vegetables and will ply empty on its way back to the rural regions .
Once the driver agrees , a message is sent out to as many people from that particular taluka or region about the transport .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interestingly , it does n't take much to get at least 100-odd passengers for every truck that is willing to take the risk .
Some shy off the task as with district borders sealed according to orders from the Centre , those who are found flouting norms are being booked by cops .
With 24 members of a large family testing positive for coronavirus in Maharashtra 's Sangli district in the last few days , the administration has set up a containment zone in one-km radius of where they live .
The vehicle Mirror came across had left from Mumbai with a few passengers from the city and suburbs .
Its next stop was Dombivli and Kalyan in Thane district .
Here , the vehicle ( MH10Z9925 ) became packed to the brim .
Those inside revealed that the last stop was around 10 pm on Saturday night .
Throughout the journey , the truck did not stop anywhere , unmindful of the routine needs of those within .
It managed to pass through smoothly at two major checkposts on Mumbai-Pune Expressway -- Khalapur and Urse .
Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SRPF ) , riot control police and highway police stopped absolutely no vehicles with emergency supplies tags .
At Khed-Shivapur toll naka , the passengers disembarked en masse and went 3 km ahead on foot .
The empty truck breezed through and cops did not know what to do with the migrants on foot .
Eventually , they met again  Around 3 .
am , the vehicle finally halted and the driver asked all passengers to alight .
Just ahead , barely a kilometre away , was a checkpost near Khed-Shivapur toll naka on Pune-Bengaluru highway .
Around 130 passengers of all ages were asked to walk across , and given a particular spot little over 3 km away where they would meet again .
At the checkpost , all vehicles were checked inside out -- even those with permissions .
This truck passed through smoothly .
So were the people on foot .
" We have no idea how to deal with them .
They are all desperate and walking home .
How can we send them back on foot ? " said an officer posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , marching from their workplaces to their native villages in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh hundreds of kilometres away amid the coronavirus lockdown , are not being welcomed back home .
As decided , the crowd assembled at the predetermined stop .
The truck had already arrived .
Within minutes , all were huddled back into the truck .
The vehicle left for its destination in Karad taluka .
At several checkpoints along the route , cops were found dozing or merely sitting on the side of the highway , letting every vehicle through .
By 8 am , the vehicle made its first stop to drop of Namdeo Chavan and his family at Undale village on Kale-Pachwad road , 16 km from Karad town .
The vehicle kept proceeding further and dropped the last passenger an hour later .
" We are all scared to live in the city .
The threat of the virus is real .
There is no work for us .
And even if we had work , what good is the money if we do n't survive ? Our grocers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle even to procure basic supplies .
It makes more sense to be back in our village , where the air is clean and people are helpful , " said Chavan , who has been working in Kalyan for 30 years now .
He started off as a mathadi worker and now runs a vegetable stall in the market .
" I could have continued to sell vegetables and would even have made a decent daily sum .
I know I have given up on Rs 1,500-2,000 earnings per day .
But I can not live there , not at least till the virus is gone , " he rued .
Before getting off , he had paid the driver Rs 1,000 per seat for seven passengers .
Several others on the truck were not as forthcoming as him , scared to speak to us on record .
" The minute the government gets to know this , they will stop movement .
So many of our brothers are desperate to get out of Mumbai , " said another occupant of the truck .
When Mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pune district , he said , " Since it was the first day of clampdown on Saturday , we had asked cops to focus on passenger vehicles .
The remaining vehicles with cargo were being allowed to go , considering that they are transporting essential commodities .
But we will take necessary care and get checking of these vehicles done , too .
Also , as far as people crossing toll plazas on foot is concerned , the government has created facilities for them around these areas .
They all need to go to these facilities and should n't be allowed to travel further .
I will see to it that such implementation is done .
"  Even if we had work , what good is money if we do n't live ? We have to struggle even for basics .
It makes more sense to be back in our village , the air is clean and people helpful  -- Namdeo Chavan , vegetable seller from Kalyan , travelling with a family of 7  Tejaswini Satpute , SP of Satara district , similarly said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll plaza .
We are taking measures to stop people from crossing the border .
We are making people disembark from vehicles and sending them to the quarantine facility set up near the toll plaza .
Till date , 200-300 people have been quarantined through this .
Many want to go back to the city .
We are sending them back after medical checkups .
Those who want to go ahead and cross the border are not being allowed to .
We are acting as per directives of the Union home department .
It might happen that in case there is an emergency , like an ambulance arrives , that we clear all vehicles in front in a hurry .
But these will also be only carriers of essential commodities , and nothing else .
