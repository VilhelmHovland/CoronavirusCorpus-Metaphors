March 30 ( Reuters ) - Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to start human testing of its experimental coronavirus vaccine by September and make it ready for emergency use in early 2021 , the drugmaker said on Monday .
J&amp;J also committed more than $1 billion of investment along with U .
agency Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) to co-fund vaccine research , expanding a previous collaboration .
Global efforts are underway to develop a vaccine for the virus that has killed over 34,000 worldwide , but experts have cautioned it could take over a year to have a vaccine ready .
A patient was dosed with Moderna Inc 's vaccine in an early-stage trial earlier this month , making it the front-runner in the race to develop a viable vaccine .
J&amp;J said in January it had begun working on a possible vaccine for the coronavirus , using the same technologies used to make its experimental Ebola vaccine .
