Trust me , as I 'm into the fourth week of quarantine here in Milan , I entirely understand .
But baseline realities matter even more in a genuine crisis .
One such truism was put best by John Stuart Mill : all it takes for evil to triumph in the world is for enough good men to do nothing .
And at the moment , utterly preoccupied by the coronavirus crisis , the greatest single political risk event of the new century , the good men of the west are sleeping .
Yet geopolitics goes on , whatever the calamity .
In the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial propagator of the virus -- that stands most to benefit .
History sometimes favours the culpable .
In true Orwellian fashion , the repressive regime of Xi Jinping is affronted that some in the west are labelling the coronavirus the " Chinese " or " Wuhan virus " , even though assuredly this is where the worst pandemic of the past 100 years began .
Incredibly , aided by the mindless left in the west , Beijing is affecting hurt , saying that such comments are racist , rather than merely amounting to statements of fact .
But there is a far more serious matter lurking beneath the surface here , amounting to the first plank in the current Chinese public relations offensive .
China , shamelessly , is trying to divert attention from the inconvenient truth that for close to two months it covered up the extent and even existence of the virus , in a selfish effort to shield its economy and spare the blushes of the ruling Communist Party .
Of course , this criminally negligent behaviour allowed the virus to spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you simply forgot this ; instead it should be shouted from the rooftops .
Second , Beijing has lost no time in taking advantage of the sluggish response to the virus emanating from both Brussels and Washington .
China may be criminally culpable in spreading Covid-19 , but Beijing is determined to win the post-virus narrative .
For example , while the hard-pressed Italians were first bearing the brunt of the disease in Europe , a selfish Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to hoard surgical masks .
Adroitly filling the vacuum , China pledged to Italy 1000 ventilators , two million surgical facemasks , 100,000 respirators , 20,000 protection suits , and 50,000 test kits .
Third , Beijing is fully energised in winning over the world with a basic new reality .
Due to its ruthless but effective authoritarian response and the innate discipline of its people , it has successfully seen off the virus .
Beijing is making it clear that , in this dangerous new world , its success illustrates that dictatorship is a more effective system than chaotic democracies .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese .
As the first to be hit by and get through the virus , China will now be ramping up its economy , even as later-hit Europe and North America are struggling with the plague .
This means that China will have a huge economic advantage in coming online first in the post-coronavirus world .
In essence , the crisis is merely ruthlessly making clear weaknesses already present in the international system well before it struck : Europe is both weak and less than a real union , while the US has lost interest in Europe as its gaze turns to Asia -- with much of the world 's future growth as well as much of its global risk .
Into this global pandemic and geopolitical vacuum , China has begun to play the strategic game of dividing an already fractured Europe .
America must ( yet again ) help come to the rescue of its European allies by collectively engaging in economic stimulus across the transatlantic space -- and even better at the G20 level -- as saving the old continent strategically helps safeguard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to stand as the west 's collective propaganda riposte to the Chinese .
The only real way to " solve " the coronavirus crisis in policy terms is to develop a vaccine .
Given America 's pre-eminence in biotechnology and the life sciences , Washington should strain every sinew , developing a Manhattan Project-style programme , getting there first , ahead of the Chinese , and getting their better , in terms of a safer , more comprehensive product .
Western democratic states have a far better record of innovation than do Communist dictatorships , precisely because the work emanates in free societies where creativity is not punished .
We in the west , awakening from our nap from history , must not be shy about combatting Chinese propaganda with this central , and very real , fact .
