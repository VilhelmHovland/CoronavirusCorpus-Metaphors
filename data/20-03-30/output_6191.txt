" If I were a big business leader right now , I would say , ' Tell stories , tell the truth , build trust , use your resources , and your muscle , and your network to provide connection and support .
Your customers really deserve the best from you right now , ' and I would feel an enormous responsibility to deliver it .

You have to visibly appreciate everyone in the industry , like the medical and service industries , who keep working and risking themselves to keep the rest of us safe .
I would turn to the creatives in my organization and say , ' Let 's come up with some really quick meaningful ideas to help those people in our world and the greater world .

Did we get the tone right ? Did we find a way to help in some small way ? Whether that was with tools and tips and advice consumers needed , whether that was with new programs and benefits to consumers or whether that was with simple distractions and the right tone for entertainment and even humor in this moment when people need an escape .

I think that 's a new question for this moment .
