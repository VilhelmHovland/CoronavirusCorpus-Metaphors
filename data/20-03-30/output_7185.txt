Amazon offers warehouse workers higher pay for Prime Now groceries  The coronavirus is affecting everyone .
And now Amazon 's focus on essentials during the COVID-19 pandemic has led it to offer special incentives to its workers .
Reuters has learned that Amazon is offering warehouse workers a $2 raise to $19 per hour if they 're willing to pick and pack Whole Foods groceries for Prime Now .
That 's not a bad incentive at all .
The company already has plans to hire 100,000 workers to keep up with demand , but that clearly is n't enough right now .
A spokesperson described the hikes as " temporary opportunities " meant to reflect a " significant increase " in grocery orders .
It was n't clear when Amazon expected the pay offer to come to an end .
Workers will be happy to earn a bit of extra money though .
It wo n't be surprising if this lasts for a while , regardless of how long the coronavirus outbreak continues .
Amazon is already dealing with grocery shortages and problems setting delivery windows .
If Amazon does n't adjust for this current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , it could lead to trouble for customers who may be forced to go outside and risk infection if they ca n't have groceries delivered .
Amazon is trying to respond to everyone 's needs at this time .
