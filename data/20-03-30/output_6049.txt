The ' Ten Cardinal Principles of War ' , have stood the test of time across ages .
With modifications , they can be leveraged in all warlike situations including the battle against Covid-19 .
The first and pivotal one is ' Selection and Maintenance of Aim ' .
War is always about making tough choices .
And these are not options between a right or a wrong .
Instead , it is about choosing lesser of the two evils .
The choices we face now are between saving lives from the pandemic or from the economic devastation that will follow it .
Both have the potential to claim tens of thousands and both have to be tackled simultaneously .
As another example , it is a hard choice between packing millions of migrant workers into trains and buses , thus increasing the spread of the virus -- versus the inability to provide food and accommodation at the cities of their work .
The essence of this principle is not just selecting an aim , but sustaining it in the face of hardships and pushbacks -- because casualties are certain ; regardless of which aim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible .
The second principle is ' Maintenance of Morale ' .
Superior morale enables smaller armies to defeat larger ones .
Maintaining morale requires credible and inspiring leadership by example , at all levels starting from the political hierarchy down to the trenches .
A shared sense of purpose and group cohesion has to be established and sustained through the most trying times -- which is yet to come .
This needs not just truthful communication about decisions , but also the rationale behind those decisions .
The third principle is ' Offensive Action ' .
Leaders have to be proactive , anticipate future threats and take bold decisions with minimal information to seize fleeting opportunities .
Out of the box thinking , breaching fiscal deficits to provide relief , releasing strategic reserves , co-opting leaders crossing party lines , nationalising resources , and commandeering private sector resources like offices and transportation are some examples .
The fourth principle -- ' Security ' , implies safeguarding of the frontline troops and their logistic chains .
The medical fraternity , police and the personnel providing essential services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mental wellbeing have to be of paramount importance .
We also need to cater for the disproportionate attrition they will have .
The fifth principle is ' Surprise ' .
The pandemic itself and the steps taken to fight it will have unexpected consequences .
For instance , many key leaders could get infected and be unavailable in the near future .
Forceful enforcement of the lockdown may blowback as hungry citizens break the law and begin attacking the police .
Terrorist organisations may step up their operations because security forces are choked .
Releasing criminals from jail could increase crime .
Such scenarios must be anticipated to avoid surprises .
Sixth , ' Concentration of Force ' .
During the war , scarce resources must be focused .
A good example of this principle is the lockdown strategy of some countries which conducted increased testing to identify highly infected clusters , rather than spreading resources thinly over the entire country .
Similarly , manufacturing capacity needs to be concentrated to manufacture medical equipment and drugs over the next few months .
Seventh , ' Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve maximum effect .
Doctors deciding whom to treat and who not , stopping elective surgeries , instructing e-commerce companies to focus on supplying essential items only ; are examples of this principle .
The eighth principle ' Flexibility ' is to cater for high fluidity in war situations .
Leaders must be mentally mobile , adaptable , admit mistakes and reverse suboptimal decisions when the situation changes .
Systems need to become resilient in crashed timeframes .
Pressing medical students and paramedics who have not yet graduated to step up to the plate , training civilians on basic triage , converting warehouses , schools , offices and trains into hospitals , opening up licences for drones , creating ham radios networks , developing websites that enable citizens to help each other , are examples of this principle .
The ninth principle ' Cooperation ' -- demands teamwork in the war .
While this seems very obvious , it is one of the most difficult principles to achieve .
For instance , while citizens may have clapped enthusiastically for a few minutes to encourage the medical fraternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostracising their relatives .
While home delivery services are happily leveraged by the citizens , their personnel are beaten on the roads and treated as pariahs when they enter the building .
The load and the risks -- bothhave to be shared equally by all stakeholders in the war .
Setting aside turf wars , personal egos , parochialism , and leveraging expertise of leaders and professionals cutting across party lines are other examples of this principle .
The final principle is ' Sustainability ' .
The war-withal can not be ' exhausted ' in just the first phase of this battle .
There is no telling how long this pandemic or it 's relapse will continue or what challenges will emerge in its aftermath .
Expended resources will need to be regenerated .
We may have to conduct crash courses for medics , press the NCC into service , set aside food , oil and medical reserves to cater for a second wave .
Similarly , part of the police and security forces will have to be conserved to cater for future contingencies .
The famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the factors influencing war are wrapped in the fog of uncertainty .
These ten principles serve as a compass to journey through that fog of war .
