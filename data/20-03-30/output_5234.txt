Assessment unplugged : Solving the BIR audit conundrum  Amid the global maelstrom whipped up by the Covid-19 pandemic , its timing coinciding with our tax season makes it all the more taxing .
It 's a welcome relief that the Bureau of Internal Revenue , after its initial refusal , relented to extend the April 15 filing of the 2019 Annual Income Tax Return to May 15 , 2020 sans any penalties .
Likewise , the BIR through its Circulars and Operations Memorandum extended the filings of certain documents like protest letters and suspended the conduct of any field audit/investigation as well as prohibited personal service of electronic Letter of Authorities ( eLAs ) and the likes , but not assessment notices , during the enhanced community quarantine .
Note though that only personal service is expressly prohibited with other modes of service , such as registered mail , still available .
Service of assessment notices are not prohibited and , thus , may still be possible .
Hence , companies may still have to watch out for that dreaded Formal Letter of Demand and Assessment Notice due to prescribing cases by April 15 , 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is , by issuing the FLD/FAN , " within three years after the last day prescribed by law for the filing of the return " ( but extendible to 10 years under certain cases , e .
, fraudulent or false returns ) .
Extension of the period to assess can only be done through a legislative amendment , not merely by a BIR issuance .
Ergo , the BIR 's march to assess prescribing cases , Covid or no Covid , can neither be contained nor quarantined .
So , what to do if you 're " lucky " to receive that dreaded assessment notice from the BIR ?  I am certain you have already been bombarded with lots of tips and advice before , but there 's no harm in adding to your stockpile of armaments .
Knowing and understanding better the assessment procedure is still your best starting defense when assessed or hit by a BIR audit .
The key is to know and also , to ask the right questions .
Electronic Letter of Authority  A taxpayer 's assessment travails commence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorizes the BIR to examine the company 's books of accounts , records and documents .
It serves as the initial salvo by the BIR giving you a checklist of documents to commence their examination .
A word of caution : Do not ignore the BIR 's repeated demand to submit documents as doing so may trigger the issuance of a Subpoena Duces Tecum -- a legal order for you to " bring " or produce the documents strictly within a prescribed period .
Further , one effect of the eLA issuance is that you can no longer amend tax returns for the period covered , even that of a tentative tax return .
As ruled by the Supreme Court , and echoed by the BIR in its issuance , any tax assessment issued without a Letter of Authority is a violation of the taxpayer 's right to due process and is , therefore , " inescapably void .
"  Remember the general rule : No L/A or eLA , no valid assessment .
Questions to ask :  Was a valid eLA issued to the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eLA bear the name , designation and signature of the approving BIR official ?  Does it contain a system-generated serial number and the date ?  Were the names of the Revenue Officers assigned printed on said eLA ?  Does it reflect the tax types and taxable period to be covered by the audit ?  Does it indicate the basis for the audit ( i .
, regular audit program , special audit , etc .
) ?  Does it have any manually written character , notation or erasure rendering it void ?  Was it properly served by the BIR and was received by the company 's authorized personnel ?  Notice for Informal Conference  Starting February 2018 , the requirement for the BIR to issue a NIC was reinstated after having been previously dispensed with in 2013 by going straight to the issuance of a Preliminary Assessment Notice .
During the " Informal Conference " stage , the taxpayer has the opportunity to present his explanations , which shall not extend beyond 30 days from receipt of the notice .
If still found to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings , the case will then be endorsed for PAN issuance .
NIC is part of the taxpayer 's due process requirement .
Hence , no NIC , no valid assessment .
Questions to ask :  Was a Notice for Informal Conference issued prior to the issuance of the PAN ?  Was the company given the opportunity by the BIR to explain the initial findings within the prescribed period of at least 30 days from receipt of NIC ?  Preliminary Assessment Notice  After the NIC , the BIR issues the PAN showing the facts and the law , rules and regulations , or jurisprudence on which the proposed assessment is based .
Failure of the taxpayer to reply to the PAN within 15 days from date of receipt will make him in default , so that the FLD/FAN shall be issued .
Now , if he responds within15 days disagreeing with the findings , the FLD/FAN shall be issued within 15 days from the taxpayer 's filing of reply .
A PAN is always required to be issued EXCEPT for the five instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as amended ( i .
, deficiency taxes arising from mathematical error , difference between tax withheld and amount actually remitted , excisable articles not paid , carry-over and automatic application of refund amount claimed against tax liabilities and article transferred from a tax-exempt to a nonexempt person ) .
The PAN , similar to the NIC , is part of the taxpayer 's due process right , a substantive and not merely a formal requirement .
Generally , the absence of PAN may invalidate an assessment .
Questions to ask :  Was a PAN validly issued to the taxpayer ?  Did the PAN issued show in detail the facts and the law , rules and regulations , or jurisprudence on which the proposed assessment is based ?  Was the taxpayer afforded the prescribed time to file its reply ?  For the next part of this article , we will discuss the other stages of the assessment procedure beginning with the FLD/FAN issuance , then filing of protest , issuance of the BIR 's final decision on disputed assessment and the administrative and judicial remedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author is a Special Counsel of Du-Baladad and Associates Law Offices ( BDB Law ) , a member-firm of WTS Global .
