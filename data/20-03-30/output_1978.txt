The coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) pandemic is first and foremost one of the gravest health crises of the past hundred years , threatening to generate millions of premature deaths worldwide .
But it also represents a major -- and unusual -- challenge for economic policymakers .
In most economic downturns , the appropriate policy response is qualitatively straightforward , if sometimes difficult to calibrate or implement .
For instance , normal business cycle downturns usually represent a shortfall in aggregate demand for which the appropriate response is a cut in interest rates or perhaps a reduction in taxes and/or an increase in government spending .
The Great Recession that followed the 2007-8 financial crisis was more challenging because it required not only aggressive ( and , on the monetary front , novel ) policies to raise spending but also measures to repair and reinforce the financial system .
The coming economic downturn is unusual , however , because it is a direct consequence of the actions taken to deal with the health crisis and , in particular , to flatten out and delay the peak in infections so that health systems can cope and so reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on people 's ability to go to work , school and shop .
It is not implausible that the consequence of the lockdowns now in force will be to reduce economic activity by somewhere between a quarter and a third , for so long as they are in force .
If the lockdowns are in effect for , say , three months that would knock something like 6-8 percentage points off annual GDP .
That is a comfortably larger decline in GDP than during the Great Recession .
And with the possibility of a second wave of infections occurring when restrictions are eased , necessitating their re-imposition or retention , the economic costs could turn out to be even larger .
The impact on economic activity comes through several channels : forced reductions in supply because of a reduced ability to operate effectively and disruption to supply chains ; and forced reductions in demand , especially for many consumer goods and services .
In some industries , the fall in supply may be the dominant factor , in others it may be the fall in demand that matters more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the disruptive effects of the lockdowns , not the direct consequences of people falling ill and being unable to work .
In these circumstances , the aim of policy should not be to boost demand -- more people shopping would just aggravate the health crisis after all -- but rather to ensure that the present hiatus in economic activity does not lead to lasting damage to the supply potential of the economy and a lower level of activity that persists after the resolution of the health crisis .
That means avoiding perfectly good businesses being needlessly driven into bankruptcy , and the associated destruction of jobs and livelihoods .
In essence , the state needs to play the role of ' insurer of last resort ' to keep the economy ticking over , so that it can quickly re-start once the emergency has passed .
The raft of measures announced by the UK authorities since the beginning of March are designed to achieve that end .
These include measures such as the government 's Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme to bolster the supply of finance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Covid Corporate Financing Facility which will provide finance for larger firms .
But loans are unlikely to suffice -- especially if the duration of the restrictions is long -- as the hangover of excessive debt will weigh on businesses ' future ability to operate .
So grants and transfers must be part of the mix too .
Such measures include : selective business rates relief and tax holidays ; the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ( CJRS ) , replacing 80% of the pay of workers who are temporarily laid off ( ' furloughed ' ) ; and the Self-employment Income Support Scheme that does the same for the self-employed .
Finally , for individuals who fall through the cracks , access to universal credit has been eased .
These measures will be expensive and in some cases those costs are hard to predict .
For instance , the Treasury has calculated that the CJRS , if taken up by 10% of the workforce and lasting just three months , will cost around ? 10 billion .
But take-up could easily be twice that or the duration twice as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 billion .
In addition , the reduction in activity will lead to a sharp fall in tax receipts .
Together with the costs of the measures , the budget deficit could easily top ? 200 billion this year according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies .
That is nearly 10 per cent of GDP , the same level reached in the Great Recession .
Although such a deficit is large , it is not unreasonable in the circumstances .
It is appropriate for governments to borrow heavily during ' bad ' times -- such as major wars , financial crises and natural disasters -- provided that they compensate for that in the ' good ' times by running a small enough primary deficit ( or a large enough surplus ) to gradually bring down the ratio of public debt to GDP , so creating fiscal space to cope with the next bad event that comes along .
In this way , the costs of dealing with such bad events is shared across successive generations of taxpayers .
The high prospective deficit will , however , offer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to sell about 6 per cent of GDP in new gilts even without the Covid-19 shock .
On top of that comes another 10 percentage points or so associated with coronavirus .
That is a lot for financial institutions to absorb .
In such circumstances , however , it would -- in my view -- be entirely appropriate for the Bank of England to help out by buying some of them -- directly from the government in the primary market , should that prove necessary .
In that way , the state 's financing needs would be partially met by an increase in bank reserves instead .
Since reserves pay interest at Bank Rate , that is equivalent to financing the some of the deficit with debt of very short maturity instead of the normal long-maturity debt .
Some readers will no doubt worry that such ' monetary financing ' is putting the UK on the road to high , or even hyper , inflation .
But similar episodes in the past -- for instance , under the Weimar Republic a hundred years ago or Zimbabwe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying political and structural problems .
That would not be the case today .
But it is important that if the Bank of England does end up absorbing a lot of the new gilt issuance , then it is explicitly understood to be a temporary expedient , with the Bank 's purchases being unwound promptly once the crisis has passed .
If that is done , I see no reason why the financial markets need worry unduly about any inflationary consequences .

One Comment  Very Insightful ! ! .
When we say " In some industries , the fall in supply may be the dominant factor , in others it may be the fall in demand that matters more " , may i ask , which are those industries .
Is there are study which i a read through ? Also , what would be the impact on prices for different intermediate and end user products , since there seems to be significant change in Supply and Demand Dynamics .
