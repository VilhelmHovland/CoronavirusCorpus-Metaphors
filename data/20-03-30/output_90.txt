Wairoa drawn in as newspaper on hold  Wairoa has well and truly joined the Covid-19 battle with the announcement that a patient who has tested positive is self-isolating in the district , and confirmation also that one of four arrests nationally for blatant disregard of the pandemic lockdown rules and advice has been made by Wairoa Police .
Mayor Craig Little has urged Wairoa residents in messages on the council website and Facebook page to be kind and supportive , saying the person with Covid-19 was " just a victim like hundreds of thousands of people in the world " and that they had followed all the right protocols .
He asked people to only post facts on social media as there was a lot of misinformation being shared and " alarmist behaviour " that was only causing more concern and anxiety .
Mr Little also warned residents to abide by the lockdown guidelines , saying police had extra enforcement powers now and no tolerance for people breaking the rules .
This all comes on a day when the Tuesday edition of the Wairoa Star is held up awaiting a decision from the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday to stop the publication and delivery of community newspapers during the Alert Level 4 lockdown .
As a paid , twice-weekly newspaper with a team of four reporters dedicated to telling the news of the Wairoa district -- which is seldom covered by other media , and never with the local detail communities rely on -- non-publication at this time would leave serious information gaps for residents .
Wairoa is a vast and isolated district with many parts that lack digital connectivity , and many elderly who are not tech-savvy .
It has a population of around 8000 , majority Maori , who buy about 2200 Wairoa Stars each day it publishes .
Because it is clear to us that the Star is an essential local news service for the Wairoa district , the team at the Wairoa Star -- which is sub-edited and published in Gisborne at the Herald offices -- expect to receive an exemption and have continued to prepare today 's newspaper .
A Government decision on potential exemptions was expected yesterday but with that now expected today , the Star did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made available free online , for those with internet access .
This is an incredibly hectic and difficult time for our Government but we trust they will make the right decision for Wairoa , knowing that the Star team is ready to follow all requirements it might have .
