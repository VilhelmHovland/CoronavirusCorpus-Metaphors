The problem with Womad  Wellington publisher Mary McCallum went to Womad with 17,000 people each day , just before the lockdown .
It 's a fortnight since people headed home from Womad in New Plymouth , some heading straight into self-isolation as a preventive measure .
Held on March 13-15 , it was the last large gathering before Government measures were ramped up to stop the spread of Covid-19 .
The country looked on as 17,000 people rocked for three days in Pukekura Park , many of them camping nearby , and wondered if it should have been cancelled .
Some who attended experienced a social backlash on returning home .
So far nobody who has attended has been diagnosed with the virus .
I was there .
It was my first Womad .
I stayed even when everything started to suggest it was a very bad idea .
On Friday the 13th , we dropped our things off at Donna 's dad 's place in Fitzroy and drove to Brooklands on the edge of Pukekura Park .
The three of us -- Donna , Julie and I -- walked down through trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacher , to a place of more trees and lights and dells and glades , with stages that ranged from the natural grassed amphitheatre called the Bowl to a platform that looked like a garden-party gazebo , food trucks with every sort of deliciousness from seafood paella to mushroom burgers , banks of hi-tech water stations , and bars with NZ-made gins and craft beers .
And people came with us , shoals of them : gold card carriers with hiking sticks and backpacks , teens in tight groups , cheerful dads with kids on their bare shoulders , hippies with dreads , middle-aged professionals with parasols for the day and Gore-Tex for the evening .
Many of the crowd had dressed up : in kilts , harem pants , ball gowns , funny hats , fluorescent paint , feathers , lights blinking from hair and waists .
Two days earlier a pandemic had been declared , and two weeks earlier Covid-19 had finally snuck into New Zealand .
While we did n't like the sound of this , the only people who seemed to be actively protecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the older folk , who were not only vulnerable but knew what pandemics could do .
I 'd felt mostly sanguine but went on mild alert when my 90-year-old author Ren ? e decided to cancel her gig at the Auckland Writers Festival to the disappointment of the organisers .
Before she 'd made that call I 'd consulted my GP friend , John Rowland , via messenger .
Would he discourage his mum from going to an event like that ? A perfunctory , " Yes .
No debate , " came back , and so the decision was sealed .
But when Donna , Julie and I left Wellington to drive to New Plymouth via the Wairarapa , there were still only seven cases of Covid-19 in the country and as yet no community transmission .
The Festival of the Arts in Wellington was continuing to pack people into the Michael Fowler Centre to see jetlagged performers do their thing , and Womad musicians had arrived in Auckland from places as far away as Finland and Scotland , Mali on the West Coast of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still going ahead in May .
Jacinda Ardern said she did n't want Kiwis to avoid public gatherings needlessly .
Still , people began talking about the wisdom of going ahead with Womad .
My mum was one of them .
As our car swung out of Patea heading for New Plymouth I posted a photo on Facebook of the open road in front of us and the steep-sided deep-blue splendour of Mount Taranaki .
Cheery friends commented " Womad ! " and " See you there ! " Matt said , " Poi e ! ' " My mother , Norma , tapped out a note of warning : " Take care .
Should have been cancelled in my view .
"  But Waikanae , where my parents live , and Wellington and Motueka , where we three hail from , felt far away .
We were in the shadow of a great mountain and the Blind Boys of Alabama were calling us ; alongside them in the packed programme were bands we 'd never heard of with beguiling names like Soaked Oats , Tuuletar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the main stage at Womad on that first evening , with a moat and back-lit trees , people sitting and sprawling on the sides of the huge grass bowl that faced it , we could hear the sound of harps , each note falling like water .
Follow the music , and we were in the area called the Dell .
Welsh harpist Catrin Finch was playing , with Seckou Keita from Senegal on a kora , an African lute harp .
It was our first Womad act and almost filmic in its perfection , and really quite -- I do n't use the word lightly -- heavenly .
Is it the harps that make me say that ? Perhaps .
But it was a feeling in the air too -- of gentleness , lightness , joy .
Have I said Wellington felt far away ? Light years .
What about the virus ? Yeah .
Covid-19 made its presence felt for sure .
There were signs on every second tree , every food tent , outside every toilet block .
Soap and water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spraying cubicles after one use .
We all washed our hands while singing happy birthday twice .
Sanitised .
But then we walked off to a stage under trees and stood shoulder to shoulder with thousands of strangers rocking out to acts like Scottish band RURA with its bagpipes and fiddles and bearded redhead , who encouraged us to wave our well-washed hands about .
When the Scots finished there was Troy Kingi and his band belting it out on one stage and Shapeshifter on the other , people on their feet dancing or drifting , a fat moon pulling itself up lazily into a starry sky .
and I 'd lay a bet that the last thing on any of our minds was Covid-19 .
Saturday and Sunday were hot .
The sun shone down as determinedly as the moon had mooched .
We stumbled on a trio from Mali , ran down the hillside for the pure vocals of New Zealand 's Reb Fountain , and found ourselves in front of Ifriqiyya Electrique playing ' slave music ' that sounded like death metal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infectious energy of Albi and the Wolves , and star quality of the blind gentlemen from Alabama in their lam ? jackets .
We were in the world , you see , but also weirdly out of it .
There was so much to absorb right there in front of us that it felt like the brain simply could n't stretch to what was happening to people elsewhere .
The virus .
We had n't forgotten it but for now , for Donna , Julie and me at least , it was n't centre stage .
From the way everyone else was acting , it was n't centre stage for them either .
But something was happening in the wings .

On the Saturday we heard the Pasifika Festival in Auckland had been cancelled , and there was talk of events having number restrictions -- including the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writers Festival .
It did n't take much googling to find that the number of people dying overseas from Covid-19 was still climbing sharply , others were confined to their homes unable to get out except for food and medicine and as an antidote were singing wildly from their balconies ( music , it 's everywhere ) , and the world economy was tanking .
That night in New Plymouth the likeable guy who fronted L .
called on everyone to dance like there was no tomorrow .
" Do it ! " he yelled .
" It might be the last festival we get to for a while .
"  On the last day for Womad , the Sunday , I got a text from my husband to say that the arts festival event he was attending that night had been cancelled .
Up in Brooklands our brains were still struggling to take it all in .
I mean , look at all the people here , relaxed , happy , healthy , from different countries and cultures , weaving together in and around the grassy slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sun shining in the sky like a drawing in a child 's picture book .
How could it end badly ?  Late afternoon and the festival was winding up .
The last acts were doing soundchecks .
Donna was hanging out at Te Paepae with her whanau , listening to a woman talking about planting by the moon .
Julie and I joined her .
It was still hot even in the late afternoon sun .
We put up our -- yes -- parasols .
There was a small stage close by , and a bunch of young men in black leather jackets , carrying brass instruments and taxidermied animals leapt on board .
The Belgian band KermesZ ? l'Est started to play something that could be called frenzied Balkan metal/jazz .
After a couple of songs , the four women who made up the Finnish band Tuuletar were invited to jump up onto the stage too , and they did , and the two bands jammed -- spit and sweat flying .
The unexpected get-together electrified the crowd .
On the ground up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her long red hair and white shawl like she was doing the flamenco .
Nearby an older couple kissed and kissed while people eddied around them .
A boy was practising with juggling sticks , using two to toss one in the air and catch it .
A toddler wiggled his fat belly and his mum chased him , her dress falling from her shoulders .
And the woman in pink danced and flicked her shawl and tossed her long red hair .
Then one of the Belgians was waving a bottle of Belgian beer .
He drank deeply , and passed it down to the woman in pink .
She drank from it , wiped the back of her hand across her mouth , and passed the bottle to another young woman beside her , who drank , too .
Even though Wellington felt light years away and the rest of the world further than that , even though the virus still felt like a concept a bully had invented to bring us all into line ( scaring people then getting them to sing happy birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all standing there sated with music and sunshine like a bunch of Lotus-eaters , still we knew that crushing on the stage , kissing in the crowd and sharing the beer were all wrong .
All wrong now .
*  When we left the next morning and headed home we 'd find out exactly how wrong it all was .
We 'd find more Kiwis diagnosed with the virus , people self-isolating , events cancelling , businesses fighting for their lives , hugs and hongis displaced by raised eyebrows and awkward elbow gestures .
Everyone perplexed and uncertain at best , deeply anxious and frightened at worst .
Some of my Facebook friends wondered aloud how they 'd greet people who 'd attended Womad -- were n't we as bad as the tourists from the cruise ships ? Should n't we self-isolate ? One of them posited , probably tongue in cheek , that we 'd be the last people to get the virus as Womad people always come home with silly smiles on their faces , and everyone knows that happiness improves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the virus .
It had been sunny too -- Covid-19 did n't like the sun .
By the time I dropped Donna and Julie at the airport on Monday afternoon to catch a flight to Motueka , the media was reporting that Milk Crate , the Ghuznee Street caf ? where I bought coffee on my way to work , was closing its doors because the seventh confirmed case of Covid-19 in New Zealand had eaten there .
Almost exactly a week later our prime minister would announce the country was going into lockdown .
In between there would be media reports about two Taranaki people being infected by the virus , and the journalist had to make it clear that they were n't at Womad , because , well , you 'd think .
There were reports too about infected people at the airport at the same time Donna and Julie were checking in .
And then the Carterton diagnosis would come through , and with it the reality of community transmission , which led inevitably and in a matter of days to Stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late afternoon sunshine at Pukekura Park , we grinned at a bunch of crazy Belgians , rolled our eyes at a kissing couple and , following the lead of a woman in pink , danced like like there was no tomorrow .
For a snatch of time before the world rushed in , we were wild , horrified and free .
