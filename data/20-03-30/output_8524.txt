In response to a skyrocketing number of people out of work or working reduced hours , the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions is warning payday lenders , title loan companies and other non-traditional lenders not to increase interest rates , fees or any costs of borrowing .
The state regulating agency issued its emergency guidelines for lenders earlier this month .
The department expected many Wisconsinites will struggle to make ends meet during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institutions encouraged lenders to reduce interest rates and keep fees as low as possible in its emergency letter .
Lenders that violate the guidelines may have their licenses suspended or revoked .
" We took this proactive measure to inform licensees that now is the time for them to be part of the solution and not a time to take advantage of consumers , " DFI secretary Kathy Blumenfeld said in an email .
" A licensee who is found to take advantage of current conditions will be deemed to have failed in the character and fitness test .
"  Wisconsin law does not have interest rate caps on consumer loans .
Because lenders often issue high-interest loans that are difficult to pay off , some financial counselors call these predatory loans .
A time of financial crisis  The rising number of unemployed workers and people working reduced hours adds new financial stress for residents in a state where more than half of residents were already living paycheck to paycheck , Blumenfeld said .
That statistic comes from the FINRA Investor Education Foundation , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income in the past year and 39% broke even .
" With 53% of Wisconsinites living paycheck to paycheck , people are going to need small loans to get through these hardships and many will be turning to lenders for help , " Blumenfeld said .
Becky Smith and Pete Spaeth are financial counselors at the Menasha-based Financial Information and Service Center , which offers financial education , programming , and counseling .
" During this time of crisis , any family or household that was on the edge anyway , or they were living paycheck to paycheck , or they were hanging on by a thread -- if any of them have lost income , partial or completely , this is going to throw them into a crisis with their finances , " Smith said .
Smith and Spaeth regularly see clients burdened by high-interest loans -- at least once a week .
" If their habit has been going toward a traditional lender , they will .
If their habit has been going toward a predatory lender , that 's probably the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it will just throw them deeper in debt and compound the crisis that 's already in front of them .
"  Smith said the Menasha-based FISC has coached clients who have run into problems paying off high-interest loans through recovering their credit score and building a savings .
They try to help clients avoid having to use , or navigate existing relationships with , those lenders .
" The folks that we see here , generally , take out a payday loan thinking they 'll get it paid off , " Spaeth said .
" And then they get stuck , and then they 'll get another one to pay off the first one .
But then they 'll end up with two .
"  There are online lenders , too .
" Basically all you need is a signature to get them , " Spaeth said .
" They do n't check credit scores , they do n't check work employment .
You can go online and easily get money transferred in your account .
"  Once there 's a signature , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay .
If they fall behind on payment or can not pay , agencies can call the borrower multiple times a day , Spaeth said .
Lenders use whatever is allowed within collection law to contact the borrower regarding payment .
Ultimately if the borrower can not pay , they may be taken to court and their paycheck could get garnished -- a court order where money or property is seized to pay a debt .
Complaints about improper lending practices can be filed on the DFI 's website .
The state is responsible for investigating complaints that are filed by consumers .
" The Department also has authority to take administrative actions against licensees , including revocation , " Blumenfeld said in an email .
What financial relief exists during this time ?  Smith said anyone having trouble paying off a loan should first call the lender to explain their situation and see what options are available .
If you are in need of financial counseling , FISC can be reached at 800-366-8161 or online .
Other available financial counselors as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listed through United Way 2-1-1 .
Resources may differ by city and county .
" There 's a lot of services out there for these folks that are low interest or no interest where they can get help , " Spaeth said .
