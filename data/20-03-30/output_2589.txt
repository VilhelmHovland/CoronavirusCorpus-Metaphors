Shopkeepers in the city at the centre of the virus outbreak in China were reopening Monday but customers were scarce after authorities lifted more of the anti-virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months .
" I 'm so excited , I want to cry , " said a woman on the Chuhe Hanjie pedestrian mall who would give only the English name Kat .
She said she was a teacher in the eastern city of Nanjing visiting her family in Wuhan when the government locked down the city in late January to stem the spread of the coronavirus .
Some 70 per cent to 80 per cent of shops on the mall were open but many imposed limits on how many people could enter .
Shopkeepers set up dispensers for hand sanitizer and checked customers for signs of fever .
Wuhan 's bus and subway service has resumed , easing curbs that cut most access to the city of 11 million people on January 23 as China fought the coronavirus .
The train station reopened Saturday , bringing thousands of people to what is the manufacturing and transportation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped at home , I want to jump , " said Kat , jumping up and down excitedly .
" I want to revenge shop .
"  That will be a welcome sentiment to officials who are under orders to revive manufacturing , retailing and other industries while also preventing a spike in infections as people return to work .
Travel controls on most of Hubei province , where Wuhan is located , were lifted on March 23 .
The final restrictions preventing people from leaving Wuhan are due to end April 8 .
