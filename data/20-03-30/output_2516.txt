Saddam laments lack of earnings for Pakistan footballers  Sports  KARACHI : Hardly any Pakistani footballer owns a car .
Most of them use motorcycles when they go to play their league matches .
This makes them less inspirational for youngsters who want to play but are reluctant because of the little monetary benefit the sport offers in Pakistan .
A few departments offer good salaries to their players but most footballers earn so little that they are unable to support their families well .
Pakistan football team captain Saddam Hussain agrees to this .
" Yes , the basic issue is how much you value your players , " Saddam told ' The News ' in an interview .
" High status acts as a motivational factor .
We do n't have that , " he said .
" How can youth be inspired when they see Pakistan 's star players living in abject conditions ! " Saddam said .
" In India players are highly valued .
Look at India 's skipper Sunil Chhetri .
He has so many sponsors .
Players ' social status has its value and plays a key role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
He said that if a PSL-type football league was organised it would enable players to earn more money and build their status .
" This will have a huge impact on the sport , " said Saddam , who can play at any position .
He said he had played around ten matches against India but the series winning game against the arch-rivals at the Bangalore Stadium in 2014 was the most memorable one .
" It was a superb win as we beat India in the two-match series on goal-average , " Saddam recalled .
After losing the first game 0-1 Pakistan fought back strongly as they downed India 2-0 in their second and last outing of the two-match series to seal the series on goal-average .
Saddam and skipper Kaleemullah scored one goal apiece in that game .
Saddam has represented Pakistan in the previous three Asian Games .
He led the side in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia in which Pakistan beat Nepal to pull off their first win in 21 years in the Games history .
Saddam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iran , said he feels doubly energised when he plays against India .
" Playing against India is always special .
When you are loyal to your country and play under your flag you feel ecstatic , " he added .
To a question , Saddam said that pressure is definitely there during matches against India .
" Traditional rivalry counts .
Yes , pressure is there when we play against India .
But I play positive and disciplined football and God helps me , " said Saddam , who lives in Malir area of Karachi .
All his cousins play football but he is the only one who has played the game at the highest level .
He used to play for Malir Shaheen FC in the initial days of his career .
He toured India for the first time in 2011 when Jaffar Khan was Pakistan captain and Serbian Zavisa Milosavljevic was the coach .
Saddam has so far played 15 international matches for the senior team .
On that tour he was played as midfielder .
To a query , Saddam said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was offered a contract by Kyrgyzstan 's club Dordoi .
" That was an emotional moment , " Saddam recalled .
" I was very happy as it was a turning point of my career .
I myself was dealing the whole contract and also used to email Zavisa , who was Dordoi 's coach .
It was a new experience for me .
At that time Asim , who was working in the IT wing of the PFF , helped me , " said Saddam , who later also played for Isa Town FC of Bahrain and a club in Cyprus for two seasons .
He said that the last five years in which Pakistan football remained mostly suspended were the most difficult of his career .
" Obviously these five years have been very tough .
No leagues , no foreign tours , no professional leagues and definitely such things incurred huge damage on every player , " he added .
When asked about his experience of playing with foreign-based Pakistani footballers , Saddam said he had good experience of playing with them .
" Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are also my brothers .
Yes , I will appreciate if any outstanding foreign-based player plays for Pakistan team .
They should be much better as compared to the home-grown players .
For example if a foreign-based striker is better than Kaleem then yes you can give him a chance , " said Saddam , who practises at home these days .
He has purchased training equipment and is keeping himself fit amid the country-wide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic .
