" The time to buy is when there 's peak fear , not when everything is on the mend .
And I do n't think we 're at peak fear yet , " he says .
This will happen when cases multiply tenfold and a hundredfold , he adds .
" We 're going to see two or three rounds of peak fear so I 'm not feeling these are bargain buying opportunities yet .
"  As the pandemic develops , he is concerned that many governments are going too far and the policy response will cost lives beyond COVID-19 infections .
" What 's being encouraged is the wrong kind of carefulness .
Shuttering large swaths of the economy does n't strike me as the right way to do things , " he says , speaking to The Australian Financial Review from the US after his plans to travel to Australia were cancelled .

-- Rob Arnott , Research Affiliates  The US Federal Reserve has pledged to buy US Treasuries in unlimited amounts and a $US2 trillion ( $3 .
trillion ) rescue bill was agreed last week , which Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell described as " a wartime level of investment " .
" The problem I 'm seeing is this notion that fiscal and monetary responses can fix a virus-induced problem , " says Arnott .
" It 's interesting Japan and South Korea have both been able to reduce the rate of transmission or the rate of growth quite drastically and they 're doing things that cost a lot less than dumping a trillion dollars of stimulus .
"  He cites practical standards such as leaving the house with a mask , temperature checks in public venues , and mandatory home quarantine for infections to spare hospital capacity .
" A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .
" I do wish the Western European governments and US government would take a lesson from Japan on this .
"  Advertisement  In a way , markets have pinned down certain asset classes and securities with the same indiscriminate severity .
Value stocks , typically heavily dependent on supply chains , have been greeted with " let 's take that whole sector out and shoot it " .
So have emerging markets .
And yet the FAANG stocks ( Facebook , Amazon , Apple , Netflix , Google ) have fallen less sharply than the market .
Arnott thinks Wall Street has got the FAANGs wrong on the assumption that they 're disrupters and the downside is limited .
Disrupters get disrupted  " Now wait a second , not at those multiples they are n't .
At those multiples they 're extremely vulnerable and as advertising gets slashed , there go the FAANGs that are dependent on advertising .
"  It seems probable that computer acquisition budgets will get slashed in the unfolding recession , as will appetite to own the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're expensive .
The other thing is disrupters get disrupted : when you look at the ten largest cap tech stocks at the peak of the tech bubble , ten out of ten underperformed the market in the next decade , " he says .
At these levels , value looks interesting , and certainly emerging markets .
Australian and UK stocks are cheap if you expect dividends will eventually normalise .

" People say their health systems are terrible , they 're going to be steamrolled by the COVID virus and supply chain is essential to them .
In fact they 're part of the supply chain .
All of that is true , but I commented to one of my colleagues , forgive the language , but , ' disrupted supply chains , lousy health systems , many deaths from coronavirus , tourism drying up , what a shitstorm .
" Well wait a second , they have a shitstorm every other year ' .
They have less far to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot like kids , he suggests ; when they fall over they cry the hardest , but then they pick themselves up and carry on like they did before .
" We 'll still be putting the pieces back together , " he says of the developed world .
" If you can buy half the world 's GDP for seven or eight times the sustainable ten-year earnings , you buy it .
Could it grow faster than the developed world ? I view this as kind of an extraordinary opportunity .
"  But as always , nobody wants to hear it .
Financial markets are plagued by inertia , a frustration Arnott has commented on previously .

If that 's true and emerging markets are half US valuations , then that means emerging markets value is one-fourth US valuations .
" And that 's in fact the reality , " he declares .
Risk parity is a strategy that has been uniquely badly suited to this bear market .
The strategy loosely involves investing based on assumptions of risk , and adjusting for that among asset classes , using leverage to juice up the less risky assets .
Pain and leverage  " Risk parity flounders when correlations converge to one , " Arnott explains .
" The old cliche is that the only thing that goes up in a serious bear market is correlation .
We 're seeing that first-hand quite vividly .
"  Advertisement  Countercyclicals like commodities and metals have crashed alongside stocks , and bond prices too .
" We 've been taught to think that when the market craters , bond yields topple and prices go up .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not the first time risk parity has wobbled either .
Arnott recalls how the strategy performed following the European sovereign debt crisis of 2012 upon the tumbling of yields .
When US Treasury yields then went up to 2 per cent from 1 .
per cent it was devastating because risk parity had wrongly assumed they were low volatility .
Arnott considers volatility a friendly force .
He will be guided by how the big picture looks in five years ' time .
" Value stocks are getting crushed because they depend on supply chains .
You 've got the banking sector reeling from near zero interest rates , you 've got the energy sector reeling because of the oil war between the Saudis and the Russians and because of plunging demand .
And I think those strike me as temporary obstacles that are going to be big issues for the coming months , but not for the coming years .
"  When the timing is right , everyone will get back to travelling and enjoying restaurants .
