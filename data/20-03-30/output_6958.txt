The FIDO Alliance 's inaugural Authenticate conference has officially been postponed .
The event was originally scheduled to run from June 2-3 , but will now take place on November 9-10 .
The FIDO Alliance member plenary has similarly been rebooked for November 11-12 .
The venue will remain the same despite the scheduling shakeup .
Both Authenticate and the member plenary will still take place at the Motif Hotel in Seattle , Washington .
Of course , the news is not all that surprising given the scope of the COVID-19 pandemic .
Authenticate is simply the latest conference to feel the effects of the virus , which could pose a greater threat to an event in its first year of operations .
Authenticate was first announced in September , while the keynote speakers were unveiled in February .
The FIDO Alliance remains optimistic even though it can not yet rely on returning guests .
The organization claims that interest in Authenticate has been high since it was announced , and that registration had been trending towards a sellout prior to the onset of COVID-19 .
The event should be a success if that enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booked , and sponsorships have almost been sold out .
