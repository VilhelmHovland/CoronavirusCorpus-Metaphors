As MLB ponders post-virus season , players worry about health  As Major League Baseball and the players ' union contemplate various ways to create a schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucker Barnhart raised a concern that is surely shared by others around the sport : Could trying to cram in games , and maybe extend the season into late November or December , lead to injuries ?  " The player safety piece is a big thing , " Barnhart , a union representative , said Monday on a conference call with reporters .
That involves how many off-days are salvaged in 2020 , how many times teams are told to play in any given week and how 2021 could be affected if there is a shorter-than-usual offseason .
" Moving forward , I do n't think you can do things that are going to compromise the integrity of next season , as well .
What I mean by that is forcing the issue of getting so many games in that you risk injury , and you risk major injury to players , because you are trying to get in as many games as you can , " Barnhart said .
" This is all assumptions and thoughts from me specifically -- it 's not from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as players , " he continued .
" And if you ca n't do that , I think that would be where I personally would kind of draw the line .
"  That 's also top of mind for Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Jameson Taillon , who already has been ruled out for 2020 while recovering from a second reconstructive surgery on his right elbow .
He 's brought up the idea of trying to return if the season goes into November , but said that 's been " shut down pretty quickly .
"  Speaking more generally about the effect an altered season could have on guys around the majors , Taillon said : " This is a unique situation .
We 're going to have to be careful health-wise .
"  No one knows when baseball and other suspended sports will resume , because no one knows when life might return to normal in the aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak .
Three-quarters of a million people around the world have become infected and over 35,000 have died , according to a running count kept by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections and more than 2,500 deaths in the U .
Spring training was halted on March 12 ; opening day was supposed to be last week and wo n't happen any earlier than mid-May .
" At this point , it 's hard to say what can or should be done .
MLB is exhausting all of their brainpower and manpower , along with the 30 clubs , to come up with some ideas and what 's the best way to play a regular season in as many games as possible and get to a playoff scenario , " said Washington Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo , whose team has turned over the grounds of its spring facility to public testing for the coronavirus .
" As the commissioner said , we 're going to need to get creative , " Rizzo added .
" But beyond that , we 're just speculating on all of these things .
"  MLB and its players are hoping to complete initial discussions on scheduling by April 10 , and among the proposals under consideration : pushing back the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites and domes to avoid colder weather in many cities ; increasing doubleheaders to get more games in per week than usual ; playing games without spectators ; changing the postseason format .
" We 've been told , " said Taillon , a union rep , " there 's no such thing as a bad idea right now .
"  Texas Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus , also a union rep , described a recent call about scheduling options with other players this way : " We were basically talking about potential scenarios and how crazy this season will be , how challenging it will be .
"  Barnhart , for one , is realistic about what is going to drive the ultimate decisions about what a season might look like .
" It goes without saying that , as players , we want to play as many games ( as possible ) , not only because we love playing , but also we want to make as much money as possible .
That 's the God 's honest truth about it , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that .
So everybody wants to make money .
