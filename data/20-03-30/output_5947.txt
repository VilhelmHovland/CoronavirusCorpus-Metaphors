All members of the servicing team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , Aniruddha Basu , PR &amp; Corporate Communications , L&amp;T Technology Services  ( BW ) ( ABB )  ABB  ABB : COVID-19 Update  Monday , March 30 , 2020 11:15AM IST ( 5:45AM GMT )  Zurich , Switzerland :  ABB is constantly monitoring the pandemic situation around COVID-19 ( novel coronavirus ) .
The health and safety of its employees , customers and partners remains the company 's number one priority and we are working hard to assess and mitigate any risks .
Guidance issued on February 5 , 2020 , did not include impacts due to the coronavirus , the effects of which were mainly limited to China at that time .
We have subsequently experienced a decline in trading conditions due to the outbreak , further impacted by a weakening oil price .
The situation in China has stabilized following extensive government-led efforts in February and operations at ABB 's three main production hubs of Shanghai , Beijing and Xiamen have largely returned to normal .
While weakened customer demand in China , our second largest market , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been improving recently .
At the same time , COVID-19 has spread rapidly to the western hemisphere in March , resulting in governments and customers adopting containment measures that have material economic consequences across the globe .
Q1 2020 impact  Although it is not yet possible to determine the exact impact of COVID-19 on ABB 's first quarter results , ABB expects revenues to decline in all its businesses relative to a year ago , while orders are somewhat less impacted .
The Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation business , which was already facing significant end-market headwinds from the automotive sector , remains challenged , with first quarter orders and revenues both expected to decline by more than 20 percent year-on-year .
Operational EBITA margins are also expected to decline in all ABB 's businesses , burdened by lower volumes , partly offset by self-help efforts .
Self-help initiatives are aided by the framework ABB already has in place to implement ABB 's Operating System ( ABB-OS ) .
At the same time , the company is significantly intensifying mitigation measures and actively reducing all non-essential costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on serving their customers while sustaining cash flow .
2020 outlook  Each of our businesses are closely monitoring current and potential effects of the outbreak .
Currently , the majority of ABB 's production facilities remain fully or partly operational and supply chain impacts have been minimal .
However , the outbreak is expected to continue to have an impact globally , potentially creating disruption across production sites and further curtailing product demand , project and service activity .
In addition to short-cycle headwinds impacting all our businesses , we expect project business to be dampened by the weaker outlook for oil and gas capital expenditures and a fall-off in cruise ship activity .
By contrast , transport projects look more resilient and the outlook for select high growth areas , such as data centers , remains robust .
Systems and service activity is curtailed by restrictions to cross-border travel for specialized sales and service engineers .
ABB is accelerating and extending its mitigation measures ahead of what looks set to be a difficult second quarter , with a focus on adjusting capacity to meet reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil price decline , ABB is no longer providing financial guidance for full year 2020 .
ABB continues to work toward the delivery of transformation milestones , including the divestment of Power Grids which is targeted for completion at the end of the second quarter .
Despite short-term disruptions , ABB is confident in the underlying resilience of its businesses and operating model , and that its short-term liquidity needs are well covered by the financial framework it has in place .
" I would like to take this opportunity during these extraordinary times to thank the whole ABB team for sticking together and handling this global pandemic with the highest level of professionalism , " said ABB CEO Bj ? rn Rosengren .
" The health and safety of all stakeholders , above all our employees , remains our number one priority at this moment in time , while we also try our utmost to secure business continuity .
We remain prepared for any scenario and will take strong action to mitigate the impact for our customers , shareholders and employees .
"  " Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABB have decided to voluntarily take an immediate 10 percent reduction in board compensation and salary for the duration of the crisis , with the view to extend this strong sign of solidarity to other senior management levels within the company .
We must stay strong together for the whole of ABB and for our society .
The money saved through the compensation and salary reductions will be donated by ABB towards efforts aimed at fighting the impacts of the Coronavirus crisis , " said the CEO .
" After many of my first meetings since joining ABB earlier this year , my impressions of the company and its people are very positive .
ABB is a strong company , with a tremendous spirit and the right products and technology to drive the positive and sustainable development of the world in the future , " Rosengren added .
