Our duty as people will promote safety , save lives  At midnight on Wednesday March 26 , 2020 , New Zealanders , for the first time in our history , entered a period of compulsory self-isolation and a lockdown of our communities .
This requires us for at least a month to stay in our homes , with a few exceptions such as going to purchase groceries or necessary visits to the doctor .
This will impact hugely on us in terms of our lifestyle and normal routines , and , for many , the ability to earn a living .
It will impact hugely on our economy at a level not seen since the Great Depression .
Drastic and unprecedented  The measures are drastic and unprecedented , but they are in response to a similarly unprecedented risk -- the unchecked spread of the COVID-19 virus .
People widely accept the need for it if we are to stop the virus infecting and taking the lives of thousands of people , as it has in other countries .
The government has acted as it needed to , and now it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is being asked of us .
I urge everyone in our communities to treat the situation with the seriousness that it requires .
Please stay at home other than when you need to go out for essential needs such as groceries or to see a doctor .
Maintain physical distance of at least two metres from anyone outside your family group .
Follow the guidelines provided by the government and we will get through this crisis together .
Businesses all over New Zealand are feeling the impact of Covid-19 RNZ Picture ( clockwise from top ) Auckland , Wellington , Christchurch and Dunedin  Seek trusted information  At this time , it is important to have a trusted source of official information .
The government 's covid19 .
govt .
website has been set up to provide this .
It has all the information you need , including guidelines for self-isolation , how to access financial assistance , and what to do if you feel unwell .
I encourage you to visit it regularly and share the information there widely .
Again , I encourage you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families and communities .
The period ahead will be hard for individuals , families and communities .
Anxiety and stress levels for many will be high , particularly for people who have lost jobs , and businesses which have lost their income .
Self-isolation important  We know , however , that the pandemic cycle will come to an end , and that this will happen earlier and without the loss of thousands of lives if we stop the widespread transmission of COVID-19 by self-isolating .
Please stay safe , stay at home and be supportive of others .
Physical isolation needs to be accompanied by increased social interaction by phone or internet , especially for the elderly and those living alone .
These are the most challenging times of our generation , but we will get through them by working together and supporting each other .
