President Donald Trump accused hospitals on Sunday of hoarding ventilators that are in scarce supply across the United States as the coronavirus spreads , adding any hospitals not using the devices must release them .
Trump , whose critics have accused him of trying to deflect blame over his handling of the crisis , did not cite any evidence to back his accusation that hospitals were hoarding the devices .
It was also unclear which medical facilities he was referring to .
" We have some healthcare workers , some hospitals .
hoarding equipment including ventilators , " Trump said at the White House following a meeting with corporate executives , including from U .
Medical Group .
" We have to release those ventilators -- especially hospitals that are never going to use them .
"  His remarks came just two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build much-needed ventilators for coronavirus patients after he accused the largest U .
automaker of " wasting time " during negotiations .
Trump was more upbeat about GM on Sunday , saying the auto giant was " working very hard .
" The Trump administration has been under pressure to ramp up the production of ventilators , which are essential to saving the lives of patients who develop complications with COVID-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus .
Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , estimated in an interview with CNN on Sunday that the pandemic could cause between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the United States .
Speaking earlier on Sunday , Dr .
Deborah Birx , a member of Trump 's coronavirus task force , told NBC television 's " Meet the Press " program that the administration was asking U .
governors and mayors to know " where your anesthesia ventilators are .
"  On March 25 , Trump issued an executive order to prevent hoarding of essential medical equipment to deal with the coronavirus pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized the U .
government to directly target hoarders , who can be criminally prosecuted .
But with the infection rate rising rapidly , Reuters has documented shortages of vital protective equipment in hospitals in hard-hit New York , where healthcare workers are hiding supplies such as facemasks from colleagues in other departments .
As supply chains break down or delay delivery of vital equipment , nurses say they are locking away or hiding N95 respirator masks , surgical masks and other supplies that are prone to going missing if left unattended for long .
