Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk updates the media on the COVID-19 pandemic at the Royal International Convention Centre on Sunday  The latest deaths came as Queensland recorded 31 new cases of the virus , bringing the state total to 656 .
" We know that we are going to continue to see the incidents happening , and I think everyone needs to realise this person has a family and friends and loved ones , it is indeed a tragedy , " Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Sunday .
But the Premier said that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a change in the government 's response in the short term .
" We are not out of the woods yet , " she said .
" It is encouraging that so many people in Queensland are doing the right thing , but I 'd just remind everyone that this is a marathon .
" It 's not a short race that we 're undertaking and it needs everyone to stay the distance .
"  The Premier reiterated the ban on gatherings of more than 10 people in a house , saying there would be " no Easter holidays " this year and urging people not to visit relatives .
The state 's Chief Health Officer , Dr Jeannette Young , said she had the power to order gatherings of 10 or more to disperse but special dispensation would be made for people living with up to 10 under one roof .
Queensland 's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young says she has the power to break up family gatherings is people do n't heed social distancing rules .
Dr Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to see a flattening of the numbers in the next two weeks if everyone continued to practise social distancing .
" Although we have not got any significant transmission locally of COVID-19 , we do know that it 's occurring in Sydney and to a lesser extent in Melbourne , " she said .
In line with new national rules , 86 people arrived in Brisbane from overseas after midnight on Saturday , sparking a mandatory quarantine for 14 days .
That will happen at two hotels near Brisbane airport , the Novotel and the Ibis .
Dr Young said planning would ensure more hotels and facilities were available if those numbers grew .
Looking to the past to plan for the future  Queensland is set to take a leaf out of a 100-year-old playbook and convert Brisbane 's RNA showgrounds into a makeshift hospital if the number of COVID-19 cases overwhelmed hospitals .
Under the plan , the showground 's facilities , notably the relatively new Royal International Convention Centre , could be rapidly transformed into a makeshift hospital for COVID-19 patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Convention centre 's spaces which could be converted into makeshift hospitals , next to images of the RNA being used as a field hospital during the 1919 Spanish flu epidemic in Brisbane .
The Brisbane Convention Centre at South Bank is also being considered for this purpose as are a number of other sites around the state .
The plan is similar to one carried out in 1919 when the Spanish Flu epidemic reached Brisbane and the RNA site was used as a tent hospital for months .
Queensland Health Minister Steven Miles said authorities were planning now in the hope the measures would n't be needed .
" If we experience a severe or extreme outbreak then we have contingency plans in place to use spaces like this one , " Dr Miles said .
" Of course we hope it never comes to that , but it should give people confidence that we have plans in place for every single possible scenario .
"  RNA General Manager Brenden Christou said the association was happy to be involved in the contingency plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different to what they were in 1918 , and we can lend a hand if needed , " he said .
" We had to do something similar in 2011 running the flood evacuation centre so we are experienced in events like these , but let 's hope that 's not required .
