Opinion  We can not wait two weeks - we must go into lockdown now for the sake of our healthcare workers  By John Dwyer  March 29 , 2020 -- 11 .
New restrictions on social movement aimed at reducing the spread of coronavirus appear to have resonated with Australians over the past week .
But many have still not heeded the message , even as the number of person-to-person transmissions within the community rises .
We can not wait any longer .
The government must enforce a full lockdown to stop the exponential growth in cases of COVID-19 that is putting the healthcare system - and its workers - at risk .
Based on our COVID-19 modelling , we expect to see enormous pressures descend on our hospitals and their staff in the next few weeks -- and it could last for months , possibly colliding with a bad influenza season , which in itself can demand hundreds of ICU beds .
Our medical workers are doing everything they can in a dangerous environment -- in Spain , medical personnel make up 13 .
per cent of the country 's 47,500 cases of coronavirus .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least we can do is take steps to reduce the number of seriously ill patients needing care .
This will help protect our health professionals and , of course , ourselves .
Centrelink queues have stretched around blocks in Australian cities Credit:Jason South  Not everyone has accepted the personal responsibility required .
There are still too many crowds in our supermarkets for shopping to be safe -- same for the long queues for Centrelink .
Scenes of large groups picnicking in parks and on the lawns above Bondi Beach are also cause for concern .
In the early days of the disease , the virus was spread mainly by people entering the country from overseas .
That threat is diminishing with time and quarantine measures .
We now face an even bigger threat - the sustained spread of the virus from person to person .
The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is doubling every three days and this is being driven by person-to-person contact in the resident population .
The time from infection to the development of symptoms averages five to six days , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days or more .
It is therefore very likely that we have hundreds , perhaps thousands , of Australians , many of whom may have few symptoms , spreading the disease and not being detected in our current testing regimens .
We wo n't be able to judge the success of the current restrictions for another two to three weeks .
However , I fear that even if they are being strictly adhered to ( they 're not ) , these restrictions leave us with numerous opportunities for continued community spread .
And , we do n't have the luxury of waiting two weeks .
When talking about exponential growth , two to three weeks is a long , long time .
Loading  We have not done all that we can .
Not every job is " essential " , as the Prime Minister suggested .
We have too many still working in situations where social distancing is difficult ( for example , the construction industry ) .
The recommendations regarding hairdressing would have been laughable if the matter was not so serious .
Extending contact time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) sent a really bad message .
The greater the time spent with someone carrying COVID-19 , the greater the likelihood of infection .
The economic consequences of full lockdown are of course very significant and not to be taken lightly -- shutting down 90 per cent of our economy is not an easy decision to make .
But the health and economic outcomes for Australia will surely be better if we move quickly to lockdown than by allowing another week to pass , before finally acknowledging the inevitable .
Better to do it now for a limited period when we can make a real dent in the spread of the virus than a few weeks from now , when it will be so much harder and take so much longer .
I have been contacted this week by many doctors and nurses who have real fear that the scenes of overwhelmed hospitals in Spain , Italy and the US could play out here .
We need to do a lot more testing and our capacity to do so is improving .
But I know I speak for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that we need to move , immediately , to the lockdown stage many other countries have implemented .
No more vacillating , we need to act today so that at least we can say that at this point we did all that is possible to minimise the spread of the virus , the need for hospital care and the loss of life .
