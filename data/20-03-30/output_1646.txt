Fact checking matters , now more than ever  Ariel Riera  Olivia Vicol  March 27th , 2020  Fact checking matters , now more than ever  As the world faces a pandemic on a scale not seen for generations , we are seeing an accompanying deluge of online misinformation : about the coronavirus itself and its origins , about the respiratory disease ( COVID-19 ) that it causes , about dubious ' cures ' and drugs to treat this illness , and about the extent of governments ' responses to it .
At this time when reliable information is more crucial than ever , fact checkers Ariel Riera , Research &amp; Impact Manager at Chequeado , and Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol , Researcher at Full Fact , explain how they work and the sort of impact they can have .
A growing movement  In 2014 , the first Global Fact-Checking Summit gathered around 40 international fact checkers in the lecture theaters of the LSE .
The first meeting of its kind , it set out to test the possibility of a common framework , amidst a new and diverse audience spanning across non-profits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in its own right .
Today in 2020 , the International Fact-checking Network ( IFCN ) comprises 78 active signatories , and another 12 under renewal .
" Fake news " has entered common parlance , even being pronounced word of the year in 2017 .
During the current coronavirus pandemic , the World Health Organization has warned of a growing ' infodemic ' : " an over-abundance of information -- some accurate and some not -- that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it .
"  Overall , the world has come to realize the key role of quality information : worth caring for , worth sharing wisely , and above all , worth defending .
This is what fact checkers set out to do .
Why does this matter ?  On some level , it matters because we are all prone to believing things which are not true .
To begin with , our default position is to trust , not doubt .
From 1940s research into the propagation of war rumours , to recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repetition increases the extent to which a claim is believed .
Other biases also apply .
Psychologists found that " fluent " stimuli such as pictures , which are easy to process , are more likely to be believed .
Above all , there is motivated reasoning .
We tend to believe things which conform to our worldviews , and doubt those that challenge us .
How do fact checkers work ?  Fact-checkers aim to reduce the spread of misinformation .
We start by tracing a claim , looking at the evidence behind it , and consulting experts to understand each topic .
We contact the claimant to require clarifications and , where needed , we seek to correct the record .
Our formats vary widely .
Fact checkers usually publish long-form articles , or ' fact checks ' .
But some initiatives also produce GIFs , videos , or even short WhatsApp audio notes , in an attempt to make their work accessible to audiences everywhere .
Research shows that how we communicate is just as important as what we say , because it affects our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us .
Beyond the diversity of outputs however , we share a commitment to accuracy , and there is some indication of success .
Though getting claimants to correct the record can be a challenge , most fact checkers can point to examples of real impact on public debate .
Getting claimants to correct the record  In 2015 , the candidate for president of Argentina , Mauricio Macri , claimed that his party had not had a single accusation of corruption during eight years running the city of Buenos Aires .
Argentina-based fact checking organisation Chequeado proved that to be incorrect .
Pointing to the fact that some corruption investigations had been opened against members of Macri 's party , Chequeado rated the claim as False , and presented the fact check in other media outlets to increase its reach .
Days after , Gabriela Michetti , candidate for the vice-presidency for the same party , noted : " I saw Chequeado 's article , so we corrected the claim and we never repeated it again " .
In the UK , Full Fact asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish figures on mental health provision , after it found that claims made by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care were based on unpublished data .
Not only did the intervention open existing data to the public , but it also prompted the collection of new data .
Following the fact check , the NHS also decided to reinstate a survey on mental health crisis care provision in A&amp;E .
Beyond examples from individual fact checking organisations , a young body of research has set out to capture the impact of fact checkers on public debate .
An experiment conducted in the US , for instance , found that legislators warned against the potentially deleterious effects of being found to have made inaccurate claims , were also less likely to make them in practice .
Another experiment , which examined the speeches of candidates in the US presidential election , found that statements which had been fact checked were less likely to occur than those which had not .
Fact checkers can also spearhead a culture of accuracy , by working with stakeholders in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Second-generation fact checkers " not only publish but also act , using systemic interventions to improve the accountability framework by seeking public corrections or raising issues with the appropriate body , for example .
They also carry out a range of initiatives , from working with public information providers to improve the supply of information , to delivering training sessions to journalists , or even running media literacy interventions with students .
For instance , our review of media and information literacy initiatives found that everyone can get better at spotting fact from fiction .
From interventions in schools , which teach children how to determine accuracy by simulating newsroom environments , to short online games for adults , everyone has the potential to be educated .
No doubt , this is a collaborative project which will require working with organisations across the education and media .
But fact checkers can turn information spotting from an organisational tactic into a public good .
Where next ?  Africa Check , Chequeado , and Full Fact are actively looking for research evidence , in an attempt to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched a joint research program that includes briefings for practitioners available in English , French , and Spanish .
No doubt , this is a marathon , not a sprint .
We have a long way to go to capture the impact of fact checkers on public debate in more depth , and to redirect the academic gaze away from Anglo-centric audiences , to those across the Global South , including Africa or Latin America .
And yet , we hope that colleagues around the world put this knowledge into practice and help to stop the spread of misinformation .
The Covid-19 ' infodemic , ' raging on as we write this piece , makes it clear that quality information matters , and the fight starts now .
