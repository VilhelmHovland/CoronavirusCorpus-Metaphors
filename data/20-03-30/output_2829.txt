Suraju said the group was also touched by the recent outcry from Sowore over alleged plans to endanger his life .
Suraju said , " The Federal Government can better guarantee protection for Sowore and other citizens by issuing a stern and clear warning to officials of government to refrain from any form of political or unwarranted arrest of citizens under the current situation .
