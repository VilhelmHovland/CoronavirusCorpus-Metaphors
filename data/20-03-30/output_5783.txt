Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi stating that the sudden lockout announced by the central government has created immense panic and confusion .
In a letter to the prime minister on Sunday , the Wayanad MP highlighted the plight of the poor -- especially migrant workers .
He also asked to follow steps other than complete lockdown announced by few developed nations to tackle the deadly COVID-19 .
" It is critical for us to understand that India 's conditions are unique .
We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy , " he said .
Gandhi said the number of poor people in India who are daily wagers is too large to unilaterally shut down all economic activities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic .
" The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from COVID-19 , " he feared .
" The sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion , he said , adding factories , small industries and construction sites have closed , and tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home states .
The Gandhi scion said the labourers have been rendered vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services , " Gandhi said .
" It is important that we help such sections find shelter and provide them with money directly into their bank accounts to help them tide over the next few months , he added .
The Congress leader underlined that the complete lockdown will certainly leave millions of youths without jobs and they will have no option but to rush to their villages .
This will increase the risk of infecting their parents and the elderly population living in villages .
" This will result in a catastrophic loss of life , " he noted .
Meanwhile , Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing a 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19 .
The Congress leader has accused the prime minister of not giving people enough time to prepare before the lockdown was imposed .
" Na Hee Tab Taiyari Thee Na Hee Ab Taiyari Hai , Tab Bhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither there was a preparation then ( apparently referring to demonetization ) , nor now .
That time also the common man was at the receiving end , so is today ) , " Tharoor wrote on Twitter .
