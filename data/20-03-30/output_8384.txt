Pasadena Unified 's grab-and-go meal program was briefly suspended Monday after officials determined a kitchen employee may have contracted coronavirus , though the case is not yet confirmed .
Officials were still waiting on test results by Monday evening .
The service will resume on Tuesday , officials announced later in the day , after Food Service Director Elizabeth Powell secured a new vendor , Best Way Sandwiches , to prepare the food in its kitchens , according to Pasadena Unified spokeswoman Hilda Horvath .
Best Way Sandwiches will provide food for at least the next week , Pasadena spokeswoman Lisa Derderian said in an interview .
And , instead of using the previous employees -- who may have been exposed to the coronavirus through their colleague -- city staffers and workers in the Pasadena Convention Center Operating Company will disburse the premade meals at the district 's seven school sites .
The latter group already had some practice : It had been distributing food over the weekend alongside employees from the Rose Bowl Operating Company .
Ultimately , the hope is to reopen Pasadena Unified 's central kitchen after a thorough cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horvath said .
Officials learned an employee may have been exposed to the coronavirus on Sunday , after they had already prepared all of Monday 's meals , Pasadena Department of Human Services Director Brenda Harvey Williams told the City Council on Monday .
All of that food had to be thrown away and , in a late night email on Sunday , Superintendent Brian McDonald told community members the district would n't be able to provide the premade meals for the day .
At the time , the break was indefinite , though officials hoped to quickly get it up and running again .
" We know that this may cause hardship to our families and are working with neighboring school districts to provide meals to PUSD students , " Superintendent Brian McDonald said in a statement posted on the district 's web site .
The district received a report " that there is a possibility that a PUSD employee at one of our central kitchens may be diagnosed with COVID-19 , " according to the statement .
The diagnosis was not confirmed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district is carrying out " extensive cleaning and sanitizing of our kitchens and facilities to minimize any risk of surface transmission , " he said .
The disruption came shortly after the Pasadena City Council approved a one-time payment of $105,400 to the district so it could expand its meal service to include weekends .
Previously , they could only provide meals on weekdays .
At $4 .
per meal , Williams said it would allow the district to serve breakfast and lunch on weekends for about one month .
While the council did not approve any expansions to its various food programs on Monday , which include the school district , the Pasadena Senior Center and area food banks , officials directed City Manager Steve Mermell to look at ways the city 's role could be expanded in the coming weeks .
