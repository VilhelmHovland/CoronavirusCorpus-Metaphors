Share this :  The watering holes along the steep lanes not far from Hong Kong 's glittering Central financial district may be creeping with the novel coronavirus .
There have been at least five cases of people becoming ill after patronizing bars and eateries in the Lan Kwai Fong ( LKF ) bar district , a popular haunt for locals and visitors .
Alarm over the new cases may further slash the income of establishments in the area , where the still-unfolding pneumonic outbreak has already scared away diners and revelers .
The usual crowds disappeared at the end of January , when the first resident came down with the contagious disease caused by the Covid-19 virus , which originated in China 's Wuhan .
A Hong Kong man who tested positive yesterday had partied in LKF during the incubation period , and three women taken ill by the pathogen had also gone for drinks and meals in the popular entertainment area within the past week , according to the city 's Center for Health Protection .

Government pathologists are investigating whether the virus is being transmitted between people in bars and restaurants , and they will also examine the travel history of those infected .
The suspicion is that foreign visitors who are asymptomatic transmit the virus or infect tableware and surfaces , exposing the next patron to the pathogen .
Early on in the city 's outbreak , a cluster of cases was linked to a family 's hotpot party gathering , and there have been other virus scares involving banquets .
Also , three branches of a well-known gym in Central , including one in LKF , are shutting their doors for 14 days due to visits by two infected members .
The Pure Fitness company had initially said the three branches had been deep-cleaned and would remain open but it quickly reversed the decision , putting out a statement about the temporary closures .

Health officials have renewed their calls for " social distancing , " even though the city 's infection curve has flattened since the beginning March , when Europe and the United States became the new hotspots .
Still , Hong Kong saw an alarming surge in new cases -- 48 within 24 hours , mostly involving overseas visitors and Hongkongers returning home -- bringing the total to 256 as of Friday .
The tally is still low compared with countries across Asia such as Singapore ( 345 ) .

The HKU researchers , from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control , said the rate of infection in the city -- an average of how many people are infected by a person who tests positive for the virus -- has risen above one in recent days .
" This is the worst time to become complacent because we 're at the highest risk since this began .
It is absolutely critical , especially as we have this influx of Hong Kong returnees starting from a few days ago and may continue for the next few days .
We must be extra vigilant , " said Professor Gabriel Leung , head of HKU 's medical school .
