NCAA to give spring sport athletes extra year of eligibility  The NCAA will permit spring sport athletes -- such as baseball , softball and lacrosse players -- who had their seasons shortened by the coronavirus outbreak to have an additional year of eligibility .
The NCAA Division I Council voted Monday to give spring sport athletes regardless of their year in school a way to get back the season they lost , but did not guarantee financial aid to the current crop of seniors if they return to play next year .

The Division I Council is made up of college sports administrators representing all 32 D-I conferences , plus two members of the student-athlete advisory committee .
How much scholarship money will be made available to each athlete whose college career would have ended this spring will be determined by the athlete 's school .
The amount could range from nothing to as much as the athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the fact that this does not avoid substantially difficult circumstances , but what we felt was important was to localize decision-making and to ensure that we were as permissive as possible , " said Penn athletic director Grace Calhoun , who is council chairwoman .
Schools also will have the ability to use the NCAA 's Student Assistance Fund to pay for scholarships for students who take advantage of the additional eligibility flexibility in 2020-21 .
Roster and scholarship limits will be adjusted next season to fit returning athletes along with incoming freshmen .
Katie Hoeg , an All-American lacrosse player at North Carolina , said she has a teaching and coaching job lined up after she graduates this spring , but now plans to return for another season as a graduate student .
" I 'm choosing my passion , " she said .
" I ca n't imagine ending my lacrosse career the way this season is going .
I was pretty hopeful this would be a possibility .
I 'm really excited this decision has been made .

Schools will be allowed to apply for waivers to restore one of those seasons for any athlete who competed while eligible in the spring season shortened by COVID-19 in 2020 .
But after the 2021 spring season , scholarship and roster limits will apply to those athletes .
