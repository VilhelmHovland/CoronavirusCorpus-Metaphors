Let 's race 2 ? NASCAR forced to consider schedule shakeup  The Indianapolis 500 is now a summer event .
The Monster Mile could be set for a monster-sized NASCAR weekend spectacle of racing .
And a supersized shakeup of the schedule looms whenever NASCAR and IndyCar resume in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic .
The Indianapolis 500 was postponed Thursday until Aug .
23 and wo n't run on Memorial Day weekend for the first time since 1945 .
The Indy 500 was positioned as the middle race of a Triple Crown of racing on Memorial Day that kicked off the biggest day of motorsports with Formula One 's Grand Prix of Monaco and ended with NASCAR 's Coca-Cola 600 .
The race now falls outside of May for the first time in its 104-year history .
" With a number of postponed sporting events being rescheduled in the summer and early fall , it 's frankly very difficult to find three consecutive weekends as we traditionally have in May , " Penske Entertainment Corp .
President and CEO Mark Miles said .
The Indy 500 now shares the race weekend calendar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IndyCar will serve as the opening act for the NASCAR Cup race at Dover International Speedway , that track better known as the Monster Mile that has suffered with dwindling attendance and had its dates shuffled around the schedule .
" The good news is they can sit in the grandstand and watch the Indy 500 and stay and watch our race live , " Dover President Mike Tatoian said .
" What a perfect day that would be for a motorsports fan .
Watch it live on your phone , sit in the grandstand and enjoy a hot dog .
"  Chew on this , Dover still does n't have a new date for its May race , one of seven NASCAR weekends already postponed before the series is scheduled to resume May 9 at Martinsville Speedway .
As each confined weekend ticks off , and the death count from coronavirus up to about 1,200 , that target seems more and more unlikely .
" We intend to race all our 36 points races as well as the All-Star event , " NASCAR President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular point we 're looking broadly about what our options are .
At this particular point , we would like to finish the season at Phoenix and keep the playoff portion intact .
With that said , it will require a lot of different opportunities for us to look at .
"  So what will happen ?  NASCAR had promised a shakeup of its staid schedule in 2021 , but the crisis may force the stock car series to offer a sneak peak the rest of the summer .
Mid-week races , night races , doubleheaders , nothing is off the starting grid when it comes to potential scenarios to squeeze in the remaining 32 Cup races .
NASCAR offered a break with tradition in June with Pocono Raceway set to hold a NASCAR Cup Series twin bill , with one race on Saturday , one on Sunday .
The test run for ' 21 could now be forced on at least another track -- with Dover the top target -- before this season is over .
" The perfect scenario would be to have enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tatoian said .
" If that 's not possible , it would have to be in the form of a doubleheader .
"  Let 's race two !  There is a doubleheader scheduled because of coronavirus with a twist , an IndyCar/NASCAR twin bill at Indianapolis Motor Speedway .
The IndyCar road course race will now be run on July 4 , a day before NASCAR races at The Brickyard in an unprecedented doubleheader between the series .
NASCAR set a self-imposed April 1 deadline to release the 2021 schedule , and that wo n't happen , not with 2020 races in so much flux .
The series would like to send a proposed schedule to teams within the next week or two that would shed light on what 's ahead .
One obvious solution , moving the June 7 race at Michigan International Speedway to an Aug .
9 doubleheader at the track to free up another weekend .
" We are working with Fox and with NBC to understand what windows might be available , " Phelps said .
" That will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure .
But both partners have shown great willingness to try to work with us , obviously we with the other sports to find windows to get back to racing in our case .
"  Unlike NASCAR , which informed its staff Tuesday that pay cuts will be imposed across the company until the series returns to racing , it 's business as usual without layoffs or salary cuts at Dover .
" We 're a public company and we run a really lean staff , " Tatoian said .
" It 's something we monitor very closely .
But the good news is , we 're a small , lean team and we 're a company that 's not carrying any debt .
Right now , we 're holding pretty firm , which is great .
