REUTERS  This is what happens when the inquiring mind of a scientist is combined with the sheer boredom of working from home .
An Australian astrophysicist had to go to a hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose during an attempt to invent a necklace that stops people from touching their faces during the coronavirus pandemic .
Daniel Reardon explained to The Guardian : " I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field , and we wore magnets on our wrists , then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face .
A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that .
" Reardon tried clipping the magnets to his earlobe and nostril but admitted " things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril .
" The two magnets stuck together inside his nose , then he attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them -- but they also got stuck .
" At this point I ran out of magnets , " he said .
Reardon 's partner took him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her colleagues to laugh at me , " he said .
The magnets were successfully removed .
