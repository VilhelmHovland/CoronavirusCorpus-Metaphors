As mourners gathered to remember Johnnie B .

" We had to ask family who knew my father , knew us all of their lives , to step out of the building , " Jermaine Wilson said .
" It was hard .

( Photo : Jermaine Wilson/SUBMITTED )  Memorializing the dead in Delaware has become a task of exclusion for grieving families and some confusion for funeral directors .
As of now , Delaware has seen relatively few deaths from the coronavirus pandemic , but otherwise , death continues .
So rituals of socialization and mourning are evolving to a time of greater personal isolation , straining families .
Delay is a consideration some are making , but most are moving forward with downsized services , local funeral directors said .
" It is pushing us to the point where there is a lack of dignity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Rachel Mealey supervisor at the family-owned Mealey Funeral Homes and Crematory in Wilmington .
LATEST UPDATES : Complete coverage of the coronavirus in Delaware  Mealey 's business is currently interpreting government rules to limit services to 10 family members , a huge stretch for mourners whose immediate family can easily outnumber the limit , she said .
The changing rules and varying interpretations of these rules have put pressure on funeral home directors , some of whom have in recent weeks allowed 10 before allowing 50 before going back to allowing only 10 .
Some currently are interpreting Delaware 's social distancing guidelines to allow 50 gathered , some say it 's 10 .
Directors also have different interpretations about whether staff are included in that number .
Mealey said from a safety standpoint , she thinks 10 should only be allowed , but said it would help the process if that were clearly articulated by the state .
" They are leaving us open to arguments by families , " Mealey said .
Ernest " Trippi " Congo II of Congo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandate to allow 50 people and that practice has been blessed by the governor 's office .
" It 's not the best , but it is better than 10 , " said Congo , who is also a Wilmington City Council member .
Last week , Jonathan Starkey , spokesman for Gov .
John Carney , said his office was working on more specific guidance for funeral homes .
Either way , it 's hard for families , directors said .
" How they can honor their loved ones and stay within the bounds of the law has been stressful for the family , " said Justen Wright of House of Wright Mortuary with locations in Delaware and New Jersey .

The limit was 100 people then .
In the 81 years that preceded his death , Johnnie Wilson served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deacon at Mt .
Sinai Missionary Baptist Church south of Wilmington for decades and founded Wilson 's Lighting and Shade Center , which has remained in business on Union Street since the 1970s .
He was the youngest of 11 brothers and sisters raised in Jackson , Mississippi .
He has a large , close family .
His son counted 81 first cousins in Delaware alone .
Hitting a limit of 100 was already a " challenge , " he said .
Then , days before the service , the number became 50 .
They managed through a series of phone calls , prioritizing the closest of family and talking to mourners in the sanctuary .
Faith and understanding were important too , said Jermaine Wilson .
" They knew it was n't personal , but I 'm sure it hurt many of them , " he said .
Johnnie B .
Wilson ( Photo : family/submitted )  Those who left were able to watch the service on a livestream outside the sanctuary , which is becoming a more common tool for local funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president of Doherty Funeral Homes , said before the restrictions , he did n't see a market for offering online broadcasting of funerals , though many in the industry have .
Since the lockdown , he said he 's used video equipment in at least eight services .
" Funeral business is an old school thing , " he said .
But that 's changing these days , funeral directors said .
Planning meetings for loved ones ' final remembrance , which often involve several family members , are being held partially online .
Services must be private , so some obituaries no longer list the time and place of the memorial .
Hand sanitizer has taken the place of guest books in some cases .
Mourners , traditionally intimate with their loved ones during funerals , are being advised to remain distant .
" Hugging and kissing comes natural when people are grieving , " Congo said .
" But we do suggest to keep the distancing at the forefront .
"  The hardest thing for Doherty is watching families try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with the deceased as a way of figuring out who can be involved .
It often excludes co-workers , close friends , friends of the children .
" It is something we do n't want to do by any means , but we have to do , " Doherty said .
The point of such difficult restrictions is to stem the need for more funerals as the number of coronavirus cases surges .
In places where the pandemic is further evolved , funerals have been postponed as new cases and casualties mount .
In the future , Doherty said he can see a situation where the local funeral industry runs short of things like masks and other protective gear .
He said he has n't allowed his mind to dwell on the grim scenes elsewhere and what mass casualties could look like for the industry in Delaware .
For now , he feels obligated to protect the public as much as he can through his business , which has limited services to 10 , not including staff .
" We have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" For their protection and the public 's protection .
"  The Catholic Diocese of Wilmington is no longer holding funeral masses , and graveside services are limited to ten people , including the priest or deacon .
Individual cemeteries have also augmented their operation to how they interpret the governor 's public-gathering limits .
Delaware Veterans Memorial Cemetery temporarily halted military honors the day before his service .
Before he was placed in the ground , there was no flag-draped casket , no chapel salute .
Mourners sat in their cars as Taps played to an empty cemetery and Johnnie Wilson was transferred from the funeral home 's hearse to a vehicle for the cemetery .
" There was no other service , " Jermaine Wilson said .
" I 'm going to try to not let that bother me .
