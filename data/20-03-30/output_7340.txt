It 's difficult for special education students and their families on a good day , and it 's even harder now during the " new normal " of coronavirus .
There are silver linings , though , and those are what Autism expert and psychotherapist Dr .

" It is important to remember to stay positive , " said Nunez , who is the founder and director of Breakthrough Interventions based in Denver .
" We can not control what is going on in the outside world , but you can control your mindset and what is going on at home .
" Our kids with autism feel nonverbal stressors of the outside world much more than we do so it is really important to no bring that stress and anxiety into the house .
It will be a downward spiral ; kids will start behaving out , parents will get frustrated , etc .
"  Nunez suggests first and foremost to get your child on a schedule .
" The parents are trying to focus on getting through the day , " Nunez said .
" So , a schedule is important .
For children with autism and really , with any needs , love the predictability and love to know what is coming next .
And keep it consistent .
A parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not .
"  There are many schedule templates online to help with this effort , but Nunez said to make sure to include times we take for granted , such as meals , end of day , bathroom breaks and snacks .

" Sometimes , kids wo n't self-initiate to go to the bathroom on their own .
"  Nunez said not to schedule any activity longer than 45 minutes and keep activities to 30 minute-intervals if possible with breaks if between .
" Our kids really need that sensory input meaning they need physical breaks , " she said .
" That can mean running out in their yard or doing wall pushups , doing wheelbarrow walking , frog jumping , helping you do simple chores -- giving your child little breaks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sensory needs .
Along with scheduling for children , Nunez recommends adults set up schedules for themselves as well with breaks .
" This is n't a break with your child , " she said .
" This is a break from your child .
Schedule in reminders to go outside to breathe , to listen to a favorite song , to have that extra cup of coffee or tea -- whatever they need to get them through their day .
"  Nunez adds that staying calm is key for parents in this situation of unknowns .
" Because we do n't know when this is going to end , parents should look at things weekly , " she said , suggesting families create " Fun Fridays " as a weekly goal .
" Explain to your kids that when we make it through this week and you do A , B and C , then we can have Fun Friday .
You can do something together -- a movie , make pizza , cupcakes , play Minecraft .
It not only gives your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .
"  She also cautions parents to not beat themselves up .
They are not teachers , she said , and parents can aim to help their children reach self-help or life goals rather than school goals .
" What I have been telling parents is take this time to set simple goals -- learning how to write their name , learning how to use a utensil , opening and closing a lunchbox and backpack , dress themselves independently , " she said .
" Teach them how to do a chore .
Think of one goal and that should help .
That way you and your child are working towards something together .
"  Lastly , Nunez advises parents to take advantage of the free online websites that offer academics as well as opportunities to explore and see new things , such as zoos , science experiments , do virtual chores , or typing .
While social distancing is the new normal , Nunez said the situation is a great opportunity for parents to socially connect with their children .
" I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said .
" We have to look at the positives and reframe things .
