The Oakbend Medical Group in Fort Bend County has opened a private , drive-thru COVID-19 testing site that representatives said has enough supplies to provide tests to approved patients " as long as people need it .
"  The hospital officially opened the site on Thursday and tested a total of 12 patients while another 10 were turned away , according to Linda Drummond , Director of Public Relations for Oakbend Medical Group .
Drummond said people were turned away because the hospital is only testing patients who have been approved for testing by a doctor through a telehealth visit , and those ten showed up at the site unannounced .
Demand for the tests has been high ; before 10 a .
on Thursday , more than 300 calls were made requesting a telehealth visit , according to Drummond .
" It may take a couple of days to book a telehealth visit but we are booking them as fast as we can , " Drummond said .
Unlike other Houston-area sites that offer free tests , Oakbend Medical Group 's tests run $140 ; this includes a $40 charge for the telehealth visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drummond .
Not all patients who are approved for testing will have to pay the nearly $140 price tag , as some insurance companies are covering the cost of the test .
" The reason we have a cost associated with ours is because we are an independent hospital ; we are not funded in any way shape or form by the government , " Drummond said .
" The testing is more than that ( $100 ) but we are taking a hit because it 's for the community and we are willing to do that .
"  Drummond said a private vendor , who she would not name for safety reasons , has committed to providing the hospital with as many tests as is needed .
The site is currently open from 8 a .
to 1 p .
Monday through Friday , but those hours could change depending on the flow of traffic .
The hospital is able to conduct 125 tests per day , but that number could expand depending on need .
" The site will be open as long as people need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Drummond said .
She said the tests are not restricted to the elderly or more vulnerable populations and that anyone can get tested as long as they have had a telehealth appointment and exhibit severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing , fever and cough .
As of Thursday night , the hospital had 80 telehealth visits scheduled for Friday .
Drummond said after people are approved for testing , the actual screening process usually takes no more than two minutes and consists of a nasal and throat swab .
In addition to approval from a doctor , patients must bring a valid ID and the required paperwork to get tested .
Patients tested for coronavirus at the site can expect to wait up to 48 hours for results , although that wait time could increase if more patients show up to get tested .
" If more people show up that could delay the result time , " Drummond said .
" We are getting them as fast as we can .
"  Yaneth Calderon , Public Health Information Specialist for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county is not involved with the Oakbend testing site because they are private clinic but stressed residents should only get tested if they deem it absolutely necessary .
" If you do n't need to be tested please do n't go out , " Calderon said .
" Supplies are short and we are trying to identify those at higher risk .
"  To schedule a telehealth visit , call 281-238-7870 .
The hospital is located at 1705 Jackson Street , Richmond .
