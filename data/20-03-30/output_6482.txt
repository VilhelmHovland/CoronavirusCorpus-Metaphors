Mar 30 , 2020 9:19 pm ET  *Regular Trash and Recycling Collections using toters to remain unchanged*  With the anticipated reduction in staffing levels , compounded by residents being home generating more trash volume , Republic Services will suspend Bulk Waste , Yard Waste and Overflow Bags Collection ( bags with stickers ) starting next week , April 1 , 2020 .
Trash volume increases of up to 30% are estimated for the following weeks while reductions in personnel due to quarantine and isolation are expected .
To maintain the trash collection service , personnel from other divisions ( bulk waste and yard waste ) will be utilized .
All residents will need to use their regular trash and recycling toters only since all other items outside the toter will not be collected .
We ask our residents for help during this emergency by limiting the volume of trash disposal as much as possible .
