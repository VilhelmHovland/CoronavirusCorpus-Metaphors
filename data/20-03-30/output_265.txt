Hopes for limited re-opening of saleyards  All saleyards are currently closed , leaving just private paddock to paddock sales and online trading available .
Stock and Station agents have put together a set of protocols they hope will allow the country 's saleyards to reopen as soon as possible as the COVID-19 lockdown progresses .
All yards are currently closed , leaving just private paddock to paddock sales and online trading available .
The COVID-19 lockdown has come at a bad time of year , when autumn sales would normally be coming into full swing .
New Zealand Stock and Station Association ( NZSSA ) chairman Steve Morrison told Rural News he 's put together a discussion document hoping to convince MPI it is possible to set up revised protocols to allow saleyards to reopen .
It is intended to apply to special sales that need to progress urgently , whilst national COVID-19 response measures are still in place .
While not expecting immediate changes , Morrison says farmers need the yards to be open at this time of year , when stock needs to transition between farms -- more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's plenty of farmers looking to what they 're wanting to do with stock and getting a little bit concerned .
" Some may be able to live with four weeks , but they are needing to do something very pressing before winter .
"  Morrison says the proposal outlined a " more COVID-friendly " way to operate a saleyard , but he acknowledges that there had to be a lot of changes to normal sale yard operation for it to be acceptable .
Many stock sales have already gone online -- and Morrison 's own company , NZ Farmers Livestock Ltd , runs its MyLivestock system -- but be believes getting the yards back in operation would certainly help .
Jesse Dargue , general manager of Peter Walsh and Associates , says online trading systems like BIDR or StockX had not been particularly well taken up before COVID-19 .
" Part of the challenge is that farmers like going to the auctions and having a look at the stock themselves .
"  Dargue says livestock companies could register as essential businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welfare of the animals .
He says livestock agents are fortunate to be able to operate at all when many businesses could not .
However , they are very much restricted in the way they can work .
They have to follow COVID-19 protocols such as doing as much as possible from home , making appointments to visit farms , travelling alone , social distancing and handwashing .
" There 's still time to work through options of ways to move stock while complying with the rules around the movement of people , " Moore says .
" Livestock companies like our own are going through a process of becoming an accredited essential provider , and we have obviously got farm sales , paddock-to-paddock sales , and we also have got our online trading platform BIDR , which we have opened up for other companies to use as well .
"  Moore says the uptake of BIDR , which has been running six months , had been " variable " up to now .
" What we 're seeing at the moment is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trading livestock .
