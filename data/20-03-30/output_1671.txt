At the time , the doctors said the spleen was a useless organ and its absence would do me no harm .
It turns out it helps maintain the immune system and without it , I 'm more vulnerable to infections .
This all became apparent when I was in hospital and , since then , I get an annual flu jab , an anti-pneumonia vaccine and I take one antibiotic pill every day .
Advertising  So if I get the coronavirus , I think it will probably kill me .
Which is why I 'm keeping my distance from the world .
Even so , the reaction to the spread of this Chinese flu ( Donald Trump is well within his rights to point out where it comes from ) seems to me to be excessive in the extreme .
It 's the end of the world as we know it .
Everything has stopped .
Our supposedly-libertarian Government has put the entire country under house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant and turning Britain into a police state .
Anguish  Advertising  It has taken over almost the entire economy , like good Marxists seizing control of the means of production , distribution and exchange .
Soon it will be rationing food and loo-paper as it is already rationing medicine and medical treatment .
This has never happened before in this country .
The State is stamping on the faces of the people in exactly the manner George Orwell predicted in ' 1984 ' .
Of course Boris Johnson and his expert advisers tell us it 's for our own good .
They also point to the fact that every other country is imposing similarly Draconian measures to control the spread of this deadly virus .
But is all this justified ? Are the horrific predictions of up to half a million Coronavirus deaths in this country alone in any way accurate ?  Is a ' worst-case scenario ' really the basis on which to destroy British civilisation ? We have known worse .
We have lived through worse .
Three years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batted an eyelid .
Every day in this country , 1,600 people die .
At the moment , many people are dying of Coronavirus and the number is growing fast ; three years ago , about 200 people a day were dying of flu .
Most , though not all , would have died anyway because of an ' underlying ' condition .
Any old flu could kill me , it does n't have to be the one transmitted from animals in Wuhan 's monstrous marketplace .
Yes , more people will die of the virus .
And the stories of their anguish will be heart-rending .
Yes , the NHS is struggling to cope despite the Government throwing everything but the kitchen sink at it .
Yes , doctors and nurses are heroes who deserve our gratitude .
But I 'm still not convinced the virus warrants the complete destruction of our economy , the long-term interruption in the education and careers of millions of young people or the closure of every attraction in the country from football grounds to National Trust parkland .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a truth we prefer not to think about .
This plague has brought home to us the fragility of life and of our way of life .
Terrified of getting it wrong and having thousands of deaths on his hands , Boris Johnson has succumbed to the gloom-mongers and pessimists .
In his shoes , who would n't ? Nobody wants to be responsible for half a million deaths .
We have to knuckle down and meekly accept this destruction of society because it 's for our own good .
Yet I ca n't help worrying this is over the top .
We ca n't trust the statistics -- for instance , we have no idea how many people have caught the virus because most people are n't being tested .
I know four people personally who may well have the virus but , as none has been tested and they do n't need hospital treatment , we will probably never know .
The virus is serious .
If I get it , I expect I 'll die a horrible death .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution for as long as necessary .
But the wholesale destruction of our entire way of life , our economy , our relationships with family and friends , in fact just about everything we hold dear , is the highest possible price to pay .
I have a nasty suspicion we will discover that Armageddon is postponed and the destruction of the Britain we know and love was a calamitous mistake .
