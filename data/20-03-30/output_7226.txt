Twitter removes two Bolsonaro tweets questioning virus quarantine  Published  19 hours ago  on  March 30 , 2020  By  Two tweets by Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro in which he questioned quarantine measures aimed at containing the novel coronavirus were removed Sunday , on the grounds that they violated the social network 's rules .
The far-right leader had posted several videos in which he flouted his government 's social distancing guidelines by mixing with supporters on the streets of Brasilia and urging them to keep the economy going .

Twitter explained in a statement that it had recently expanded its global rules on managing content that contradicted public health information from official sources and could put people at greater risk of transmitting COVID-19 .
In one of the deleted videos , Bolsonaro tells a street vendor , " What I have been hearing from people is that they want to work .
"  " What I have said from the beginning is that ' we are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " he said .
" We just ca n't stand still , there is fear because if you do n't die of the disease , you starve , " the vendor is seen telling Bolsonaro , who responds : " You 're not going to die ! "  ADVERTISEMENT  In another video , the president calls for a " return to normality , " questioning quarantine measures imposed by governors and some mayors across the giant South American country as an effective containment measure against the virus .
" If it continues like this , with the amount of unemployment what we will have later is a very serious problem that will take years to be resolved , " he said of the isolation measures .
" Brazil can not stop or we 'll turn into Venezuela , " Bolsonaro later told reporters outside his official residence .
ADVERTISEMENT  On Saturday , Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta highlighted the importance of containment as a means of fighting the coronavirus , which has already infected 3,904 people in Brazil , leaving 114 dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people want me to shut up , follow the protocols , " said Bolsonaro .
" How many times does the doctor not follow the protocol ? "  ADVERTISEMENT  " Let 's face the virus with reality .
It is life , we must all die one day .
"  In the four videos posted on his Twitter account , Bolsonaro is seen surrounded by small crowds as he walked about the capital .
Bolsonaro has described the coronavirus as " a flu " and advocated the reopening of schools and shops , with self-isolation necessary solely for the over-60s .

The aggressive actions of local governments in the San Francisco Bay Area may have successfully bent the coronavirus curve .
" State leaders and doctors are cautiously optimistic that the Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago have prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region 's health care capacity thus far , " Politico reported Monday .
" Six Bay Area counties were first in the country to adopt aggressive tactics with an enforceable March 16 order requiring residents to stay at home , " Politico noted .
" After 14 days -- the outermost period at which symptoms are believed to emerge post-infection -- doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected to see at this point , and officials credit the lockdown with stemming the tide of patients they feared would flood into emergency rooms .
"  More details about Donald Trump administration 's haphazard response to the COVID-19 pandemic were revealed in a bombshell new report published by The Atlantic on Monday evening .

Gore explained he feels , " especially badly for those who really follow President Trump and believe in him , and , you know , there are quite a few people in our country that do .
"  " I do n't agree with his policies , but those who follow him , I 'm afraid many of them have been misled into thinking that some of his earlier statements about using the word hoax -- and he used it in a specialized way -- but saying it was going to disappear , those kinds of things , I feel badly for those who believe that stuff and have not been protecting themselves , " he explained .
