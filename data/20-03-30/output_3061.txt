A few days after , Sydney Talker explained what has been happening to him and why he made that video .
Sydney Talker explained that he has been experiencing symptoms of coronavirus but was not attended to by the NCDC .
Read Sydney 's full statement on Twitter below :  Good afternoon everyone .
I 'm sharing my personal experience with our failed healthcare system especially on its inability to respond promptly to this COVID-19 epidemic .
A week ago , I came down with some symptoms similar to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 2 days before I got a response stating that since I have not started showing ALL signs &amp; symptoms plus I have no recent international travel history or contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient I would n't be attended to .
I took to Twitter later that day expressing my displeasure for the response I got and most people including the @NCDCgov dismissed it as a skit or probably an ' attention-seeking ' video .
My symptoms continued to persist and I reached out to the @LSMOH through the hotlines all to no avail before contacting them on Twitter via @08000CORONA where I got a call the following morning .
I was told to get a cough syrup and mix lemon in hot water and take these liquids every morning and evening .
I carried out these practices for 2 days with a little relief or so I thought , up until yesterday where I had serious difficulty breathing .
I was rushed to a private hospital where I was rejected because of my symptoms and was referred to the Mainland Hospital ( Formerly Infectious Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival at the Mainland Hospital , the doctors on ground reluctantly attended to the case after questioning me .
Some of the doctors dismissed it almost immediately stating that the signs and symptoms plus possible confirmed contact did not fit the profile of a COVID 19 case .
A sample was eventually collected for testing after we insisted on NOT leaving without a test being carried out .
While the test was ongoing 2 persons were immediately admitted into the Isolation Ward based on the fact that they had possible contact with a confirmed case .
We were later referred again from the Mainland Hospital to Lagos University Teaching Hospital ( LUTH ) for medical examination .
On getting to LUTH we were halted at the entrance of the Accident &amp; Emergency Ward and told to wait outside .
We were questioned from a distance on the symptoms I was experiencing .
After questioning , the doctor said this was a possible case of COVID 19 and referred us back to Mainland Hospital Yaba stating that they do not have adequate gear and facilities to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours of 11pm and 5am while I was still having difficulty breathing , dry cough and my hands and feet were numb .
We eventually decided to head back home as there was no HOPE in sight of being attended to .
We placed a call across to a Nigerian trained Consultant based in the US who prescribed some medications to subdue the symptoms and instructed us to carry out certain tests .
I 'll be going live on Instagram tomorrow morning by 9:00 am to give a proper account of everything that happened yesterday night .
