As the realities of a national lockdown hits home for many South Africans this week , it is becoming increasingly important for tools and platforms to be made available for learning to continue for students and work to be maintained for those doing so remotely .
Answering the needs for the former is the launch of a new platform called BeOnline from HP , which is designed for distance learning across the African continent .
In order to bring BeOnline to fruition , HP has partnered with Classera and Mirai , with all three working to support schools and universities in establishing a fully fledged virtual learning environment , by providing expertise and tools at no cost .
The BeOnline programme gives schools access to the full ecosystem needed for a comprehensive remote learning environment , with pedagogical consultancy for online education provided by Mirai , a learning management solution from Classera , and HP 's IT consultancy on the required infrastructure .
