As efforts continue to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus , the Canadian Forces leadership is expected to soon decide whether to cancel the annual movement of thousands of military personnel and their families to new jobs across the country .
Much of the movement takes place in the summer .
The Canadian Forces has already put on temporary hold trips by military personnel to look for accommodations in the geographic areas where they will begin their new assignments , said Capt .
Kathleen Soucy , spokesperson for Military Personnel Command .
Such " house-hunting " trips have been put on hold for three weeks .
" Right now we are waiting for additional guidance , " she added .
" Many members are asking what is going on and we are looking at that .
"  A decision could come within the next week .
Around 11,000 military personnel move each year .
That happens as military personnel are promoted or sent to new positions in units or other jobs at bases around the country .
Others are moved to various headquarters overseas .
The busiest time for postings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as the " Active Posting Season " or APS , according to the Canadian Forces .
During APS , about 5,000 to 6,000 members receive their posting messages , usually during the spring .
Those come 90 days before the date they are expected to report to the new location .
Military personnel can usually negotiate their actual date for reporting to work within 30 days before or after their official reporting date , the Canadian Forces noted .
There are usually another 3,000 additional annual moves where the federal government pays for those leaving the Canadian Forces to relocate to a geographic location of their choice .
The annual military posting season comes at a time when federal government officials are advising Canadians to stay at home and practice social distancing in an effort to reduce the number of cases of COVID-19 .
Military training schools in Borden , Ont .
and other locations are also being closed .
The Canadian Forces also announced Tuesday that officer cadets at its universities in Kingston , Ont .
and Saint-Jean , Que .
were being sent home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer cadets will begin , immediately , to depart the campus once essential administration is completed and arrangements can be made for their travel home , where their responsibility will be to stay safe and healthy ( their mission will be to respect social distancing and practice self-isolation ) , complete their academic year online , and be ready for follow-on tasks that could include summer training or force employment in roles / tasks yet to be determined in support of the broader Canadian Armed Forces missions , " noted the message to cadets at Saint-Jean .
A similar message was sent to cadets at the Royal Military College in Quebec .
The pandemic has already caused the cancellation of Exercise Maple Resolve , the army 's main training event for the year , as well as a naval exercise off the coast of Africa .
HMCS Glace Bay and HMCS Shawinigan , which were to take part in that naval training , are now returning to Halifax .
The ships are expected to arrive in mid-April .
Maple Resolve was scheduled to take place from May 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5000 personnel and 1450 pieces of major equipment .
" The current situation with COVID-19 is unprecedented and prudence demands we adopt a posture that allows us to best support civilian authorities should the need arise while safe-guarding the well-being of our personnel and the broader Canadian public , " Department of National Defence spokesman Dan Le Bouthillier stated .
In addition , the Canadian Forces is also limiting public access to its recruiting centres across the country .
The military is continuing to recruit but has asked new applicants to begin their recruiting process using its website .
