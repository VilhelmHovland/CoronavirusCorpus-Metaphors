ATAR to go ahead despite school disruption  By Adam Carey  VCE students ' results will be competitively ranked to determine university admissions at the end of the year , despite the unprecedented disruption schools face from the COVID-19 pandemic .
Loading  About 12,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank to be scrapped this year , along with all senior exams , to alleviate stress on VCE students .
" Students are under significantly increased stress as a result of this pandemic , on top of the normal stress experienced by year 12s , " petition founder Peter Hutton , a former principal of Templestowe College , wrote .
Mr Hutton proposed that students could demonstrate their competence in each subject in an alternative way , to be assessed by teachers , while universities could set their own entrance criteria .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for international students , so there will be ample space at uni for more local students , so why do we need to be so harsh ? " he said .
But the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre said the timeline for year 12 students to apply for university would remain unchanged , " with applications opening in August and the ATAR being released in December " .
" If there are changes to the timeline for VCE assessment and results , VTAC will adjust the timeline for release of the ATAR and selection for tertiary courses to accommodate this , " a spokesperson said .
The Age revealed on Tuesday that more than 3800 year 12 students graduated without an ATAR last year , a record number of unscored VCE completions .
