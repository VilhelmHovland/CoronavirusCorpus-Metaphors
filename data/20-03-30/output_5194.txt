As global recession seems inevitable with demand shock becoming much larger than the initial supply shock , governments must ensure that workers get paychecks and firms receive enough cash flows to avoid bankruptcy , else the present health crisis will turn into a mega financial crisis within no time , a new report from London Business School has warned .
Government spending should be now and as large as the predicted economic costs , focusing directly on cash disbursement to firms and households , said the report titled ' The economics of a pandemic : the case of Covid-19 ' .
The immediate tasks at hand must be to ensure households delay mortgage/rental payments and have cash-on-hands , workers receive paychecks even in quarantine or if temporarily laid off ; firms have enough cash flows ( to pay workers and suppliers ) , especially small and young businesses and can avoid bankruptcy .
According to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) chief Kristalina Georgieva , the new coronavirus has taken the world economy to a recession , that will be as bad or worse than the financial meltdown of 2009 .
The LBS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health crisis becomes a financial crisis .
" Central banks should provide financial backing to the government , not just through their own reserves but also by printing money if necessary .
Global shock needs global response .
No country has fiscal capacity to stand alone , " the findings showed .
To avoid a financial meltdown , governments must start from health expenditure .
" Invest in testing and expansion of supply .
Too late now for the first peak but still time to contain the second peak in the fall of 2020 , " said the report .
Use a coordination of fiscal and monetary interventions to maximize and multiply impact and provide financial backing to each other policy and be global -- interconnected society and economy requires global coordination .
" Government spending should be now and as large as the predicted economic costs , focusing directly on cash disbursement to firms and households , " it added .
The IMF chief has said that though in recession , a recovery is very much possible in 2021 if the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project a recovery in 2021 .
In fact , there may be a sizeable rebound but only if we succeed in containing the virus everywhere and prevent liquidity problems from becoming a solvency issue , " Georgieva said .

The outbreak of corona virus in China , although in its ascending phase , may threaten global recovery , especially considering that the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak cost the world $57 billion ( at current price level ) , says a research note from State Bank of India ( SBI ) .
In the report , Dr Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser of SBI , says , " The new virus is of same genre as SARS virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new virus has progressed at a much faster pace than 2003 SARS case .
The impact of outbreak on China will be severe as Wuhan is the hub of transport and industry for central China .
The total cost of SARS outbreak in 2003 at current prices is around $57 billion .
Epidemiology models suggest the current disease is in ascending phase hence it is difficult to assess the full impact at this stage .
"  The pneumonia of unknown cause was first reported in WHO Disease outbreak news on 5 January 2020 .
By 12th January , the outbreak was confirmed .
The new virus is of the same genre as SARS virus of 2003 .
The studies on economic impact of SARS virus of 2003 suggest that the outbreak had impacted industries such as tourism and the retail service sector .
" With sudden shift in expenditure priority growth will be affected in China and globally , " SBI says .
In addition , the report says , unless the impact of novel corona virus is factored in , since the events were coterminous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on global economy would be incomplete .
On 15 January 2020 , the US and China signed the first economic and trade agreement by signalling the intent to end the economic and trade hostility that has marred the bilateral relationship for over two years .
The trade agreement signed on 15th January is broadly divided into seven parts and covers a wide range of agreements and roadmaps on protection of intellectual property ( IPR ) , transfer of technology on market-based principles and trade .
It is agreed that over 2017 baseline , China will import $200 billion of goods and financial services for the first two years .
At the highest level , the agreement brings some clarity on US-China side of US-China-India triangle .
For the global economy , the growth expectations improve but marginally .
The upside is limited as trade disputes are just one of the many structural problems .
Commenting on the impact of the deal on US dollar and US interest rates , SBI says , " The deal envisages reducing the Sino-US trade deficit by 48% for its level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal proceeds as planned US dollar will appreciate over time .
The direction of interest rates will be conditional on three vectors - the US fiscal deficit , the progressive decline in forex reserve accretion of China and other factors such as inflation .
Of late the interbank liquidity in the US was in deficit .
Thus , all factors indicate marginal rise in bond yields in the US .
"  " However , on the other side , with global food prices at 71 month high and trend likely to continue central banks in emerging economies could make an unsynchronized exit from easy monetary policy .
This could mean a weakening US dollar .
In balance , we expect pressure on US dollar with risks tilted towards the downside as now , " Dr Ghosh from SBI added .
For India , SBI says , the mood swing in financial markets on account of aggressive posturing by the either side will become less and thus , some order is expected in the global forex markets and Indian rupee will have an appreciating bias .

The European Union 's antitrust regulators on Wednesday fined Google 1 .
billion euros ( $1 .
billion ) for abusing its dominance in the online search market by blocking rivals .
Google has abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites which prevented Google 's rivals from placing their search adverts on these websites , the European Commission ( EC ) said in a statement .
" Today the Commission has fined Google 1 .
billion euros for illegal misuse of its dominant position in the market for the brokering of online search adverts , " EC Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said .
It is the third EU fine for Google in just two years .
" Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites .
This is illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Commission said the fine which is equivalent to 1 .
per cent of Google 's turnover in 2018 takes account of the duration and gravity of the infringement .
" The misconduct lasted over 10 years and denied other companies the possibility to compete on the merits and to innovate - and consumers the benefits of competition , " Vestager said .
Websites such as newspaper websites , blogs or travel sites aggregators often have a search function embedded .
When a user searches using this search function , the website delivers both search results and search adverts , which appear alongside the search result .
Google is an intermediary , like an advertising broker , between advertisers and website owners that want to profit from the space around their search results pages .
Therefore , AdSense for Search works as an online search advertising intermediation platform .
Google was by far the strongest player in online search advertising intermediation in the European Economic Area ( EEA ) , with a market share above 70 per cent from 2006 to 2016 .
Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most commercially important publishers took place via agreements that were individually negotiated .
The Commission reviewed hundreds of such agreements in the course of its investigation and found that starting in 2006 , Google included exclusivity clauses in its contracts .
This meant that publishers were prohibited from placing any search adverts from competitors on their search results pages , the European Commission said .
