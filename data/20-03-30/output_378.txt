Mother to baby transmission of COVID-19 can not be ruled out , new study finds  Vertical transmission initially seemed unlikely .
Expectant moms share concerns over giving birth amid the coronavirusWith medical guidelines quickly changing , many parents have questions about the safety of their babies and giving birth during the coronavirus pandemic .
Early in the novel coronavirus pandemic , encouraging data suggested that infants born to mothers with COVID-19 did not acquire the virus before birth , a process called vertical transmission .
However , three new reports released in The Journal of the American Medical Association unfortunately suggest the opposite may be true .
Vertical transmission , or the spread of infectious disease from mother to child , initially seemed unlikely based on initial COVID-19 case reports as well as historical data from the outbreaks of MERS and SARS , close cousins of the novel coronavirus .
To date , data has been published on 19 infants born to mothers with COVID-19 , all of whom subsequently tested negative for the virus .
However , a study released from Wuhan 's Children 's Hospital evaluated 33 newborns born to mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 9% ) fell ill .
The physicians involved noted that strict infection control procedures were followed during delivery , suggesting that the virus did n't infect the infants during or after delivery , and instead likely came from the mother while they were still in the womb .

Fortunately , all three infants pulled through .
Two of the infants were born full-term via C-section and developed fever , lethargy and pneumonia on chest radiographs .
The third infant required more intensive care , but was also significantly premature - born at only 31 weeks gestation , or six weeks early .
The premature infant also was found to have sepsis , or a blood infection caused by a bacteria .
With this , along with the complexity that inherently goes along with prematurity , it is unclear how significantly COVID-19 affected the infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improvement and recovery .
Antibodies in newborns raise further concern  The two additional research letters released on March 26 report a different sign of potential mother-to-child transmission .
In a bit of a medical mystery , researchers describe case studies of three infants that did not have symptoms nor test positive for active COVID-19 infections , but did have specific antibodies , or immune proteins , called IgM .
What to know about the novel coronavirus :  IgM is usually produced in response to a pathogen three to seven days after infection .
It is not usually transferred from mother to fetus because of its larger structure , which is too big to cross the placenta .
Researchers suggest that if coronavirus-specific IgM is present at birth , it could either indicate that the infant had produced its own IgM in response to the virus or the mother 's IgM was transferred to the baby through a damaged placenta .

All gave birth via C-section using multiple infection control measures , including isolation of their infants immediately following delivery .
Two of these six infants had IgM present , but none had symptoms and were repeatedly negative when tested for the virus .
A separate report from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University had similar findings , but focused on only one infant .
This mother was sicker than the others and was treated with antiviral , antibiotic , corticosteroid and oxygen therapies .
She gave birth via C-section nearly one month after contracting the virus and her infant , too , was positive for coronavirus-specific IgM .
While these findings are difficult to interpret given their paucity of accompanying clinical details , these isolated case studies are still worthy of special attention .
Scientists and researchers are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to best protect the health of infants and mothers with COVID-19 infection .
Until we have more data , pregnant women and women hoping to soon become pregnant should continue to seek guidance and medical care from health professionals .
