THE 2020 AFL Women 's season is one Nowra 's Maddy Collier wo n't forget anytime soon .
It all started at the end of last season when she decided to leave the Greater Western Sydney Giants , after three campaigns , and pen a two-year deal with inaugural franchise West Coast .
It only took the Nowra High School alumna a small amount of time at the Eagles to make an impact on the club , after she was named in their leadership group .
" Being named in the leadership group was amazing and definitely not something I expected , " Collier said .
" I knew I had an influence on the group , as I was one of the more experienced girls but I did n't realise how much - leadership can come in many forms , depending on the time of the year .
" To be nominated for the position by my peers is totally humbling and I ca n't think of anything more endearing - as I love my teammates .
" The 24-year-old was then named to start on the half-forward flank for the club 's first-ever game against Collingwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the guernsey for the first game and to be a part of that match , " she said .
" Our group became tight-knit very quickly , which made it even more special to run out alongside some of my best friends .
" We were all excited , which showed by our amazing first quarter display - the pressure we exerted during that term was amazing and really laid a platform for us for the rest of the season .
" Although we went on to lose that game , there were plenty of positive signs to come from it .
" Then in round four , all the hard work during the pre-season and opening three weeks was rewarded when the Eagles recorded their historic first win , downing the Western Bulldogs at Leederville Oval .

" I thought we were the better side on the day and deserved to win that game - it was a reward and relief for the whole group .
" To also be part of the group to sing the club 's first-ever victory song ( now remixed by Birds of Tokyo ) was very special and something I 'll never forget .
" The AFL South Coast product 's side would go on to lose their next two games - with Collier missing the latter because of a hip injury sustained at training - before the AFLW decided to cancel the rest of the season due to the coronavirus .

" It 's not just our club that 's affected , it 's both competitions and we 've all got to do our part to help society through this tough time .
" I know our group are doing all the right things , as well as constantly checking up on each other and seeing if we 're each okay - I know we will all get through this together .
" It 's this environment at the club that has impressed Collier most during the season .
" As soon as I stepped footy into the club , you could just feel the culture there , " she said .
" It 's not just the players - every single person in the club as the right approach .
" There 's the mentality that every single person plays their role , to the greater benefit of everyone at the club - there 's a long-term focus and we know it 'll all start to pay off soon .
" Now that 's she 's had a bit of time to reflect on the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build on .
" If you just look at the losses , you might think we did n't have a good season , but the way I see it , there 's now an opportunity for us to get better and be the most improved side next season , " she said .

" From a personal point of view , Collier is also concentrating on the positives .
" I did n't have the season I wanted personally , as I wanted to try and get my consistency back , which I had lost the past couple of seasons with the Giants , " she said .
