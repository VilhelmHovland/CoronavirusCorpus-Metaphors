No money , no security ; only cold shoulder for migrant labourers in Bengaluru  Like the hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers all over India rushing home after the lockdown was announced , those in Bengaluru too are in a pitiable condition .
With public transport suspended during the lockdown , they have nowhere to go .
And while they 're stuck in their shanties , they are fast running out of food , money and hope of receiving any payment from their contractors .
On Monday , Bangalore Mirror met with migrant labourers staying at a few colonies in Mahadevapura , Kundalahalli village near Cosmos , in Brookefield , and at Veerannapalya near Manyata Tech Park .
These labourers , including construction workers , domestic helps , security guards , drivers , are uncertain about their next meal as their respective contractors are yet to settle their dues for the month they have already worked .
Some were told that they would get rations and Rs 1,000 from the government , but nothing has come yet , they say .
" We are scared to step out to ask for rations .
When a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police .
Our contractors allege that builders/project managers have not cleared their dues and hence our payments are stuck , " said a labourer .
In a shocking incident , migrants who were returning to their homes in Uttar Pradesh were sprayed with ' chemical on Sunday by a team on sanitising duty at the Bareilly bus stand .
Their shanties are situated close to under-construction high-rise apartment complexes .
" When the lockdown was announced , most people had money to buy and stock groceries .
We had nothing , " said Nihad Hasan ( 24 ) , a migrant labourer from Malda , West Bengal .
" We are surviving on snacks and eggs that we buy from a shop on credit .
Our contractor said he would pay the money now and we would have to pay it back later , " said Bhuvaneshwar Sharma ( 47 ) , a labourer .
Nowhere to goStuck in a strange city , away from home and with no employment , the plight of the labourers is indeed pitiable .
" We thought we would use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns but with public transport suspended , we 're stranded here , " said another migrant labourer Sayabnna ( 45 ) told BM .
Sayabnna is a migrant labourer from Kalaburagi who works as a car cleaner at a service station in Marathahalli .
Migrant workers say that after the lockdown contractors , project managers and builders have stopped responding to their calls for help .
Rahim Sheik ( 37 ) a contractor from Nadia district in West Bengal , who is working in Mahadevapura and has about 10 labourers working under him for two months , said , " The project manager had to pay a total of Rs 75,000 .
First , he gave Rs 9,500 and later he gave us Rs 14,000 .
He is yet to pay Rs 55,000 , but he is not answering my calls .
"  The Supreme Court on Monday slated for tomorrow the hearing on a petition seeking directions to provide amenities like food and shelter to migrant workers amid the lockdown imposed in the wake of coronavirus .
As regards the compensation from the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those registered with the labour commission .
" Less than 30 per cent of the labourers are registered with the government while the remaining 70 per cent just work as daily wagers .
This is part of the builders ' scam , " said R Kaleemullah , a member of Swaraj Abhiyan .
These labourers hail not only from interior districts of Karnataka like Kalaburagi and Raichur but from other parts of India like West Bengal , Odisha , Assam , Bihar , Uttar Pradesh , Tripura .
Domestic help in distressA large number of domestic help workers who are employed at apartment complexes in Kundalahalli near Cosmos Brookefield have been asked by their employers not to come to work as they visit multiple houses .
The employers fear that they might be carriers of the corornavirus .
" We were told that we would get some free rations , but a group of people came here and took a list of names of people who spoke the local language and went away .
We were ignored , " said Beauty Mondal .
" We are around 500 number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all from Kolkata and since public transport is not available , we 're stuck here , " said Mafuza Patkewadi , who works as a domestic help .
Mafuza is one among a big group of migrant workers who is uncertain of what to do for their next meal .
There were handicapped children and elderly people with ailments at the shanties who are now staring at starvation .
And with the threat of Covid-19 looming , poor hygiene and lack of physical distancing , the plight of these labourers gets worse with every day of the lockdown .
Many of the thousands of jobless workers , marching from their workplaces to their native villages in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh hundreds of kilometres away amid the coronavirus lockdown , are not being welcomed back home .
When BM tried to call Jayadev Rai , a project manager , his mobile was switched off .
Rai is the manager of a residential project .
When the lockdown was announced , most people had money to buy and stock groceries .
We had nothing  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Malda , West Bengal .
Around 1,000 labourers live in shanties at Veerannapalya near Manyata Tech Park .
After a labourer fell ill on Wednesday evening , some men hired by the builder rushed to the spot .
He was taken to a private hospital in an ambulance .
However , the other labourers panicked as they thought he might be Covid-19 positive .
The builders ' men rushed to the shanty and promised to provide money and rations .
They also took the responsibility of cleaning up their shanties , including the toilets .
Meanwhile , BBMP authorities claimed that they have hired convention halls and other shelter arrangements for migrant labourers who were stranded at the border , while on their way back home .
" What happens to labourers like us who are still stuck here with our families and looking at an uncertain future , " asked Nahid Hasan .
These labourers are stuck in a no man 's landMigrant workers who tried to leave Bengaluru on Sunday night are stuck in a ' no-man 's land ' .
Many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed .
However , when they were about to cross the Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border near Bagepalli , the migrant labourers were caught and told to return to Bengaluru .
They were promised rehabilitation at kalyana mantaps by the BBMP , a labourer said .
As they had to spend the night arguing with cops at the state border , they had no other option but but to eventually return to Karnataka .
However , Monday morning was no different as they were stopped at the Devanahalli check post and were told that they would not be allowed to enter Karnataka .
Officials at Devanahalli said that they got orders about not allowing anyone to enter the state and hence the labourers had to spend most part of the day standing on the road .
The labourers demanded that the government provide early relief a s they can neither go to Bengaluru nor to their homes in Uttar Pradesh .
