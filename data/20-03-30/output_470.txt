Share this story  The world was a strange place even before the COVID-19 pandemic , but it has gotten stranger still .
One of the oddest things about this socially distanced new world is that a respiratory disease has made toilet paper worth its weight in gold .
Why is everyone scrambling for toilet paper all of a sudden ? Consumer behavior researcher Kit Yarrow suggests it 's a case of our social primate brains reacting to newsfeeds full of striking but sometimes disorienting visual cues .
Retail therapy on overdrive  Panic-buying during a crisis is nothing new .
Midwesterners joke about everyone making Apocalypse French Toast before a blizzard , because store shelves mysteriously empty of bread , eggs , and milk .
On the coast , peanut butter is the must-have item every hurricane season .
In part , it 's reasonable to want to be prepared , says Yarrow .
But panic-buying is partly an attempt to gain a sense of control when the world feels uncertain and dangerous .
" When we feel anxious , which I think all of us do right now -- it would be sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anxiety is always control , " said Yarrow .
" And since we ca n't really control the track of this disease , we turn to what we can control , and that 's why people are shopping .
It 's like , ' well , I feel like I 'm doing something , I feel like I 'm preparing .
I feel like I 'm taking control of the thing I can control , which is stocking up .
'  " Some of the people that are doing the hoarding , they 're not bad people and they 're not selfish people .
They 're just scared people , and I think that if they thought about their connection to others and their responsibility to the community , they probably would n't do it , " Yarrow told Ars .
It 's easy to see the logic -- even if it 's irrational -- behind frantic stashing of soap or hand sanitizer .
But why toilet paper ?  Yarrow says that is a bit unusual .
" I do n't think most people think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This is kind of a first , " she told Ars .
The run on toilet paper ( sorry , not sorry ) is what happens when social media-driven communication meets human instinct in the middle of a crisis .
The optical illusion of a shortage  " We 're social animals , " Yarrow told Ars .
" In times that are really kind of unprecedented and uncertain , we do look to other people for cues about what to do .
Unfortunately , other people are doing kind of crazy things , so it makes us feel like we should do it too .
"  And today , most of us find out what our fellow humans are doing through social media , or through news reports filled with images and video .
So the cues we 're getting are very visual , which affects how we process certain information .
Big , bulky items like toilet paper leave more noticeable , visible gaps on store shelves than smaller items like canned tuna -- especially when toilet paper takes up most of an aisle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few feet of shelf space .
" A picture of an empty toilet paper shelf is really a lot more dramatic than an empty tuna shelf , and a picture of somebody walking out of the store with two big things of toilet paper is a more dramatic picture than a picture of somebody walking out with a bag of tuna , " Yarrow told Ars .
" Toilet paper sort of became the thing that the media in particular was really focused on , and that then cued people into thinking about it .
"  Do n't stockpile the Charmin  So what should be we be doing instead of building toilet-paper forts ?  " I 'm not going to tell people to not be prepared , because I think that there 's so many ways that that 's satisfying to them , both practically -- I think people need to be prepared -- but also emotionally .
It feels really good to prepare , " said Yarrow .
But once people have what they actually need , it 's time to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain world .
" Keep in mind that what we want to do is feel like we 're being productive and in control in this weird , open , loose space of uncertainty that we 're in , so control what you can control , " Yarrow suggested .
Assert some control over your socially distanced days by scheduling and establishing a routine ; assert some control over your environment by cleaning or organizing .
And seek out as much human connection as possible within the bounds of social distancing : video chats , walks at the park , or phone calls .
