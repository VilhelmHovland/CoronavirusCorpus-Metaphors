counties have yet to report a single positive test result for COVID-19 infections , an analysis by The Associated Press shows .
Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows that 1,297 counties have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 , out of 3,142 counties nationwide .
Of the counties without positive tests , 85% are in rural areas -- from predominantly white communities in Appalachia and the Great Plains to majority Hispanic and Native American stretches of the American Southwest -- that generally have less everyday contact between people that can help transmit the virus .
At the same time , counties with zero positive tests for COVID-19 have a higher median age and higher proportion of people older than 60 -- the most vulnerable to severe effects of the virus -- and far fewer intensive care beds should they fall sick .
Median household income is lower , too , potentially limiting health care options .
