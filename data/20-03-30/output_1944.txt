' Postponing our wedding because of coronavirus means we ca n't live together yet '  Three couples tell i about having to cancel or postpone their weddings because of the coronavirus outbreak  As the Government 's unprecedented lockdown measures to tackle coronavirus came into effect on Monday 23 March , anyone who had plans to tie the knot in the near future found themselves unable to , as weddings and social gatherings are now banned .
While Boris Johnson said the partial lockdown would be reviewed after three weeks , for those planning weddings in May and over the summer , there is still uncertainty as to whether their celebrations will go ahead .
This uncertainty , as well as the cascading effects of suppliers needing to accommodate existing as well as future clients , has meant turmoil and chaos for couples and the wedding industry .
According to a 2018 Bridebook survey , UK weddings cost ? 30,355 on average for couples who use every type of supplier .

i spoke to three couples about their postponed plans and how this has affected them .
' We 've just cancelled and wo n't be able to get married next year '  Sylvia , 32 , is a psychologist and was due to marry Robert , 35 , an architect , in July .
They are based in Norwich .
We were a bit non-traditional and did n't get engaged with proposals and rings .
I 'm from New Zealand originally , while Robert is from the UK , and about 18 months ago we agreed that getting married would be a lovely way to get the families all together for a nice blowout .
For my brother and sister , it would have been their first visit .
We planned to have a registry office ceremony with our mums as witnesses , then a big barn party a few days later for all our friends and family .
Everything was booked for July 2020 .
A few people in my family fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would n't be attending about three weeks ago .
I was keener to cancel earlier so that family would n't lose money on flights and accommodation , whereas Rob wanted to wait and see for a bit longer .
We 're definitely in agreement now , but it just took a bit longer for us both to get to the same point .
We officially told friends and family last week .
Thankfully most people booked with airlines which could refund them , and it was sufficiently far in advance that Airbnbs could be cancelled without losing money .
We are definitely going to lose some more of our deposits but ca n't bring ourselves to sit down and work out how much .
We had budgeted ? 10,000 for the wedding and so far , we have lost ? 2,800 .
We 're still talking to vendors at the moment , but there are no slots for our venue in 2021 , so we definitely wo n't be able to do it next year .
We did n't take out insurance for the party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think insurance would have covered this kind of event .
We feel like the reality of it has n't really set in yet as there 's so much more to focus on at the minute .
' We were sad to move the wedding , but now it feels trivial '  Liam Pikett , 31 is an assistant psychologist and research assistant at St Bartholomew 's Hospital and University College London , and was due to marry his fianc ? Simon Carroll , 36 , in May .
They are based in Hackney , London .
We have been together since 2013 .
We got engaged in June 2018 and have been planning since then .
We were due to marry at Peckham Asylum Chapel and have the wedding party at The Stratford Hotel -- we would have been the hotel 's first wedding .
We were really excited to bring our friends and family together to celebrate our love and thank them for their love and support , and it 's so sad it has been moved .
But , working in healthcare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem this was going to become .
We quickly adjusted and accepted what is happening - there are larger problems at hand .
We have been very lucky in terms of financial implications .
The Asylum messaged us with our options and have been very accommodating .
They have offered to let us keep our deposit as long as we get married there by the end of 2021 ( we are currently pencilled in for 17 December ) This put us at ease immediately and made us feel secure .
The wedding is quite expensive but we have n't lost money at this point as we took action early enough .
We had a lot of international guests coming , but that actually made us consider moving it early on due to restrictions happening around the world ahead of the UK .
We reached out individually and people have received refunds from National Rail , BA , Virgin Flights and The Stratford Hotel because we got organised around travel and accommodation .
We were very sad to move the wedding , but it now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our relationship will endure , and we will celebrate that when it is safe for everyone .
' Our wedding being postponed has also put a halt on our plans to live together '  Aman Chima , 31 , is a self-employed business management consultant who is engaged to Gurdeep Sahota , 30 , a property developer based in London .
In March 2019 , Gurdeep got down on one knee in Cappadocia , in Turkey , and asked me if I would be his wife with a backdrop of valleys , hot air balloons and the sun rising .
We have been planning the wedding ever since .
Our guest list was around 450 people .
We legally got married last week and were set to start our cultural and religious wedding festivities from 28 March for two weeks , with four events over this period .
On 10 April we were meant to have our Sikh wedding ceremony , and it would have only been after this that we would be living together .
Given the current global pandemic , both of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of our guests .
Gurdeep and I both have close immediate family members or friends who are highly vulnerable to coronavirus including elderly people , pregnant women , children with asthma , people with cancer and leukaemia survivors .
We had the option of downsizing or waiting until closer to the date to see if the wedding could still go ahead , but one of the most important things for us was celebrating with our loved ones .
It has been a very difficult time .
Gurdeep and I are married and were due to be living together in three weeks , however as our Sikh wedding has been postponed , this has also put a halt on our living arrangements .
It was stressful enough planning a wedding the first time around and now we essentially are having to start the process again and plan for a second time .
It is mentally draining trying to work out the best way to handle it , as well as becoming obsessed with reports and waiting daily for any direction from the Government .
I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , photographers , decor , and the Gurdwara and they have all offered to reschedule the date with no additional charge .
However none of my suppliers is able to offer a refund , and we all have to work around the temple who only have two dates available , in six months time .
We 've only lost ? 300 for far and we are aware it could have been worse .
If you had told me two weeks ago our wedding could be postponed because of a global pandemic I would never have believed you , but unfortunately this is the situation we and many others are in .
I guess the silver lining is that people always wish they did things differently during their wedding once the big day is over .
Gurdeep and I , and all of the others in our situation , get the chance to take away learnings from the past year of planning and do things differently now based on what we want and what is important to us .
