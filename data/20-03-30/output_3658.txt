( Photo : EPA-EFE / Wu Hong )  China has given us a taste of things to come after releasing economic statistics that show how much pain has been inflicted on its economy in its efforts to lock down the coronavirus .
As the US Federal Reserve pulled the trigger on what little ammunition it had left , China released economic statistics that show what a sudden stop in economic activity looks like two months after the country went into effective shutdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus .
The statistics show Chinese industrial production slid 13 .
year-on-year during the first two months of the year , fixed asset investments slumped an even more startling 24 .
and retail sales came off some 20 .
These figures give scary insight into the pain other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ahead .
As the first figures to capture the fundamental impact of the virus , they exceeded even the most pessimistic estimates .
So much so that ING Greater China Chief Economist Iris Pang commented :  " There is nothing in the history of this data that can compare to this set of abysmal figures .
"  She does see some light at the end of the tunnel for China , saying :  " Investment might recover faster than retail sales and industrial production because the government has promoted ' new infrastructure ' investment to boost economic growth to support the recovery .
So , fixed asset investment in the coming months should rise from negative growth .
"  However , she notes that industrial production will remain under pressure during March and April " as the spread of Covid-19 in almost all countries means global demand will stop abruptly , and the global supply chains will still be broken when factories around the world suspend operations " .
" However , the international demand shock of fear of the virus will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  While China may already be painstakingly climbing out of this economic black hole after the considerable fiscal and monetary policy stimulus measures it has undertaken this year to date , other emerging economies may find it much harder to win back economic ground they lose this year .
With most emerging markets still heading for a coronavirus growth shock at a time when they have already been struggling with low growth , the two things they will need to find their footing again are in short supply : foreign investment flows and fiscal and monetary policy capacity to stimulate the economy .
Two research reports published by the International Institute of Finance ( IIF ) in the last few weeks highlight the challenges emerging markets are facing on these two fronts .
Firstly , the institute 's tracker of non-resident portfolio flows to emerging markets recorded its most negative reading ever , with the outflows that have already been experienced far greater than the disinvestments experienced during the 2008 global financial crisis .
The IIF is particularly concerned about those emerging economies that have seen their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of the flow of money looking for a home in high-beta assets after a decade of " extraordinary monetary policy stimulus " rather than valuation gains in those assets .
It points to South Africa as " a stand-out " in this respect alongside Mexico and Chile .
As you 'll see in the graph below , South Africa 's foreign portfolio holdings as a percentage of GDP are 100% a result of flows and not valuation gains .
The problem with attracting foreign portfolio investment for the wrong reason is that it is hot money that will flow out as quickly as it has flown in , particularly if the fundamental economic rationale for investing in the market is not compelling .
The IIF says , " We have documented negative growth momentum in many emerging markets even before the Covid-19 shock , including in Mexico and South Africa , so that the initial conditions in many places are weak and vulnerable to a persistent pull-back in foreign financing material .
"  The impact of foreign portfolio disinvestment is evident in the significant decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global financial markets in late February .
By the end of last week , the JSE All Share Index had come off 23 .
since February 19 and is off a similar amount for the year to date .
Other emerging markets that have experienced similar sell-offs include Turkey , which has slumped 19 .
since the February high , Mexico , which is off 18 .
over the same period and Brazil , which has been particularly hard hit , losing 29% since then .
China is an exception , having been rewarded for its proactive measures to contain the virus .
Its Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index has lost a mere 3 .
since February 19 and is down just short of 5% since the beginning of the year .
With investment flows unlikely to return meaningfully to emerging markets until the global economic outlook becomes more favourable and investor sentiment returns , emerging markets will have to rely on their own internal measures to help their economies survive .
However , the other Achilles heel that emerging markets have that China did not is they do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulus measures that are likely to allow China to put those dismal January and February figures behind them .
Some emerging markets do have the capacity , though , according to the IIF , and should use it " sooner rather than later " , before the economic environment gets worse .
It notes that the US Federal Reserve 's recent rate cuts have also " widened monetary policy space for emerging markets " and , because virus-related effects are likely to affect growth negatively rather than cause inflation , the IIF believes this alleviates the pressure on central banks to adopt hawkish monetary policy stances .
However , for South Africa , which the IIF identifies as one of the few emerging market economies that do have monetary policy space , it warns that " substantial fiscal risk leaves the SARB with less room than real rates indicate .
" However , the policymakers will have to use that room wisely as the government takes the decisive , far-reaching and , few would argue , necessary action to contain the virus after seeing countries like Italy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sign in  Do n't have a login ?
