Eagles players finding creative ways to work out , stay in shape during coronavirus  There are n't many options for NFL players now that most gyms are closed , along with the practice facilities of the Eagles and teams around the league .
So they have gotten creative in trying to find ways to stay in shape during the coronavirus pandemic .
Eagles backup quarterback Nate Sudfeld , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played football -- Zach Sudfeld spent two seasons in the NFL as a tight end and Matthew Sudfeld was a wide receiver in college at Brown .
Sudfeld is staying with his parents and brothers .
He said the family garage has been converted into a makeshift gym .
Sudfeld and his brothers can also run pass patterns near their home .
Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nate Sudfeld speaks into a radio at the NFL football team 's practice facility in Philadelphia , Thursday , June 13 , 2019 .
( Photo : Matt Rourke , AP )  " I 've got two nice targets that are under my quarantine , which is perfect , so I 'm able to throw to them for a little bit , " Sudfeld said .
" But it 's hard .
It 's kind of a day-by-day thing trying to figure out how to keep developing , how to get into shape this offseason without the full weight room , full workout , all that stuff .
"  This time of season is considered a dead period anyway for players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically work out by themselves or in groups at a gym/training facility .
But it 's likely that the voluntary offseason conditioning programs , which begin at team facilities on April 20 , could be in jeopardy ( teams with new head coaches would have been able to begin on April 6 ) .
" Hopefully we brought in players who understand that they need year round to stay in shape , " Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said .
" This is no longer a situation where you come to training camp , and you work yourself back in shape .
" They have a training manual that was given to them when they left ( in January ) with ideas on stuff .
That 's also visual through their phones and through their iPads in terms of workouts .
"  " I pride myself on working the hardest , " he said .
" The fact that all these gyms and stuff and parks and stuff are closed is kind of driving me nuts right now .
I think it 's just being cautious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now .
We all have to be extra careful .
People are dying out there because of this .
It 's a serious condition .
" Having the ability to adapt , I think , is the biggest thing that we can do .
Whether that 's training differently in the house , or being somewhere where there 's absolutely no one around .
You got ta do things differently .
"  Parks said he goes to a park in the area to get in a workout , in addition to lifting weights at his house .

" Just using a couple of objects outside to get my body going , and then right back in the car and right back home .
" It definitely sucks not being able to do the things you normally do .
But I think I 'm doing a good job as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Eagles defensive tackle Javon Hargrave .
" With all the gyms and stuff closing , I 've been ordering a lot of stuff for my apartment , " he said .
" A bike , some weights .
I 'm just trying to find ways to eat right without exposing myself .
I 'm just finding ways to grind , eating real healthy .
Just bang out the weights and grinding .
"  Then there 's Eagles kicker Jake Elliott , who has taken his golf game indoors , posting a video of him sinking a shot from the top of his staircase into a water cup at the bottom , and other such trick shots .
Trying to find some levity is about all players can do at this point .
That , and watching a lot of video -- football and otherwise .
" Trying to watch as much film as I can , and try to be on top of it , " Sudfeld said .
" But if you ask anybody , it 's pretty unprecedented , so I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
