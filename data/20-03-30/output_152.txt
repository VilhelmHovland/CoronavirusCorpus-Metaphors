Covid-19 : What we know about New Zealand 's first 500 cases  New Zealand now has 514 confirmed and probable Covid-19 cases .
One week ago we had 66 cases , two weeks ago we had eight , three weeks ago there were five and four weeks ago it had just been confirmed that one person had tested positive in New Zealand .
In just one month the number of cases in New Zealand has grown significantly as people rushed back after borders around the world closed and airlines stopped flying .
Most of the cases in New Zealand are related to travel , including a group of three men in their 20s who travelled from Chicago to Whanganui on 23 March and another group of mostly middle-aged Wellingtonians who travelled together on a trip to New York .
Fifteen of them are confirmed to have the coronavirus , while another two probably have it .
