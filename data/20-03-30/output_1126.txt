Coronavirus and the lessons of the Athenian plague  The plague that struck Athens in the summer of 430 bc was a killer : it lasted for two years , returned after a year , and carried off a third of Athens ' manpower , including Pericles .
From the historian Thucydides ' famous description , the plague -- he caught it but recovered -- bore certain resemblances to Covid-19 ( allowing for differences in severity ) , but also invites reflection .
He is the first Greek to mention two common illness-related phenomena : contagion -- he says that , because of their exposure , there was a high death-rate among doctors and among those with the courage and sense of duty to try to care for the sick -- and some immunity from further attack among survivors who , he says , concluded they would live for ever .
The result of contagion , he goes on , was that many Athenians died in isolation , especially as caring for them seemed to have no effect at all .
Some remedies seemed to work , but what was effective for one person proved useless for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider social consequences that Thucydides provokes thought .
The plague was so deadly , he reports , that it soon became clear that no one would live long enough to pay a price for their behaviour .
Time-honoured funerary practices were ignored -- any private family pyre would do for cremating a corpse -- and immediate pleasure became the priority .
Since no fear of gods or law was any constraint and the impious and pious suffered without distinction , the social fabric of the Athenian world began to crumble .
The life of honour was no longer a goal , and the aim was to get as much enjoyment out of life as everyone could in the time available to them .
In the UK there are already trivial , but nevertheless indicative , signs of social breakdown ( sanitisers being ripped off hospital walls , for example ) .
But if an Athenian-style plague is just around the corner -- and Covid-19 shows how possible that is and where its source would probably be ( though all animal-derived human food has its dangers ) -- modern medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
