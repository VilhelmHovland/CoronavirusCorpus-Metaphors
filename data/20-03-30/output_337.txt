Comments  Solidarity is a beautiful thing , but it is also defined in cultural terms .
And culture is by definition something that works largely on a subconscious level .
Which makes it difficult to bridge .
Eurobonds and the like hit that nerve .
It may solve one problem , but it will create new ones , along the same cultural faultlines  The UK wo n't default on its debt - it 's no doubt a serious crisis and could cause a UK economic crisis but the worst that happens is a devaluation of the pound - bad for the UK but ultimately not so important globally .
A Eurozone break up would be utterly catastrophic for the global economy - it was crash financial systems and take years to unravel .
It 's the only thing that keeps me optimistic - it 's literally so big to fail , it might not .
" The EU originated to stop war amongst its members .
NATO was created to protect it from an external threat "  The UK did n't join the EU until the 1970s but I did n't notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out of an all out war , where massive genocide took place and the Marshall plan to get countries back on their feet ensured no one one felt aggrieved ( unlike after WW1 ) .
Added to that it was sandwiched between two superpowers and Germany under external military occupation .
Claiming the EU kept peace looks like putting the cart before the horse .
The EU is a result of the desire for European nations to keep the peace .
Wheras in the UK we have a dithering vague central government that seemed to think a ' herd immunity ' measles party was the answer .
then did a U turn , and now we apparently ca n't even supply hospitals with enough PPE and tests when they knew this was coming weeks ago and were alledgedly ' building capacity ' all that time .
plus we have all the different regions ( England , Scotland , Wales , N Ireland ) all issuing different pronouncements on absolute basics like ' Do we allow construction sites to continue ' .
errrr , yes , emmmmm no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus cares about our regional boundaries .
Talk about a headless fustercluck .
We and the rest of the EU ( and the USA ) are like a dysfunctional family in our belated bumbling - we belong together .
The Brexiters willing the EU to fail should focus on the damage they are doing to our own economy .
The simple truth is that we live in a connected world , and there is no going back to the way things were .
Brexit was never cerebral , it was always visceral , and they should have the intellectual honesty to admit that .
German healthcare is excellent and you have 7 times as many ICU beds per capita as the UK , but Germans smoke twice as many cigarettes per capita as the UK and existing lung damage from smoking has been cited as a driver of mortality for covid-19 victims .
As I write this France has 1,331 deaths from 25,233 cases and Germany 206 from 37,323 - such a disparity can not simply be due to superior healthcare .
Laughable .
How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and nineteen or something different fiscal policies .
deficits being funded by bonds that are excluded from ECBs quantitative easing programmes .
in fact the Greeks could n't even issue bonds .
It 's a mess .
Maybe it 's the other way around .
Let 's be realistic : the Eurozone is n't working , because its countries are diverging instead of converging as they were supposed to .
Sooner or later , it 's bound to implode .
unless something big happens and forces Germany et al .
to create a real union , with a real , shared budget .
If thousands of innocent deaths are n't enough to pave to way to eurobonds , that what is ?  Seperate to the fiscal situation , countries have banned ' exports ' within Europe of many medical goods to ensure they have enough for their own country .
Combine this with previous bans on state aid and subsidies that means countries self sufficiency in key industries has degraded makes the current set up of the EU a disaster for many member countries .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that figure and it is surprisingly low .
Probably ca n't read too much into it because of statistical fluctuations surrounding such relatively small numbers but if this persists over the next few days it 's a game changer in terms of the length of the shutdown .
The EU had no authority in health issues , that 's the problem .
In case of a pandemic the EU should have full authority instead of the member states .
Only than an effici ? nt system if cooperation can be set up in a short time .
