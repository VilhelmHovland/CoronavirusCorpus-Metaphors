Within a few hours of being launched , over 800 Venezuelans in the U .
registered for an emergency flight from Miami to Caracas through a website run by the Venezuelan government .
This flight , offered at no cost , was proposed by President Nicol ? s Maduro when he learned that 200 Venezuelans were stuck in the United States following his government 's decision to stop commercial flights as a preventative coronavirus measure .
The promise of one flight expanded to two or more flights , as it became clear that many Venezuelans in the U .
wanted to go back to Venezuela , yet the situation remains unresolved due to the U .
ban on flights to and from the country .
Those who rely solely on the mainstream media might wonder who in their right mind would want to leave the United States for Venezuela .
Numerous outlets -- including TIME magazine , the Washington Post , The Hill , the Miami Herald , and others -- published opinions in the past week describing Venezuela as a chaotic nightmare .
These media outlets painted a picture of a coronavirus disaster , of government incompetence and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of Venezuela 's coronavirus response is not covered by the mainstream media at all .
Furthermore , what each of these articles shortchanges is the damage caused by the Trump administration 's sanctions , which devastated the economy and healthcare system long before the coronavirus pandemic .
These sanctions have impoverished millions of Venezuelans and negatively impact vital infrastructure , such as electricity generation .
Venezuela is impeded from importing spare parts for its power plants and the resulting blackouts interrupt water services that rely on electric pumps .
These , along with dozens of other implications from the hybrid war on Venezuela , have caused a decline in health indicators across the board , leading to 100,000 deaths as a consequence of the sanctions .
Regarding coronavirus specifically , the sanctions raise the costs of testing kits and medical supplies , and ban Venezuela 's government from purchasing medical equipment from the U .
( and from many European countries ) .
These obstacles would seemingly place Venezuela on the path to a worst-case scenario , similar to Iran ( also battered by sanctions ) or Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those two countries , Venezuela took decisive steps early on to face the pandemic .
As a result of these steps and other factors , Venezuela is currently in its best-case scenario .
As of this writing , 11 days after the first confirmed case of coronavirus , the country has 86 infected people , with 0 deaths .
Its neighbors have not fared as well : Brazil has 1,924 cases with 34 deaths ; Ecuador 981 and 18 ; Chile 746 and 2 ; Peru 395 and 5 ; Mexico 367 and 4 ; Colombia 306 and 3 .
( With the exception of Mexico , those governments have all actively participated and contributed to the U .
regime change efforts in Venezuela .
) Why is Venezuela doing so much better than others in the region ?  Skeptics will claim that the Maduro government is hiding figures and deaths , that there 's not enough testing , not enough medicine , not enough talent to adequately deal with a pandemic .
But here are the facts :  Second , the government quickly carried out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 12 , a day before the first confirmed cases , President Maduro decreed a health emergency , prohibited crowds from gathering , and cancelled flights from Europe and Colombia .
On March 13 , Day 1 , two Venezuelans tested positive ; the government cancelled classes , began requiring facemasks on subways and on the border , closed theaters , bars and nightclubs , and limited restaurants to take-out or delivery .
It bears repeating that this was on Day 1 of having a confirmed case ; many U .
states have yet to take these steps .
By Day 4 , a national quarantine was put into effect ( equivalent to shelter-in-place orders ) and an online portal called the Homeland System ( Sistema Patria ) was repurposed to survey potential COVID-19 cases .
By Day 8 , 42 people were infected and approximately 90% of the population was heeding the quarantine .
By Day 11 , over 12 .
million people had filled out the survey , over 20,000 people who reported being sick were visited in their homes by medical professionals and 145 people were referred for coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venezuela would have 3,000 infected people and a high number of deaths .
Third , the Venezuelan people were positioned to handle a crisis .
Over the past 7 years , Venezuela has lived through the death of wildly popular leader , violent right-wing protests , an economic war characterized by shortages and hyperinflation , sanctions that have destroyed the economy , an ongoing coup , attempted military insurrections , attacks on public utilities , blackouts , mass migration and threats of U .
military action .
The coronavirus is a different sort of challenge , but previous crises have instilled a resiliency among the Venezuelan people and strengthened solidarity within communities .
There is no panic on the streets ; instead , people are calm and following health protocols .
Fourth , mass organizing and prioritizing people above all else .
Communes and organized communities have taken the lead , producing facemasks , keeping the CLAP food supply system running ( this monthly food package reaches 7 million families ) , facilitating house-by-house visits of doctors and encouraging the use of facemasks in public .
Over 12,000 medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to be trained for house visits .
For its part , the Maduro administration suspended rent payments , instituted a nationwide firing freeze , gave bonuses to workers , prohibited telecoms from cutting off people 's phones or internet , reached an agreement with hotel chains to provide 4,000 beds in case the crisis escalates , and pledged to pay the salaries of employees of small and medium businesses .
Amid a public health crisis -- compounded by an economic crisis and sanctions -- Venezuela 's response has been to guarantee food , provide free healthcare and widespread testing , and alleviate further economic pressure on the working class .
The U .
government has not responded to the Maduro administration 's request to make an exception for Conviasa Airlines , the national airline under sanctions , to fly the Venezuelans stranded in the United States back to Caracas .
Given everything happening in the United States , where COVID-19 treatment can cost nearly $35,000and the government is weighing the option of prioritizing the economy over the lives of people , perhaps these Venezuelans waiting to go home understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economically -- are much better in a country that values health over profits .
