Recommend0  Salman  Mar 28 , 2020 05:35am  @Shaikh Abdul Rasheed , the people who returned from iran are all kept in quarentine , but the 1,40000 who returned from all over the world , are roaming free .

" By reducing the hours would that not cause more gathering , instead spread out trading so people could spread their shopping hours instead of crowding , is that considered or to be considered after comparison , post change , maybe it will be too late .
Unlike India 's Lathi brigade police hitting citizens , Pakistan is doing well , more humane .
Make it easier for shoppers and shopkeepers and the enforcing police too , enforce and restrict entry to shopping area with App controlled time limits per hour on entry and exit counts .
Give electronic passes at the entry , using a tapping system app just like used in transport rides , with non-stop alarm for time out to track those exceeding their time quota .

Recommend0  alirizvi99  Mar 28 , 2020 11:25am  Dear Concern , There are few steps which should take as precautionary measures .
1 : All Groceries /Pharmacies must be open 24/7 so that avoid overcrowded at certain time limit .
2 : Zero Tolerance policy must be applied immediately by LEA as no other options to restrict the people .
3 : The curfew must be imposed by provincial government especially Sukkur and Larkana that could be minimum local transmitted cases .
Suggestion : People strictly follow the government guidelines .
More spend time with family members at home .
Increase spirituality and self assessment .
