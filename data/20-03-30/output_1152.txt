Six months of mourning and depression for Stephen Baxter were washed away the moment Crusaders took to the pitch at Molineux to play Wolves at the start of the season .
The Crues boss had suffered the traumatic loss of his father George after a long illness in January of last year and was left in a low and lonely place .
Stephen and his father enjoyed a very close family bond , George was a regular attendee at Seaview and his passing hit the family circle very hard .
Baxter soldiered on in public , beating Glentoran , Linfield , Ballymena United and Coleraine en route to a victorious Irish Cup Final against Ballinamallard United , but today reveals the feeling of emptiness inside as his thoughts turned to his father .
" For six months , I was in a very lonely place mentally and I struggled with the bigger picture " , he recalls .
" When you have a relationship , a very special relationship , with your father and you have to watch an illness take someone out and you lose that person , you have to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some wise people I know , people who have suffered loss , I guess I nearly had a bit of depression for those six months and I do n't think I 'm completely out of that place .
" It 's funny , as a football manager , you have a public persona and a private one and I was like two different people .
" I had to be Stephen Baxter , the manager , the man with all the encouragement , that drives on other people while on the inside I was feeling completely dead .
" That Irish Cup run was very tricky , we had to get through that run to get to the final against Ballinamallard and the victory on the day was great .
" But because of the overwhelming sense of loss I felt about my father , the Irish Cup paled into insignificance by comparison .
" There was joy okay , but there was no sense of overwhelming achievement , because of the loss of my father .
" Dad died in January and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on holiday with my family to sit in the sun , read books and relax but it was worse , I had more time to think about things .
" It was only when we went to play Wolves at Molineux in the Europa League last July that I started to feel myself again .
" I got there , looked around the stadium and thought ' wow , this is something else ' , and it seemed to kick-start me .
" After all the numbness I had felt , I started to feel a little bit clearer around my emotions , I felt more alive than I had been feeling .
" It was like the flick of a switch , I thought ' I 'm back ! ' and it really helped me .
" Six months later on , I was able to look back and in some way feel glad that I experienced what I was going through , which was the loss of someone very special to me , it was comforting .
" You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are winning trophies or fighting relegation battles you keep your perspective and think about your family and personal life .
" It 's a bit like this coronavirus pandemic , some panic and some take it in their stride and , for me , my faith has always been something I have been able to draw upon since I decided to devote my life to God when I was 19 .
"  Baxter also joined the ranks of senior football at the same age , signing for Ards initially before going on to Linfield , Crusaders , Glenavon , Distillery and Bangor .
As Crusaders team-mate Glenn Dunlop said : " Just because you are a Christian , it does n't make you a coward " , and Baxter really found his spiritual home at Seaview , where Roy Walker was assembling a formidable outfit known as ' The God Squad ' because of the Christians in the group , including Walker himself .
Those players of faith would pray together before joining the likes of Marty Murray and Kirk Hunter in battle on the pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shrinking violet himself as a rangy target man in the 90s but , throughout his career and his life , his faith has been a guiding light and remains relevant to this day .
As society is cowed into isolation by the coronavirus , football is in lockdown until April 29 at the earliest and Baxter told his players to train in isolation ahead of a potential restart .
In these times of hardship , the man from north Down insists there is no better time to turn to God for succour .
" It 's an interesting question ; when the world is faced with a global crisis , where is God in all of it ? " he said .
" The world has faced famines , tsunamis , all sorts of disasters and you ask yourself how you cope with it .
" That 's when you very much have to draw upon your faith and I have been able to find a mechanism to help , even when me , my wife , my daughter and grandson are in isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of rhythm in my day and I start off with early devotion , then do a lot of reading and watching modern worship on YouTube , I think of people who have needed prayers in recent times and I pray for them .
" I tend to find it 's a nice way to still the mind , it helps to pay attention to what is going on around you and who needs a bit of support .
" This is a disease that will take very many lives , there is no vaccine yet , the death toll keeps rising and it really brings into focus the elderly and the vulnerable in our society .
" It gives us time to think about why we are here and how we can help our fellow man in times of strife , and it brings me back to creation - you are born for a time , you live for a time then you 're gone .
" I have tried to use my time wisely , not to panic , be well informed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so important .
