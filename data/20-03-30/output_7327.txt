Taco Bell is still working to serve customers with drive-thru and delivery orders .
As an added bonus for those who order at the drive-thru , the chain is giving out free Doritos Locos Tacos tomorrow .
Taco Bell has been keeping customers updated on the ways they are adjusting their policies to provide for people in their communities .
Free Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Tacos will be available on Tuesday , March 31 at participating locations , but this is just a small portion of what the taco joint is doing during this time .
For one , the Taco Bell Foundation is donating $1 million to No Kid Hungry , and organization that aims to help end child hunger in America .
The " round up " program will also be implemented at stores so customers can benefit No Kid Hungry .
When you order , you 'll be asked if you want to round up your total to the next dollar , and the difference will go to No Kid Hungry as well .
Along with this , Taco Bell recognizes the individuals who are working on the front lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive-thru only at the moment , meaning ambulance and truck drivers can not easily pull through and order if need be .
The chain is looking to find a solution for this , and will be serving other essential workers like healthcare workers , teachers , and grocery store employees by turning their Taco Trucks into mobile commissaries .
Taco Bell has also extended its free delivery offer through GrubHub for all orders $12 and up .
On its website , Taco Bell ensures that they are staying up to date with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and will be changing their policies and offers as needed .
