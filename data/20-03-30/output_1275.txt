You know all those stories of leaky cloud buckets taken offline ? Well , some may still be there , just badly hidden  Plus , Google warns of fake journo phishing attacks  Takedown does n't quite take down everything  Last week , The Registercovered the story of how VPNmentor found and ultimately got a public-facing Amazon-hosted S3 bucket containing financial records of thousands of small businesses removed from view .
In that story , it was reported the misconfigured bucket in question was removed in January after AWS was notified .

However , some outfits will just remove the bucket 's public index , thinking that will hide or obscure the contents , which is not a safe thing to do .
