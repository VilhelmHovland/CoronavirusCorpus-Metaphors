Forum : No country can fight this pandemic alone  The coronavirus pandemic is neither the first nor will it be the last pandemic .
We also can not be sure that it will be the worst .
Viruses mutate all the time .
As the ice in both the North and South Poles melts , who knows what devilish concoction hidden in it for aeons will be released ?  Some think that the mainland Chinese brought the world the coronavirus by eating all kinds of wild animals .
Perhaps , but go to the markets of Africa and other parts of Asia and you can find the body parts of all phyla of the animal kingdom on sale as food .
Not that the existence of one should justify the others , but it means none should be pointed to as a sole culprit .
Even if China had recognised the danger of the virus , it could not have exterminated it .
None can , even now .
It would still have spread sooner or later .
The West had two months to see how the Chinese were suffering .
Leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , instead , they adopted an attitude that I liken to the Chinese idiom " watching the fire burn on the opposite shore " .
Some in the West even described the preventive measures taken by other countries as " draconian " , " restricting human rights " and " authoritarian " .
Recent events also prove how much Malaysia and Singapore need each other .
The Malaysians want jobs .
We need their services .
They have food to sell .
We panic if we do not have their products .
What happens to one country may affect the whole world .
No country can be an island .
Not even a superpower .
