The hospital is caring for a high number of coronavirus patients .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurers Cigna and Humana are waiving customer cost-sharing and co-payments for all treatments related to the Coronavirus strain COVID-19 , President Trump announced Sunday at the White House .
" That 's a lot of money they are waiving , " Trump said of Cigna and Humana in a press conference after the announcement .
The coverage moves unveiled Sunday are significant and take effect Monday and run through May 31 for all Cigna customers while there is yet " no end date " from Humana health plans .
The waiver of co-payments include both in-network and out-of-network medical care providers treating patients with the Coronavirus strain COVID-19 .
" Our customers with COVID-19 should focus on fighting this virus and preventing its spread , " Cigna president and chief executive officer David Cordani said Sunday in a statement accompanying the disclosure by Trump .
" While our customers focus on regaining their health , we have their backs .
"  The decisions by Cigna and Humana are the latest by health insurance companies that are expanding coverage and eliminating plan member cost-sharing for everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultations for screening of the disease .
But the efforts by Cigna and Humana are likely more significant to customer finances and access to care because co-payments for hospitalizations and related cost-sharing for all treatment beyond a diagnostic screening or office visit are likely more expensive for the health plan .
The expansion of coverage also comes as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus hurtled toward 140,00 on Sunday .
" We know we 're uniquely positioned to help our members during this unprecedented health crisis , " Humana president and CEO Bruce Broussard said in a statement Sunday afternoon .
" It 's why we 're taking this significant action to help ease the burden on seniors and others who are struggling right now .
No American should be concerned about the cost of care when being treated for coronavirus .
"  The treatments that Cigna is covering are those " covered under Medicare or other applicable state regulations " such as hospital admissions , home oxygen , albuterol nebulizers and all of the prescription drugs Medicare covers .
" The company will reimburse health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as applicable , " Cigna said .
In Cigna 's case , the new policy applies to its entire book of U .
customers who are covered under the insurer 's " employer/union sponsored insured group health plans , insured plans for US based globally mobile individuals , Medicare Advantage and Individual and Family Plans ( IFP ) .
" Cigna said it is also administering a " waiver to self-insured group health plans " and encouraging employers to participation though these plans " will have an opportunity to opt-out of the waiver option .
"  Humana 's said costs related to subsequent treatment for COVID-19 , including including inpatient hospital admissions , will be waived for enrollees of " Medicare Advantage plans , fully insured commercial members , Medicare Supplement and Medicaid .
