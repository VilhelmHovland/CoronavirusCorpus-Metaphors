As the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold , the staff at Mount Sinai Brooklyn is documenting its experience with regular dispatches .
Our second installment is with Claudia Garcenot , the hospital 's chief nursing officer , who is seeing more and more of her nursing staff call out sick with COVID-19 each day .
Amid constant staffing shortages , she 's dealing with the sickest patients she has ever seen , fielding frantic calls from family members , and making unbearable decisions about whether families will be able to visit their loved ones before they die .
I start every day around midnight , when I make a phone call to find out what 's going on with staffing the following day .
And then , of course , inevitably , around 4:30 a .
, I get phone calls as my people start to call out sick .
Friday night was really bad .
We had four sick calls and another five people who called to say they were COVID-positive .
So that 's nine nurses I lost Friday .
And they 're out for seven to 14 days .
We 're a small hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of six could potentially be very short .
For the most part , my staff tends to seem better after a week or ten days .
Then , every once in a while , there 's that outlier .
I have this young nurse who 's in her early 30s , who texted me about an hour ago , " I ca n't breathe .
I 'm going to the emergency room .
" It just seems like it 's different for everyone , which I think makes it so challenging .
It 's the unknown that makes you so crazy .
Everybody 's getting sick -- respiratory therapists , cleaning people .
We have to get creative .
We bring in more of the non-nursing staff .
We put teams together of two to three people where there will be one nurse and a couple of other people who will work to manage the care for all of the patients .
Our ratios are not where we want them .
That 's not just our hospital ; that 's everywhere .
A critically ill patient is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schnell , M .
The patients are so sick .
Oh my God .
I 've been a nurse for a really long time , and I 've never seen so many people so sick in one space in my entire career .
Now the vast majority of our patients in the hospital are COVID positive .
We probably now have five COVID deaths a day or more , at least at a hospital of 220 beds .
Everybody is so weak .
Everybody has temperatures ; everybody 's congested .
They 're barely breathing .
They 're kind of like little old crumpled-up fetal-position people .
Some of them came in speaking ; they 're not really speaking anymore .
Just every bit of everything takes so much effort .
We see so many atypical presentations .
Everybody says , Oh , you have a fever .
You have a cough .
You have congestion .
You know , you have shortness of breath .
But some people do n't have that .
They 'll just have one symptom .
One patient came in complaining of back pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is n't a new back pain .
And eventually they did a CAT scan and a chest X-ray and found that he had pneumonia .
And that 's what prompted them to test him for COVID .
But he would never have been one of the people that we would have thought .
Every morning , I go through the symptoms in my mind .
Do I have a sore throat ? I do n't think so .
Do IHave any joint pain ? No , I feel okay .
Do I have a temperature ? I take my temperature twice a day .
When do you ever take your temperature twice a day ?  Medical staff intubate a patient in respiratory failure using a laryngoscope while watching a video feed of the patient 's larynx to confirm the appropriate placement of the endotracheal tube .

My daughter every day says to me , " Mom , I really do n't want you to go to work .
What happens if you get sick ? " You know , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartstrings every day .
I 'm 62 .
I 'm worried about my health because I think we all need to worry about it .
But I 've been a nurse for a really long time .
I was a nurse during the AIDS epidemic .
Nurses do this stuff , right ? We walk into the unknown and say , Okay , we 'll just do all the things to protect ourselves and then keep going .
I am thinking more about the patients , and about the other nurses , because how am I going to care for 200-plus patients if 50 percent of my nurses go out sick ?  The thing is that -- and I know everybody would say this about their field -- nurses are different .
The doctor comes in for 20 minutes , maybe 30 minutes , spends that time with your patient and leaves .
But the nurses are there for 11 .
hours every day with that patient , with that family -- they know their fears , they know the intimate details of their health , their personal lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathroom .
You 're doing a million things that makes you so intimately involved with patients .
And then we turn around three weeks ago , and we say , " Guess what , folks ? No visitors .
" Starts to cry .
I found that to be such an overwhelming comment to have to make to the patients .
I do n't know how the patients are doing it .
I do n't know how the families are doing it .
You know , my husband died three years ago .
He was really sick .
Every time Dennis went into the hospital , I went with him and I stayed with him and I never left .
And I say to my kids all the time , " Imagine if this was now and daddy was sick now .
" Knowing that he just had a few weeks left or whatever , I would be that crazy person trying to sneak in the hospital all the time .
I know I would .
I 'm trying my best to support the families .
So , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in .
They get a report on every patient on the floor and then they call the families to say , " Mom did okay last night .
We medicated her for pain .
She 's comfortable .
She 's gon na get out of bed today .
" Whatever we can give them so that they feel a little bit connected .
Before we started doing that , we were getting like 10 calls a day from every single family member of every patient .
If someone is actively dying , then we call the families , and we do allow them to come in .
But imagine : You know that that 's the call , right ? I 'm calling you and I 'm saying , Hurry up .
Get here .
Because this is it .
This is the last time you 're going to see your mom or your dad or your whomever .
When a doctor calls a family and says , " There 's nothing else I can do .
I 've done everything I can for your mom , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse managers on the floor hysterical , saying , " Please , please , please let me come in and see my mom before she dies .
" And every day we have to make that decision .
I do n't want to play God .
We 're at the point where the person has to be really actively dying for their families to come in .
But then you worry that if they do n't get there in time , you did n't do it early enough .
So there 's so much weight on the nursing staff .
The other day , we had these two daughters who were so hysterical .
I did n't really know that the mom 's death was imminent , but I spoke to the nurse manager on the floor and I said , " Let 's bring them in .
Give them five minutes .
" I think if , God forbid , something happened to this woman , they will not be able to get by for the rest of their lives if we do n't do this for them .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to get them all gowned up .
Everything takes an hour now .
And my nurse managers are just an emotional wreck .

Nurses are generally a very warm group , and now you ca n't even give somebody a hug if they 're afraid .
You 've got to keep six feet .
And you 've got so many other things to do .
We 're losing the human side because we 're trying to save the life .
The worst part is that you know that this person that you 've been taking care of for four or five days is probably not going to make it .
And we do n't usually know that about our patients .
You know that about some .
But , for the most part , you think you 're going to send the vast majority home .
Now the pendulum is swung the other way .
We 're probably not going to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had 30 vents in use -- 220 beds , 30 vents .
That 's an unbelievable percent of ventilators for a small hospital .
It does n't seem very likely that most of them will come off it .
I read on Facebook the other day that some 95-year-old lady went home .
I hope that 's really true .
I have n't seen a lot of 94-year-old people go home from us .

Shearer Peter Shearer , the hospital 's chief medical officer tells me that they 're claiming the peak could arrive in two weeks .
I can only hope that 's true .
I can probably keep my head above water for the next two weeks and get ready for whatever 's next .
And in that time , my expectation is that I 'll have a number of nurses who have been out sick because of COVID come back and then my workforce will be replenished .
We need to maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we need to keep taking care of our patients , and cross our fingers and hope that it really does peak in two weeks .
I 'd like if you could highlight the hero work of the nurses .
I am so proud and overwhelmed and in awe of the nurses .
I 'm just so honored to be leading them .
Because these are the people that every day come in , no matter what 's going on at home , no matter what they 're worried about , and they spend 11 .
hours taking care of somebody else .
I 'm just in awe of them .
I really am .
Every day , I look at them and I think to myself , I do n't know if I could do that .
If it was 20 years ago for me , could I do what they 're doing ? I do n't know .
