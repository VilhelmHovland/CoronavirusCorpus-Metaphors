WASHINGTON Siding with public health experts ' dire projections , President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to extend restrictive social distancing guidelines through the end of April , while bracing the nation for a coronavirus death toll that could exceed 100,000 .
" Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days , " Trump said during a Rose Garden press conference .
He called refraining from public outings " our shared patriotic duty " during the outbreak .
The comments came a day after Trump made a dramatic course reversal and announced that he would not be moving to ease the guidelines and get the economy back up and running by Easter , as he said last week he hoped to do .
In the face of stark projections from his team and searing images of overwhelmed hospitals in his native New York City , Trump instead extended to April 30 the social distancing guidelines , which had been set to expire Monday .
Many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings .
" The worst that could happen is you do it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trump said during a nearly hourlong call-in interview with " FOX &amp; Friends " as members of his coronavirus task force fanned out across other media outlets to warn the virus ' spread was only just beginning .
Anthony Fauci , the government 's top infectious disease expert , said Sunday the U .
could experience between 100,000 to 200,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic .
