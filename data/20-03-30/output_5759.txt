When small might be beautiful  If community transmission can be mitigated or avoided altogether in the small population through extraordinary human-centred measures , the Seychelles may continue to report some of the lowest numbers of confirmed cases in the Indian Ocean .
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted almost every country around the world , including small island African nations such as the Seychelles .
As transmission rates vary from place to place , the management of this outbreak has been highly influenced by the response measures adopted by each country .
At the time of writing , the Seychelles has confirmed an eighth imported case of the coronavirus and continues to see no evidence of community transmission .
This is currently proving to be something of an anomaly in the region .
The smallest country to form part of Africa with a population roughly numbering 95,000 , the Seychelles is reporting far fewer cases than other Indian Ocean islands , which may point to successful initial control measures .

Located 4 degrees south of the Equator , the Seychelles archipelago is geographically distanced from much of the world but remains well-connected via technology .
This means information -- and information overload -- about the coronavirus is very much a feature of this public health crisis on the islands as well .
In a bid to stem the flow of false information , the Ministry of Health has opted for social media and daily press updates to keep members of the public informed about confirmed case numbers , testing results and the status of quarantined persons .
Transparency and the continuous provision of information has thus proved pivotal in stemming fears and panic buying behaviours among the populace .

All learning centers , including the University of Seychelles , were shut down indefinitely .
Travel advisories banned all Seychelles residents from travelling overseas for 30 days .
Social distancing measures were also put in effect ; a four-person limit on public gatherings has been imposed to further prevent the spread of the virus .

The national airline Air Seychelles has suspended flights until April 2020 .

Ironies further abound ; the Seychelles is classed as the only high-income country on the African continent , but 40% of the population is reported to live in poverty .

With tourism being the biggest income and foreign exchange earner for the country , national concerns lie between balancing the public health needs versus the economic fragility of the country .
