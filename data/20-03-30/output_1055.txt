Questor : our income feels the impact of the coronavirus crisis -- the portfolio 's first dividend cut  Shares in Crest Nicholson have fallen by about 55pc relative to our purchase price  That did n't take long .
Yesterday morning the first of our holdings announced a dividend cut as a result of the coronavirus crisis .
Crest Nicholson , the builder , said it would no longer pay a final dividend for the year to October 2019 , which shareholders had been due to approve at its annual meeting next week .
As a result , all that we will receive for the full year is the interim dividend of 11 .
, paid in October .
That takes the yield down to 2 .
relative to our purchase price of 435p in November 2016 .
The company said : " The board has carefully considered this week 's rapidly evolving government guidance in respect of Covid-19 and expects this to have a significant impact on visitor levels , production capability and trading performance over an unclear timeline .
Accordingly , the company has taken the difficult decision to cancel its final dividend .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to our purchase price and by 62pc since a recent peak of 519p last month .
However , this is always of less concern to us than income .
Coronavirus is temporary ( we hope ) while Britons ' determination to own their own home is immutable .
Demand will return and so will dividends .
We will hold .
Update : Next  Instead of announcing a final dividend as it normally would , it said it would pay a " second interim " dividend of 116 .
( the same figure it intended to pay as a final ) in August but retain the option to delay payment by up to three months if it needed to retain cash in the business because of the virus crisis .
Proposing a final would have committed the firm to the payment ; the new approach gives it more flexibility .
Next added : " In the event the business needed to conserve cash , we could suspend both the August 2020 and January 2021 dividends , which would retain ? 220m in the group .
" It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We applaud the firm for this pragmatic approach and hope and believe that the dividend will be paid .
Questor says : hold  Ticker : NXT  Share price at close : ? 40 .
Update : OneSavings Bank  The buy-to-let lender also announced annual results yesterday and there was reassuring news about its dividend .
The situation is slightly complicated by the merger with Charter Court , completed in October , but the dividend was as expected .
The board recommended a final payment of 11 .
, which gives a full-year figure of 16 .
It said : " Together with the pre-merger Charter Court interim dividend of 4 .
, this is in line with our target dividend payout ratio .
"  The bank 's statement included a long list of possible ways in which the virus could affect it .
But the fact that it is choosing to pay the dividend reassures us that it does n't expect a severe impact .
In Questor 's view , its borrowers should be able to make their repayments , backed by rental income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does not strike us as likely .
In the absence of a lengthy shutdown , properties should retain their value and savers should continue to deposit their money with the bank to allow it to fund its loans .
Update : bonds  Some of our bonds have been affected by the crisis : the Paragon Bank bond is now 38pc below par value , Ladbrokes is 29pc below and LendInvest 26pc below .
Ladbrokes ' parent company has put out a reassuring statement on its financial position in connection with the virus impact , while the other two have said nothing ; the listing rules would force an announcement if there were something material to say .
We will of course keep all under a close watch .
Hold .
