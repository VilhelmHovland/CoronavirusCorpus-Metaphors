Do the consequences of this lockdown really match the threat ?  OPINION : As the Covid-19 picture emerges , it is vital to continually assess our response .
The virus was identified quickly and tests developed .
We are acquiring knowledge about it at a great rate .
As cases mount across the world , a picture is also emerging of the effect of the virus on populations , which , as an epidemiologist , is my interest .
Unprecedented social controls have been rapidly thrust upon us .
The justification initially was not overloading intensive care facilities , but we have now moved beyond that to " flushing out the cases we already have " .
The duration of the lockdown is uncertain .
It is also unclear how much of a financial hit the country is willing to stomach .
We know this virus is serious , but exactly how serious ? How does the case-fatality rate , a measure of the importance of the disease , compare with other similar viruses ?  As a rough guide , the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention uses rates of between 0 .

This is clearly an important statistic to attend to , but it is easy to get this wrong -- very wrong .
Alvaro Barrientos/AP  Italy has had a large number of deaths , but many may have been attributed to Covid-19 when they were not .
Its overall deaths are much the same as during the flu season two years ago , writes epidemiologist Simon Thornley .
The calculation is skewed , initially , because sicker patients are tested first , making the infection appear more serious .
Also , in determining fatalities , uncertainty arises in patients who are otherwise sick with a limited life expectancy , who then test positive and subsequently die .
Should they be labelled as Covid-19 deaths ?  Remember swine flu in 2009 ? Initial estimates of case-fatality rates were about ten times higher than those calculated once the dust had settled .
It turned out that swine flu , that year 's killer virus , was no more harmful than seasonal flu .
DEBORAH WINKLER  Deaths among positive-tested passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But this was among a largely elderly population .
So let 's look at a couple of examples where more comprehensive testing has been completed .
The Diamond Princess ship is one of the few examples of a closed population who were all tested for the disease .
Seven deaths occurred in 700 test-positive patients , giving us a case-fatality rate of 1 per cent .
Remember , this was an elderly population .
Calculations show that , if these rates were translated to a Western country 's overall age structure , the statistic would be 0 .
per cent ( interval of plausible values : 0 .
per cent to 0 .
per cent ) , higher than normal flu ( 0 .
per cent ) , but not by much .
The figures of up to 900 deaths a day in Italy are alarming , and so is the nation 's crude case-fatality rate of 9 per cent .
However , a recent analysis of the deaths in Italy shows that only a small fraction were entirely due to Covid-19 , occurring in people with no co-morbidities ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many deaths were hastily labelled as Covid-19 related when they were not .
As the average age of those dying is 80 , that is not surprising .
This kind of seasonal epidemic of deaths has occurred frequently in elderly populations living in this region for some years .
Another question to ask here is whether Covid-19 represents an added burden on top of usual seasonal viruses .
After all , admissions to hospital , intensive care , and deaths occur at a background rate .
Time-series plots of overall deaths in European countries show surprisingly low rates for this time of year , even in heavily affected countries , such as Germany , Spain , France and Italy , even in the over-65 age group .
Italy has the most dramatic increase , but no higher than occurred during the same season two years ago .
David Keyton/AP  Swedes are continuing to gather in cafes , as the government has not yet ordered people to stay at home .
Schools , kindergartens and sports clubs also remain open .
Is a " lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meta-analysis of social distancing measures for avoiding viral chest infections found that such an intervention was not strongly supported , since little evaluation of these policies had been done .
Of all the preventive measures that were examined , improving hand hygiene had the best supporting evidence .
It remains to be seen whether lockdown will result in " flattening the curve " , but we do n't have strong evidence in favour .
Despite my scepticism , Covid-19 does pose a real risk to our health .
Sensible measures include better hand hygiene , ensuring good cough etiquette , and restricting large gatherings .
Limiting exposure for the elderly , and people with chronic conditions , makes sense .
It is important that the public health response matches the threat posed to our health .
It is important we keep abreast of developments , such as tests of immunity , so that we can return to normality quickly .
We do n't want to squash a flea with a sledgehammer and bring the house down .
I believe that other countries , such as Sweden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
