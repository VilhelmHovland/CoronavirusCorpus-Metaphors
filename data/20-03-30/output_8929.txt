The current U .
health care system is analogous to the U .
military 's " hard power " -- the acute , advanced , highly effective , highly resource-intensive response to a military crisis ( or in this case , the immediate illness threatened by COVID-19 ) .
American health care 's " hard power " is immense , powerful and effective , arguably the best in the world .
Yet , U .
health outcomes lag behind nearly every other high-income nation , even though we spend more and more of our national treasure on medical care .
What the U .
is missing is sufficient health-focused " soft power " : proactive , vigorous , coordinated , well-funded preventive and public health actions outside of the acute health care system .
For the military , soft power includes the nation 's actions on diplomacy , economic development , trade agreements , foreign aid or sanctions , and promotion of education , women 's rights and democracy .
ADVERTISEMENT  To improve the nation 's health , soft power should include education , surveillance and monitoring , scientific research , public health leadership and infrastructure .
Systems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be implemented in this soft power approach .
Additionally , soft power should encompass community urban design , a healthy food system that not only ensures food security but is also sustainable in its production .
Moreover , vaccines , tax policy and other economic incentives that reward consumers ' healthier choices and businesses that produce healthier products .
Policy should include taxation of hazardous products , child-resistant packaging , product labeling , and quality and safety standards for air , water , housing , food products , toys , mattresses , cars , and much more .
Over several decades , our elected officials , military leaders and intelligence experts have overwhelmingly recognized and endorsed the crucial need for highly coordinated , well-resourced , intensive soft power to identify and address disputes , instability and other national security threats .
They 've managed to do so in a preemptive , cost-efficient and effective manner .
Accordingly , our soft power infrastructure for national security has been greatly expanded , modernized and coordinated .
Yet , inexplicably , this has not happened in health care .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of soft power for health : effective surveillance , public health infrastructure , scientific research and expertise , interagency coordination , community efforts , education , business innovation and government policies to maintain and improve health , many of which are belatedly being employed in our battle against this pandemic .
ADVERTISEMENT  Our hospitals , doctors , nurses and other health care professionals are doing an amazing job fighting on the health care front lines .
Yet , the burden of winning this war can not be placed on their shoulders .
We are recognizing as a nation that our health care system may soon be outnumbered and overwhelmed by patients who contract the disease .
COVID-19 is a stark message that looking beyond this immediate crisis , it is time to assess and develop a proactive , vigorous , coordinated and well-funded preventive and public health strategy and infrastructure to keep our nation healthy and safe into the future .
