Markets have crashed before  I am old enough to remember the 1987 crash on Black Monday , one of the fastest in history .
I remember how the FTSE 100 crashed during the technology bubble , in the weeks after 9/11 , and of course the financial crisis in 2008 .
It always comes as a shock .
Investors look at their pensions and Stocks and Shares ISAs , and see they are worth less than before .
That hurts .
Many respond by diving into safer assets , such as cash and gold , and you might be tempted by that right now .
The FTSE 100 could fall further .
In the financial crisis , it fell by half .

Look for firms with strong balance sheets , loyal customers , steady cash flows and low debt , as these will be better placed to survive and profit at the expense of weaker rivals .

And with the Covid-19 virus now beginning to spread beyond of China and Italy , it seems very likely that the bull market we 've enjoyed over the past decade could finally be coming to an end .
Against such a backdrop of market worry , it 's little wonder that many investors are starting to panic .
