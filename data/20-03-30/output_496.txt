Coronavirus complicates the work of Carroll County food pantries  David Benedict and Jacob Hill prepare to distribute food to Carroll Food Sunday clients on Thursday , March 26 .
( Jon Kelvey )  The East Middle School parking lot in Westminster was marked with traffic cones and signs Thursday morning , the better to keep those coming by to receive bags of shelf-stable food and the Red Cross and Carroll County Emergency Management team staff distributing those bags at a good 6-foot remove from one another -- the healthy separation recommended as part of the " social distancing " designed to help slow the transmission of the novel coronavirus .
" One of the biggest pieces with social distancing is to make sure that we as the people that are facilitating this are meeting this goal , " said Celene Steckel , director of the Carroll County Department of Social Services , from 6 feet behind a table where she was watching the food distribution services .
" You can have all the literature you want , but you have to constantly remind people .
"  Advertisement  Over the course of several hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carroll County Food Sunday , drove or walked through the East Middle lot to get food , an example of modifications food banks and pantries are making in order to continue to serve their clients at a time when large groups can no longer congregate .
Maryland Gov .
Larry Hogan limited gatherings to 10 people on March 19 .
As of late Saturday , the coronavirus had resulted in some 2,000 deaths in the United States out of more than 120,000 who have tested positive for the virus , according to Johns Hopkins University .
The U .
now has the most confirmed cases in the world , followed by Italy with more than 92,000 and China with about 82,000 .
Tuesday and Thursdays were the two days designated for distribution by Carroll County Food Sunday , which normally services clients at the nonprofit 's distillery building location .
But continuing to bring as many as 50 people into close contact with each other and Food Sunday volunteers was deemed too much of a risk even prior to Hogan 's order , according to Executive Director Ed Leister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the public , are facing precarious times at present and it is difficult to know the proper action to take , " Leister wrote in an email .
" Most of our CCFS volunteers are 75-plus years of age and fall in the high risk range to serve .
Now that we are aware that a large number of those who are ill are in the 20-to-40 years age range and the extreme danger to any who are 60-plus years of age , that covers approximately 70% of our clients as well .
"  There will be no further Carroll Food Sunday distributions until further notice , according to Leister , but they are providing food to the Carroll County Emergency Operations Food Collaborative , which not only handled the Food Sunday distribution Thursday instead of the nonprofits ' usual volunteers , but will be tracking community need and finding ways to get meals to people who need them going forward .
" We will be looking to see where the need is and how , how we need to disperse that food , whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the doorstep if a person can drive they come pick it up , " Steckel said .
" Although county office buildings are closed , our case managers are continuing to do outreach from home .
"  And anyone who has an emergent social services need can still reach staff members at county agencies , Steckel added , as there will be people answering the phones or returning voicemails .

As of Thursday afternoon , however , there did n't appear to be a deep need for food , at least not yet , according to Steckel .
On Tuesday , they served about 80 households that typically patronize Carroll Food Sunday , and by 12:30 p .
Thursday , they had served 68 families .

" Carroll Food Sunday also provides food to people that have children .
And so I think that that 's another reason that there 's not as much of a need coming through , " Steckel said .
" The school system is providing their mass distribution on a daily basis at the different locations throughout Carroll County .
"  There are also other faith-based and nonprofit soup kitchens and food pantries that are there to support people , according to Steckel .
" They 're still operational .
they are still serving , " she said .
" They 've all kind of morphed their model over to if they 're serving food and they used to do a congregate setting , they 're now doing bag lunches for pickup so that people are , are n't doing that in close proximity with each other .
"  Advertisement  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the folks we serve come in to our pantry and are able to shop for what they need and what they like , " said Executive Director Stephanie Halley .
" We 're now doing a drive-up service , still by appointment .
We prepare boxes of food and give them to those who come , respecting social distance directives .
"  TogetherWeOwnIt , a Westminster-based nonprofit that typically provides mentoring , support and recreational opportunities for at risk youth has been delivering meals and dog food to families that need them -- more than 300 as of Thursday .
" We 're still working with the same clientele but what we found is so many more people now are finding themselves in positions where they need services , either because of layoffs or because of temporary loss of jobs or lost wages , " Director Katelyn Kirby said .
" We 've had to amplify what we do and what we offer which has been exceeding the need in this particular situation .
"  Hampstead 's Little Free Pantry is also operating , and since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a donation type of operation , it 's always been compatible with social distancing , according to Jennifer Greenwood , who helped her daughter Makenzie open the the pantry at St .
John 's United Methodist Church in 2017 .

Neighbors leave donations for others to take as they need .
There is never any direct contact between people at the pantry unless they happen to be there at the same time , " Jennifer wrote in an email .
" We have volunteers going by to wipe down the pantry to help minimize the spread of germs .
"  But while Carroll Food Sunday has supplied the Emergency Operations Food Collaborative for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on donations and events which are now disrupted due to the novel corona virus .
" Our inventory relies solely on the generosity of others .
A major event that is held each spring by the Unchained Few Motorcycle Club has been canceled .
They usually collect enough donations to get us through the summer , " Jennifer Greenwood wrote .
" We 're worried about our ability to keep up with demand without this donation .
"  At the Rescue Mission , which typically serves about 100 families per week , the normal sources of food donations are also not flowing as they have before .
( Carroll County Times file )  " Our supply is decreasing .
Some of the stores we pick up from do not have food to donate , " Halley wrote .
" But we are making due and getting creative about how to serve in this time when there is even more need in our community .

" We 've had to close our thrift store temporarily , which is an important source of income for us and helps us to continue with not only our food operations but our Addiction Healing Center , " she wrote .
" We 're working on ways to continue to accept food donations from the individuals in the community with decreased onsite staff and in safe ways .
