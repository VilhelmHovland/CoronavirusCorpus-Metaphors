As the novel coronavirus continues to spread , pregnant women report concerns about how COVID-19 could affect them and their unborn babies .
" Most people who acquire COVID-19 will recover fully with minimal risk .
This is true for pregnant women as well .
"  Here , Justin Brandt , an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the division of maternal-fetal medicine at Rutgers University Robert Wood Medical School , discusses some common questions regarding pregnancy and the coronavirus :  Q  Are pregnant women more at risk if they contract COVID-19 ?  A  Although preliminary data about COVID-19 and pregnancy was reassuring , we have seen reports in the US of some pregnant women having severe illnesses .
Pregnant women experience physiologic changes in their chests that may make them more susceptible to viral respiratory infections .
Based on our growing clinical experience with COVID-19 and our prior experience with SARS and MERS , which are also coronaviruses , women with COVID-19 might be at greater risk for pregnancy complications .
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Health Service from Great Britain are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth , and fetal growth restriction if they have COVID-19 .
Q  What should a pregnant woman do if she thinks she is infected ?  A  Women should call their obstetrician and let them know their concerns .
If symptoms are severe , they may need to be evaluated in the hospital .
However , most women , even if pregnant , have mild symptoms and likely will not have to seek medical attention .
My colleagues and I are triaging these calls over the phone to ensure that potentially ill patients are evaluated at the hospital while most are staying home .
Patients at home with mild symptoms need to self-quarantine for a minimum of 14 days .
They should not go to their routine prenatal visits until they have spoken to their doctor 's office and received instructions .
We are encouraging our patients to be forthcoming with symptoms when they call , even mild symptoms , so we can ensure patients get optimal care .
Q  What impact could COVID-19 have on unborn babies ?  A  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the risk of vertical transmission is low .
This means it is unlikely that the virus is transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus .
However , it was recently reported that some newborns of mothers with COVID-19 have virus specific antibodies .
These antibodies , which are IGM subtype , are not usually transferred across the placenta from mother to fetus due to their large molecular size .
This new data has some significant weaknesses , but this finding suggests that antibodies were produced by some babies who were exposed to the novel coronavirus in utero .
We need more data to clarify and corroborate this risk , but there may be reason to worry about vertical transmission and associated conditions , including birth defects , early neonatal disease , and other complications .
At this time , though , the data is just too limited to comment definitively about this risk , and we may be reassured by data about first trimester infection with SARS , another coronavirus , which suggests the risk is low .
We know that neonatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can transmit the infection to children .
The majority of cases of COVID-19 involving children , including newborns and babies , have been asymptomatic or mild .
We need to prevent these infections , though , because there have been reports of severe disease , even deaths , in children .
Q  How is the medical community trying to reduce the risk to pregnant women and their babies ?  A  At our Rutgers Health practice , we have modified our schedule for prenatal visits and obstetric ultrasounds .
We are also using telemedicine as much as possible .
We are doing everything we can to provide optimal prenatal care while minimizing the need for patients to leave their homes .
During this time , expecting parents should check with their physicians and the hospitals in which they plan to give birth as visitor policies are changing frequently .
Patients may be allowed to have one support person on labor and delivery or , in some cases , may not be allowed any visitor .
In addition , many hospitals are screening visitors for fever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to enter a hospital if symptomatic or high risk for COVID-19 .
Pregnant women who have COVID-19 should expect that they will be temporarily isolated from the baby following delivery .
This is in accordance with guidance from the CDC and is intended to minimize the risk of neonatal transmission .
The recent report of a neonatal death in Illinois due to complications from COVID-19 underscore the importance of this policy .
The baby can receive the mother 's breast milk and will be reunited with the mother as soon as transmission-based restrictions are lifted .
Q  What should pregnant women keep in mind right now ?  A  Pregnant women should adhere to the principals of social distancing , stay home , and avoid public gatherings .
If parents must leave their homes , we want them to focus on adequate hand washing , trying not to touch their faces , and keeping a safe distance of at least six feet from people who may be sick or people whose statuses are unknown .
Expecting parents should prepare to be home for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Tylenol , thermometers , and other household items such as soap , toilet paper , and washing detergent .
When possible , patients should take advantage of delivery services rather than going to markets and other stores where people may congregate .
It is safe for pregnant women to be home if they develop mild illnesses .
Most people who acquire COVID-19 will recover fully with minimal risk .
This is true for pregnant women as well .
However , symptoms may worsen rapidly .
Shortness of breath , coughing up blood , inability to tolerate liquids due to persistent vomiting , and changes in mental status such as confusion are symptoms that require urgent medical attention .
In addition , obstetrical complaints such as uterine contractions , vaginal bleeding , and perceptions of less fetal movement also require evaluation .
