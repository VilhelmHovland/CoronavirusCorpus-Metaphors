MEXICO CITY -- As the novel coronavirus spreads in Mexico , doctors and nurses at public hospitals have begun protesting a shortage of personnel and basic supplies such as masks and gloves .
Medical staff held strikes and walkouts across the country this week , warning that a lack of resources increases the risk for them and their families as well as for patients .
" We ca n't work without equipment , " implored a nurse in Tabasco state in a widely viewed video on Twitter .
" We also have families -- children and parents .
"  The federal government says that $150 million in additional medical supplies is on the way and that it is rushing to fill roughly 42,000 job openings for doctors , nurses and other medical professionals that predate the coronavirus crisis .
" We invite health personnel .
to heed the call and commit to the future of this country , to being a person who helps face the epidemic , " Deputy Health Secretary Hugo Lopez-Gatell said Tuesday .
But within the medical community there were growing concerns that the government has moved too slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight a major outbreak of the disease .
One doctor who screens dozens of people a day for COVID-19 at a public hospital in impoverished , populous Mexico state , which includes Mexico City , said she is allotted just two disposable masks for each 12-hour shift .
Ideally she would put on a new mask for each patient .
" We feel unprotected , " said the doctor , who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to give interviews .
Even before COVID-19 arrived in Mexico , which has seen 367 confirmed cases and four deaths , the nation 's health care system was strained .
Lengthy wait times for procedures are common at the country 's vast network of public hospitals and clinics , where most Mexicans receive care .
Often , doctors and nurses have been forced to ask patients to buy them surgical masks , gowns and other basic supplies .
By many accounts , things have gotten worse since President Andres Manuel L ? pez Obrador took office in December 2018 and embarked on a program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populist -- who ran on an anti-corruption platform -- has canceled contracts with drug companies , which he alleged were working with a crooked network of hospital administrators .
That may have been true .
But L ? pez Obrador 's dramatic changes have led to shortages of life-saving drugs .
Two of the groups hardest hit by the shortages are children with cancer and patients with HIV .
Last year , the head of Mexico 's Social Security Institute stepped down and issued an unusual public resignation letter declaring that " excessive savings and controls in health spending are inhumane .
"  L ? pez Obrador 's response to COVID-19 has generated a new wave of criticism .
Compared with other countries in the region , Mexico has been slow to implement preventative measures to stop the spread of the disease .
Mexico had its first confirmed COVID-19 case in late February , yet it was n't until this week that it ordered schools to close and recommended that businesses let employees stay home .
The jacaranda-dotted streets of Mexico City are emptier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain open .
To the chagrin of his critics , L ? pez Obrador has repeatedly contradicted the advice of his own health authorities .
In a video message Sunday , he sat at a table near a supporter in Oaxaca and implored Mexicans to maintain the normal rhythm of their lives .
" Do n't stop going out , " he said .
The Mexican government has held off on implementing more drastic measures because it is deeply worried about its struggling economy .
The peso has fallen dramatically in recent weeks , this week hitting a new record of 25 pesos to the dollar , and prices for basic goods are rising .
At a market on Mexico City 's west side , the price of a pound of chicken rose by 25 cents in a week , a major jolt in a country where the minimum wage is about $5 a day .
On Tuesday , Lopez Obrador implored business leaders to not lay off employees and said his government would grant loans to some small businesses to help them stay afloat .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personnel and supplies , though he said Mexico was prepared for an onslaught of COVID-19 cases .
On Twitter , political analyst Denise Dresser said Mexicans deserve more details about those preparations .
" What we wanted to hear : We need to equip hospitals , manufacture ventilators , sew face masks , train doctors and nurses and ask for help from industries and laboratories and factories so they can focus on producing what is urgent and necessary , " she wrote .
Of growing concern is the number of COVID-19 tests available in Mexico .
Authorities have given a range of figures , from about 9,000 to 35,000 .
The government has conducted fewer than 3,000 tests , primarily in people who recently traveled to areas with significant numbers of infections .
The World Health Organization has recommended that all suspected cases be tested .
Even at private hospitals , where tests are more readily available , patients have reported long lag times in getting results .
Ariana Sawyer , a human rights worker who recently traveled to France and California , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico City on March 15 after falling ill .
Nine days later , she still had n't received results , though doctors said it was " probable " that she was infected and ordered her to self-quarantine at home .
She said she is worried about the disease spreading to poorer communities in Mexico or migrant camps along the U .
border , where there are unhygienic conditions " and people do n't have access to social distancing .
"  " It 's going to be devastating for them , " she said .
