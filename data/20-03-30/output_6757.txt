When UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov shockingly announced he was stuck in Russia on Monday without a way to cross the border to get to his UFC 249 main event battle against Tony Ferguson on Apr .
18 , several of the other top athletes in the UFC began publically lobbying for the opportunity .
But now it seems four of the best 170-pound UFC welterweights would also like to get in on the action .
Per MMA Fighting 's Damon Martin , both UFC champion Kamaru Usman and Jorge Masvidal have indicated they 'd be willing to climb inside the Octagon to face each other next month at UFC 249 .
That same outlet suggests former champion Tyron Woodley and former interim champion Colby Covington would also like to compete against each other at UFC 249 .
It 's not clear if both huge fights could be considered for UFC 249 now that Nurmagomedov 's fight against Ferguson is seemingly off .
It 's also not clear whether Ferguson will continue to compete at UFC 249 against a different opponent .
Regardless , adding Usman-Masvidal or Woodley-Covington to UFC 249 next month would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
And somehow adding both amazing fights to the upcoming pay-per-view card that suddenly needs a main event ?  On such short notice during the unprecedented coronavirus pandemic ?  That would be a miracle .
Both Woodley and Covington Lobby for UFC 249 Gigs  Both Woodley and Covington have seemed interested in facing each other over recent months .
In fact , when the COVID-19 outbreak sunk the UFC 's original plans for its UFC on ESPN+ 29 card in London on March 21 , Covington lobbied hard for the chance to face Woodley in the event somewhere in the U .
before the card was ultimately canceled .
Both are top-flight welterweights .
Woodley was originally supposed to face Leon Edwards next but the UFC could just as easily tab Covington for the gig instead .
After all , Covington is the No .
1 contender in the welterweight division .
Woodley is ranked No .
" The offer still stands @ufc , " Covington said on Twitter .
" I 'll go full Teddy Roosevelt &amp; beat the breaks off @TWooodley live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free on @ESPN for the people ! Im in such a giving mood I 'll even arrange a tour of the oval office for Tyrone , since Obama never did .
"  The offer still stands @ufc .
I 'll go full Teddy Roosevelt &amp; beat the breaks off @TWooodley live from The @WhiteHouse lawn ! Save sports and make it free on @ESPN for the people ! Im in such a giving mood I 'll even arrange a tour of the oval office for Tyrone , since Obama never did .
Masvidal and Usman Both Say They 're Down for UFC 249  Meanwhile , Masvidal and Usman were set for a summer showdown but that assumed headliner never materialized .
Regardless , both Masvidal and Usman said Monday via social media that they were ready to accept the huge welterweight title fight for UFC 249 .
Masvidal is the first-ever UFC " BMF " champ .
Usman is the UFC welterweight champ .
The two seemed on a collision course this year before the COVID-19 outbreak sidelined most of the upcoming sporting events across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both fighters " are saying they 'd be down to fight on April 18 .
"  Jorge Masvidal 's manager said they were willing to accept the fight with Kamaru Usman for April 18 .
Does n't mean it 's happening but now both Usman and Masvidal are saying they 'd be down to fight on April 18 .
