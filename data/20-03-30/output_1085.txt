While morrison no doubt welcomes the generally uncritical support from The Australian and The Guardian , it could be argued that such a perspective omits important issues .
IMHO Bill Botwell is the more correct - our problem is precisely that the politicians want to control outcomes .
After all , none of the experts who are truly expert are elected .
looked to the Gov't to prove its worth ? Found only blather , waffle , lies , motherhood statements , the ANZAC spirit re-birthed ( as in every calamity ) and TOTAL CONFUSION of what actually needed to be doneIf this is all the LNP Gov't thinks we are worth then I despair for the future that faces my grandchildrenCurrent Gov't has proved it is WORTHLESS  Great article , thank you Katharine , very good analysis .
In short , once we come through and out of this coronavirus crisis , I believe the world will go forward into a different place .
I know it 's highly inappropriate to say this right now and I apologise for that , but in the medium and longer term some good may come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than greed and competition .
Some people say that capitalism aligns with human nature , you know , that greed and self obsession are natural .
I have never bought into that , I think capitalism breeds , encourages and fosters greed , inequality and competition , not the other way round .
I 'm not suggesting communism or socialism , just something much better than we 've got now .
Coronavirus : Morrison is first among leaders as world order changesGREG SHERIDANMARCH 28 , 2020  Scott Morrison could become Australia 's most important war-time leader .
His Friday talk with the nation was the best iteration so far of his critical ongoing dialogue with Australia , and Australians .
tone keeps evolving .
It has n't always been perfect .
But it 's getting better .
spoke unambig ? uously as a wartime leader : " I thank you for the great job you 've done this week , Australia .
So far , Morrison has led Australia well in a time of its gravest crisis since World War II .
If he succeeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists only of John Curtin , a leader who got us through , who worried us through , our last existential challenge .
has hit a powerful formulation by saying that he wants " to save lives and save livelihoods " .
It 's good , but do n't overdo it .
When he seemed angry at panic-buying -- " It 's un-Australian , it 's got to stop " -- I thought this tone a mistake , as it seemed as though maybe he was losing control .
But in fact it was probably good to convey how urgent the situation really is .
you do realise that Australia is refusing to stop digging up and burning coal and do anything to limit its emissions ? If Australia was ever to " ensure that China stops digging up coal from the ground to burn " it would probably be only to eliminate competition and be CHina 's coal supplier ( which it already is anyway ) .
Congratulations , Ms Murphy , for an excellent article -- both timely and discerning .
Over recent months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words and otherwise placatory journalism vis- ? -vis the coalition government ; I saw you as desperately trying to find excuses for them where none exist .
But now you have struck a different note altogether : picking out the objective elements that might provide us with the foundations of a positive democratic future , while making plain the criteria this present government must meet if it is to qualify as a candidate for that desirable future .
One certainty in all these crises , the LNP government is incompetent .
Some of the decisions made by Prime Moron and Co have been detrimental .
Good people are going to die because of a lack of leadership and because of incompetence .
Thanks Katharine for keeping up the analysis .
We must not lose ourselves completely in the present .
There will be an end to the measures and a vaccine will be found .
Countries will take time to recover socially , economically and politically .
They will focus inwards and there will be a retreat from globalisation for a period of time but not permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection to best advantage .
Covid-19 is not a 1 in 100 year event .
It may be a 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 year event .
Accordingly , we must look closely at the resilience of political institutions , key sectors of the economy and health systems .
Are they going to be fit for purpose when the next pandemic threatens to cripple the world ?  For me , Australia is the global society of the future and I believe they will the people to lead us out of the wilderness .
, as members of the G20 they must ensure that China stops digging coal out of the ground to burn - or is sold the carbon resource by Germany , North America , the Eastern European countries and Australasia herself - or we will not have a planet to be remade by our Australian friends .
I 'm led to believe that they are quarantined overseas between flightsI may be wrongBut incoming overseas travellers from interstate will have 4 weeks quarantine , 2 weeks at arrival point then 2 weeks in their home state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is CONFUSING  One thing this shows is that even so-called first world economies have third world governments .
In terms of stopping or slowing the spread of the virus they might as well not have existed .
They were more concerned with the health of the stock markets than their populations .
The quicker it spread through the population the quicker they could get back to making bank .
' Boomer remover ' ? Sitting in the UK , young people in Australia who think that need to realise that the result of this virus is n't just going to be &gt;60 year olds dying , there is going to be a lot of their parents and them being seriously ill or dying in hospital .
