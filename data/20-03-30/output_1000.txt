' It 's probably a bit like the Jamaican bobsleigh team .
maybe they 'll make a Cool Runnings of Irish sumo film one day '  Did you ever hear the one about the Irish sumo wrestler ? It may sound like a joke but the love affair between John Gunning and the ancient Japanese sport was nothing of the kind .
The Roscommon man would represent Ireland three times on the World stage , but that 's only part of the story - he talks to Neil Loughran .
John Gunning prepares for battle at the 2007 World Amateur Sumo Championships in Chiang Mai , Thailand .
Picture by Wyndham Hollis  Roscommon man John Gunning ( centre ) is sumo 's first English language commentators , and works for NHK , Japan 's public broadcaster  OVER the course of the last month , the sporting scene in Japan has ground to a halt amid growing fears over the coronavirus spread .
The Nippon Professional Baseball League season had been due to open on March 20 but has been postponed indefinitely .
No matches have been played in soccer 's J League since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tour Champions event which was due to take place in Chiba in June , is cancelled .
The country 's top Rugby Union league , home to World Cup winners Dan Carter , Kieran Read and Brodie Retallick , completed six rounds of games before being suspended .
Those organising the Tokyo Olympics held out for as long as they could before eventually succumbing to the inevitable earlier this week ; the Games will take place in 2021 instead .
And then there 's sumo .
The fact that the sport 's March basho -- a bi-monthly professional tournament - went ahead as planned , albeit behind closed doors , tells you plenty about the ancient attitudes that prevail .
It is a world in which Roscommon man John Gunning has been immersed for 16 years , first as a competitor , then coach , and now as commentator and newspaper columnist .
" Calling off the event completely would undoubtedly have been a safer course of action , " he wrote in the Japan Times earlier this month .
" Closed doors or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Measures are being taken to limit interpersonal contact , but controlling the movement of 700 people day and night for two weeks is a near-impossible task , and if a rikishi becomes infected with Covid-19 , serious questions will be asked .
" The nightmare scenario , of course , would be a member of the general public in the region contracting the virus from someone in the association .
The repercussions for the sport 's governing body in that case would likely be severe and long lasting .
"  After 15 days of competition , the basho came to a close last Sunday .
As that column clip shows , he has no fear of shining a light on uncomfortable issues inside sumo .
Gunning has been outspoken , for example , on the continued freezing out of female participants - a tradition stemming from Shinto and Buddhist beliefs that they are " impure " because of menstrual blood .
Then there 's the " ticking timebomb " of CTE ( Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ) and concussion in an at times brutal , violent arena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the English speaking side of the media so my influence on the sport is probably pretty limited - some people think I 'm the wasp at the picnic and others think I 'm the ultimate yes man .
You can never win , but that 's the nature of the job .
" You 're not as free as you would be in some other countries to say what you want , but I try to push the envelope and ask important questions .
"  The 19 years spent in Japan so far are all interwoven into Gunning 's own sumo story ; from the first day he walked into Komatsuryu Dojo - one the most prestigious clubs in the country - to representing Ireland at three World Amateur Championships before hanging up his mawashi in 2012 .
Having sustained broken bones , shattered teeth and a fractured skull in pursuit of progress , Gunning has earned the right to ask questions .
But here 's one for him : how does a man from Castlerea , the second largest town in the county with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bosom of an indigenous way of life , one whose history and tradition spans centuries ?  Now there 's a story .
**********************  Libido .
No further explanation is required  WALTER Payton , Jim McMahon , William ' The Refrigerator ' Perry -- these were the guys who captured the imagination .
The local GAA club , St Kevin 's , had a decent history of its own , four county titles and one Connacht by that stage .
Castlerea Celtic are one of the oldest soccer clubs in the country .
Manchester United were his team across the pond , despite enduring a decade to forget .
But there was something exotic about American football .
Especially then , especially to a young lad finding his way in mid-80s Ireland .
The razzmatazz , the pageantry , the fanfare and the flash .
those fleeting glimpses snatched at on RTE every now and again left John Gunning intoxicated , craving more .
It was so wildly different to anything else he had seen before ; there was a huge appeal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music was a lifeline to the world beyond county borders too .
The hair rock phase at the latter end of the decade eventually morphed into something a bit dirtier , a bit more raw , thus the early ' 90s Grunge scene was born .
A few weeks back Gunning posted a picture on Twitter of a mocked-up album cover , himself front and centre , long curly locks flowing freely , the main man glaring moodily into the camera like a midlands Michael Hutchence .
Flanked either side by university pals from Mary Immaculate College in Limerick , the magnificently named Libido meant business .
And , by God , they had it all .
Almost .
" We had literally everything going for us -- we had attitude , the look , the desire , " says the 46-year-old , speaking from his Tokyo home .
" The only problem was not one of us had any kind of musical talent whatsoever ; that proved our Achilles heel , unfortunately .
"  Asked to assign a genre to Libido , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- is that a genre ? That 's the only word I can think of to describe it .
The worst possible thing you could imagine .
"  When his degree in media and communications finished up , Gunning spent some time travelling around the US before moving to Italy for a spell .
Ireland called again but his feet had the itch by now and when a friend revealed plans for a holiday in Japan in 2000 , a life-altering change of pace was about to occur .
" I came for two weeks and absolutely fell in love with the place , did n't want to leave at all .
As soon as I went home I quit my job and started applying for jobs in Japan .
" A year later I was living in Osaka and , nearly 20 years on , I 'm still in Japan .
A city like Tokyo , where I live now , you can never reach the end of it .
There are vast sections of the city where I have n't walked around the streets .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at times it feels like you 're living in the future , and then you have the traditional side of things -- like sumo .
I did n't know anything about sumo until I came to Japan , but it was the only thing I could understand on the television because I did n't speak Japanese when I came here .
" I got hooked on it straight away .
"  Gunning had played a bit of semi-pro soccer in a tri-state league in New England , and persevered with the beautiful game when he landed in Japan .
The extreme heat of the summers though , allied to aging limbs and a dodgy knee , accelerated his quest to find something new .
New and exciting , just as the amazing technicolour of American football had been back in the day , something about sumo pulled at him and would n't let go .
" When you go to the tournament itself and you 've got all the sights , sounds and smells , it 's so different from any other sport .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like , professional sumo is not just a sport , it 's a lifestyle .
It 's a cross between sport and being in the military , or living in a monastery ; it 's a 24 hour thing , there 's no separation .
It has n't changed for 350 years .
" Both physically and mentally , it 's extremely taxing .
Their lives are lived essentially the same as they were in the 1800s .
When you go in at first , you have no rights -- 95 per cent of the people in the sport do n't get any salary .
Their stable-master is the ultimate authority , each stable is like a family more than a team .
" I know a Canadian guy who went in a few years ago - I was translating for him - and he asked the stable-master for the wifi code -- the stable-master laughed at him .
He was like ' you 're not allowed to use the internet for the first three years , you do n't need the code , you 're not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a letter once a month to your family in Canada ' .
" This guy was probably 20 , I do n't know if he 'd ever put pen to paper in his life , he 's living on Instagram , and he 's being told he can write a letter ? ! "  The amateur side , which Gunning joined in 2004 and participated in for 10 years , was n't just as brutal -- but did see him double his weight from 60 to 120 kilos in a bid to reach a competitive level .
" I started at 30 , the age most guys retire , and where I did a lot of running in my soccer days , that pretty much switched to all power and strength stuff .
" You do n't have to put on the kind of mass I did because in the amateur side of the game there are weight classes , where in professional sumo everyone fights everyone , but my decision to gain weight was deliberate because the lighter groups are very fast , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of sumo was more suited to a power style than a speed style .
The more weight you have on top of the muscle , the more impact that has when you hit your opponent , and when they hit you , it 's harder to move you .
"  He represented Ireland at the 2007 World Championships in Thailand , 2008 in Estonia and Hong Kong in 2012 but , by his own admission , did n't quite do himself justice on the big stage .
" I never got the results I wanted or thought I deserved , " recalls Gunning , who commentates for NHK , Japan 's public broadcaster , alongside his day job at content director at Inside Sport Japan , a sports media agency he set up in 2017 .
" I was never able to translate what I could do in training into tournaments , which was very frustrating .
I lost fights to people I should never have lost to , in my own mind anyway .
" Once I lost in 2012 it was just : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this .
In the big tournaments it always felt like the body could n't move ; it was as though I was in slow motion .
" Looking back , I think I was always more focused on trying not to lose than winning .
When you 're trying not to lose , you get tense and you do n't move as freely as you should .
In sumo , you 're screwed if that happens .
" Every fight is over in a couple of seconds .
You ca n't work your way into it and come back in the second half , there 's no bad round after which you can adjust your strategy .
There 's nothing .
In sumo , it 's rock , scissors , paper , you throw it out and you either win or you lose .
" You spend a whole year training and then it 's over in a flash .
"  John Gunning never quite managed to find his best form on the big stage , having represented Ireland at three World Championships .
Picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur level , could take an almighty toll , with Gunning 's catalogue of catastrophic injuries telling their own tale .
" I broke teeth , fractured my skull , but my main injury was when the left humerous split up the bottom and right down to my hand .
It was a throw in sumo where a 120 kilo guy just fell on the arm as it was extended and snapped it like a twig .
It split lengthways , top to bottom .
" That arm had been supporting me and when it snapped my head crashed straight into the ground .
I lost sight and hearing for 10 minutes I hit my head so hard .
" It took four months for the bone to start fusing back together , 18 months for them to completely fuse .
I basically had a dead arm that was tied to my body for the first four months because all the nerves had been severed .
" But the thing is , I kept training .
I went in after a month , black and blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach looks at me and says ' are you going to train ? There 's nothing wrong with your legs , is there ? Do some squats ' .
" That 's the sumo mentality .
"  As if the finer details of that injury are n't enough to send the stomach into a spin , Gunning winces as he recalls some of the methods of preparation undertaken to ready himself for battle .
And that 's precisely the reason why he continues to call for some kind of head injury protocol ; because he has seen , and felt , first hand exactly the kind of damage competitors are inflicting upon themselves .
" One of the things we used to do was basically ramming your head into a wooden pole .
At the face off , you drive into your opponent head first , a bit like American football -- only you 're not wearing a helmet .
" That kind of training still happens with kids now , the CTE and concussion issue is a ticking timebomb in sumo because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safer .
It 's basically two massive people crashing into each other from a crouching position -- head to head contact , with full power .
" Some of these guys are 200 kilograms and more .
You hear that massive crack of the head , and we used to practice for that on a wooden pole .
I thought it was toughening up the skull so you got used to the impact - 15 years later it 's like ' what were we doing ? '  " Now we know any kind of impact with the head is not good , yet I 'm the only person I know who raises the issue .
I talk about it a lot but the awareness is not there yet in sumo .
" If or when it does come in it 's going to be very difficult , because what do you change ? What will happen eventually is what has happened to American football in the States where parents do n't want their kids doing it any more .
" Sumo is a rough fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that .
"  What the future holds for this ancient art , nobody knows , but Gunning 's lies in Japan -- " this is my home " -- at the heart of a community he calls his own , despite occasional differences of opinion .
" There was definitely a gap in the market for an Irish sumo wrestler , " he smiles .
" It 's probably a bit like the Jamaican bobsleigh team .
Maybe they 'll make a Cool Runnings of Irish sumo film one day .
