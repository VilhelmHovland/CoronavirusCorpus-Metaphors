Lanka 's economy ca n't recover until the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 traumaPosted on March 30th , 2020  By Shiran Illanperuma courtesy Xinhua  COLOMBO , March 28 ( Xinhua ) -- Global communities and financial institutions must unite to put the world economy back in order amid the COVID-19 pandemic , a senior Sri Lankan economic expert said here Saturday .
Sri Lanka is looking at an economic situation created by circumstances beyond our shores .
The global community must therefore come together to provide a solution to put the world economy back in shape , " Cabraal said .
Cabraal , who is a former Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka , said that Sri Lanka would attempt to tide over businesses and keep the economy afloat amid precautions taken against the spread of COVID-19 in the country .
However , he noted that Sri Lanka 's biggest foreign exchange earners include apparel manufacturing and tourism , both of which rely on external demand which has been contracting due to the impact of COVID-19 on developed economies in the West .
No amount of stimulus packages by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions are not right , " Cabraal said .
Similarly , lower oil prices , while beneficial to Sri Lanka 's import bill , could lead to job losses for Sri Lankan migrant workers in West Asia .
The resulting loss in remittances could negate the benefit of low oil prices , Cabraal said .
The current crisis will need an international response similar to the Bretton Woods system which was set up after World War II to promote reconstruction and recovery of demand , " Cabraal said .
We have to lobby institutions like the G20 , IMF , World Bank and UN to create global policies to address these issues , " he added .
