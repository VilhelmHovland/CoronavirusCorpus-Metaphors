40,000 Ventilators Ordered , Focus on Readiness : Health Ministry  As the total number of cases in India soar to 873 , the government and ICMR held a press briefing to the media on 28 March , to address India 's state of preparedness against COVID-19 .
" There have been 19 deaths so far , 2 came in yesterday and they were elderly .
149 active cases came since yesterday .
Our focus is on the high disease burden hotspots .
With state governments , we are implementing community surveillance , rigorous contact tracing and containment strategies .
"  Lav Agarwal , Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ( MOHFW ) .
This is a fight we will all fight together , said Lav Aggarwal , Joint Secretary , Ministry of Health and Family Welfare .
The current 21-day lockdown is a measure to achieve social distancing and help break the chain of transmission .
One of the big questions that is on everyone 's mind is about community transmission .
Are we there yet ?  ICMR 's Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar had this to say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not giving their travel history .
But this is not a significant number .
People are hiding that they travelled abroad or tested positive , but we need more data before we over-interpret this .
"  Yes , says ICMR .
" We have ordered and received 5 lakh more probes from the US .
IN the labs the current capacity is to test over 1 lakh patients , we have 1 lakh reagents .
People can go to the government or private labs .
"  ICMR added that their current testing strategy is adequate as we are not yet testing to our full capacity due to a paucity of cases .
" We are only testing 30% of our full capacity and have approved 44 private labs today .
Yes , the number of tests done is increasing but not that much .
"  " We have increased the ICMR testing guidelines to include people with severe acute respiratory illnesses as a precaution , " he added .
" There is no need to increase random sampling , " he insists .
ICMR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's super fast kits saying that the purpose of point-of-care kits is in their simple functionality , but " it should n't be that easy that anyone can do it , the general public needs to listen to the advise of professionals for COVID tests .
"  " If there comes a time , we will have point-of-care kits too , " he said .
Focus is on Increasing Health Infrastructure Says Govt  Agarwal added that the focus was on improving the current health infrastructure , and creating dedicated COVID beds , hospitals , isolation centres and more .
" We are working with state and union territory governments to identify specific blocks for the same .
"  Agarwal repeated that the government 's response is a graded one against the evolving situation .
Another major concern is on PPEs for healthcare workers and general equipment at hospitals , and for that Agarwal says that they have " ordered 40,000 ventilators for the country and are working on getting PPEs .
"  " We are sure we will have increased infrastructure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a role in deaths .
" Co-morbidity is a major factor in death cases .
Cardiac condition , hypertension , asthma , diabetes have been seen so far in the death cases .
The age profile , all over and in India , is that the elderly are at a higher risk .
"  Lav Agarwal , Joint Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare ( MOHFW ) .
He added that the government was also focusing on training nurses and doctors on managing and following up with COVID-19 patients and that they were starting online clinical guidance .
Relief for Migrants  The government also responded to the images of migrants walking long distances back to their hometowns .
" We are going to work with state and UT governments to set up relief camps .
We want to bring awareness of these camps to migrant workers through technology , public address systems , NGOs and volunteers , " said the government .
The home ministry also in conversation with state and UT governments to utlise the state disaster fund relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been much confusion about hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) as a prophylactic for high-risk populations such as those in close contact with confirmed cases .
On 23 March , the ICMR had recommended the drug as a prophylactic for specific people , but hoarding of the drug has been reported .
Addressing this , Gangakhedkar said ,  " For now we have been using HCQ if the patient has been admitted with COVID symptoms .
Some trials show that if the patient has COVID and HCQ , their viral load reduces .
"  " ICMR only gave it to healthcare workers as a testing strategy .
We are collecting evidence based on current admitted cases .
Once this data is analysed then we will release it to the public .
For now , this is not for the general public , " it was clarified .
