Only a fraction of the global population has been infected by COVID-19 , but almost all of us are now dealing with the paralysis that comes with a pandemic .
Despite unprecedented circumstances and protective measures , there are some aspects of life that simply can not be postponed , isolated at home or " socially distanced " - and one of these is the health of our animals .
We rely on livestock for a safe supply of milk , meat and eggs in our supermarkets , especially now that the supply chain is under distribution pressure , and we need our pets for comfort even more than usual .
So , while it is wise for governments to take strong actions in the face of a threat like COVID-19 , it is also critical that these restrictions do not put at risk the veterinary services that protect animals .
Like people , animals will inevitably face the same , day-to-day health threats and illnesses that arise outside of a major disease outbreak , and like people , animals will suffer if they and veterinarians can not access vital health supplies .

Carel du Marchie Sarvaas  Executive Director of HealthforAnimals  This is why national governments worldwide must treat veterinary medicines , along with human medicines , as " essential goods " that can continue to cross borders and reach those who need them , even in the throes of a pandemic .
The European Commission has led the way by including animal treatments in its guidelines on essential goods , and it now falls to national authorities in Europe and elsewhere to ensure that veterinary drugs can continue to reach those who need them .
For a start , veterinary medicines are crucial for pets , not just in an outbreak but every day .
If a dog or cat falls ill , they will need to visit a veterinarian just like their owner would need to see a doctor if sick .
In some early reports , however , supplies of veterinary medicines were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wake of the outbreak .
But despite initial mixed messages , it has since been recognised that even in the grip of a pandemic , veterinary practices remain " key services " and can , and should , remain open for pets who fall unwell .
Securing access to animal health care is vital , but even more so in the fall-out of the COVID-19 outbreak , when many owners are facing extended periods of isolation , making healthy pets a lifeline for those living alone or at risk of loneliness .
As we have seen with this outbreak of coronavirus in people , animal and human health are intrinsically linked .
Carel du Marchie Sarvaas  Executive Director of HealthforAnimals  Meanwhile , animal agriculture remains the lynchpin of our global food chain .
Healthy livestock is needed now more than ever to provide safe , plentiful food .
If farmers were unable to access routine vaccinations for their cattle , chicken or pigs , for example , they would be unable to meet food safety standards , meaning livestock can not enter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  An outbreak of animal disease could further threaten the supply chain , leaving families with fewer options for protein , iron and other key nutrients .
By recognising animal medicines as " essential goods , " as the UK has done , governments are helping livestock farmers continue to raise animals safely , not only protecting their own livelihoods but also an important source of food at a time of potential scarcity .
Finally , as we have seen with this outbreak of coronavirus in people , animal and human health are intrinsically linked .
It is vital to keep veterinarians equipped with all the tools needed to do their jobs , to recognise their services as essential businesses , for the sake of animal health , human health and the livelihoods of veterinarians themselves .
We simply can not afford to compromise on animal health if we are to safeguard human health in this crisis .
Carel du Marchie Sarvaas  Executive Director of HealthforAnimals  In the short-term , veterinarians play an important role in caring for our food-producing animals and pets throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this .
But in the longer term , veterinarians are also on the frontline of global health and controlling future outbreaks of animal-borne diseases .
Government support that allows veterinarians to stay in business now will ensure we do not risk losing their vital expertise and skills .
Across the animal medicines industry , we are working to guarantee that veterinary medicines continue to reach veterinarians , farmers and pet owners during this crisis , so they may provide proper care to animals , while also protecting employees and reducing the risk of further disease spread .
What is clear is that we simply can not afford to compromise on animal health if we are to safeguard human health in this crisis .
