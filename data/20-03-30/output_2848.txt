Burden and Benefit of Using Distancing in Work and School  Here 's how social distancing is being employed to combat COVID-19 .
Experts recommend social distancing to combat COVID-19 .
For many , distancing will involve working from home .
Many companies have implemented remote working policies .
Just last week , the two remaining Democratic contenders for the U .
presidency announced that their campaigns will move online .
My employer , the University of Texas at Austin , recently announced that classes will move online as soon as possible .
When I last held class , I told students that it would likely be the last time it was in-person .
One responded , " Most of America seems to be moving to Zoom or something like that to work or go to school .
Will it hurt or help how people perform ? " I told them it will likely do both .
Programs like Skype or Zoom allow people to see non-verbal cues ( e .
, facial expressions ) that increase their feeling of being physically present with others , but such programs are limited .
For example , students often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask questions .
With remote teaching , this is less likely to occur .
Distance learning may also threaten students ' sense of belonging .
Many students , particularly students of color , question whether they belong in school , which can lead to adverse health and academic consequences .
I 'm not arguing against social distancing , as history shows such efforts are effective at combating the spread of infectious diseases .
However , educators need to be vigilant when it comes to monitoring not only students ' physical health but their emotional well-being too .
But , will it be all Zoom and gloom ? When it comes to how distance will change the way employees and students think and perform , my research suggests that people may also benefit from working or learning remotely .
When people think about others who are farther away , they typically think in more abstract , broader terms .
For example , in one study , we found that participants who viewed a video of two people having a conversation that was purportedly taped in a distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe the video 's content -- participants were more likely to describe the actors in the video using abstract adjectives ( e .
, she seemed considerate ) rather than just concrete descriptors ( e .
, she said thank you ) .
Other researchers have reasoned that more abstract , higher-level thinking should facilitate creativity , and they , in fact , demonstrated that portraying a task as originating from a far ( vs .
close ) location led participants to perform better on a problem-solving task that required abstract creative insight .
As far as capitalizing on this moment , this is the time for companies to go big .
With more employees moving to remote work , this could be an ideal time to move employees away from mundane , routine activities and give them time to be bold and risky in their product development and creative brainstorming sessions .
Managers may be surprised to find employees who normally do n't exhibit creativity and a broad vision do so now that they are teleconferencing .
Teachers who will be holding class virtually should find ways to enhance their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be especially challenging , as they may not be able to see students ' " tells " and emotional signals that let them know when they are feeling disconnected .
Obviously , as a teacher myself , I recognize that this will not be easy , and I look forward to getting back in the classroom with my students .
