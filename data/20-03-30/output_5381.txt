Coronavirus : Aussies ca n't handle a world in grey  Coronavirus : Aussies ca n't handle a world in grey  Black and white is understandable , you can either do something , or not .
You know your boundaries , what 's expected , and you choose whether or not you 're going to abide .
But the grey is murky and scary for many .
Grey is uncertainty , do I , do n't I , should I , could I ?  The coronavirus has most Aussies living in the grey , and they just ca n't handle it .
The shops are open , but we 're told to stay away where possible .
Schools are open but parents are allowed to keep their kids at home .
The local gym has shut but the undercover swimming pool has n't .
Go out and support local businesses but please keep your distance and go alone .
These are all messages we 've heard in the past week .
They make sense .
to me .
But I can see why so many people are confused and are taking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , what should they be doing ? Our way of ' corona life ' has many so unsure of themselves that they need the backing of the pack from Facebook and Twitter .
In the past four days I 've heard so many people with black and white thoughts on the issue , or lack there-of .
" Until I get a symptom , I 'm not changing the way I live , " to " do n't leave home , self-Isolate now or we 're all going to die " .
Where 's the grey in this scenario ? Somewhere in the middle of these black and white thought processes is common sense and probably the best course of action for now .
When the pictures are n't in black-and-white , Aussies have a hard time recognising another depression when they see one coming .
Kieran Bicheno  Sure , things are going to change , especially if we 're all too blas ? about restrictions , but we do n't need to hit the panic button and fear death at every corner .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nature are laid back , which is probably why social distancing just has n't been working .
Until they 're told to stay home and not leave , many will continue to think the situation does not apply to them .
It 's human nature .
For example , cancer is a horrible , horrible disease , but true empathy for those suffering only comes when directly affected .
The same applies here .
It 's like we 're all teenagers again , untouchable and invincible and indestructible .
But that can also be a coping mechanism for many , so that they do n't fall into the other category , of panic .
I must admit , I 've probably been out and about more than I should have recently .
I have stopped visiting friends , but I 'm still at the shops most days grabbing something ( no I 'm not stockpiling ) .
I 'm still working in an office , albeit not for long and I 'm still planning on helping a family member move house this weekend .
But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasoning for what is a little bit of a messy society at the moment .
I understand we need certain industries to still have workers and be operational while others are not .
I know we need to support those left open as best we can while ensuring we are not ignoring health and safety advice from those above .
I also understand that this is far from over .
We are just at the beginning and need to prepare for the long haul .
Yes , it 's probably going to get a lot worse before it gets better , but let 's not be frightened of the unknown .
Let 's live in the grey and be OK with that .
You can make rational decisions without needing to be told to either never leave home or go out and socialise .
You can get through the uncertainty by knowing you are not alone .
These are challenging times , but let 's be rational with our own responses .
