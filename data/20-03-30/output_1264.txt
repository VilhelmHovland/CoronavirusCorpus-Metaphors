With the Olympic qualifying period likely to be extended for another year , Law remains confident of maintaining her strong form to secure her ticket to Tokyo .
By Andrew Both , Reuters News  Four years after being inspired by watching compatriot Justin Rose claim gold at the Rio Olympics , Bronte Law had all but secured a spot on the British golf team before the 2020 Tokyo Games were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic .
With the Olympic qualifying period likely to be extended for another year , Law remains confident of maintaining her strong form to secure her ticket to Tokyo .
She flew back from her American base to her family home in Cheshire just before Britain went into lockdown earlier this week to slow the spread of the coronavirus .
With the LPGA Tour shut down indefinitely , Law , who won the 2015 English amateur by 16 strokes , will have plenty of time to ponder the Olympics .
" It 's been something on my mind for a couple of years now , " she told Reuters in a telephone interview .
" ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college .
To see ( Rose win ) made it very real as far as golf now being an Olympic sport .
" You can win grand slams in tennis and majors in golf , and all of those are incredible achievements but when you become a gold medal winner you become part of a very select group of incredible athletes that branch across all sports .
"  Law is 18th on the Olympic qualifying list , the second-placed Briton , immediately behind Charley Hull and well ahead of 39th-ranked Georgia Hall .
Two British women will qualify .
" ( The delay ) is obviously very disappointing , " said Law .
" I really set my sights on Tokyo and have been playing well , and hope to continue to do that , so I 'm not so concerned about making sure I make the team .
"  Whenever the LPGA Tour resumes , the 25-year-old Law will be ready rather than rusty .
" We have a nice place with plenty of room and land and I figured I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home here , " she said .
" We have land attached to the garden where I can hit a range of iron shots , not too many drivers but I 'm planning on putting up a net .
I do n't have it too badly here .
"  Though Law is rarely venturing out because of the lockdown , her parents have been busy supplying packaging to food manufacturers .
" My parents are working non-stop and it 's just me and my sister at my house , " Law said .
" We 're trying to do our best to not leave the house at all .
"  That will soon change , however , as Law has signed up to deliver groceries to those most in need , including health workers who are working long hours due to the pandemic .
" It 's an unknown time for a lot of us but a time we can give back in a way we 're not always able to , having such busy schedules , " she said .
