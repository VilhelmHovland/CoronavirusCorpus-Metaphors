But it is on track to run out of masks and other critical protective equipment for health workers in just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would run out of capacity or not have enough health care workers , but the situation at Seton illustrates that a shortage of protective gear to keep doctors and nurses safe is perhaps even more imminent and dire .
On Friday afternoon , Seton was treating its own patients , including five who have tested positive for COVID-19 and eight suspected of having COVID-19 who are awaiting test results .
That is well below the hospital 's new capacity of about 160 COVID-19 patients , including about 50 in ICU .
But nurses and doctors are worried that the hospital is supposed to accept transfer patients next week -- but has not received additional masks , gowns , face shields or other protective equipment from the state , according to three Seton nurses and a physician .
" It 's going to get very difficult to protect our employees , " said Dr .
Robert Perez , who oversees the physicians at Seton .
" I 'm very nervous about that .

Now she 's an ER nurse on the front lines , where equipment and staff are short .
Many nursing students who are just inches away from graduation are hoping to join her , and begging the state to bend its licensing rules so they can work .

In California , 48 health care workers have been infected with COVID-19 , according to figures released by the state Friday .
Health care workers and first responders are at higher risk than the general population for exposure to the virus because they come into close and frequent contact with COVID-19 patients .
It is particularly risky to intubate a patient or administer a nebulizer , which can lead to a patient coughing and emitting droplets close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , or emitting droplets into the air that can remain there and infect other health care workers in the room who are not wearing full protective gear .
Last week , Gov .
Gavin Newsom said California began receiving shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile in response to the state 's request for hundreds of thousands of N95 masks , surgical masks , face shields , gowns and other protective gear .
The California Department of Public Health did not immediately provide answers Friday about whether the state has sent supplies to Seton , or whether the state plans to send supplies , and when .
Seton hospital staff go through about 1,000 N95 masks each day , and nurses have already been asked to conserve the existing supply by using one N95 per day instead of single-use , as is recommended .
The shortage likely will get even worse , when more than 100 temporary traveling nurses start to arrive within the next three weeks to help manage the expected surge in patients .
" We 're a COVID center without supplies , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have no one , " said Debra Amour , an ICU nurse at Seton .
