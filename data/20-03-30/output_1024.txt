No cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the north-western province of Idlib , which is the opposition 's last stronghold , but humanitarian organisations are particularly concerned about the situation there .
A million people have fled their homes since December to escape a government offensive , and the limited number of functioning hospitals are already struggling to treat casualties from the fighting and respond to other medical needs .
The medical charity said it was providing assistance for the screening of patients at two health centres , including one at Deri Hassan camp , which hosts 164,000 people .
" We witnessed people living in the open ; we also saw two or three families sharing a tent which did not protect them from the cold or the rain .
There were too few tents to accommodate the new arrivals , " said Ahmed , MSF 's project team leader .
