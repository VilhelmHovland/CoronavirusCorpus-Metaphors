Aids to Private Storage ( APS ) is among a number of measures that will be considered by the European Commission in the event of " serious market disruption " arising from the Covid-19 pandemic .
Speaking last week at a meeting of EU agriculture ministers , Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development Janusz Wojciechowski outlined a range of measures that may be implemented " at a latter stage " .
His comments come as industry and political pressure mounts for the opening of APS .
Dairy Industry Ireland ( DII ) , along with the Department of Agriculture , Food and the Marine , made the request earlier this month .
The commissioner said : " Our toolbox of instruments foresees even further measures .
In the event of serious market disruption , market support measures such as public intervention , APS , withdrawals , etc , and exceptional market measures are available under the CAP Common Agricultural Policy .
However , Commissioner Wojciechowski indicated that such measures would have a significant impact on the EU 's finances for agriculture .
" I will not hide from you that if such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This has to be looked at and assessed when necessary , " he said .
Dairy  Speaking specifically about the dairy sector , Commissioner Wojciechowski said that it was " too early " to say how the dairy market would develop over the course of the coming months .
He commented : " EU dairy commodity prices have been slightly decreasing for a few weeks .
The Global Dairy Trade GDT Price Index has also decreased three times in a row .
There is a lot of uncertainty about the extent of the consequences of the virus .
" So far , we are not aware of problems in European factories but we will remain vigilant , especially at a moment when Europe is about to reach its peak production .
Export business is limited due to the lack of containers .
This affects European exports to all destinations , not just China , " the commissioner added .
Advertisement  Meat  Commissioner Wojciechowski highlighted to the EU 's agriculture ministers that , while demand for meat products from the retail sector is up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant and food services sector has " collapsed " .
He added that " a strong decline in demand may be expected in the coming weeks " , depending on other factors , including movement restrictions .
' Whatever it takes '  Commissioner Wojciechowski said he would listen to the requests of the agriculture ministers and that he was " ready to take action whatever it takes " .
Responsiveness and flexibility is what is needed now and in weeks to come .
It is imperative to protect our farming sector , the food chain and rural businesses .
I will do everything in my powers to do so .
He highlighted that the commission is co-operating with the EU 's trade partners to ensure " that no barriers affect international trade flows " .
He explained that the Directorate-General for Trade ( the department of the commission overseen by Commissioner for Trade Phil Hogan ) is requesting that trading partners put in place trade-facilitating measures for EU exports of animals , plants and their products -- where certification is hampered due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certification already for imports and we request trading partners to do the same for EU exports , " Commissioner Wojciechowski outlined .
I am in constant exchange with my colleagues responsible for transport , internal market , home affairs , etc , to strengthen our cooperation and to ensure that agricultural markets , including food and feed and other agricultural raw materials or inputs , remain fully open and fluid .
Concluding his remarks , the commissioner said : " The bottom line is that the commission stands ready to help European agriculture .
We all have a common duty here to identify and implement the most appropriate actions to support our agri-food sector .
