Like many kids growing up in the mid-00s , Parent Trap was my favourite film .
My Nan and Pa had it on video , and I 'd watch it on repeat whenever I visited them in Shepparton .
Each visit was met with the same sentiments -- I 'd scream when Hallie pierced Annie 's ears , scream for Elizabeth and Nick .
Like many kids growing up in the mid-00s , Parent Trap was my favourite film .
My Nan and Pa had it on video , and I 'd watch it on repeat whenever I visited them in Shepparton .
Each visit was met with the same sentiments -- I 'd scream when Hallie pierced Annie 's ears , scream for Elizabeth and Nick to reunite and , above all else , scream at Meredith Blake for being the antichrist of cinema .
My 5-year-old ass genuinely hated Meredith Blake .
With a passion .
But I 'm obviously not alone in this regard -- we were intentionally coaxed to loathe her , the film 's villain -- but something about seeing Meredith Blake 's face on the telly screen hit differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boil .
Meredith , a 26-year-old publicist from San Francisco , was instantly painted in a negative light -- our introduction to Meredith was overshadowed by Hallie 's nanny Chessy implying that she 's a gold digger and after Nick for his millions .
A couple scenes later , we observed Meredith telling her assistant , " first change I make is to send that two-faced little brat off to boarding school in Timbuktu " .
My loathing of Meredith lasted well-after I stopped watching Parent Trap at my Nan and Pa 's .
But as I grew into adulthood , and Parent Trap became a mere piece of nostalgia , I began to view Meredith 's escapades in a new light .
My subsequent loathing morphed into something else -- I began to , dare I say , champion the publicist from San Francisco .
Here 's why Meredith Blake , the ' 98 villain , was simply ahead of her time .
A misunderstood icon , if you will .
She 's a woman in charge  Love her or hate her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't afraid to go out and get it .
She was a hustler , and , in today 's society , would be commended for it .
" Being young and beautiful 's not a crime you know , " she tells Annie .
" This is the real deal honey and nothing is going to come between us .
" She 's unapologetic in her bad bitchery , even to Nick 's own daughter , which is a massive departure from most female characters portrayed in 90s Disney films .
Yes , she may be a " hot young thing " , but that hot young thing was an intelligent schemer , whose wit and cunning intellect sees her nearly swindle everyone .
Fierce .
Image : Disney  She 's an icon in the looks department  She did n't like hiking -- relatable  The audience 's hatred of Meredith was arguably solidified by the fact that she did n't like hiking and camping .
But you know , what ? Fucking same .
I absolutely would have behaved like Meredith if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins .
And if Hallie and Annie put rocks in my pack , placed a lizard on my Evian , replaced my mosquito repellant with sugar and water and dragged my lilo into the middle of the damn lake , I 'd be sending their assess to Switzerland as well .
Image : Disney  Mind you , she still served us in the look department .
Image : Disney  So there you have it .
Given that it 's 2020 and attitudes have well and truly changed , we have no choice but to dow down to Queen Mer , and apologise for not only hating her so viciously , but for doubting her relatability .
It 's unlikely we 'll see a figure like Meredith Blake again , given how unprecedented this character type was in the 90s .

Never did I think that I 'd refer to Tiger King 's Doc Antle and the legendary Ms Britney Spears in the same sentence , but , alas , here we are .
Following the Netflix series taking the world by storm over the weekend , some internet sleuths dug up footage of Doc on stage with Britney during her world-renowned " I 'm a Slave 4 U " performance at the ' 01 VMAs .
Many would forget that a tiger was even present at the performance , as it was ultimately overshadowed by *that* python moment .
( Image : Getty / KMazur )  Indeed , the golden tabby tiger was Doc 's .
IT YOU .
( Image : Getty / KMazur )  Actually , the more I think about it , this collaboration is n't so shocking -- in the series , Doc gives us a glimpse of his Hollywood showreel , hinting that he worked on a number of big projects in Tinseltown .
That being said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflated that it 's only Monday ? Reminiscing about Saturday night on House Party ? Let me give you something to look forward to -- Fitzroy 's Mr West Bar &amp; Bottle Shop are delivering 1 .

Check the below ' gram to see if this applies to you .
For Brisbane and Sydney folk , you 'll have to wait a smidge longer -- 3-10 days depending on where you reside .
( Still worth it , in my opinion .
Do I need to remind you that it 's 1 .

As many of us head into our second week of self-isolation , slight delirium is well and truly setting in .
I , for one , live by myself , and conversations with my plants have become the norm ( fine , right ? ) .
In a bid to combat said delirium , we 've all thought of some innovative ways to socialise and stay focused -- the TikTok #HorseChallenge , for example , or this completely blank 2,000-word puzzle .
House Party has also become the norm .
Well , let me throw another option into the mix -- a free , online version of ' Cards Against Humanity ' .
Yep , you can now play that infamous damn game up in the cyber-webs with your mates .
All you have to do is head over to playingcards .

Up to 6 people can play at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn , everyone picks their most iconic answer , and the judge decides .
Add wine and video chat into the mix , and you 're bloody laughing .
Hey all you cool cats and kittens .
If your weekend in self-isolation looked anything like mine , then you , too , binged Tiger King , swooned over Joe Exotic 's ARIA-worthy tracks and vowed to one day recreate their stunning accompanying visuals .
In this case , I bring you heart-breaking news -- Joe Exotic did n't actually sing his songs .
We 've been swindled again .
As reported by Vanity Fair , musical duo Vince Johnson and Danny Clinton -- who formed The Clinton Johnson Band before Clinton 's untimely death last year -- were the masterminds behind Exotic 's bops .
Exotic had initially come across the pair via an advertisement , with the intention to create a theme song for the park .
What eventuated was Johnson and Clinton writing and producing tracks that Exotic claimed to sing .
" I had no idea he was going to Milli Vanilli the songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of months and after two or three songs when I was on YouTube one night and just happened to look up Joe Exotic .
And there he was , lip-syncing and acting like the ghost of Elvis .
I called him up , I was hot .
And he bamboozled me about his reality show -- that it was coming soon and he would make everything right as rain .
I just wanted the proper credit .
"  Image : YouTube / JoeExoticTV  Rick Kirkham , the producer whose work was heartbreakingly destroyed in the zoo 's studio explosion , also told Vanity Fair had shit vocals .
" One time , Joe got a little bit drunk and high , " he said , " and we actually coaxed him into singing part of one of the songs .
He could n't even hold a tune .
It was just so ludicrous .
"  This should n't really come as a surprise , given the amount of lies , deceit and fuckery in the show .
That being said , the tunes themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to my heart 's content .

Today also marks 10 years since I vowed to never forgive Nickelodeon for frying Ariana Grande 's hair like that .
Update : I shall now forgive , but I will never forget .
The show , created by sitcom guru Dan Schneider , first graced our screens back in March 27 , 2010 , when " Hey , Soul Sister " was #1 on the ARIA charts and I was getting tipsy off 2 guava cruisers .
What a time .
" i could n't have spent my teenage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human beings , " Ari captioned a throwback flick of the gang , below .
" i really loved playing cat valentine ( even though sometimes people think i actually still speak and act like that and her essence will lovingly haunt me til i die ) .
i miss getting in trouble w my friends the school room and trying not to laugh when we were n't supposed to on set .
"  Victoria Justice also jumped on the tribute bandwagon : " This show changed my life &amp; I 'm so grateful I got to share it with this amazing , insanely talented group of people .
We share memories together that I look back fondly on to this day &amp; will always cherish .

Panic buying aside , this look is , hands-down , a piece of art .
( See what I did there ? I 'm sorry .
I 'll let myself out .

What matters is that this footage exists , and it exists forever .

Self-isolation has given rise to a new , terrifying pandemic : singletons across the globe texting their exes .

Brave truth-tellers have begun flooding the internet about their unified desire to text pass flings , or , conversely , about exes randomly coming out of the woodwork to say ' long time , no see ' in the age of coronavirus .
Day 13 of self-isolation and my ex from high school tried to friend me on Facebook .
Can this be done soon  It 's not surprising that self-isolation has led to a rise in messaging exes , to be honest .
After all , when you 're cooped up inside , lonely and deprived of human contact , it 's only natural to throw on those rose-coloured glasses , think about the last person who gave you a sliver of affection and get all gooey and nostalgic about it .
No gay man has n't done AT LEAST one of the following in self isolation :  Messaged their ex Gone live on Instagram Taken a quarantine thirst trap Thought about a buzz cut Thought about bleaching their hair  Throw horniness and a $3 bottle of rose into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin reminiscing about that one date you went on with Rachel last year , or the time that cute boy on the bus made eye contact with you back in ' 09 .
day 13 ( i think ) of self isolation and i 'm now considering turning into the person who texts their exes to apologise  Does this mean you should message them ? It depends .
If you ended amicably and were sporadically chatting prior to Ms Rona , then why not ? But if they fucked you over back in 2016 and you subsequently went around calling them the spawn of Satan to anyone who 'd listen , I 'd probably avoid jumping on FaceTime with them for a cute living room wine .
