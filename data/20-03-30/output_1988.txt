The British Pound starts the new week close to the multi-day highs reached against a number of currencies on Friday , with markets digesting news that the UK 's sovereign debt was downgraded by ratings agency Fitch over the weekend .
Despite the broadly improved tone , the currency does remain highly volatile as is the case with most financial assets at the curent time , and we would therefore expect to see some movement both up and down as the day progresses .
Sterling might have gotten off to a better start were it not for the suprise news the UK was downgraded one notch from AA to AA- by Fitch after markets closed on Friday owing to the significant increase in fiscal spending announced by the Government in order to cushion the negative economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak , as well as due to the uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was weakening this morning after Fitch cut the country 's credit rating after the close Friday in New York , citing the weakening of public finances caused by the virus outbreak as well as the uncertainty about the post-Brexit trade relationship with the EU , " says Marshall Gittler , Strategist at BD Swiss .
When downgrading the UK 's sovereign debt rating , Fitch said they took into account , " the deep near-term damage to the UK economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak and the lingering uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit UK-EU trade relationship " .
" This is the first downgrade of a sovereign on the back of the coronavirus and the increase in fiscal spending .
We have had several reviews of Eurozone countries including France and Spain and neither has been downgraded on the back of the increase in fiscal stimulus , " says Jens Peter S ? rensen , Chief Analyst at Danske Bank .
Fitch forecast the UK 's economic output would drop nearly 4% in 2020 due to an economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus , " the downgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and a fiscal loosening stance that was instigated before the scale of the crisis became apparent , " Fitch said .
The UK 's Chancellor Rishi Sunak last Thursday announced further spending plans with a slew of support packages for the self employed .
The latest initiative takes the government 's total support package of direct tax and spending measures to ? 119bn ( 5 .
of GDP ) , according to analysis from Capital Economics .
Fitch estimate that the whole package will cost 4 .
of GDP in 2020 .
Fitch 's baseline projections show the government 's deficit will increase by around 9% of GDP in 2021 from 2 .
of GDP in 2019 .
Within this forecast , they estimate that the Coronavirus Job Retention scheme will cost 1 .
of GDP , assuming that 4 .
million employees will be supported over the three month duration of the scheme .

Agencies such as Fitch issue ratings on a country 's bonds , reflecting how secure they believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amounts of debt relative to the size of their economy , a ratings agency will rate them highly as they believe the government will comfortably service that debt .
The rating is meanwhile lowered if an agency believes a country will struggle to service a debt , thereby making the bonds it issues less attractive to investors .
" The commensurate and necessary policy response to contain the COVID-19 outbreak will result in a sharp rise in general government deficit and debt ratios , leading to an acceleration in the deterioration of public finance metrics over the medium term , " read a statement from Fitch detailing the decision to downgrade the UK 's debt profile .
This matters as countries with lower ratings tend to have to compensate investors more for holding their debt .
For currency markets , debt downgrades can often trigger currency depreciations as international investors sell domestic domestic bonds in reaction to a debt downgrade .
Sterling has however thus far shown little negative reaction to Fitch 's decision , but the move nevertheless could have longer-term implications for the currency should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " EUR/GBP has moved below 0 .
again , probably driven partly by the weaker USD .
We think risks are still skewed towards a weaker GBP in the current environment and think it will move above 0 .
again soon , " says S ? rensen .
A move above in 0 .
in EUR/GBP translates into a move back below 1 .
in GBP/EUR .
Fitch says much will depend on how the UK approaches its public finances once the coronavirus crisis has passed , a consolidation of the UK 's debt will go some way in improving its ratings profile .
However , Fitch is not confident the UK government will be prepared to enter another round of austerity to rebuild the public finances .
" We fully recognise that timely and targeted policies can help reduce the risk of a more sustained loss of economic output .
The likelihood that temporary stimulus measures are unwound will reflect policy choices and political developments .
However , in our view , given the direction of public finances reflected in the March 2020 budget , it is unlikely that reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK government , " said Fitch .
Rapid Recovery in Sterling can Hold  Fitch say the rapid response to the coronavirus crisis by the UK Treasury and the Bank of England should limit the second-round effects of the initial shock and should help growth to recover , assuming that the immediate health crisis subsides .
The agency adds the combined liquidity support measures which include GBP330 billion ( 15% of UK GDP ) of loans and guarantees from the Treasury and the Bank of England are an important component of an effective near-term policy response , providing support to the ratings .
Ahead of the coronavirus crisis the government had already committed to additional investment spending to 3% of GDP , which would be its highest level for 65 years , and could further underpin the economy .
" Whether higher investment spending improves UK productivity and medium-term growth prospects would depend on how effectively such measures as large infrastructure projects are targeted , " said Fitch .
The gains in Sterling over recent days form part of an ongoing recovery from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the month ; the UK currency has proven to be particularly sensitive to losses against the Euro , Dollar , Yen and Franc during period 's of market weakness owing to declining investor sentiment stemming from the coronavirus outbreak .
However , a return of some investor confidence and market stability since central banks announced they would pump billions of dollars worth of extra liquidity into the global financial system , while governments announced measures to support their respective economies , appears to have stabilised the currency .
If markets should rally further , we could see Sterling 's recovery extend .
" We do see a light at the end of the tunnel : there is still a reasonably strong argument for a v-shaped recovery , and policymakers are working hard to bring about that outcome .
But , without medical breakthroughs of some kind , the next few weeks could be challenging for markets as we price in a deep global recession .

Sterling enters the new week with some relatively supportive near-term momentum , courtesy of a strong close to the previous week that surprised many in the foreign exchange market , that could deliver further gains over coming days .
The UK currency rallied sharply against nearly all of the world 's major currencies with the gains coming despite stock markets tanking : the FTSE 100 , Dow Jones and Germany 's Dax were all down over 2% as the week 's recovery capitulates in impressive fashion .
The playbook for the current global market downturn goes that when markets are down , the Pound is down and vice versa when markets are going higher .
The Pound to Dollar exchange rate is quoted at 1 .
, the March low is at 1 .
The Pound-to-Euro exchange rate is quoted at 1 .
at the time of writing , the March low is down at 1 .
" We continue to see upside potential for Sterling .
Despite its relative liquidity , the pound was one of the G10 currencies most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the UK 's large financial sector .
As this issue seems to have been resolved , we expect Sterling to regain its lost ground by mid-year , " says Ga ? tan Peroux , Strategist at UBS .
The British pound advanced against the Euro and the majority of the world 's largest currencies over the course of the past 24 hours but fell back against a resurgent U .
Dollar amidst an environment of heightened volatility due to the coronavirus economic crisis .
The British Pound starts the new week close to the multi-day highs where it ended on Friday , with markets digesting news that the UK 's sovereign debt was downgraded by ratings agency Fitch over the weekend .
The Pound is pushing sharply higher against the Euro , Dollar and a host of other currencies ahead of the weekend , but the gains come as stock markets are tanking : The FTSE 100 , Dow Jones and Germany 's Dax are all down over 2% as the week 's recovery capitulates in impressive fashion .
