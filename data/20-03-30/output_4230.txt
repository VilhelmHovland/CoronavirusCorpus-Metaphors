Go to page  Honorary Master  It 's bullshit in that it is implemented from a starting point that assumes all citizens are in contravention of the regulations , not the other way around , like one would expect in a constitutional democracy .
Executive Member  I am extremely worried about the long term effect of shutting down entire supply chains .
Most other countries are not doing this , btw .
Manufacturing , construction and shipping remain operational in most countries undergoing lockdown .
I think we could be in for huge supply shocks and widespread shortages of materials when this thing is over , and that 's before we add the financial collapse into the mix .
Companies could go back to work and find that whole classes of raw goods , suppliers , distributors and sub-contractors have disappeared off the map permanently .
I do n't think the people in charge have a cooking clue about the complexity and interrelatedness of all of this .
What a sad day in SA that the CPF are not allowed to operate either .
I believe they could be of great help to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a power hungry state that we live in .
of commie knts  Honorary Master  What a sad day in SA that the CPF are not allowed to operate either .
I believe they could be of great help to the nation for the times we are now experiencing .
This is a power hungry state that we live in .
of commie knts  ( a ) ensure that all executive organs of state in the national sphere of government are accountable to it ; and  ( b ) maintain oversight of  ( i ) the exercise of national executive authority , including the implementation of legislation ; and  ( ii ) any organ of state .
Steenhuisen said that although the DA has pledged its full support to President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Cabinet , they , as the official opposition , and other opposition parties in the House still have a duty to hold the executive to account .
He emphasised that the DA needed to look at measures to ensure that not only was the coronavirus outbreak stopped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent accountability of the government during the outbreak .
Steenhuisen added that this was why the DA was proposing the establishment of an ad hoc committee .
Rule 167(g) indicates that a committee may meet in a venue determined by it .
" We are proposing that this committee meet via online platforms or videoconferencing facilities to respect the conditions of the lockdown and adhere to the principle of social distancing .
" We need to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution at all costs , even in this most unprecedented and unusual of times , " he said .
The question is how the ministries are interpreting their own powers under the Disaster Management Act ? Each ministry has been enabled to give directions , and as discovered many are making directions which contravene with others .
This when the government themselves have made them the sole authority .
From the above , the courts need to correct our civil liberties , which is a shame in the sense that these matters must be taken to the court , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruled on .
From my observation ,  We now know how initial policymaking takes place without proper consultation and parliamentary control  We have too many ministries  Etc .
There are various points that I can make which I will avoid in doing so , but  I have to ask , knowing that we have Chinese authority here when Ramaphosa made his SANDF deployment speech , are we being consulted by the Chinese on current regulations ?  Honorary Master  What opposition ? The EFF is way to small nationally , and probably the long term Stalin to the ANC 's Hitler , so hopefully no .
The DA was almost a viable opposition until Zille came and shat the bed big time .
