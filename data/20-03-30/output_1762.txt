SMEs disheartened over being left out of stimulus package  Business owners are calling for government support , implying that the government forgot to take them into account in the " no one left behind " stimulus package .
Since Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the package last Friday , there have been open letters to him , WhatsApp messages that have gone viral as well as formal statements released to the press , pointing out that the implications on business have not been properly thought out .
A source close to small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) , who refused to be identified , waxed lyrical .
" The present situation is akin to the government asking SME chickens to lay more eggs while there is no corn to feed them .
"  This seems to be the general sentiment .
A WhatsApp message that has gone viral , attributable to just " business owners " , points out that salaries , electricity bills , taxes , bank interest , the Sales and Service Tax , employer 's contributions to the Employees Provident Fund and Socso and property tax are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced shutdown .
" We do n't mind sitting home until April 30 if these expenses are cut .
But how are you planning to support the business class from whom you are demanding this sacrifice ? "  He tells Enterprise that this means helping businesses , which employ a significant number of staff , that through stimulus , will also assist a number of supply chains in the ecosystem .
" Later on , these will contribute by paying taxes again .
This is as opposed to just paying more cash to employees who are now redundant at home ( especially those who can not work from home ) , but are still drawing a salary from the SMEs .
" These employees may not necessarily contribute in terms of consumption because they may end up saving more , just in case something were to happen .
Eventually , they may lose their jobs and not be able to service their loans .
And now , we have a bigger economy hole to plug , both at the SME and staff levels .
Worse still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of business and loss of skill sets .
"  Renuka Sena , co-founder and CEO of Proficeo Consultants Sdn Bhd , points out that micro-entrepreneurs , for instance , are unaffected by the concessions made by banks with regards to the moratorium on payment of loans to SMEs because they do not qualify for loans in the first place .
She called for these companies to be extended some kind of credit facility to tide them over , so they can start planning what to do once the MCO is called off .
" Right now , most of them can not even sleep at night , " she says .
Others put in requests that were personal to their own particular experiences in trying to secure funding to survive .
Joachim Sebastian , founder of Everpeaks , a local multi-channel e-commerce solutions provider , said his company was finding it difficult to raise funds , even from the various relief programmes out there .
" When the Covid-19 outbreak started to hit our shores , I began the process of raising funds as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we did not build reserves , it would put cash flow and the livelihood of our employees at great risk if anything happened .
"  Sebastian approached more than seven banks and applied for all available funding through every avenue , including Special Relief Funding ( SRF ) and even a personal loan , but to no avail .
" This was three weeks ago .
Until today , we have not secured any financing facility yet , " he says .
He proceeded to outline what he considered the main limitations of the process .
First , banks will only allow SRF funding for existing clients .
" This will be a huge barrier for all SMEs to obtain funding , especially the ones on the start-up scene .
"  Second , banks require a minimum of two years ' audited results before they evaluate the application .
On top of that , they require the company to already be profitable and a negative balance in any of the two years will greatly impact the application , he points out .
In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to qualify for the SRF application .
" This is a very subjective issue and has been used to decline our applications .
Just because we applied early does not mean we are not affected .
"  Proving effect involves waiting for a bank statement that only comes out on the 6th of each month .
Many SMEs do not have the luxury of waiting for this to come out or the resources to withstand the effects of the shutdown during this Movement Control Order , he adds .
Sebastian says the economic slowdown from China 's Covid-19 shutdown started affecting sales three months ago .
" Many SMEs do not have a great CCRIS or repayment history due to this .
We were affected by this last month and it severely reduced our rating , although we have mitigation plans .
Many companies are far worse off and in greater need of help .
"  He ended his letter with a list of recommendations for the government to ensure that the effects of the stimulus package are actually felt by the SMEs and to ease their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiving any CCRIS ( Central Credit Reference Information System ) or CTOS ( the credit agency ) concerns from January to March 2020 for the SRF applications due to economic slowdown .
He also suggests that the government reduce the two-year audited results requirement to one and that the applicant need not be a current customer of the bank in question , but simply a customer of a recognised financial institution .
He also recommends that the funding amounts be limited to 40% of the SME 's annual revenue or 12 months of salary and rental , whichever is higher , that documents for application be simplified ( with a director guarantee on the disbursed loan to take care of risk ) , and that the government require a 10-business-day turnaround for application to disbursal .
Finally , waive the profitability requirement for high-growth companies with proven cash flow , says Sebastian .
" We SMEs form a critical component of the economy of close to 40% contribution of GDP and we create 66% of the jobs in our country .
For us to survive the closure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to prepare for the grind to recover , please ease the funding criteria and help get the stimulus disbursed as soon as possible .
