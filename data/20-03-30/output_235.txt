Comments  Me and all of my friends had strong aversions to something as children .
For me it was news print ; for another , shirt buttons .
We all went through phases of compulsive habits like hand washing or pacing ; we all had keen obsessions ; we all struggled with changes in routine .
And for all of us , all of those things eventually went away on their own .
If a behavior is not permanent and unchangeable then it 's just a phase , not autism .
This is the first time I 've heard of someone else looking for good examples of how to interact and then copying them .
I have literally had to retrain myself from books , on how to be a mother , because I had a completely appalling example in my own mother and she from hers .
I am sure I have been successful at raising them kindly and so they feel loved .
A lot of the reactions I 'd read about that were ' good ' , and I wanted to have in certain situations have even become automatic , which I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children for their mistakes , and never hitting them for anything even though my automatic reaction would be to hit , taking care of every word I say to them so they 're in line with my beliefs about how to best rear children etc ) Although I 'm sure I 've fallen down in some areas , such as enforcing school work in my children , because it 's so triggering to me that I ca n't face it .
My childhood example of parents enforcing school work was violence - I wo n't do that but I lack any other tactic so have to distance myself .
Luckily the children are quite self motivated , but it does worry me that I ca n't deal with frustrating situations like that , without wanting to lash out - I have taught myself to take myself away from the situation so as not to react in the way that 's instinctive to me .
But it is disappointing that I ca n't help with my children 's school work unless they 've asked me and want me to .
think people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand the exhaustion that comes with controlling one 's behaviour to this extent .
That sounds awful , very difficult to get through and to process now .
try to understand the women in my family on my mother 's side and wonder if there 's a diagnosis somewhere .
coldness , the lack of empathy , the controlling behaviour , the violence , the emotional unavailability , the dislike of physical contact , the unawareness of what was socially normal as regards abuse of children .
And also the mostly failed attempts to mask this at home but the ability , having been trained in her job , to carry that out seemingly without people seeing that her sympathy was an act .
mother , my grandmother , my great grandmother and perhaps further back , were all like this .
Child abandoners and severe abusers , although slightly less so with each generation ( but perhaps this reflects how much abuse each generation could get away with ) .
I just thought they were psychopaths .
But perhaps they were diagnosable .
I do n't see those extreme traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had an autistic or aspie or ADHD diagnosis .
But I struggle a lot to cope and I identify with many ADHD and autistic traits .
However , I would be scared to look into it , for fear of opening up something I do n't want to see .
do n't think anything good could come of it .
All in all , for daily life , COVID-19 physical distancing rules have made my life easier .
Just saying .
As a fellow Aspie , I entirely concur .
I love being at home more , where my environment is mostly comfortable for me and there are no other people around .
I am so happy I no longer have to shake hands or stand closer to someone than I 'm comfortable with .
It 's fantastic not having to negotiate crowds of people when out in public .
I certainly do n't want the coronavirus crisis to last longer than it has to , but I will bloody well appreciate the physical distancing while it lasts .
I have to have infusions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed an affinity with one of the nurses there .
How it is for me , is , I have a special interest in Asian cultures , so I like being attended to by the Asian nurse , but I also have a special interest in UK crime dramas , so I like being attended to by one of two British nurses .
I label myself their Number One Rebecca Tope fan , as I 'm always reading a Rebecca Tope novel while having it .
The Asian nurse is also encouraging of my talents .
The hospital is understanding also , of how , if ever I need to change the day of an infusion ( the only reason is a public holiday ) I need to do it at least two infusions in advance and I need to know which nurses are on .
When I go to the doctor , I will only see one doctor , and my doctor is understanding of my autism .
My rheumatologist sees it as a gift , and my gastroenterologist is also understanding of me .
As I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are like that and she understands .
I also do n't like being touched .
I found maths tricky and my teacher noted my handwriting was not great .
I remember a teacher writing on my paper , " Repeat neatly ! " The best teacher I had was my first Year Two teacher , who noticed these things , and co-ordination , and suggested I be assessed , as she feared I had muscular dystrophy .
I did really well in spelling , though .
Halfway through the year , that teacher left , and was replaced by a cranky , old school teacher , who undid the good my other teacher did .
My Grade Three teacher was worse , and my mother told me that I 'd be staying in Year Three ( I went up to Year Four ) and I know that had I repeated Year Three with the same teacher , it would have been a recipe for disaster .
I remember , even further back , I was upset one day in kindergarten , by some kids squealing .
The teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt you ! " but it really upset me .
I am actually finding that I can remember dates going back to when I was about four and can remember what the weather was like and what I was doing on those days .
I remember my grandmother telling me that when she was very small ( she was the second youngest of eleven children ) her family had a piano and her sister had just finished playing and left the lid of the piano up .
My grandmother climbed up onto the stool and played the music from memory .
Fearing punishment , she hid under the stool , and my great-grandmother picked her up and asked her to play it again , and she did .
I said to my father , when I was 38 , that my grandparents did n't have one autistic grandchild , they had two ( my cousin and I ) .
I also remember my maternal grandfather telling me that his mother 's brother had a memory for piano tunes and could play without the music .
My father 's sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and I have picked up some of it from my grandmother , and I believe this to be true .
Looking at my own childhood , I remember I did n't like certain textures of food ( I did n't like bread , and I learnt I 'm coeliac at 31 ) , and I remember my mother used to read to me at mealtimes , and I could recite the books before I went to school .
I remember , when I was four , sitting in my maternal grandparents ' lounge reciting a book my parents had bought me a short time earlier .
When I was six , I remember being fascinated by concrete mixer trucks and I colour coded them according to the company they were owned by .
I can also remember pacing the backyard telling myself stories , something my mother described as stupid .
As I moved into my teenage years , I developed an intense interest in Japan and Japanese .
I remember I cried when I heard the story of Sadako , the little girl who developed leukaemia from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with neurotypical people .
We went through a diagnostic process with our child .
We were guided by the school where he was having problems socially and emotionally .
At the end of the process the diagnosis was dyspraxia .
The school continued to address ' sensory difficulties ' they had identified by offering headphones and structuring groups differently .
He continued not to present any sensory difficulties at home .
We saw an Educational Psychologist .
He scored very highly in IQ based testing despite how dyspraxia skews this kind of test result .
The school did n't act on his intelligence at all , continued with headphones and so on .
One day he took them off , making a declaration of how he did n't need them .
He got into trouble .
We were at our wits end .
On advice from the educational psychologist we moved schools .
The Head at the new school got him from day one , the next school change experience was equally seamless .
He is clumsy in a dyspraxic way , he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great .
He 's very bright , he 's very social .
Because of the history I still switch to worry mode if he says something is too loud .
It 's usually the vacuum , the complaint is usually because he 's trying to work .
I am thankful we got good diagnostics because we were able to access occupational therapy .
Whatever the diagnosis , it 's access to the most useful therapies and services that is crucial .
Things are more tricky now , resources are more stretched which is very sad .
Gosh - reading your description of your son as a toddler , you could have been describing mine ! We never had him tested as he appeared to " learn to cope with himself " as he got older .
He is 24 now and a professional musician .
It constantly surprises me that a little boy with such strict adherence to routine and structure has chosen a profession with such little external structure in it .
Appreciate this insightful , generous , tender story .
My grandson was diagnosed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is hard at work on his third novel .
Intellectual , social , engaging , opinionated , tall and handsome , he also struggles mightily with all sorts of quirks and obsessions .
Unpredictable , but always kind , he teaches me constantly .
My offspring is asd , early diagnosis 3 years , specialist schooling to 24 .
every educational and clinical profile suggested her father 's interesting traits would be regarded as high functioning asd .
Its sad that many ccg and LA teams are refusing ( illegally ) to assess and support from young ages now as a result of funding scarcity .
That critical and much derided label can be the gateway to additional support .
Thanks for the article and all comments .
For those who see no point in considering whether dead relatives might have any purpose , I think the increased acceptance of them in the emotions of the living is a good thing for mental health .
For those who see no point in the diagnosis of older or successful adults or of children who are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labelling of their weirdness gives them increased access to " reasonable adjustment " from many sectors of first-world economies - even to the extent that a friend who could get the magic paper has got onto a list for the specialist since he was told that " if he had been proven to be on the spectrum " he would have won the position he applied for at his workplace .
I did n't bother getting the magic piece of paper until I realised that , should I have to go into hospital or a high-support home , I would be expected to be conventionally social .
The diagnosis means I wo n't have to say ( over and over ) that it 's not depression or some madness : I just do n't have standard emotional reactions , I am analytic where many get emotional and respond strongly where others see no problem .
I do n't do nt get on well with standard chat , bright lights , noisy dinners where I am expected to keep track of conversations further than the next seat , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , polyester etc , people who want to stand close or hug without permission as a standard greeting , scratchy labels on silk clothing , sugar-coated medical advice .
So older probably-Aspies might consider that .
All in all , for daily life , COVID-19 physical distancing rules have made my life easier .
Just saying .
The genetic cause is pretty well established .
Having said that , there 's a big variation in how severely a person has it , whether they live in circumstances making it easier or harder to cope , or even to thrive etc .
Thank you so much for writing and sharing your experiences in trying to cope .
I can appreciate how exhausting the effort you put into trying to ' fit in ' must be .
You write very well , you certainly have no trouble expressing yourself with this medium !  My 8 year old grand daughter has been diagnosed .
She too has trouble in over stimulating environments , making transitions from one activity to another , sharing attention with other children , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
She is quite underweight , and we worry about that .
Other than that ( ! ) , she is very bright , has a laser focus on what interests her , and , I hope will be happy as she gets older .
The social scene of teen-age hood will probably be very hard for her .
You are not a terrible person , and you never were .
I am sorry you were bullied as a child and not given consideration at work .
If it would make you feel better to have an official diagnosis , I hope that you will be able to get that , however , you do n't need it to access the support of others .
I am sure that any forum will welcome you , please give it a try .
I am sorry you are so unhappy .
I live in Canada , and suspect you are in the UK .
I would like to give you a virtual hug , if that is something you like , and I can still do that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parent and are present throughout a person 's life in virtually every cell in the body .
These mutations are also called germline mutations because they are present in the parent 's egg or sperm cells , which are also called germ cells .
When an egg and a sperm cell unite , the resulting fertilized egg cell receives DNA from both parents .
If this DNA has a mutation , the child that grows from the fertilized egg will have the mutation in each of his or her cells .
Acquired ( or somatic ) mutations occur at some time during a person 's life and are present only in certain cells , not in every cell in the body .
These changes can be caused by environmental factors such as ultraviolet radiation from the sun , or can occur if an error is made as DNA copies itself during cell division .
Acquired mutations in somatic cells ( cells other than sperm and egg cells ) can not be passed to the next generation .
Genetic changes that are described as de novo ( new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , the mutation occurs in a person 's egg or sperm cell but is not present in any of the person 's other cells .
In other cases , the mutation occurs in the fertilized egg shortly after the egg and sperm cells unite .
( It is often impossible to tell exactly when a de novo mutation happened .
) As the fertilized egg divides , each resulting cell in the growing embryo will have the mutation .
De novo mutations may explain genetic disorders in which an affected child has a mutation in every cell in the body but the parents do not , and there is no family history of the disorder .
This is actually how changes in organisms happen over time .
You know , ' evolution ' .
As for the discussion at hand , there have been many genes that seem to be different in some people diagnosed with autism ; but there has been , so far , no one , or any cluster , that can define the person has having autism .
That is why there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  ASD has a tendency to run in families , but the inheritance pattern is usually unknown .
People with gene changes associated with ASD generally inherit an increased risk of developing the condition , rather than the condition itself .
When ASD is a feature of another genetic syndrome , it can be passed on according to the inheritance pattern of that syndrome .
we 're all neurodiverse , there actually is no ' neurotypical ' , there is a huge , infinite range and we all sit somewhere on it .
People talk about diversity but sometimes still want to make things binary by opposing ' neurodiverse ' and ' neurotypical ' - it is n't a binary opposition of two categories- .
The derogatory way that some people talk about ' neurotypicals ' sometimes really pees me off as its just reproducing and perpetuating mistaken beliefs and prejudice .
That , and other descriptions Agbabi makes of her possible autistic traits is intriguing .
I went to one of her poetry gigs years ago and it was a pretty riotous affair , lots of noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political shouting from the audience .
That must have been difficult for someone with those kind of sensitivities ( hope that 's right word ) to deal with ; maybe her performances are calmer affairs now .
Agbabi 's poetry is pretty good .
Green , I use the word " disorder " because that is what the medical community uses .
The term " disorder " is n't meant as a judgement or an insult .
Most of us have some sort of disorder or other , whether it 's major or minor , whether it 's temporary or lifelong .
For example , myopia is a disorder of eyesight .
When most people get a diagnosis of myopia , they do n't consider it a personal attack ; they get glasses or contacts so they can function in a world of sighted people .
Thank you for this article .
My autistic nephew also loves Thomas the Tank Engine , and has memorised the schedules of a large part of the British rail and bus system .
My brother tells me of the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally changed his focus to the non-stop babbling of his son , he was told where he had taken the wrong turn , and was guided , turn by turn , back to that point .
look at his behaviour and are strongly reminded of the attributes of my rather unloved father .
So I suppose that also explains much about the trajectory of my own unsettled life .
She 's not worried about where he got it , but she is now seeing her mother in a new light and she is worried that the medical profession due to misconceptions about who can be autistic and what the symptoms are is failing girls and women by not diagnosing them as quickly as boys .
Raising awareness that girls can be autistic too though they might not present in the same way as we expect them too is important .
And it 's not just with autism , the medical profession in general uses men as the standard model and therefore often fails to diagnose women as quickly as men , for example heart attacks are recognised more frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many unnecessary deaths .
I knew there was something very odd about my mother from a very young age and it would have been huge if other people had realized and helped instead of not interfering and minding their own business .
Having other people as a resource is to throw a life line to a young child and may mitigate the damage .
My sister worked out she was ' Aspy ' as she puts it in her late ' 50s .
It was a relief to find out that she was different , rather than merely confused by others .
I think my mother too was .
She now has alzheimers so it is a little difficult to explore that now .
Growing up everything had to have a story around it .
Going shopping was a nightmare , especially when served directly , e .
clothes stores , as your entire life 's history was regurgitated .
But now I think that was her way of creating a world that she could operate in , even if she did n't understand it .
When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues in comparison with the past , I would say many were hiding in plain site , if only anyone had looked , especially amongst women who tend to present differently .
I have often wondered about how the culture of a family is effected by having a parent who is aspy or actually mentally ill .
How far does a child who grows up in a family where there is such a parent have to go to overcome the behavioral influence and odd socialization that can result from the odd acculturation ? I think it 's a long journey to ' normal ' and a lifetime 's work to discover the maladaptations and to reorient .
It 's a long process unpicking the legacy of living with a ' norm ' that you realize may be not very normal after you realize that you 've inherited action patterns and reactions that are at variance with other peoples acculturation .
Trying to recreate a healthy dynamic , copying it as well as you can from good examples is a challenge and a life 's work .
I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment for an eating disorder .
It was a massive penny drop .
I am 51 and female and my whole life I have known I was different .
I did n't know why .
I am hypersensitive to many things particularly , to noise and temperature .
Some textures of foods make me gag .
I notice everything in detail , all at once and have no filter , so I get sensory overload quickly .
I have a lot of little rules about everything that only make sense to me .
But I am high functioning and I have a high IQ and was a gifted child .
I am extremely creative .
But I am aware that I am considered eccentric .
I have been called opinionated and blunt .
I have upset people and have genuinely no clue why .
I do not know social interaction instinctively .
Everything is rehearsed .
I play conversations and scenarios in my head over and over and over continually , so I will know how to react in any situation .
This is tailored to each person I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities , so I can rehearse my interactions with them before they happen .
But if someone goes " off script " it throws me , I do n't always give the expected response then .
If someone is unexpectedly emotional , I freeze , like I have blown a circuit , I am overloaded .
I feel empathy with their emotion but I have no idea what to do with that , I desperately search my database of responses , this can take time , meanwhile they are crying .
Sometimes I misunderstand , overreact or get the emotional temperature wrong .
Indifferent to something people think is important , over the top enthusiasm for something mundane .
memorise jokes and interesting information continually , so I have something to say and practice inserting them into imaginary conversations .
Sometimes it is years before the correct sequence in a real life conversation occurs and I can insert the joke appropriately .
You can appreciate this is exhausting and I do n't socialise much .
I hate meeting new people because I have n't " learned them " .
I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get as an adult .
I feel the medical profession have failed autistic women .
It has ruined my life because I thought I was a terrible person .
I was bullied at school and have been bullied at work .
Some people do n't like " weirdos " .
I find it hard to keep friends and have never had a romantic relationship .
I would like the diagnosis , I do n't feel able to access support or talk to fellow ASD people without it .
I have long suspected myself of being effected by this .
I was a nightmare as a child .
Asked to do things I felt meaningless I would kick off and punch out .
I was also ahead of others in all the ways autism described .
I was reading alone at 3 , I was reading Robert Heinlein at 6 .
At that age I had a perfect memory .
I was also very ill as a child .
I should have died .
At 8 years old I ( or rather my mother , I was sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told that my kidney diesease gave me a 10% ( at best ) hope of surviving to 16 .
Needless to say I survived .
I 'm now 51 .
But this has effected my whole life .
I am very introvert , compulsive and fit in with all the supposed signs of autism .
I do n't dispute the fact that these things exist .
I dispute their point .
I dispute the way these things are uzsed to seperate people .
Too much is made of differences , and not enough of similarities .
If we are all ' on the spectrum ' to some extent , that means we are all more the same than is made out .
When I 'm allowed to get past the ways I 'm different people see me a a beatiful and decent person , not as as an autistic person .
Too much emphasis is put on differnces and not enough on similarities .
Excelent post .
Unfortunatly some people are very reluctant to accept this , preferring to blame vaccines and other external causes .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was incredibly withdrawn and insular .
One day he saw me reading the review of the latest Marvel movie on the web and realising I was a fan opened up as if we had been lifelong friends .
You only often see one side of autistic children , but the hidden side can be wonderful .
Great article , thank you .
I test half and half , I am synesthesic , claustrophobic , and sensitive to labels and seams+++ .
I buy t .
shirts and tops oversized so that I can put french seams in them .
If only I could wear nothing but silk at all times .
Stay safe everyone , promise ?  100% correct -- autism is a genetic disorder , not a personality type .
But since it affects communication and behavior , and personality involves these , it does affect personality .
I 've commented above about online discussion about growing up with autistic parents before the average person knew what autism was .
There are some traits that very strongly suggest ASD , and they go beyond " quirky " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perception are affected by ASD , we can view these traits in a more objective , nonjudmental way .
For example , some of us had parents who could never attend a play or football game to watch us perform because " they hated noise .
" As kids , this made no sense to us and so we labeled our parent 's behavior as " selfish " or " unloving .
" But people with ASD can experience noise as extremely loud and anxiety-provoving , in a way " neurotypicals " can not understand .
Knowing this can help us forgive and move on , because it is n't anyone 's " fault .
"  That is just one example of an ASD trait that may affect parenting .
People who seek out groups such as ours usually have lists of a dozen traits or more .
Beautifully written patience and with such insight .
Yes , you may have slight autistic traits ( I have met you a few times attending your excellently executed workshops ) but you have also channelled your talents superbly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand your concern about retrospective diagnosis , and the sometimes-too-wide umbrella of " Autism Spectrum Disorder .
" But I 'd like you ( and others ) to consider a different point of view .
I commented above about being an adult with an autistic parent in the days before the average person knew that functioning adults COULD be autistic .
I also commented on the difficulties of moderating online discussion on this topic ( on Reddit and Facebook ) .
While I ca n't speak for the author of this piece , I can tell you that by the time people have come to our discussion groups , their " armchair diagnosis " of their elderly or deceased mother or father has gone way beyond some superficial stereotypes of behavior .
None of us came to " label " our parents after reading one article in " Parenting " magazine or seeing a TV show .
Learning about how ASD likely affected our parents ' parenting of us has helped us understand and , in many cases , forgive what had been inexplicable to us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " worried about it " so much as experiencing clarity about her mom 's behavior in light of her son 's behavior .
And that 's a good thing .
Just as a parent can learn how ASD is the reason her child ca n't endure bright lights or loud sounds , adults can learn how ASD may have caused their parents to act in certain ways that puzzled , enraged or even hurt us , without their having had any intent to do so .
I commented above on having a parent with ASD and the taboo of discussing this topic online .
Certainly the author loves her mom ( and I loved my dad ) .
And certainly the author 's mom loved her ( and my dad loved me ) .
But it needs to be okay for us to talk about how the traits of ASD affected our parents ' parenting , and about how we were impacted as children .
The here and now is very important , but sometimes we do need to confront and heal from the past in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This piece is much more more important than the author may realize .
A short history lesson shows why :  In the mid-1990s , a couple of books introduced " Asperger 's syndrome " ( or " high-functioning autism " ) to the public .
The relatively new diagnosis only dated back to the 1940s and has since officially disappeared , having been included under the term Autism Spectrum Disorder .
But prior to the 90s , the word " autistic " generally brought to mind the image of a small child ( usually a boy ) without speech , spinning in circles or slamming his head into a wall .
That " autistic " could also mean an adult with an occupation , spouse and children , functioning in " regular society , " simply did n't exist .
This was a seismic shift .
Today , people are finding answers to questions about themselves in a diagnosis of ASD , which is a developmental disorder affecting communication and thinking .
They 're learning how to navigate the unwritten social rules of work , marriage and parenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ASD .
I 'm part of a generation of adults in our 40s to 70s who understand now that OUR parents had ASD , even though they were never diagnosed ( and many of them have already passed away ) .
Understanding ASD helps us understand why our mothers and fathers were the way they were .
That 's what 's happening with the author .
But resistance to this concept is extreme .
As one of the few people who has helped moderate discussion of " adults with autistic parents " on Reddit and Facebook , I 've learned the very idea makes many people furious .
So furious , in fact , that multiple other such discussion groups have shut down .
A couple of very brief responses to the most common accusations :  1 Yes , we understand the pitfalls of armchair diagnosing ANYONE with ANYTHING , particularly posthumously .
But a real diagnosis of ASD usually includes a number of traits and behaviors that are VERY specific to ASD .
By the time we seek out online discussion for " adults with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our parents as simply quirky , stubborn or eccentric .
Our childhood experiences , and their affects on us , are so similar it suggests a syndrome of its own .
2 In labeling our parents " autistic , " we are n't trying to stigmatize or punish them .
Actually , just the opposite : understanding ASD helps us understand why our parents acted in certain ways , and can help us forgive and move on .
Parents with ASD are as loving as any other parents -- but because ASD affected their communication and behavior , it affected their parenting in significant ways that caused significant trauma in many of us .
It was also extraordinarily isolating , because we did n't have the words to explain .
3 Discussion about traits of ASD affect parenting should not be taboo .
It is n't a value judgement , and it does n't mean we advocate eugenics .
It is permissible to discuss how having parents who are immigrants , rich , poor , disabled , addicted , mentally ill or Hollywood celebrities affected us .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with autism affected us .
Please let us do that .
A few years ago , I read a piece highlighted in MedPage Today .
It was written by a Scandinavian doctor who lamented the American habit of medicalizing a normal state of being .
Personally , I see our insistence that children sit at attention for 8 hours and having a reduced chance to no chance of interaction with their classmates as an abnormal expectation , not the ranges of behavior described as " ADD " or " Autism Spectrum " .
School needs to be more " kid friendly " and less " test oriented " , especially considering decades of stressing the " test " has not produced any positive outcomes .
More art , more music , more recess .
Was this woman 's mother " autistic " .
Probably .
Did it negatively influence her life ? That is absolutely impossible to say .
We have millions of diabetics in the US that do n't follow a diet and a medication schedule and most of the are insured .
I am not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them very much , really identified with the wrenching away from the spinning top ! And your comment reminded me that when I lived abroad in a different culture for three years I seemed to fit in much better there .
I am shy , which is often misunderstood in so many ways ( snooty , stupid , etc ) , but in the other country that quality was appreciated , they did n't expect or want people to be brash or quick-witted etc .
I hope you get to Russia and find it an enriching experience .
What a wonderfully written heartfelt piece .
My son has Asperger 's and it has been a trial for him in some ways particularly pre-puberty ( for some reason a lot changed in his middle teens ) but he has some magnificent qualities that would not be there otherwise .
I have never forgotten his very individual way of flicking the bird to school sports day by strolling through a race casual as you like .
His musical ability is excellent also .
Social things still trouble him but he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ? Well his mother is not I think likely to be on any spectrum .
I on the other hand have many traits that could be seen that way .
I am too old to bother with a test now , I am what I am .
But in hindsight that human is something I have had to purposely learn to be in full knowledge of what I find hard to do , just as my son has , and he had it worse initially I think so a diagnosis helped him in that respect .
both see the world at a tangent , he in music me in words .
We use what we have , and if that is the case I am proud to have passed that on .
by the way " agarg " is just brilliant ! .
