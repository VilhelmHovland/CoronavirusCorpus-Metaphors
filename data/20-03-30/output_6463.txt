An inspiring message from a Schreiner University senior  An anonymous Schreiner University senior , who 's graduation ceremony in May most likely has been scrubbed thanks to the coronavirus pandemic , wrote a letter thanking the staff of the university for their support and guidance during their time in Kerrville .
The university shared the letter on social media , and it was picked up by San Antonio news media and seen by thousands of people .
While we do n't normally run anonymous letters , we 're pretty certain this is how a lot of college and university seniors are feeling about 2020 -- in the time of COVID-19 .
