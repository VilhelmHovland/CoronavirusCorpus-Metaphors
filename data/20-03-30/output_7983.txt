During COVID-19 Outbreak , Hungary 's Orb ? n Grabs Power  Prime Minister Viktor Orb ? n is pushing through a law that will sideline parliament indefinitely and jail anyone he deems to be spreading false information about the coronavirus .
RACHEL MARTIN , HOST :  There are only a few hundred confirmed cases of the virus in Hungary , but the nationalist government there has passed a law giving the prime minister unlimited power indefinitely .
Critics say , Prime Minister Viktor Orban is paving the way for one-man rule in a European Union nation .
Joanna Kakissis reports .
JOANNA KAKISSIS , BYLINE : Julia ( ph ) is a multilingual grandmother in Budapest who follows every rule to prevent the spread of COVID-19 .
Before Friday 's curfews were announced , she 'd only gone out once .
JULIA : I took my car from the garage , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchild from far away while she was playing in an empty park with her mom .
KAKISSIS : What she can not stomach is a law that extends a state of emergency indefinitely and allows Prime Minister Viktor Orban to bypass Parliament and rule by decree .
Julia asked us not to use her last name because she believes Orban will come after those who criticize him during the pandemic .
JULIA : He is afraid that where he ca n't manage the situation , that could make people turn away from him .
And that 's why I think that he would do just anything to stay in power because the situation is terrible .
ZSOFIA KOLLANYI : It 's not just that there is not enough nurses and doctors and so on , but also that we are spending , compared to our economy power , less and less on health care .
KAKISSIS : Orban 's government is supported by many people in Hungary .
KIM LANE SCHEPPELE : The one place where the state has really not been doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hungarians .
KAKISSIS : Kim Lane Scheppele is a professor at Princeton University and an expert on Hungary .
SCHEPPELE : So Orban 's been walking around with this Achilles ' heel of the health care system .
And suddenly , this giant arrow comes out of the sky and hits him right in the Achilles ' heel .
That 's what this pandemic is .
KAKISSIS : Orban did not talk a lot about the health care system last week when he told lawmakers why the bill granting him sweeping emergency powers was important .
( SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING )  PRIME MINISTER VIKTOR ORBAN : ( Through interpreter ) The pandemic has made change unavoidable .
This law helps us do whatever we can to defend Hungary .
KAKISSIS : That includes jail terms of up to five years for anyone spreading false information about the virus .
GABOR GYORI : That is an extremely subjective standard .
KAKISSIS : Gabor Gyori is a political analyst in Budapest .
GYORI : It can be applied to honest efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling the coronavirus cases .
It could be applied for posting something on Facebook that is factually accurate but it frightens people .
KAKISSIS : Georg Spottle is an analyst with a pro-government think tank .
Speaking on a bad connection from Budapest , he insists the government will use the law only to shut down online fraudsters .
GEORG SPOTTLE : Some criminals make website and writing fake news about martial law , about lack of food in Hungary , lack of clear water and everything .
KAKISSIS : Hungarian journalists are concerned about the law , but they 're also worried about losing their jobs .
Veronika Munk , deputy editor of the widely read online newspaper Index , points out that the few remaining independent media in Hungary rely on reader donations .
VERONIKA MUNK : If people lose their jobs , then they wo n't donate to us .
KAKISSIS : And if these media outlets go under , she says , there will be fewer voices left to challenge Viktor Orban .
