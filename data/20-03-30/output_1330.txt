Food review : Big appetites will be sated at House of the Rising Sun  I 'm beginning to wonder what we did in the bad old days before Covid-19 .
Subscribe to our daily newsletter  The pork belly bun was the dish of the day  Can you remember that far back ? It 's been , ooh , at least 10 days and my memory 's already a little hazy .
That 's because the gastronomic gymnastics of The House of the Rising Sun have blurred all that went before .
Did we really get in our cars , pop on a clean shirt , book a table , arrange a babysitter and go to all that time and trouble when we could instead have been eating a ? 40 quid feast from the comfort of our own sofa .
What fools .
Thank goodness for Corona .
The restaurant sector has been hit by a tsunami of redundancies and cancellations , leading to job losses on an unprecedented scale .
Not withstanding Chancellor Rishi 's intervention a week hence , allowing the sector to furlough staff , many are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinging on by their fingernails .
This eaterie may not be welcoming diners in the current crisis but it 's serving up a treat with a takeaway  Eating out -- or , should that be eating in -- is no longer an act of pleasure .
It 's an act of solidarity .
Whether that continues as new social distancing guidelines are introduced remains to be seen .
Our local restaurants are populated by some of the hardest working and most creative individuals in the county .
Most of them are stark staring mad , of course -- and proud to be , in many cases -- and now is the time when we ought to support them .
It 's perhaps no surprise that they had adapted within 24 hours of the Government 's decision to close restaurants .
That came on Friday March 20 and the next day most were already offering a **45;763;TOOLONG service , as well as a conventional takeaway offering supported by local transport/app providers .
The results , frankly , have been utterly , lip-smackingly gorgeous .
The House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And having enjoyed so much food for a fraction of the cost of eating out , we 're hoping this Covid-19 lark will last a while longer .
Advertising  I called .
They picked up within three rings .
" Do you do a takeaway ? " They did .
" How long does it take ? " 15 minutes .
Boom .
Fire the engine , we 're on our way .
Chicken madras served with rice  You 'd imagine restaurants with exceptional front of house staff would no longer have the chance to dazzle .
After all , they ca n't pour the wine , engage in conversation , ferry hot plates of food and do some of the smaller , more nuanced things that exceptional front of house staff do .
And you 'd be wrong .
For the service at The House of The Rising Sun was as good as it has ever been .
When I went to collect , the restaurant manager and another member of staff were at the door .
There was no handshaking and we observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite chat while the chef wrapped up the food .
Since its launch , The House of The Rising Sun -- and other restaurants in the group owned by entrepreneur Sam Taylor -- have been ahead of the game .
Smart , savvy , fashionable , switched on ; they observe opportunity while others are still daydreaming , they capitalise before others have got started , they provide assured standards that others find themselves following .
Advertising  The new takeaway era is no different .
Service is great -- believe me , having called a few this weekend , not all are operating to the same standard -- even though we 're no longer sitting down in a funky , Soho-esque dining room .
Intenseley flavoured shredded duck gyoza  Food travels about as well as a hardback book .
When you 're cooking to a reasonable level , it 's not intended to make its way into a plastic container before being ferried a mile or two across town .
And there 's no denying that what would have been a crisp batter on a deliciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its crunch in the five minutes it took to get it home .
The flavours , however , had not .
Nor , indeed , had the presentation .
Here 's the thing : while your local neighbourhood takeaway routinely slops food into a container with little thought or care , the guys at The House of The Rising Sun were plating as though dishes were going out to the restaurant .
So the sweet and sour was dressed with a swish of sweet and sour sauce before being laid on a bed of sticky Thai rice .
A container of stir-fried egg noodles with pork -- a snip at ? 4 .
-- emerged steaming and thrillingly sweet and sticky from its container .
Edamame beans  A tandoor chicken masala with ballsy chunks of cauliflower and other seasonal vegetables was topped with chopped coriander and served with a crisp , straight-out-the-fryer poppadum .
Delicious .
And frankly ridiculously good value for ? 7 .
Edamame beans were offered salty , sticky or spicy ; we opted for the former and enjoyed them as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perfectly presented starters .
A duck gyoza featured shredded confit duck with Peking plum sauce .
Intensely flavoured with meltingly tender meat , it set angels dancing on my tongue .
An exquisite Korean pork belly bao bun was the dish of the day .
Served on a soft , feathered bun , laid flat , and stacked with a kewpie mayo , sesame seeds , perfectly fermented kimchi and glazed in a tangy Korean sauce , the meat had been cooked thoroughly until the fat rendered out .
Slightly crisp and indulgent , I took out an engagement ring and proposed to it on the spot .
Won-der-ful , as Craig Revel-Horwood might have said .
We 'd ordered too much food -- great , plenty left for tomorrow -- and been dazzled by flavourbombs that offered hits of umami and sweet , savoury and salt .
Textures were good ; remarkable , truly , given the travel thing , while presentation was as impressive as a morning suit on a wedding day .
A plate of delicious chicken noodles  I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit Kat for dessert , but it would be a lie .
The House of The Rising Sun had sated the healthiest of appetites .
To steal from the Chancellor , it 's on all of us to support our local communities and those who work within them while Covid-19 plays merry hell with what we once considered normal .
But if that means eating food of the quality and value provided by The House of The Rising Sun , I 'm hoping that damned virus sticks around for a while yet .
If you 've not yet tried it ; now 's the time .
Taylor and his team wo n't be letting the sun go down on them .
If you know a great restaurant that 's offering a brilliant take-away service , let us know .
