Mark Zuckerberg announced that he would be contributing $25 million via his foundation , the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , to research for therapies and medicine to treat COVID-19 .
Zuckerberg 's contribution will go to funding the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator , which was launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation earlier this month with the Wellcome Trust as a partner .
The initiative started with $125 million in seed funding at its launch on 9 March .
The goal of the project is to develop affordable treatments to COVID-19 that can be distributed at scale .
The accelerator will evaluate new drugs as well as repurpose existing ones for the treatment of COVID-19 .
Evaluating existing drugs is a particularly important part of the accelerator 's research , as they would have already gone through clinical safety trials and could be distributed more quickly .
' If they 're effective , it will be much faster to make them available than it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a year or more , ' wrote Zuckerberg in a Facebook announcement .
' I 'm looking forward to seeing what the Therapeutics Accelerator discovers .
'  In the long term , it is hoped the research from the Therapeutics Accelerator can be used to fight other viral pathogens .
Shortly after Zuckerberg announced the contribution to the Gates Foundation initiative , he made another funding pledge , committing $100 million to help news outlets , many of which are feeling the economic impact of the pandemic , even despite increased readership .
' Right now journalists are working under very difficult conditions to keep their communities informed , ' wrote Zuckerberg .
' Local news is especially hard hit , so we 're committing $25 million for emergency grant funding through the Facebook Journalism Project , and another $75 million in marketing spend to support journalists and news organizations covering the crisis .
