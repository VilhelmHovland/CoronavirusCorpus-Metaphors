Social Distancing Party Parade  Info from Licensor : " Our son was turning 6 years old on the day of the video .
We had arranged a big party for him quite some time ago but because of the current status of our world , the party had to be canceled .
He was amazed when he heard the news and understood as best he could .
We still wanted to try to make this special , so we sent out an optional invite on Facebook to his friends and family to see if everyone could join us to line up some cars and have somewhat of a parade .
We requested no gifts for contamination reason ( though you can see some still brought some ) .
He was totally surprised and said it was the best birthday ever .
He had an amazing time .
It felt great to see that light back in his life .
