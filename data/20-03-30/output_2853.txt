Tokyo Olympics : Looking for a new date for opening , closing  TOKYO -- The Tokyo Olympics need new dates for the opening and closing ceremonies in 2021 .
Nothing much can get done until those dates are worked out by the International Olympic Committee , the Japanese government and Tokyo organizers .
" We must decide this soon , otherwise it will be hard to decide on other things to follow , " Toshiro Muto , the CEO of the organizing committee , told his 30 senior directors -- all men but one -- seated in a large meeting room on Thursday .
Two days after the unprecedented postponement was announced , the group gathered for the first meeting of what is being called the " Tokyo 2020 New Launch Task Force .
" They must put the Olympics back together after they were torn apart by the coronavirus pandemic .
Muto and the president of the organizing committee , Yoshiro Mori , each gave pep speeches .
Mori , an 82-year-old former Japanese prime minister , drew on war memories from his youth to summon the resolve to redo in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  He talked of his father going " to the war in the Pacific " and leaving a rugby ball and a baseball glove behind for his young son .
" I 'm sorry , I 'm an old person and I talk about the old days , " Mori said .
" I 'm comparing this to the old days and I might be criticized by the media .
However , this is the emotion I have inside me and this is the emotion I have as we face the predicament in front of us .
"  Muto ran off a condensed string of issues to be resolved : ticketing , security , venues , merchandise , accommodation , the Athletes Village , transportation and lining up unpaid volunteers .
He added he was looking at " thousands of contracts " and the interests of broadcasters , sponsors , the IOC , world sports federations and national Olympic committees .
" I did n't imagine at all we 'd be tested to this degree , " he acknowledged .
He also voiced another reality .

The Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei has estimated added costs due to the delay of $2 .
billion .
This would go on top of an official budget of $12 .
billion .
A Japanese national audit agency , however , says the actual amount of spending is about twice that size .
IOC President Thomas Bach said Wednesday that " all options are on the table " for new dates .
He said next year 's Olympics do n't have to be restricted to summer in the Northern Hemisphere and might occur sooner .
Two of the marquee Olympic events -- track and swimming -- have already scheduled their own world championships for July and August of 2021 .
If the Olympics are moved into spring , when it 's cooler in Tokyo , they clash with the end of the European soccer season .
In North America , they would bump into Major League Baseball , NBA basketball , NHL hockey and possibly even college basketball .
That 's assuming normal sports schedules resume by then .

Hidemasa Nakamura , the games delivery officer , was pressed again on dates .
" That 's something we have n't decided on yet , " he said .
" We have no idea when we will be able to finalize the dates .
We do n't have a fixed plan how to proceed from here .
