Brace for a more authoritarian China  Last week , China 's health authorities said there had been only one new case of local transmission of Covid-19 over the previous five days .
In the city of Wuhan , the epicentre of the outbreak in China and source of the global pandemic which has sent billions of people into lockdown , had none .
The claims were met with deep skepticism by experts -- indeed , as have the country 's overall coronavirus numbers .
Washington Post correspondent Anna Fifield , who 's stuck in Havelock North after China banned entry to foreigners , says Chinese statistics are , at the best of times , unreliable and massaged to fit political aims .
To think there 's only been one domestic transmission in a country of 1 .
billion people seems , quite frankly , ridiculous , she says .
" It 's understandable that there 's skepticism about numbers , and the evaluation of the situation in China because , first of all , the Chinese government did cover up the virus for the first month at least , and then blatantly lied about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which definitely led to the spread of the virus across China .
"  Some schools have re-opened , in less populated areas , and many people are returning to work , emerging from coronavirus-forced hibernation into a new world of physical distancing .
Optimistic noises are being made about factories restarting .
Chinese society is being put back together , albeit in an economy that , relatively speaking , is barely functioning .
The big question now , Fifield says , is the size of the economic hit .
" The economy has n't contracted since the end of the cultural revolution in 1976 and in fact the Chinese leader Xi Jinping has a goal of having the economy double from 2010 to 2020 .
" If the economy does contract in this quarter and that impact lasts through the rest of the year , that 's going to have really huge political implications as well as , obviously , very clear implications for people 's standard of living and quality of life .
"  Fifield says the Party has ruled China in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom -- a compact that 's been somewhat begrudgingly accepted by most people in past decades .
It has been tolerated , in the main , because of big increases in wealth and living standards .
Once the virus is contained , there 's the prospect of a big economic downturn with mass unemployment and lower wages .
It seems unavoidable considering the United States , which has a rapacious appetite for Chinese goods and services , is also heading for a recession .
The Communist Party 's promise of unending growth , therefore , would be broken .
" That could undermine the legitimacy of the Communist Party , " Fifield says .
She quickly adds she 's not predicting the collapse of communist rule in China .
" But it will fundamentally change the deal with society .
"  How so ? There might be personnel changes , she suggests , and it may weaken the authority of leader Xi Jinping .
" He 's personalised the Chinese political system like no one since Mao Zedong .
So it could really weaken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could just lead to more bubbling up , more criticism within society .
"  Some speculate the virus debacle -- the coverup , the bungled response , the high-profile death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang -- might spark a re-think from the Communist Party to act more transparently .
" I think it will probably lead to more tightening in China , " Fifield said .
" The system will get more authoritarian and stricter and the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) will think that they need more of this technological surveillance and more ability to lock down whole cities , with millions of people , and increase the need for these authoritarian tools , not the opposite .
"  University of Canterbury professor Anne-Marie Brady , a China expert , says , on the one hand it 's hard to believe the CCP could be even more repressive .
But the Party 's " micro-controls " over Chinese society have dramatically increased during the Covid-19 crisis .
She notes people have been literally locked into their houses , and videos emerged of doors being welded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as an opportunity to further strengthen societal and political controls in China .
"  Changing the narrative  China is keenly aware its disastrous mishandling of the virus has hurt its international reputation .
A report emerged at the weekend of furious British Ministers saying China faces a " reckoning " .
The most public repudiation , of course , has been US President Donald Trump 's many public statements linking the virus back to China and Wuhan .
( Brady : " Occasionally Trump gets a home run .
" )  The Communist Party has pushed back hard against such narratives , including expelling 13 American journalists working for the New York Times , Wall Street Journal , and Fifield 's Washington Post .
At the same time , China has launched an international charm offensive , making seemingly magnanimous donations and sales of masks and medical equipment to Spain , Italy and other nations affected by Covid-19 .
" It seems to be working in a lot of ways , " Fifield says .
" The Italian government in particular has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at this time , contrasting that with the lack of help from other European countries , or from the US -- before the US got hit with this .
"  However , the move backfired , somewhat , as hundreds of thousands of masks and test kits being revealed as defective .
Brady , of the University of Canterbury , says international critiques of China by world leaders have been incredibly muted .
Outwardly , then , one might think the reputational damage to China will be limited .
But Brady believes more is happening in the background .
She refers to the Chinese saying : " Zuo er bu shuo " -- which means , to do and not say .
" It makes sense to me that the small and medium powers wo n't be shouting they 'll just be acting -- pull together more , strengthen their cooperation .
"  A test of China 's outward attitude will be when its borders re-open to foreigners .
Fifield says : " I still have my press card and will be returning when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen for 18 months .
She 's deeply troubled by China 's expulsion of journalists -- which has been reported as a tit for tat move after the US designated five Chinese state media outlets as foreign missions , capping the number of journalists that can work for them .
" That 's the kind of thing that governments do in the lead-up to a war , " Brady says .
" It 's a very worrying action .
"  Credible information is crucial in a crisis .
The pandemic is pushing us into an unknown and uncertain future .
As the crisis unfolds the need for accurate , balanced and thorough reporting will be vital .
