TOKYO -- Japanese car makers slashed output in February at home and in other major production centers , suggesting the industry was slowing down before the full weight of the coronavirus pandemic crashed down in March .
While China was a big factor , since most factories had to close there in February during the worst of the coronavirus 's spread , it was n't the only cause .
Nissan 's production had been declining due to falling sales around the world .
Its production fell 29% in Japan and 24% in the U .
in February .
Honda 's production was down 14% in Japan and 5% in the U .
in February .
Much steeper declines are expected in March , when the novel coronavirus spread around the globe and was declared a pandemic .
Car makers have closed factories in Asia , Europe and the U .
this month so that workers can stay home .
The shutdowns are likely to last until at least early or mid-April in the U .
and until at least late April in Europe .

Car sales could drop to 69 million units this year from 90 million in 2019 if the virus continues to spread into the second half of the year , according to a March 27 report from LMC Automotive , a forecasting firm .
On Friday , Nissan said it would cut one of two shifts at its plant on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu in April before suspending production completely starting in May .
The company said this is due to lower car sales .
The Kyushu plant ships Rogue sport-utility vehicles to the U .
On the brighter side , plants in China are expected to ramp up production starting in April .
