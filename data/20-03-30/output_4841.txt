Indonesians are brilliant in a crisis .
In many ways , they have to be , in a country that unfortunately experiences more than its fair share of tragedy .
Sitting on the " Ring of Fire " , Indonesia is no stranger to earthquakes , tsunamis , volcanic eruptions , and floods .
Its transportation safety record is similarly bleak , with plane , train , bus , and ferry disasters all too common .
Sprawled across the thousands of islands that make up the archipelago , it is the " rakyat " , or the general population , who immediately rally in Indonesia , while the central administration often dithers .
The response to the coronavirus pandemic has been no different .
In Medan , North Sumatra , a plucky team of students from GMKI , or the Indonesian Students ' Christian Movement , have stepped in to fill a gap in the city 's crisis response .
They have started making their own hand sanitiser .
Meliana Gultom is the head of the Medan chapter of GMKI and an education administration student .
" Coronavirus has already infiltrated Medan , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene practices , as the price of hand sanitiser has risen so sharply in the past few weeks .
Making our own was something concrete that we could do to help now .
We do n't just want words .
"  Asked if they are not worried they might poison someone if they get the hand sanitiser formula wrong , they burst into giggles .
In Medan , hand sanitiser has been nearly impossible to buy for over a month , and when it can be found , the price of a small bottle has risen from IDR13,000 ( US$0 .
) to over IDR80,000 ( $5 ) in some cases .
The students decided to make their own sanitiser using a formula from the World Health Organization that they found online .
The ingredients and the equipment such as bottles and syringes were all donated by GMKI members , and on the first day of production the students made roughly five litres .
They then took to the streets of Medan , spritzing members of the public with a coin sized amount of liquid to remind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger amounts of the hand sanitiser to churches and mosques , as well as refugee settlements sheltering people from Afghanistan , Iran , Myanmar and other countries .
" It 's important for us to do this , " says Jaya Sinaga , Deputy Secretary of GMKI Medan .
" The government does n't seem to have the resources to do something similar , so we are helping them .
There has n't been a fast response from the provincial administration , so hopefully they will see what we have done and get moving .
"  The Indonesian government has been widely criticised both locally and internationally for bungling its initial response to the outbreak of Covid-19 .
In the early days before a pandemic was declared , Indonesia 's Health Minister Terawan attributed the lack of local Covid-19 cases to the " power of prayer " and urged the public to " keep praying " in order to stay safe .
Faced with bungling from the administration , the public often takes it on itself to act .
As Murdoch University 's Ian Wilson describes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely in part due to the relative absence of reliable or equitable government services .
" Religious organisations and even patronage networks often become doubly important when things go wrong , and can mobilise far quicker than the government , unfettered by bureaucracy , and often free of the red tape that government or NGOs may face .
The GMKI students are a good example .
The students have the confidence of youth and the community spirit to just get it done .
Asked if they are not worried they might poison someone if they get the hand sanitiser formula wrong , they burst into giggles and point out that they have followed the WHO recipe closely .
They 've also been working with pharmaceutical students , who have supervised production .
And while they may have started work quickly , their strategy is impressively well thought out .
It 's not just about raising awareness about good hygiene .
The students are worried that the price of the materials used to make the sanitiser will also increase in the coming months .
It currently costs them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanitiser .
" We wanted to show that it does n't have to be expensive , " says Gultom .
" We hope the government is watching , so that they do n't let price gouging become a problem .
"  " With all our resources , we will try to prevent the spread of Coronavirus in Medan .
We hope everyone will follow us .
We can defeat this .
We 're all in .
