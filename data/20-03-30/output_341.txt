Financial Markets Rattled By The Multiple Effects Of COVID-19  NPR 's Noel King talks to economist Megan Greene , a senior fellow at Harvard 's Kennedy School , about how President Trump 's European travel ban will impact financial markets .
( SOUNDBITE OF BELL )  NOEL KING , HOST :  That is the sound of the opening bell on Wall Street .
Just minutes after it rang yesterday , U .
stocks fell so fast that it triggered a 15-minute halt in trading .
By the time the day was over , the Dow and the S&amp;P had experienced their biggest one-day drop since 1987 .
Lawmakers in Washington continued to work on an economic rescue package .
They 're , of course , trying to respond to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic .
Economist Megan Greene is in the studios of WBUR in Boston .
She 's a senior fellow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
MEGAN GREENE : Good morning .
KING : So I want to step back here because this has been a really odd and interesting week .
President Trump outlined some proposals to stimulate the economy on Wednesday night .
And then yesterday , Thursday , the market goes into meltdown .
What is happening here ?  GREENE : Well , I think a piece of it was President Trump 's address .
He seemed nervous , so it did n't really instill confidence .
You know , he made three errors in a scripted address that he had to correct afterwards .
So I think that 's a piece of it , but I also think that what 's going on in the rest of the world and particularly Italy , where the entire country 's been shut down , is playing into it as well .
It just suggests that this has gone from being a supply-side shock where the worry was that , you know , American companies would n't be able to get parts to finish their products to sell an appliance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home .
And so you do n't have people out buying stuff to finally this week being a financial shock where , yesterday , the Fed had to step in with emergency liquidity measures to try to deal with some of the funding stress in the markets .
And so this crisis has moved , you know , at a lightning speed from just a supply-side shock to all three kinds of shock .
And I think that 's driven the markets .
KING : Let me disambiguate something you said there about the demand shock because it 's very easy to not quite get that , right ? I go into the supermarket , the shelves are empty , there 's no wipes , there 's no Lysol .
And I say , well , everybody 's buying everything .
There must be a lot of demand , right ? So where 's the shock coming in ?  GREENE : Yeah .
So there 's some demand from the - you know , from people buying groceries and hand sanitizer and masks , but generally , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And also if you think about the guy who runs a coffee stand on the corner of the street in Manhattan , he 's not getting business because people are n't walking to work anymore .
And the Uber driver in , you know , some city where a big concert 's been canceled , he 's not getting rides .
So if you kind of multiply that out across the entire economy , that really adds up , and that creates a demand-side shock .
KING : Congress - lawmakers are working on an economic rescue package with the Trump administration .
What do we know about what 's in it ?  GREENE : So we know that Trump announced that he 's , by executive decree , leaning on the Small Business Administration to increase loans to small and medium-sized companies that form the backbone of our economy .
And he 's increasing them by $50 billion , so that 's a lot .
That 's positive .
He mentioned a payroll tax , but actually , Nancy Pelosi has come out , and she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be voted on , and it does n't include a payroll tax .
It seems like what it does include is free coronavirus testing for everyone , 14 days of paid sick leave .
We 're not really sure how that 'll be paid for , so it could be tax rebates , it could be that companies just have to apply to get that money back - we 're not sure - increased funds for Medicaid , which is really important because both states and the federal government have to contribute to Medicaid .
And so the federal government is saying we 'll contribute more , which means that states wo n't have to make fiscally constrained decisions , especially when it comes to health care , and then , finally , enhanced unemployment benefits and food aid , which is really important if you think about lots of families who , you know , their kids get food at school as part of SNAP , and actually , if schools close , where are they going to get those meals from - so figuring out how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for SNAP , which is the food stamps benefit , and also increase unemployment benefits .
So that should help , but it 's nowhere near as far as we need to go .
What we need to see is checks cut across the economy to everyone so you can get money to everyone , you know , the small Uber driver and the coffee shop guy .
You might get checks to people who do n't need them , but that 's OK .
We need to get money out really quickly .
KING : And you 're talking , in the seconds we have left , about me just getting a check in the mail .
GREENE : Yes , that 's right .
And you can do it in , you know , about six weeks in theory .
So that 's the fastest way to distribute money and counter this demand-side shock that we 're seeing .
KING : That would be really interesting .
Economist Megan Greene at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , thanks so much .
