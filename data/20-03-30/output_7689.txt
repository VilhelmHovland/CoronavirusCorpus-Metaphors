what we 're dealing with .
There 's no question as to the consequences .
There 's no question as to the grief on the loss of life , and there 's no question about what we must do .
They 're on Lee two missions .
There are only two operations that we need to perform first .
The public has to be responsible .
Stay at home .
When I issued the stay at home order , it was n't .
It would be nice if you did .
Uh , it is a mandate .
Stay at home .
If you 're a non essential workers stay at home .
If you leave the house , you 're exposing yourself to danger .
If you leave the house , you 're exposing others to danger .
You can get infected , go home , and in fact , whoever 's at home .
So stay at home .
I know the isolation can be boring and oppressive .
It is better than the alternative life , his options , right ? Stay at home .
That is the best option if you are out .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want proximity to other people , and you want to stay away from places that are dense .
Still , in New York City , you have too many places with too much density .
I mean , I do n't know how many different ways to make the same point ? New York City parks .
We made the point .
There 's too much density .
You want to go to the park or to the park , but not in a dense area , not in playgrounds , where you 're playing basketball with other people on .
I have said that that New York City is trying to reduce the density in those playgrounds .
Thus far , they have not been successful .
If that continues , will take a mandatory action to close down playgrounds .
A CZ harsh is that sounds , but it can actually save people 's life .
So that 's Mission one mission , too .
And this is gon na be more and more clear as we go on the front line .
Battle is in the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hospitals across the city , across the state and across this nation .
That is where this battle is fought .
It 's that simple .
You know exactly where it 's coming .
You know exactly where the enemy is going to attack .
They 're going toe .
In fact , a large number of people that number of people descend on the health care system .
The health care system ca n't deal with that number of people .
You overwhelm the health care system .
That 's what 's happening .
So first step was flattened .
The curve , reduced density .
Keep people home .
We 've done everything that we can possibly do .
Their second step is do n't let the hospital system get overwhelmed .
The soldiers in this fight are our health care professionals .
It 's the doctors .
It 's the nurses .
It 's the people who are working in the hospital 's .
It 's the AIDS .
They are the soldiers who are fighting this battle for us .
You know the expression .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle , the troops are health care professionals .
Those are the troops who are fighting this battle for us .
We need to recruit more health care workers .
We need to share health care professionals within this state And within this country , As governor of New York , I am asking health care professionals across the country .
If you do n't have a health care crisis in your community , please come help us in New York .
Now we need relief .
We need relief for nurses who are working 12 hour shifts , one after the other after the other .
We need relief for doctors .
We need relief for attendance .
So if you 're not busy .
Come help us , please .
And we will return the favor .
We will return the favor .
New York .
Yes , we have it now .
Intensely , there will be a curve .
New York at one point will be on the other side of the curve , and then there will be an intense issue somewhere else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful .
So help New York , where the ones who were hit now that 's today .
But tomorrow it 's going to be somewhere else .
Whether it 's Detroit , whether it 's New Orleans , it will work its way across the country , and this is the time for us to help one another .
We need supplies desperately , and we 're working on that .
We just had a very good meeting where we discussed supplies .
I want to thank Michael Evans from Alibaba , who 's here with us today .
I 'm gon na thank Elizabeth Jennings from the Asia Society , who 's here with us today who are helping us source supplies because we 're in a situation where you have 50 states all competing for supplies .
The federal government is now also competing for supplies .
Private hospitals are also competing for supplies , so we have created a situation where you literally have hundreds of entities looking toe by the same exact materials , basically from the same place , which is China , ironically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're competing amongst ourselves .
We 're driving the prices up .
When we started buying ventilators , they were under $20,000 .
The ventilators are now over $50,000 if you can find them .
The ventilators did n't change that much in two weeks .
The prices went up because , literally , we are driving the prices up .
But we need to give our front line our health care , perfect professionals , the supplies they need .
And we need to do it now .
Our rule here in New York has been planned forward to get ahead of the problem .
The old expression is Do n't fight the last battle .
This virus has been ahead of us from day one .
We have been playing catch up from day one .
You never win playing catch up , get ahead of the problem .
Do n't fight today 's fight plan for two weeks , three weeks , four weeks from now , when you 're going tohave the apex and make sure that we 're in a position to win the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be at the apex .
That 's where why we 're preparing stockpiles now , where building a stockpile .
The word stockpile by definition means not for immediate use .
It means you 're preparing for a battle to come and you have to have the equipment and you have to have it .
Now I 've done disaster work all across the nation .
I can tell you this if you wait to prepare for the storm to hit , it is too late .
My friends , you have to prepare before the storm hits .
And in this case , the storm is when you hit that high point when you hit that apex , how do you know when you 're going to get there ? You do n't .
There was no crystal ball .
But there is science and there is data .
And there are health professionals who have studied this virus and its progress since China .
We now have months of data .
Listen to the scientists , listen to the mental health , the health care professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing here in New York .
We just had a great meeting where we brought the health care system from across the state of New York together to come up with one coordinated plan , not private hospitals in public hospitals , not New York City hospitals and Long Island hospitals in Westchester , hospitals in upstate hospitals , not big hospitals and small hospitals .
The entire health care system convened , coordinated , working as one for the first time in decades .
No one can ever remember the way we have deployed and coordinated like this .
Why ? Because this is a statewide battle and we want to make sure that we are all coordinated and we 're all working together .
And that 's exactly what we have accomplished at this meeting .
No politics , no partisanship , no division .
There is no time for that .
Not in this state , not in this nation .
This is a deadly serious situation , and frankly , it 's more important than politics .
And it 's more important than partisanship .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus will defeat us .
If there was ever a moment for unity .
This , my friends , is the moment in this situation .
There are no red states , and there are no blue states and there are no red casualties , and there are no blue casualties .
It 's red , white and blue .
This virus does n't discriminate .
It attacks everyone and it attacks everywhere , the president said .
This is a war .
I agree with that .
This is a war .
Then let 's act that way .
And let 's act that way now .
And let 's show a commonality and a mutuality and a unity that this country has n't seen in decades , because The Lord knows we need it Today more than ever before .
Questions , comments Yes , New York is not practice might be going out The back door might not be proper passionate response that directly Yeah , question is that the president suggested that P p e equipment maybe going out the back door .
Uh , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It 's the New York City warehouse .
We 're creating a stockpile for someone to say .
Well , the warehouse has equipment in it .
You should be using that equipment today that defies the basic concept of planning and the basic operation that we have tohave working not just in this state , but of course , the country .
If you are not preparing for the apex and for the high point , you are missing the entire point of the operation .
It is a fundamental blunder .
Two on Lee .
Prepare for today .
That 's why in some ways we are where we are .
We 've been behind this virus from day one .
You have the scientists and the data projections showing you a curve .
The curve goes like this .
You 're over here .
Prepare for the high point of the curve and do it now .
When you gon na do with the night before ? What am I going to tell the hospitals when they call up ? And they say we just had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more equipment and we need more ventilators .
Sorry .
So the whole stockpile concept is to prepare for the future in terms of a suggestion that the P P E equipment is not going to a correct place .
I do n't know what that means .
I do n't know what he 's trying to say .
If he wants to make an accusation , then let him make an accusation .
But I do n't know what he 's trying to say by inference .
The we just had a conversation about exactly that .
In New York City , there are basically two systems .
There 's what 's called the Greater New York Hospital Association .
Ken Rasky represents it .
It 's basically the private voluntary hospitals Mount Sinai , Columbia , etcetera .
Uh , then there 's the Health and Hospitals Corporation , which are the public hospitals .
You have those two systems .
We just discussed that those two systems have to in this situation , undertake a balancing that they probably have never had to do before .
Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to get overrun .
There 's a high load in one hospital .
Before that happens , transfer people toe one of the hospitals that has more vacancies and less load .
Distribute the load among those public hospitals and do it immediately .
Do it on a daily basis .
One hospital is starting to overload , distribute , transfer same thing with the Greater New York Hospital Association .
And then we said , Take it a step further .
Once one system is near capacity , then the two systems will work together to share the load on .
We just discussed that , and we all agreed to do it .
There are no legal .
There are no legal barriers .
If a hospital let 's stay with the public system because the public system , I think , is going to face the greatest stress .
If a public hospital starts to get overloaded , transfer to another hospital with less of a load .
I do n't believe there are any restrictions .
Ken Rasky , who is the expert on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na work is one cohesive family system throughout New York .
And New York is beyond the city itself , including the downstate area , both the island as well as Westchester .
And And I think what we 're going to see is that balancing that the governor is is talking about balance within the system .
Balance went without the system beyond it .
As we go forward with a CZ , we encounter Maur and more stress .
With each day that goes on , the stress points will increase and and as a result , that balancing is absolutely essential .
And because of because of the leadership of the governor , it is clear to everybody that we 're going to be one cohesive family in tackling this right there .
Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , Let me let me weigh .
Just spent a couple of hours doing it , and it 's complicated , but let me give you the top line of her mind .
The right now , basically , the hospital systems operators basically separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater New York hospitals you have Westchester hospitals , you have Long Island hospitals , and then you have upstate hospitals and they have their own trade associations and public a public and then the privates of the privates .
We said we have to work his one system so share staff share resources .
If one hospital is , uh , does n't have enough masks rather than that hospital have to scramble , let the other hospitals help .
Maur Mutual Ken 's word is a good one , a health care family as opposed to these distinct operations .
And we worked that through to add on top of the state system .
You then have now Javits this facility 2500 beds and the comfort the ship that the president sent 1000 beds , these 2500 beds of Javits and the 1000 beds of Covitz at comfort on non co vid beds .
The federal government .
I asked them to make the facilities covert facilities they want to handle non co vid people of Javits and Comfort , which means their function will be basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take covert patients , but they can take non covert patients .
When we talk about a hospital getting near capacity they could then download , if you will to , uh , Javits and the comfort .
Yeah .
Ah , how many years have you known me ? The question is , am I unwilling to tangle with the present ? How many years would you say you know me ? 20 years ? Have you ever known a time in the 20 years that I am unwilling to tank ? I 'm a tangle ? Er , uh , look , I understand what the president said about the first .
I think it was .
I thanked the president because I take his comment as a compliment .
The president commented on a pole that said people were pleased with my leadership on and I thank him for that .
That was a compliment .
As faras the president 's comment about having a political contest with me .
I am not engaging the president in politics .
My only goal is to engage the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uh , and , you know , lead by example .
I 'm not going to get into a political dispute with the president .
I 'm not goingto rise to the bait of a political challenge .
I 'm not running for president .
I was never running for president , I said from day one , I was n't running for president .
I 'm not running for president now .
I 'm not playing politics .
I just want partnership to deal with this on .
I said to the president quite clearly , Look , when you do good things for my state and you 're a good partner , I will be the 1st 1 to say you 're a good partner and I have I went to the ER ship Comfort Today I said , Thank you , Mr President .
We opened up this Javits Center .
I said , Thank you to the Army .
They did a great job here , the Army Corps of Engineers .
You do when you help my state , I 'll say thank you .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal legislation that they passed , I will say that , too .
You know , sometimes it 's simple .
Just tell the truth right on .
That 's where we are telling the truth .
If you 're doing the right thing by New York , I 'll say it .
If he 's doing the wrong thing by New York or the rest of the country , I 'll say it .
But I 'm not going to engage in politics unwilling to tangle , but because I think it 's inappropriate and I think it 's kind of productive .
And I think it 's anti American .
Forget the politics .
Forget the politics .
We have a national crisis .
We are at war .
There is no politics .
There is no red and blue .
It 's red , white and blue .
So let 's get over it and again lead by example .
But we 've we have said that no one can get evicted for non payment of rent .
And that , to me , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above .
Uh , you ca n't pay the rent .
A lot of people ca n't pay the rent .
They 're not working .
There 's no income .
I ca n't pay the rent .
Landlord .
Technically , legally had a right to say .
Okay , you 're evicted .
We said .
I said by executive order , That could be no evictions , period .
If you pay the security deposit , you do n't pay the security deposit .
You pay part of the rent .
None of the rent .
You ca n't be evicted for three month period .
If they want to pay , they can pay .
Yeah , again .
I think our policy answers it .
You can not be evicted for non payment of rent .
It 's not that you do n't .
It 's not that you wo n't owe rent at one time , right ? Because you signed the contract .
Ah , and , uh , even the people to whom you pay the rent have to pay the rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evictions for nonpayment of rent .
And then we 'll see where we are , and we 'll see how long this goes on .
Yes , sir .
Yeah , but we spoke about that today .
Elmhurst Hospital is a New York City public Hospital .
We talked about the Health and Hospital Corporation .
It 's one of the New York City public hospitals .
It is struggling .
That 's clear to everyone .
And we spoke about it directly in this meeting , and I 've asked other hospitals the pitch in and help Elmhurst , and they 've agreed on and to also anticipate other public hospitals that may struggle as the numbers continue to increase and be ready to help them also , you know , we , uh , 100 to 200,000 .
White House estimates 102 100,000 as a death toll .
We do n't have projections in this state as two numbers of deaths where studying models , which , by the way , you 've done by very professional companies .
I do n't come up with these models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that The Bill Gates Foundation has an institute that those projections were studying the projections to see how we best deployed To make sure we 're ready for the next battle .
Make sure we 're ready for the apex .
Uh , is 100,000 is a 200,000 look , Does it then ? Whatever the number is is going to be staggering .
The number is already staggering .
Our human life is a human life .
We 've lost over 1000 New Yorkers to me were beyond staggering .
Already we 've reached staggering on .
The only only point now is do everything you can to save every life possible .
That 's what this is all about .
Yeah , right now .
Ah ha .
A hospital .
This is my opinion .
A hospital is basically an isolated entity , right ? One hospital has its own employees , has its own logo as its own finances does its own purchasing has its staff .
You then have associations of hospitals on .
Then you have the public New York City public hospitals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't work in this environment .
It just does n't work .
No one hospital has the resources to handle this .
No one hospital can do its own procurement .
No one hospital has enough staff .
No one hospital congeal with the capacity .
There has to be a totally different operating paradigm where all those different hospitals operated on as one system .
So when I run out of masks , I can call brother can at the other hospital , say I 'm out of mess .
Can you send me some masks ? When I refill , I 'll send them back .
We have to get to a point where I can say I have too many people walking in the door .
I ca n't handle it .
And we are going to set a load threshold so that when you get near that load threshold , you can send people to other hospitals that have a lower vacancy rate purchased together .
You staff together download patients together , balance the load and do it all .
Of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of this .
Where they have staff capacity , they have bed capacity .
We need you now here in this fight and engaged , and that 's a totally different concept .
But that 's what we did today .
Can you want to come to the question What what we 're going to do is work very cohesively with the state government Department of Health , particularly in putting together a command center that will receive all this information on an instantaneous basis and then begin feeding out that information and instructions as to what to do , for example , just simply in discharging patients to this facility .
This huge facility that that has been built by our colleagues here , this is this will create a way of decanting .
The pressure on our institutions and that information will go to a central place and transfers will be made .
And that is part of this cohesiveness that we 're talking about .
The same thing applies to supplies , ventilators and all the other stuff that goes into making a hospital work .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're now in the process of pulling it off in a complete basis tomorrow .
Yeah , it 's it 's it 's in the works , but it will do central purchasing central stockpile rather than everyone have their own stockpile and then distribute by need .
We 'll take one more all the way in the back .
General , the doctors are exactly right .
Ah , the message is God bless you And thank you .
We all applaud you .
We are in awe of you .
We 're all inspired by you .
We all wonder secretly , would we have the courage to really step up at a time of challenge on They are doing it and they are doing it every day and we are all in their debt and we respect them and we love them for what they 're doing .
And they should have every piece of equipment that they need to do their job .
That is the least that we can do .
And we are all doing everything we can to make that a reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Okay .
