Four more test positive for coronavirus  The number of coronavirus cases in Kenya has risen to 42 after four more cases were confirmed yesterday .
During a briefing on Sunday , Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said of the four , one is a Kenyan , one American , one Cameroonian and one a Burkinab ? .
He said three of the cases were based in Nairobi and one in Mombasa .
The CS said of the 42 cases , 24 are male while 18 are females .
Nairobi leads with 31 cases followed by Kilifi ( six ) , Mombasa ( Three ) and Kwale ( one ) and Kajiado ( one ) .
Kagwe revealed that 1,426 people are being monitored while 215 others were discharged after completing 14-day mandatory quarantine .
To contain the pandemic , he said that mass testing in ongoing on those who arrived in the country from last Sunday .
The CS said that 18 people were waiting for their test results at Mbagathi Hospital .
He said that those who will test positive will be isolated .
The CS warned leaders against perpetuating lies about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , urged all Kenyans to observe high standards of hygiene and physical distancing .
He commended the private sector for assisting government to find facilities that can be used as hospitals , isolation centres .
Meanwhile , it is no longer a matter of if but when the Coast region will emerge as an epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak should authorities fail to enforce strict measures to curb the pandemic .
Already , the government has named Kilifi , Kwale and Mombasa among high risk counties .
" The National Governments Administration Officers ( Ngao ) have been quietly preparing for stricter measures that will include tight control of movements within the coast region , as they try to implement strict adherence to counter the spread of the virus .
This could include partial lockdowns of the region , " the Press was told .
As a pre-emptive measure to the strict controls , Mombasa County government moved to set aside Sh700 million under the Emergency Household Relief and Nutrition Support Project to cushion 227,404 vulnerable households in case the country goes into lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic , enhanced measures may have to be taken by the national government including a total lockdown to enforce enhanced social distancing , " Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho said , adding that this was necessitated by the need to support the population that depends on wages .
In the aftermath of the deadly Al-Shabaab attack on the Dusit 2 hotel complex in Nairobi in January 2019 , urgent discussions began about how to re-enforce Kenya 's counter-terrorism capabilities .
Clearly tough lessons still needed to be learnt in the wake of the Westgate Shopping Centre siege six years earlier .
Al-Shabaab continues to be a potent force in the region .
After a brief lull it appears to be ramping up operations in both Somalia and Kenya .
Despite a reported increase in the number of United States ( US ) air strikes against al-Shabaab operatives , al-Qaeda 's deadly affiliate has been linked to at least 15 attacks in Kenya since the start of 2020 .
Now Washington has announced the creation of the US 's first ever overseas joint terrorism task force , based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Kenya and the US to form the Kenyan Joint Terrorism Task Force ( JTTF-K ) .
The FBI , which along with the US State Department is the key partner in the new joint task force , is no stranger to Kenya .
It offered valuable forensics capacity following the Westgate attack , and FBI personnel are routinely embedded in foreign embassies .
Now the JTTF-K is formalising that engagement by promising to offer Kenya 's counter-terrorism forces ' training , experience and insight ' from US counterparts .
After a brief lull al-Shabaab appears to be ramping up operations in both and Somalia and Kenya  It 's supported by George Kinoti , Kenya 's Director of Criminal Investigations , who at the JTTF-K launch said it would give Kenya the ' upper hand ' at a time when al-Shabaab was entrenching itself and growing more adept at ' adapting to new technologies ' .
As part of the joint task force , more than three dozen Kenyan investigators will receive training at the FBI 's specialist academy in Virginia .
They 'll be drilled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to Kenya , to be supervised by specialist FBI mentors .
However the FBI also has a less savoury legacy in Kenya , its officers having been accused in the past of involvement in a series of extrajudicial renditions of suspected al-Shabaab operatives .
It is perhaps not surprising then that there are questions regarding the creation of a joint terrorism task force , in particular its scope and the limitations of its operations .
The US State Department Bureau of Counterterrorism , which is sponsoring the two-year project , has made it clear that this is an investigative unit - not a military one .
It is aimed at equipping Kenyan counter-terrorism officers with the tools required to detect and bring to justice those responsible for conducting , aiding and abetting terrorism .
Whether the Kenyan justice system has the capacity to bring to trial prominent terrorist suspects may be in question , but the US has made it clear that the task force will be subject to the Kenyan constitution and international law .
That is code for retaining Kenyan sovereignty and being human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as judge , jury and executioner , something the Kenyan anti-terrorism police unit ( ATPU ) have previously been accused of .
