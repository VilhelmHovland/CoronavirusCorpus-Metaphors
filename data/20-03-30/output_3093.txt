Ensuring milk supply in the times of corona  The dairy sector around the world is starting to feel the pinch from the coronavirus .
The world 's top dairy exporters are expecting a significant supply disruption as importing countries -- like China , Germany , Netherland , Italy , France , UAE , Malaysia , Singapore -- continue to see spike in the number of coronavirus cases .
At home however , the threat is of a completely different scale and nature .
Pakistan 's dairy sector is highly unorganized and unregulated where raw and loose milk accounts for over 90 percent of the total milk sold .
Benefitting from falling global milk prices is out of the question as domestic milk prices seldom follow international prices because the processed milk sector accounts for only 5 percent of the market .
Likewise , despite being among the world top milk producers , Pakistan is not a significant dairy exporter .
But lower global exposure does n't mean that the country 's dairy sector will not witness the fallout from the deadly virus .
Dairy comprises around 11 percent of the GDP .
In case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk supply chain may face disruptions , as might the supply of fruits and vegetables to urban area  Dairy farming is highly inefficient due to lack of scale and investment , while the outdated supply chain of milk relies on hundreds of thousands of people distributing milk in most often poor hygiene conditions , requiring far more number of people in distribution than pasteurised or UHT milk might require  By one industry estimate , about 100,000 people deliver milk to millions of households in the country , whereas dairy parlors are also poorly regulated and crowded places as are sabzi mandis and fish markets .
Closing them down risks supply chain disruptions ; yet if one does n't close them down then there is an inherent risk of person to person contract spreading the virus across both ends of the supply chain .
Considering that milk is a perishable item , the downfall of the unregulated market will lead to increase in wastage , which is already high in Pakistan estimated at around 15 percent .
Amid rising Coronavirus cases , the Punjab Food Authority ( PFA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March only .
Unless the government can come up a solution to properly regulate milk and sabzi mandis and ensure social distancing in the wake of corona without disrupting supply chain , facilitating packaged foods and packaged milk industry seems to be the only option to help towards smooth food and dairy supplies .
In the case of milk , one must bear in mind that as springs ends and summer begins milk supply will enter a lean period .
BR Research channel checks suggest that local market players in the regulated milk sector have the technology and the capacity to increase production .
While in the long run it is up to the people ( consumers ) to decide whether they prefer fresh &amp; chilled , pasteurised or UHT milk , the government must treat all segments equally .
That and the fact that this pandemic is a threat to loose milk dairy supply chain , the government should do away with sales tax ( at import stage ) on the critical inputs such as dry milk powder needed for the packaged dairy sector since those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , fairness demands that loose milk sector should also have similar exemptions on account of the fact that milk is used as a key nutrient provider in Pakistan .
Around the world , many milk producing countries are trying to streamline their milk processes and ramp up production of packaged milk particularly UHT milk that has longer shelf life , can be stored , and has little human intervention in the production process to address issues like shortages amid panic buying and inevitable human interaction in the raw milk distribution .
As the matter stands now , dairy supplies are met .
But corona is here to stay .
Best to give incentives to the industry and create a level playing today , to be able to ensure milk supplies when the going really gets tough .
