Although researchers did not test for its ability to disinfect COVID-19 , a device that circulates vaporized hydrogen peroxide and commonly used to disinfect hospital rooms can clear three types of viruses placed on N95-respirators , found the study , now in expedited peer review .
These respirator masks offer state-of-the art protection against infection for health care workers , and are in extremely high demand in pandemic-stricken regions of the country .
But after use , they can harbor viral particles , and can potentially infect health care workers .
The device , made by the international firm Bioquell , is in use in some hospitals for sanitizing rooms where patients with highly infectious diseases have been treated .
In theory , thousands of respirator masks could be cleansed of pathogens daily in dedicated areas of a hospital by using vaporized hydrogen peroxide , the authors say .
The study was conducted at Yale New Haven Hospital by Yale 's Patrick Kenney , assistant professor of urology ; Richard Martinello , associate professor of medicine ( infectious diseases ) and pediatrics ; and Benjamin Chan , research scientist in ecology and evolutionary biology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that posts unpublished research from scientists .
The site cautions that research posted there should not be used to inform clinical-care decisions until published in a peer-reviewed journal .
Kenney said he hopes that expedited approval for publication will come within the next few days .
