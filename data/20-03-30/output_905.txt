In precisely one year -- on Tuesday , March 30 , 2021 -- the almost US$10 billion James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST or " Webb " for short ) will launch on a European Ariane 5 rocket from the Guiana Space Centre to the northwest of Kourou in French Guiana .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb " will study the solar system , directly image exoplanets , photograph the first galaxies , and explore the mysteries of the origins of the Universe .
By detecting infrared light , Webb will be able to look further back in time than any other telescope thus far .
Webb is the most ambitious and complex space science telescope ever constructed , and tantalisingly soon it will be the plaything of scientists .
or , at least , that 's the plan .
Will COVID-19 delay the launch of Webb ?  It 's highly possible .
Originally conceived in the 1990s and at first expected to launch in 2007 , Webb has been beset by delays -- the latest being COVID-19 -- but at the time of writing the massive telescope was safely in its cleanroom at Northrop Grumman in Redondo Beach , California , and March 30 , 2021 , was still the target date for Webb 's launch .
However , there could be an announcement on April 15 , 2020 about a new schedule .
For now , let 's presume we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , and get excited about what we 're going to learn about life , the Universe and everything in 2021 and beyond .
What is Webb ?  A joint venture between NASA , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , the Canadian Space Agency ( CSA ) and Space Telescope Science Institute ( STScI ) , Webb is a massive space telescope with a near-infrared camera and spectrograph for collecting light from the early Universe .
It 's named after James E .

Scientific Visualization Studio , Goddard Media Studios  How does Webb compare to Hubble ?  For starters , Webb can collect a lot more light than Hubble , so it will be able to peer deeper into the Universe -- essentially , further back in time .
Launched on April 24 , 1990 and now in its 30th year , the US$2 .
billion , 11-ton Hubble has a primary mirror with a diameter of 8 feet/2 .
meters .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diameter of 21 feet/6 .
meters .
It 's made up from 18 gold-plated beryllium hexagonal mirror segments and will have vastly improved infrared resolution and sensitivity compared to Hubble .
Where will Webb go ?  There 's also a very different physical side to Webb and Hubble .
While the latter orbits Earth from 550 km , Webb will observe the Universe from the second Lagrange point ( L2 ) around a million miles/1 .
million kilometers from Earth .
It will send its images back to Earth via NASA 's Deep Space Network .

Why do we need Webb ?  " Hubble and Webb are designed to complement each other -- it 's a blending of different wavelengths to give us a better understanding of what 's out there , " said Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock , a space scientist who has worked on the Webb 's instruments , during a recent lecture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to give us a better understanding of how our Universe began .
"  Webb will be able to " see " the cosmos as it was when just a few hundred million years old , capturing images of the first-ever stars and galaxies .
As well as " cosmic dawn " images , expect never-before-seen images of planets , comets , Kuiper Belt objects and -- most excitingly -- exoplanets .
Armed with an instrument that can block the light of a star , Webb will detect exoplanets using its infrared skills , and even study their atmospheres .
What comes after Webb ?  The Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope ( WFIRST ) .
At 8 ft .
meters , its mirror will be the same size as Hubble 's but WFIRST is all about the big picture ; its wide-angle lens on a 288 megapixel camera will give it 100x the field of view of Hubble , essentially enabling it to map the Milky Way and other galaxies in super-quick time .
It 's designed to research three key areas : exoplanets , dark matter/dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Positioned in a very similar place to Webb , WFIRST is scheduled to launch in 2025 .
