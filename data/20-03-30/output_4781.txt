Racing is not immune to that and thus we have had to make some incredibly tough decisions today around our workforce and prizemoney , which fuels participation in our industry .
" These are not decisions that we have taken lightly , however the impacts of the past fortnight and the nation 's rapidly evolving economic crisis means that we must act now to help soften the blow for Victorian racing .
" It has become clear that this pandemic and the associated economic crisis will have a long-term impact on our industry if we do n't seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical for the long-term viability of the industry that we reduce our expenditure to help compensate for the short- to medium-term reduction we will have in our revenues .

"  Kruger said RV was acting in line with its member clubs , many of whom have already stood down or laid off staff and reduced their operations .
