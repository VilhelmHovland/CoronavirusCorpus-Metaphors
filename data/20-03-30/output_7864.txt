FAYETTEVILLE -- Spring sport athletes whose seasons were cut short by coronavirus will receive an extra year of college eligibility , the NCAA 's Division I Council ruled Monday .
The NCAA also relaxed spring roster and scholarship limits for the 2020-21 school year to account for incoming freshmen and returning seniors who would have otherwise exhausted their eligibility this spring .
NCAA rules allow athletes to have four seasons of competition during a five-year period .
Any athlete , regardless of classification , who competed this spring can appeal to restore the lost season , but scholarship and roster limits will apply to all athletes again after the 2021 spring season .
For seniors who choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to honor this year 's scholarship agreement , but can offer a scholarship equal to or less than the amount that was promised this year .
Most spring sports function as equivalency sports , meaning most athletes only receive partial scholarships , as opposed to full rides in sports like football .
Programs that are already feeling a financial pinch will have the ability to utilize an NCAA assistance fund to help pay for scholarships for returning spring seniors next year .
The NCAA last week announced it would distribute $225 million to its 300-plus Division I schools this year , $375 million less than budgeted after the cancellation of its biggest money maker , March Madness .
At Arkansas , spring sports include baseball , softball , men 's and women 's outdoor track and field , men 's and women 's golf , and men 's and women 's tennis .
The extra of eligibility is especially important in college baseball because of the MLB Draft .
Most baseball players are drafted after their junior year when they can leverage the highest signing bonus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as five rounds this year , some players could have been put in a difficult situation without the extra year of eligibility .
Before news broke of a potentially-shortened draft , Arkansas baseball coach Dave Van Horn said he expected junior position players Heston Kjerstad , Casey Martin and Casey Opitz would turn pro this summer .
According to their Baseball America prospect rankings , all three players fall within the picks that make up the first five rounds , with Kjerstad and Martin projected to be selected in the first round .
But where the eligibility and roster size modifications passed Monday will help Arkansas most likely will be with juniors that would have been drafted any other year , but might go undrafted this year .
Notable Razorbacks who could return next year in other sports include golfers William Buhl and Mason Overstreet , All-SEC softball pitcher Autumn Storms and All-America jumper Laquan Nairn .
Coaches eager to begin work on their 2021 rosters have essentially been in a holding pattern for two weeks while awaiting the NCAA vote .
" Really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this coming fall , " Van Horn said March 18 .
" What are the new stipulations ? What 's going to go on with the scholarships ? What 's going to go on with counters and number we can have on the roster ?  " I mean how unfair would it be if you were a freshman and you had seven at-bats or two at-bats .
If you do n't get this year back it does n't make any sense .
It should n't be just for seniors .
It should be for everybody that is on the team .
"  Coaches reached by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette on Monday were either unavailable for comment or wanted to wait to comment until they had a better feel for how the decision would affect their teams .
Van Horn is scheduled to address the NCAA 's decision on a teleconference Tuesday morning .
Arkansas athletics director Hunter Yurachek wrote on Twitter that he appreciated the Division I Council 's decision , with " several important details to be clarified and decided by institutions , coaches and student-athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that this does not avoid substantially difficult circumstances , but what we felt was important was to localize decision-making and to ensure that we were as permissive as possible , " said Penn athletics director Grace Calhoun , who chairs the Division I Council .
A similar decision to restore blanket eligibility was approved for the NCAA 's Division II last week , but the Division I vote was expected to be tight .
The 34-member Division I Council is made up of college sport administrators representing all Division I conferences , plus two members of the student-athlete advisory committee ( SAAC ) .
Prior to Monday afternoon 's vote , SAAC representatives from Power 5 conferences - the SEC , ACC , Big 12 , Big Ten and Pac-12 - released a joint statement that recommended most of the same eligibility and scholarship parameters that passed the Division I Council .
" Eligibility relief should be accessible , " they wrote .
" Roster limits and competition fields should also be expanded to accommodate returning seniors and incoming freshmen .
"  Athletes had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as basketball and gymnastics , because the NCAA postseason was canceled .
The NCAA 's ruling did not apply to winter sports , however , because those sports had concluded all or most of their regular seasons at the time of the shutdown earlier this month .
The NCAA announced it was canceling its postseason championships in all winter and spring sports on March 12 , and college sports in the U .
had essentially ceased as of the following day .
Some conferences , such as the SEC , waited until last week to call off their regular-season competitions .
Sports such as tennis and golf were in the second half of their regular seasons at the time of the shutdown , while baseball and softball were in the first half .
The outdoor track and field season had yet to begin .
