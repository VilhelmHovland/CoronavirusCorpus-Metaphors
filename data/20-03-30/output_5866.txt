Ramon Fernandez says ' kumpare ' pilot in plane crash a true sportsman  THE pilot who perished in the Lion Air plane that caught fire and crashed in the runway of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Sunday night was a true sportsman and friend to some of the country 's top sports personality including basketball legend Ramon Fernandez .

" He 's my kumpare and friend since 1973 .
He was still at Ateneo ( then ) , " disclosed Fernandez , who was then still with the Komatsu Komets ( renamed Toyota Comets later on ) in the defunct MICAA ( Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association ) and the Philippine national team .

Providing similar relief to winter sport athletes , such as basketball and hockey players and wrestlers , will also be considered .
According to a memo recently sent to college sports administrators from the NCAA , there does not appear to be support for that .
" ( W ) inter sports had either concluded their regular season competition or substantially concluded their regular season competition , " said the memo , a portion of which was obtained by The Associated Press .
Division II has already approved legislation to provide an extra season of eligibility and financial aid for its spring sport athletes , according to the memo .

Paying for those extra scholarships is potentially costly for schools .
Bowlsby said with so much unknown regarding the outbreak and when sports will be able to resume , delaying a decision on giving back eligibility might be the best option .

" If we have that sort of disruption again , then are we going to offer fall-sport athletes another year ? "  He added : " I really think as much as everybody wants to know if they 're going to get another year , I think we would be well-served by waiting a period of time to make the decisions .
"  Continue reading below ?  Sun Belt Commissioner Keith Gill said he expected the conference to finalize its position Friday during a conference call with athletic directors and university presidents .
" I think our conference is in a place where we 're certainly going to look to try to provide some relief in that position .
Those students have been through a lot , " Gill said .
" Trying to provide them an opportunity to be as whole as they can with regard to their competition opportunities is something that we are supportive of .
