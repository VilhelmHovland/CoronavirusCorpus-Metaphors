The five most recent Christian Science articles with a spiritual perspective .
Every Monday  Comfort and harmony during self-quarantine  Here 's an article in which a mother shares inspiration that tangibly helped her family during a voluntary self-quarantine some years ago .
March 31 , 2020  By Susan Booth Mack Snipes  Many years ago when I was a single mom with two young daughters , my job as a secretary was our only source of income .
At that time the community we lived in faced a contagious epidemic , and we were encouraged to consider quarantining our children at home for five weeks , even if they showed no symptoms of the disease .
I voluntarily took this step out of support for my family and our community , but I was feeling a deeper need for security than quarantining could provide .
How would I pay our bills ? How would I survive five weeks alone in our house with two active children ? What would happen if they did become ill ?  I turned to God in prayer for answers .
Fresh inspiration came with the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they which love thy law : and nothing shall offend them " ( Psalms 119:165 ) .
I found a definition for " offend " that said " to attack from without .
" And I remembered a definition of God 's law in a book by Mary Baker Eddy , the discoverer of Christian Science .
It says , " God 's law is in three words , ' I am All ; ' and this perfect law is ever present to rebuke any claim of another law " ( " No and Yes , " p .
30 ) .
Putting these ideas together , I reasoned that since God is All , then God is ever present -- therefore , there is no " outside " to God , so nothing to attack from without .
All good comes from God , including supply , health , harmony , security , and peace .
This brought me great comfort , and as I prayed with these ideas I began to see signs of that divine law in operation .
The first came when my boss called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my salary while I took this time off to be with my children .
Also , creative ways to spend happy and productive days with the children came to thought , which enabled the five weeks to pass harmoniously .
But at the very end of the quarantine time , both children caught the disease .
As I cared for them , I again turned to the Bible .
What came to the rescue this time was a story about the prophet Elisha ( see II Kings 6:8-23 ) .
Elisha 's awareness of the ever-presence of God had at first kept his people from being attacked by the Syrian king 's armies through avoidance .
But then , in a place called Dothan , he found himself surrounded by these armies , who had the king 's orders to capture him .
Yet Elisha 's faith in the allness of God never wavered .
He was able to discern that even where an enemy surrounds , God is round about , and the divine power is supreme .
Instead of just escaping the enemy , Elisha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location .
By the time they realized who Elisha was , they were in enemy territory , but Elisha fed them and sent them home in peace .
I suddenly saw that we are divinely equipped to confront fear of the enemy ( in this case the disease ) head on .
Disease is powerless to take away our health , because God is All , and has created us in His image : the spiritual expression of God 's purity and goodness .
And we can prove this spiritual reality in our lives .
I still remember how rapidly both children were healed , recovering much more quickly than was usual for that illness .
As I pray for all in the face of the present pandemic , I am treasuring the ever-presence of God , good , round about us all .
Each of us can look to God and feel the power of the law of God 's allness , which brings release from fear and inspires healing .
