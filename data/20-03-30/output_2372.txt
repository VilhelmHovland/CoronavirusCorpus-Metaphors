The increase in ore inventory reflects the continuous efforts of the Corporation to increase its ore purchases at record levels at year end which will allow to continue the production at a high level during the rainy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level exceeding its nominal capacity of 300 tpd between September 2019 and the recent COVID-19 crisis .
The increase of gold in process ( including activated carbon ) is explained by the December 2019 production which exports were deferred until January 2020 and by the 20% increase in cost per ounce in line with the increase in gold market prices .
The finished goods-Gold dore bars relates to the December shipment retained by the Peruvian custom authorities for control procedures .
We can not predict at this time when this shipment will be released by the authorities and therefore , we have classified then under other non-current assets .
2020 OUTLOOK  COVID-19 crisis  Subsequent to year end , the COVID-19 virus situation became an international crisis .
In Peru , the state of emergency was declared on March 16 , 2020 for an initial period of 15 days , and all public and private companies have been informed to stop their activities .
This period has just been extended until April 13 , 2020 .
Accordingly , the Corporation Peruvian subsidiary has temporarily ceased its operations until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and impacts of this crisis are still unknown , therefore it could have a prospective material impact on the Corporation 's activities , cash flow and liquidities .
Following these events , the Corporation has taken and will continue to take action to minimize the impact .
However , it is impossible to determine the financial implications of these events for the moment .
At the date of this press release the Corporation has a solid financial situation with no debts and approximately $15 M in cash and should be well positioned for the market recovery .
In this historical difficult period for all , worldwide , the Corporation management priority is toward the protection of all of Dynacor 's employees , suppliers and all their families and communities .
We will get through this .
