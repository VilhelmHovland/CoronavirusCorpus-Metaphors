Dump used face masks properly in red bins  Bangkok Governor Aswin Kwanmuang has urged people to dispose of used face masks properly by using red bins which are designated for hazardous waste .
" Used face masks must be put in a plastic bag fastened with a rope or rubber band before putting them in red bins to prevent the spread of Covid-19 , " he said .
" This also includes facial tissue used to wipe noses or bodily fluids .
"  The governor advised separating wastes in different bags in case there are no red bins near your area .
" If possible , put a label or sign on bags containing hazardous waste so that garbage staff can dispose them of properly , " he added .
" Hazardous waste in Bangkok will be separated and disposed of in incinerators at specialised facilities in Nong Khaem and On Nut districts .
Aswin also added that the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has provided red bins for hazardous waste at various locations throughout Bangkok including district offices , public health offices , hospitals , city hall , and public parks .
