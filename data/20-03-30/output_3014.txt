Africans using mobile payments to curb COVID-19  Governments and startups in Africa are implementing tools to shift a greater volume of payment transactions away from cash , which the World Health Organization ( WHO ) flagged as a pipeline for the spread of the coronavirus .
It 's a choice facilitated by the rise in fintech that has occurred in Africa over the last decade .
By several estimates , Africa is home to the largest share of the world 's unbanked population and has a sizable number of underbanked consumers and SMEs .
In Nigeria , Africa 's biggest economy with a population of 200 million people , the growth of COVID-19 cases has moved the country toward electronic payments and prompted one of the country 's largest digital payments startups to act .
Lagos-based venture , Paga made fee adjustments , allowing merchants to accept payments from its customers for free -- a measure " aimed to help slow the spread of the coronavirus by reducing cash handling in Nigeria , " according to a release from the company .
Some parts of Lagos , which are connected to Nigeria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require digital payments in response to COVID-19 , according to Paga 's CEO Tayo Oviosu .
Tayo Oviosu , founder &amp; CEO , Paga  " We 're seeing some stores that are saying they are not accepting cash anymore , " he told TechCrunch on a call .
Paga already offers free P2P transfers on its multi-channel network of 24,840 agents and 14 million customers .
The startup ( that recently expanded to Mexico and partnered with Visa ) will also allow free transfers up to roughly 5000 Naira ( ? $15 ) from customer accounts to bank accounts , to encourage more digital payments use in Nigeria .
What it means : Paga 's CEO believes the current COVID-19 crisis will encourage more digital finance adoption in Nigeria , which has shown a cash-is-king reluctance by parts of the population to use mobile payments .
Time and research will determine if efforts of African governments and tech companies to encourage digital payments over physical currency yield results in halting the spread of COVID-19 on the continent .
Ghana is also using mobile payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-19 .
Lately , the West African country 's central bank directed mobile money providers to waive fees on transactions of $1 , with restrictions on transactions to withdraw cash from mobile-wallets .
Ghana 's monetary body also eased KYC requirements on mobile-money , allowing citizens to use existing mobile phone registrations to open accounts with the major digital payment providers , according to a March 18 Bank of Ghana release .
The trajectory of the coronavirus in Africa is prompting more countries and tech companies to include mobile finance as part of a broader response .
The continent 's COVID-19 cases in the single digits until recently , but those numbers spiked last week leading the World Health Organization to sound an alarm .
