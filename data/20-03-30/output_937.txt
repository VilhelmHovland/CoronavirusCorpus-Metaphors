And sure , Animal Crossing does appear to be breaking sales records right now , as people flock to an island where hard work always pays off and kindness is the rule of the land .
But despite New Horizons ' reputation as a reprieve , one of the most popular trends sees players wearing medical masks , a curious reminder of the borders beyond the Nintendo Switch game .
On social media , medical masks are perhaps the most common piece of attire you 'll see in shared screenshots .
Even at Polygon , several staffers also have characters wearing medical masks .
For some , like Sofia Lillo , it is partially a fashion statement -- indeed , before the coronavirus pandemic , face masks were already popular in Asia and often sported by celebrities like Billie Eilish .
Some luxury brands are even starting to manufacture face masks amid shortages in places like the U .
" I 'm a huuuuuuge fan of Japanese street fashion , " Lillo , who has been wearing a black face mask in-game since release , told Polygon via email .
Clothes are a huge part of Animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the occasion .
There 's even an in-game wand that , with a swish , sparks a magical transformation between different character looks .
But for Lillo , it 's not just about composing a killer outfit .
" It 's a reflection of a life that I 'd love to live right now , " Lillo continued .
" Be able to run around outside ; do things with friends and wear cute clothes while doing it ! "  Image : Nintendo EPD/Nintendo via Polygon  Within the idyllic Animal Crossing grounds , acquiring a face mask is as simple as pressing a button .
The price is meaningless ; simply catching and selling a couple of fish will cover it .
The same can not be said of real life .
" I ca n't find any masks unfortunately , " Kyrie Page , who has been self-isolating through the pandemic , told Polygon over email .
Instead , Page is wearing a digital face mask with nearly in-game every outfit .
" The mask is more of a symbol , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these troubled times .
The fact no villagers comment on it also reminds me of when I lived in Japan , where wearing masks when you were sick was the norm and no one gave you funny looks .
"  Image : Nintendo EPD/Nintendo via Polygon  Animal Crossing 's face mask also acts as an optimistic symbol for players like Greg LeClair , who have jobs where they are in constant contact with other human beings .
" There 's a certain positive feeling invoked by the sight of medical masks , as a person out working in the thick of it , I ca n't really not be thinking about it constantly , " LeClair told Polygon on Twitter .
" So when I see someone wearing one I know they 're at least aware of the role they can play in this mess .
"  Face masks are n't the only way that 2020 has infiltrated Nintendo 's supposed vacation .
Fans also like to set up signs " instructing " villagers to wash their hands , or they share media where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viruses .
Player Cat Law , who asks all island visitors to wash their digital hands for 20 seconds , tells Polygon they 've even taken it upon themselves to distribute face masks to other players .
" That and social distancing seem to have been pretty successful in curbing the spread of COVID-19 , so I kind of wanted to encourage more people to think about masking up , if supply is available in their area , " Law said .
" I ca n't really not be thinking about it constantly .
"  But roleplaying things like quarantine areas in Animal Crossing takes more time and energy than simply wearing a mask , which might explain why the accessory has become so prevalent within the community .
" While I acknowledge it 's a little dissonant to want to keep a medical mask on in a game which I am using as an escape from the stress of the pandemic , for me it 's feeling helpful to project some extra safety and care into my little world , " New Horizons player Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be safe and considerate even if it does n't matter in the virtual world .
"  " There 's also an element of making light of it all , " he added .
Perhaps video games provide a safe outlet to laugh about something that is otherwise terrible .
In this , New Horizons is not unique .
Fallout 76 players , for example , have started hoarding digital toilet paper , sometimes even hiking up the prices to thousands of caps , the in-game currency .
Elsewhere , in medieval mayhem game Mordhau , some fans don yellow protective gear resembling hazmat suits while pretending to test other denizens .
Joking about coronavirus , which has outright become a meme , can give some players a sense of relief and comfort during a period when such feelings are scarce .
Well , most of the time .
Sofia Lillo notes that , in her adventures with friends , the medical masks come up in conversation .
" I 've actually had friends of mine point it out and tell me that it 's giving them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it off when I visit a friend 's island or they visit me , because I do n't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable while they 're actively escaping like me .
