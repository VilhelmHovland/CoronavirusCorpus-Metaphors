GREENWICH -- With local residents warned not to congregate in Greenwich parks during the outbreak of the coronavirus , police officers have been active in enforcing the ban .
Police said they gave out nine warnings over the weekend to people who were found in town parks , in violation of a recent directive from First Selectman Fred Camillo that all parks are to be closed as a public-health measure to combat the spread of coronavirus .
Residents are urged to practice social distancing and limit gatherings to five people or less .
One person was also given a misdemeanor summons for entering Tod 's Point by climbing over a fence , police said Monday .
According to police Lt .
Mark Zuccerela , officers were making sure that the ban was enforced .
" All were advised of parks needing to be cleared .
Some were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lieutenant wrote in an email .
No fines were issued in those cases .
But on Friday evening at Tod 's Point , a caretaker caught a 25-year-old Greenwich man climbing over a fence at the park , according to Zuccerela .
That man was given a summons for criminal trespass .
Camillo issued an order that closed town parks and other recreational facilities , effective March 22 , after thousands of people visited Greenwich Point over that weekend .
" We 're not looking to give tickets and throw people in jail , " Camillo said of the closure order .
" We 're not looking to make people 's lives more frustrating than they are now .
But we 're very , very , very serious about this .
If we close the parks , that means they 're closed .
If we close the beaches , that means they 're closed .
If you 're there and in violation and you 're told to get off , you need to get off .
If you do n't , you 're going to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to this .
"  The closure order includes the town 's golf course , tennis and basketball courts , ball fields , playgrounds , school grounds and town-owned open spaces .
Authorities have been putting up yellow warning tape at parks including Greenwich Commons in central Greenwich to warn the public to keep out .
Towns around the region have been adopting various park restrictions , from outright closures to bans on certain kinds of activities , as the public-health emergency continues .
In Norwalk , all recreational fields , courts and playgrounds are closed .
