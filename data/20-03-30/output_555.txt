We 're still in the thick of a shelter-in-place order , as we do our part to #flattenthecurve .
While some have turned to Netflix during this plentiful indoor time , others have decided to spend those hours in the kitchen .
SFGATE readers were asked to send over photos of the food they 've been making and they really stepped up , sharing incredible photos of tangerines turned into tangerinecello -- inventive ! -- to making samosas that remind them of the version from Pakwan in San Francisco .
Local Jennine Jacob said that now that she 's at home with her family during the shelter-in-place , her cooking has changed from a one-pot style of meal to dishes that take more time and care ; a past shortcut of buying shredded or precut carrots , for example , has now given more purpose to something like taking the time to julienne a carrot .
" I felt like just even doing that very simple act of cutting carrots , you had to be really present , just thinking about something very simple and what was right there -- and I 've found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Cooking just kinda seemed to be my moment , where I 'm here in the moment and not thinking about what 's happening on the outside .
"  Referencing " The Omnivore 's Dilemma " by Michael Pollan , Jacob said now that she cooks more at home , she sees the benefits of it along with the dynamic of the whole family eating together .
" I feel like my son is more likely to try vegetables and try eating healthier foods when we 're at home , " Jacob said .
" Whereas if we go to a restaurant and we 're all ordering our separate things , he 'll kind of gravitate toward just eating carbs .
So it 's a lot better , it 's a lot healthier ; you get to see what 's in your food and get a better understanding for ingredients , and actually once you get into it , cooking is not as difficult as you think .
"  Others , meanwhile , have been using their baking and cooking skills to help comfort others .

She also delivered a helping of her grandmother 's chicken vegetable soup recipe to soothe a neighbor sick with coronavirus ( which Natalie delivered safely via the front porch ) .
" We are helping friends and neighbors by grocery shopping or sharing supplies from our home 's stock for those who are sick or running low on something that 's not available in the supermarkets , " Natalie wrote .
" We are cooking and baking for people who are sick and those who just need to have their spirits lifted , and buying treats at our local bakery , such as hot cross buns , and leaving little gift boxes of these for our neighbors on their front porches .
" My husband and I try to do some act of kindness like this every day for another person or people , " she continued .
" If we each do this for another person every day , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Along with those acts of kindness , she encouraged others to donate to the local food bank to help others in need .
" Those of us who can , need to help them too , " she wrote .
" Giving to our local food banks helps fill a critical need .
"  Whatever your reason for cooking and baking is -- to de-stress , to help others , to keep yourself occupied -- take a look at the slideshow above to get a glimpse at what is helping your neighbors get through this time : one loaf of bread , baked pizza , or cookie at a time .
