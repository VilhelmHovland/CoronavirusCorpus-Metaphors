There were ten , except sadly I think one was dead .
Either that or it was very still .
I could n't see because it was obscured by the grass .
I am not sure whether they are an early or a late clutch .
I hung over the railing at the park and watched the parents and their brood for ages .
That scene in Winnie the Pooh about Pooh hanging over the railings and watching the stream slipping slowly away beneath , came to my mind .
I ca n't remember the exact words , but it was as though I had n't a care in the world .
And it was as though my world like the stream was slowly slipping away and also my cares with it .
Odd given the current situation .
But then everything is odd now .
