US equity futures fell sharply after trading opened at 6 p .
ET , triggering a limit down trading halt .
The decline came after the Senate failed to agree on a stimulus package designed to fight the sudden economic fallout from coronavirus .
The rescue package would amount to roughly $1 .
trillion of aid , according to Politico .
The prospect of a prolonged economic contraction and the impact it will have on corporate profits have sent traders fleeing from stocks .
Investors got an early sign of just how deeply coronavirus will impact the economy when jobless claims spiked to a two-year high last week .
Goldman Sachs has since forecast that the jobless claims figure from this upcoming week , due March 26 , could reach a whopping 2 .
million .
That would mark the largest single-week unemployment-filing surge in history - by a landslide .
