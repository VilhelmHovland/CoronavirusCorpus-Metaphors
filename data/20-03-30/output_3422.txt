An expert has said that there is no need to wash down tins and boxes of food after doing your shop amid the coronavirus outbreak .
Kim Roberts , a lecturer at Trinity College Dublin , said that there is a risk of picking up Covid-19 at the shops but that risk is low .
Speaking to Sean O'Rourke on RTE Radio One , the assistant professor said that the biggest risk is what you are touching inside the shops .
Ms Roberts said : " The biggest risk is in the actual activity of doing your shopping , so if you are travelling on public transport it 's about trying to maintain the two metre social distance from everyone else .
" If you are walking around the corner then obviously the risk is lower .
When you go into the shop , when you touch the doors , freezers trolleys , those are all high touch surfaces that lot 's of people would have touched so there 's a risk there .
