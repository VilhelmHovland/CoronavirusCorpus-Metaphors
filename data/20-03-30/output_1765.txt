REUTERS/Radu Sigheti  WARSAW ( Reuters ) - Poland 's ruling nationalists fast-tracked changes to the electoral code through parliament in the early hours of Saturday in a bid to press ahead with presidential elections in May which have been criticised by opposition parties who want the vote to be postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak .
The changes , which would allow postal voting for senior citizens and those in quarantine or self-isolating , were an unexpected last-minute addition to a bill that was intended to shield the economy from the effects of the health emergency .
Poland is due to hold the first round of its presidential election on May 10 , with incumbent Andrzej Duda , an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice ( PiS ) party , well ahead in the polls .
The constitutional court ruled in 2006 that changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months preceding the elections .
" This move is completely against the constitution and electoral law , " said Andrzej Zoll , a former head of Poland 's constitutional court , told the Onet website .
" It must be emphasised clearly : six months before the election , no changes can be made .
"  PiS lawmaker Marcin Horala rejected the criticism of the changes .
" The ban on changing the rules six months before the elections concerns its essential elements , such as the size of constituencies .
Technical and organizational changes are allowed , " he wrote on Twitter .
ELECTIONS  Victory for Duda is crucial for PiS 's hopes of implementing its agenda after it won a second term in power in 2019 , as the president has the right to veto laws .
PiS lost control of the upper house of parliament , the senate , in 2019 .
While the senate can delay the progress of bills it can not stop them completely .
" In May they ( PiS ) have a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate on a very low turnout , " said Anna Materska-Sosnowska , a political scientist at Warsaw University .
" They know full well that in today 's state of shock and crisis people gravitate towards those in power , " she said .
" However , the effects of their poor management of the crisis will come very quickly and even in autumn their candidate might not win .
"  Lawmakers voted online for the first time to pass the " anti-crisis shield " package , which is worth over 200 billion zlotys ( 39 billion pounds ) , after watching speakers in a largely empty chamber by video-link .
Opposition lawmakers complained of problems logging in to the online voting system .
The measures still have to be debated by the opposition-controlled senate .
Senate speaker Tomasz Grodzki , a vocal critic of the government , said opposition senators disapproved of adding electoral changes to a bill on the economy .
