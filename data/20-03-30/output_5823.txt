Human rights group calls for release of teacher arrested over ' seditious ' Facebook post  Metro Manila ( CNN Philippines , March 29 ) -- A human rights group calls for the release of the teacher detained over an allegedly seditious Facebook post , tagging the arrest a " crackdown on dissent " by the government .
In a statement , Karapatan denounced the government 's " militarist response " to the COVID-19 outbreak , which on Friday resulted in the warrantless arrest of 55-year-old public school teacher Juliet Espinosa and her son .
Espinosa is now facing sedition charges after allegedly publishing a Facebook post urging residents without food to raid the gym in Brgy .
Lagao , where relief goods are reportedly kept .
The post was published under an account with a different name , " Yet Rodriguez Enosencio " .
It contained criticism against the local government 's lack of appropriate response to the health crisis , which the user said is resulting in the starvation of residents .
Espinosa 's son was also arrested for reportedly resisting his mother 's arrest .
He will face charges for violating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedience to a person of authority .
Karapatan called the arrest " overkill , " arguing that the teacher was simply airing her " legitimate grievances " .
It also maintained that the people have the right " to criticize the government 's incompetence and demand services .
"  " The lack or inadequacy of socio-economic measures in the imposition of quarantine measures in the country is driving people to unbearable degrees of mass hunger , " Karapatan Secretary General Cristina Palabay said .
" Yet , true to the Duterte government 's militarist framework , instead of responding to the people 's legitimate demands , the government moved quickly to squash dissent .
"  The group said that Espinosa is not alone in her sentiments , adding that " the poor , street vendors , tricycle and jeepney drivers , the homeless , workers , and farmers are grumbling at this regime 's callousness to the people 's suffering .
"  It also warned against the emergency powers recently given to President Rodrigo Duterte , which it said allows the State to " arbitrarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , which grants the President additional powers to address the COVID-19 outbreak in the country , includes a provision punishing those who create or spread false information about the crisis .
Under the law , violators may face a two-month jail sentence or a fine of ? 10,000 to ? 1 million .
" It has happened in Cebu and in General Santos City -- it wo n't be long before arresting critics for online posts becomes a national policy that could throw us back to the dark days of Marcosian martial rule , " Palabay said .
" However , if the government thinks that arresting the hungry and the poor will squash dissent , it is gravely mistaken .
By continuing its militarist policy that neglects the people 's concerns and meeting them with violence and repression , the regime only exacerbates unrest , " she added .
