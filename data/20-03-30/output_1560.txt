Speaking this morning , health secretary and West Suffolk MP Matt Hancock said he hoped that the testing of medical staff would take place " as soon as possible " so doctors , nurses and other NHS workers who may not have the virus but are self-isolating can get back to work .
All major hospitals have received deliveries of personal protective equipment needed by frontline staff , government officials have confirmed , and a hotline has been set up for NHS workers to ring if there are shortages in their area .
" We have got enough of it .
Of course we are going to need more and we are buying it too .
" But it is about distributing it to the frontline .
" We have done two things over the weekend .
First , we have got a shipment out to all the major hospitals and the second is we now have a helpline so that if you are on the frontline and you ca n't get access to the equipment you need , you can phone in so we know where the shortages are .
