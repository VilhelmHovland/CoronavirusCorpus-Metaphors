NEWDELHI India Ratings and Research ( Ind-Ra ) has revised its FY21 gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth for India down to 3 .
per cent from 5 .
per cent .
The key reasons for this downgrade are the spread of novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) and the resultant nationwide lockdown imposed till April 14 , 2020 , crippling most economic and commercial activities .
The revision is based on the assumption of lockdown continuing till end-April 2020 ( full or partial ) and gradual restoration of economic activities May 2020 onwards .
In view of the lockdown , India Ratings and Research has even revised the FY20 GDP forecast downward to 4 .
per cent ( 9MFY20 : 5 .
cent ) from The National Statistical Office 's advance estimate of 5 .
per cent .
The rating agency expects the GDP growth to come in at 3 .
per cent in 4QFY20 and 2 .
per cent in 1QFY21 .
Average growth is forecast to decelerate to 2 .
per cent in 1HFY21 ( 1HFY20 : 5 .
per cent ) and recover to 4 .
per cent in 2HFY21 ( 2HFY20 : 4 .
per cent ) , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual recovery and restoration of supply chain , it said .
Some of the initial and visible impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the Indian economy has been the disruption in the production of select manufacturing sectors due to the breakdown of supply chain , near collapse of the tourism , hospitality and aviation sectors and a rise in the work load of the healthcare sector .
Also , micro , small and medium enterprises , irrespective of the sector they operate in , have begun to witness cash flow disruptions .
This is not to say that other sectors were not affected or are not likely to be affected .
However , some the services sectors such as financial services , IT and IT-enabled services have greater flexibility in their operations and they quickly readjusted and/or are readjusting their operations by allowing employees to work from home .
Yet , the panic has gripped the Indian capital markets like elsewhere in the world .
A changed outlook of investors has led to a huge outflow of capital and the rupee has come under intense pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would impact the consumption levels .
With the rabi crop maturing , disruption in harvesting and inability of agricultural markets to timely procure them could be a blow to the farmers ' income and rural demand .
Astop on the construction activities will accelerate the problems of the real estate sector , which is still struggling to access funding in the middle of ameltdown in the NBFC and banking sectors .
India Ratings and Research expects the government to announce more measures in the coming days/weeks to mitigate the pains and concerns of the other segments/sectors of the society/economy , since the role of the government is crucial in terms of containing the spread of COVID-19 and simultaneously mitigating the adverse impact of the lockdown on the economy .
