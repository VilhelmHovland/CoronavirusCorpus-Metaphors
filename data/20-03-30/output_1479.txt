I agree with the points made by the various writers .
In fact , the Public Hygiene Council ( PHC ) has been reiterating these very concerns over the past years .
The PHC has also been engaging schools , operators of public eating places and the general public to promote good hygiene habits .
For instance , since 2016 , we have worked with the Ministry of Education to promote the Keep Singapore Clean Movement in schools .
Students not only clean their own classrooms every day but many also take time to help clean their school compounds and areas in the neighbouring community .
We have also initiated conversations with parents of pre-school children on their role in cultivating good hygiene habits in their young children .
Since the outbreak of Covid-19 , the PHC has been playing a major role in SG Clean , the national campaign to rally the public and businesses to raise cleanliness and hygiene standards .
One of our initiatives is to feature owners of coffee shops and commercial buildings who practise very high standards of cleanliness and have stepped up their efforts to counter the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these times that everyone plays his part .
But let us not return to our old ways once the crisis is over .
Let us continue to wash our hands regularly , clear our tables at public eating places , throw our trash into the bins , and keep public toilets dry and clean .
Make these acts of courtesy and consideration the new norm .
We will all be better for it .
