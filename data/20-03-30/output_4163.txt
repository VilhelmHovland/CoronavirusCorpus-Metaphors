Covid-19 : Number of patients being treated in England 's hospitals jumps almost 50%  There has been almost a 50% rise in just a few days in the number of people being treated for coronavirus in England 's hospitals , according to new figures .
Simon Stevens , chief executive of NHS England , said on Friday that more than 6,200 patients were in hospital with Covid-19 .
But today , he said this figure had jumped to more than 9,000 .
It comes as 1,408 people are now confirmed to have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for Covid-19 , as of 5pm on Sunday .
This is up 180 from the 1,228 the day before .
Earlier the head of the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) said around one in four NHS doctors are off work sick or in isolation .
Public Health England ( PHE ) also announced that almost 11,000 coronavirus tests a day can now be carried out .
The Government had set a target of carrying out 10,000 tests a day by Sunday but PHE figures show 9,114 had been carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried out by the same time on Sunday .

The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) will this week release figures on deaths involving Covid-19 in the wider community , such as care homes .
The ONS will look at deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate , including in combination with other health conditions .
These figures are likely to inform a truer picture of how many people have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus , rather than just looking at deaths in hospitals .
( PA Graphics )  Speaking on a visit to the new NHS Nightingale Hospital on the ExCeL site in east London , Sir Simon said that the number of patients will increase , but extra capacity is being made available .
He said : " Today , there are over 9,000 positive coronavirus patients in hospitals across England and we know that number is only going to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a mass mobilisation , taking place right across the country , but also at these new Nightingale hospitals .
" We have got available intensive care and available hospital beds but we are also bringing online additional capacity such as these Nightingale hospitals as we need them .
"  Earlier , Professor Andrew Goddard , president of the RCP , told the PA news agency that about a quarter of the doctor workforce is off , either with coronavirus or because a family member or housemate is ill .
" At the moment , we think it 's more doctors self-isolating with family members , though there are some off sick themselves , " he said .
( PA Graphics )  " This is really impacting a lot in emergency departments and London is in a much worse position than elsewhere at the moment , but it will come to other places .
Birmingham is also struggling .
"  Asked about the pressure on intensive care units , Prof Goddard told PA : " Some hospitals are really at the limit .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , you ca n't underestimate how difficult it is .
"  He said it was unclear whether the 25% off work would be a " rolling number " or whether it could ease as testing of NHS staff increases and people come out of isolation .
" Of course the worry is we will lose more people to Covid-related illness , " he added .
It comes after the Royal College of Nursing ( RCN ) said on Sunday that around one in five nurses had taken time off work to self-isolate .
( PA Graphics )  Meanwhile , Professor Neil Ferguson , from Imperial College London and author of a report which warned of mass deaths if the UK did not introduce strict controls , said there were signs the rate of hospital admissions was slowing .
While the numbers are still going up , the rate of growth is slowing , he suggested .
It comes as Dominic Cummings , the Prime Minister 's chief adviser , became the latest in Westminster to self-isolate after developing symptoms .
He joins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty , who are all in self-isolation due to Covid-19 .
Prof Ferguson said social distancing measures brought in by the Government appeared to be having an effect on the numbers .
" In the UK we can see some early signs of slowing in some indicators -- less so deaths because deaths are lagged by a long time from when measures come in force , " he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme .
" But if we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions , that does appear to be slowing down a bit now .
" It has not yet plateaued , so still the numbers can be increasing each day but the rate of that increase has slowed .
" Dominic Cummings is self-isolating ( Matt Dunham/PA )  Prof Ferguson said the epidemic was spreading at different rates in different parts of the country , but across the UK perhaps 2% or 3% of the population had been infected .
Based on the estimated UK population of 66 million , this would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illness .
