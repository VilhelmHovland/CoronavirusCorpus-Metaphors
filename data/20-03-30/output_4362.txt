Let us not forget ever that we are not travelling through the darkness alone , but that we are on this journey together .
"  " He said : In this crucial week , when we are being asked to take yet more stringent measures to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus , may I to take the opportunity to congratulate you and thank you for your solidarity and vigilance .
" All of our efforts together are making a difference .
I am well aware that it is not easy , what we are asked to do .
" We are being asked to keep our distance -- from loved ones , from relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a daily basis and who give our lives meaning .
" For all of us , this is a difficult ask .
For too many , it is extremely painful not to be able to be there for those who need them , and not to be able to share the grief of our families , neighbours and friends in these difficult times .
" Sabina and I are acutely aware of the pain and hardship so many of you are experiencing , and we would like to send our deepest sympathies to those who have been bereaved in recent days and weeks as a result of the pandemic .
" All of what we continue to do now is about saving lives , slowing the virus , and caring for the most vulnerable .
May I take this opportunity , as President of Ireland , to thank again all those who continue to work to keep our communities healthy and safe .
" So many in our health service , in the Defence Forces and An Garda S ? och ? na , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public utilities , continue , day in and day out , to deliver the products and services we have come to dependent on .
" Everywhere in Ireland , countless people are working tirelessly and selflessly to ensure the best care possible for those affected by the Coronavirus and the safety of all our citizens and I wish to express our shared gratitude to you all for the outstanding contribution you are making .
" At this time , when our everyday lives have changed beyond recognition , and when so much of what we have been accustomed to is no longer possible , we are being tested .
And in these difficult times , our solidarity is vitally important .
" Our solidarity now means that we need to keep our distance physically .
Solidarity now also means supporting those in our communities who need us , or who are vulnerable .
And it means looking beyond our borders , finding ways to support those countries that are struggling to cope and whose health care services are in danger of collapsing .
" So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear fruit in the weeks that will follow .
It is therefore important that we keep the faith , stay patient , and vigilant .
" The days ahead will be difficult , for all of us , but what a memory it will be when the virus has passed , to know that we gave of our best .
Let us not forget ever that we are not travelling through the darkness alone , but that we are on this journey together .
" Let us stay the course , and ensure that we arrive at our destination , together , all of us .
" Beir beannacht .
