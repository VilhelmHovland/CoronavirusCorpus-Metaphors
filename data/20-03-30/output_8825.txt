House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D .
, Calif ) says she believes some bipartisan support exists for a fourth , coronavirus-related stimulus package .
Just as new fronts are opening up in the health battle against the coronavirus , so too is the next front in the policy debate over how to contain the economic carnage .
Specifically , the question is this : Is it already time for Washington to prepare another big economic-stimulus package ?  " Two trillion dollars might seem like a lot of money , and it is , " she said in an interview Monday morning .
" But the challenge is so great .
" As she spoke , Mrs .
Pelosi was planning conference calls later in the day , with other House leaders and then with all Democratic members , to lay plans .
In the Pelosi view , the first two bills passed amid the crisis were simply about dealing with the health emergency -- buying medical supplies , for example -- and the third was designed to mitigate the deep damage done by an economy shutting down .
Now , she says , it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Related Video  President Trump signed an historic $2 trillion bill into law Friday aimed at relieving workers and businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus pandemic .
WSJ breaks down what is in the package .

Ronald Lopez/ZUMA Wire  So she envisions a phase-four bill that would pay for some growing workplace needs : medical leave , more protections for those at risk of infection , government funds to pay for coronavirus tests and help for pension funds at risk because of the economic jolt .
Beyond that , the legislation would have a bigger goal : fund improvements in America 's infrastructure , including its health and digital infrastructure , both badly taxed in the current crisis .
Infrastructure projects produce instant economic activity and jobs , but are in danger of shutting down as state and local governments use whatever money they have to cope with the skyrocketing costs of coping with the coronavirus pandemic .
" We must have more resources -- it 's absolutely essential -- for state and local government , " Mrs .
Pelosi said .
" That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She adds that she talked in recent days with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell : " He said with interest rates so low , think big .
"  Just a few days ago , Mr .
Trump echoed this desire to do more for states .
Still , his aides are trying to tap the brakes on the drive toward a new stimulus bill .
They do n't rule out supporting one eventually , but argue it is wiser to digest the giant economic rescue just passed before deciding on more .
The just-passed package will be in full force within three to four weeks , senior administration officials say .
The machinery for dishing out small-business loans will be in place by Friday , and the money can flow by next week .
Within the two weeks after that , financial-aid checks to average Americans will be moving out , and new unemployment benefits will be available .
If the curve of the virus case load starts heading down in the meantime -- still a big if -- all that may prove sufficient , they argue .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable arguments .
Yet so is the case for an additional stimulus package .
In truth , the $2 trillion bill just passed is more an economic rescue plan than an actual stimulus package .
It is designed to stop the bleeding in households struck by layoffs , tide over small businesses forced to close during the time the country is shutting down and keep money flowing in credit markets and to certain imperiled big companies and businesses .
Yet the experience in China , which is a couple of months ahead of the U .
in the arc of the pandemic , suggests a need will exist for ongoing help as consumers pile up debt .
Likewise , states face a budget crunch , particularly if they have trouble tapping the bond markets for financing , as already appears to be happening .
A stimulus package could help on all those fronts .
More than that , it could finally start to do what Mr .
Trump and Democratic leaders have said for three years they want to do , although without success : Put together a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could today 's problem turn into an opportunity later this year , for both parties .
That scenario includes one particularly intriguing possibility : making a big national push into 5G technology part of any new package .
The current crisis has pushed Americans further online , and there is probably no reversing that trend now .
More distance learning , more working from home and more telemedicine all are on the national agenda now -- and a robust 5G network suddenly looks more important than ever .
" Lesson learned here : We 're going to be doing a lot more online , " says former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel , who helped guide the Obama administration 's stimulus plan through Congress as White House chief of staff in 2009 .
