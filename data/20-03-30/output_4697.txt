During the Great Depression , unemployed workers were offered three kinds of official support in Australia .
From 1930 , assistance known as " sustenance " , " food relief " , " the dole " or " rations " , was provided for some destitute households , and was barely enough to survive .
Towards the end of 1933 , most states began rolling out " work-for-sustenance " programs where workers were paid far below basic wage rates for participating in special " make-work " projects , like laying sewerage pipes and building roads .
And miscellaneous assistance was provided by state governments through the decade , like free retraining for young teenagers .
In 1936 , when the scourge of poverty had become so entrenched that an " abolish poverty " campaign had begun , the level of assistance provided for an unemployed man to support just one child was openly mocked .
" Many people spend more than that on a dog , " one woman complained during a poverty abolition meeting in Cairns .
" Teachers will tell you that in the city schools the ' dole ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type .
Thin , listless and rickety , they quickly fall behind in games and study .
"  The official assistance was too paltry to prevent shanty towns and unemployment camps mushrooming around the country , such as the famous " Happy Valley " in Sydney 's south , where hundreds of shacks and tents were erected in the sand dunes of La Perouse in Botany Bay .
Fifty years later , in 1983 , a Reserve Bank research discussion paper noted how Australia 's welfare architecture had been woefully unsuitable during the Great Depression , and lessons had been learned from the experience .
" The rapid rise in unemployment in the early 1930s overwhelmed traditional methods of relieving unemployment , " the paper said .
" Today , unemployment benefits are paid in cash rather than partly-in-kind and various forms of miscellaneous assistance have been expanded considerably .
"  How does that translate to today ?  At this point in the coronavirus media cycle , the Morrison Government is still planning to rely on Centrelink to provide the survival net for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are losing their jobs as parts of the economy are shut down to prevent the coronavirus spreading .
Government ministers could n't believe what they were seeing as the MyGov website crashed and unemployment queues formed literally overnight .
Stuart Robert , the Government Services Minister , said he failed to appreciate the scale of demand that would be placed on Centrelink by the decision to force hundreds of thousands of businesses to close this week .
" My bad , " he said .
But the flow-on effects from the decision to rely on Centrelink to provide the sustenance program for Australia 's workers have compounded quickly .
By Friday , with the economy still haemorrhaging jobs , the Government said it was considering a suite of radical measures to put affected businesses into " hibernation " somehow , so employers could see through the next six months and then re-open their businesses without much damage or debt and carry on trading .
Your questions on coronavirus answered :  Under its emergency unemployment scheme , the maximum Centrelink payments for a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 76 per cent of the minimum wage for a full-time worker .
And when recipients wake from six months on that less-than-minimum wage they wo n't have a job to return to .
So , who will provide the custom to the businesses that survive hibernation and try to reopen and keep trading later in the year ?  Overseas examples may hold the key  The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Labor and the unions , the Greens and a range of economists have been asking the Government to consider a " wage subsidy " scheme to keep workers employed .
Similar schemes are being adopted in the UK , Denmark , Ireland , and South Korea , among other countries , where Governments are subsidising employers ' payrolls to help them retain their staff through the crisis on reduced incomes .
The Morrison Government rejected that idea this week , saying the best way to help Australia 's unemployed was through the existing payment channels and tax system arrangements , which included Centrelink .
But according to a report in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed tack on that , and could soon announce a wage subsidy scheme .
A former Treasury official , Steven Hamilton , says a wage/payroll subsidy scheme would make far more economic sense for Australia than using Centrelink as the major support for workers .
The loan must be used for payroll , or rents and leases associated with the business , and the business will be bound to keep the same number of full-time equivalent hours on its books for the next three months .
If it does that , the loan will be waived .
" If you think about it there 's this weird , temporary two-to-three month period where everything 's going to stop .
" If you just topped up the revenue of every business that 's suffering revenue losses because of the coronavirus , and they keep paying their workers and their landlords and everything else that they would normally do , it will just be like everyone 's on holiday .
" Businesses wo n't lay anyone off or cut any hours , and there wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that .
" Pumping cash into the economy is actually not what you need to do now .
And I think people have finally come around to that .
