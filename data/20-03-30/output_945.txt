: Jon Shapley , Staff photographer  When Jose closed the door to his two-bedroom apartment , he saw the same notice from management taped to every door of the complex .
The first line : " Despite what you may have heard in the media , rent is still due and evictions will be filed .
"  The memo was dated March 23 , four days after Texas had declared a halt to evictions statewide and well into the Houston area 's novel coronavirus surge .
Jose , who asked that his last name be withheld because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only able to pay his share of April 's $1,017 rent because he 'd stopped making car payments .
Jose has no idea how he 'll pay rent next month .
" If this is not over soon , definitely I will become homeless , " he said .
He 's lived in his unit at the Ashford Westchase Apartments for four months .
As the first of the month looms , tenants who found themselves suddenly unemployed as the novel coronavirus devastates the economy are left unable to pay rent .
Landlords worry that without the expected rent revenue , they wo n't be able to pay their own bills .
Some states -- including Texas -- have temporarily stopped evictions from going forward in court .
In Maryland , no landlord can evict a tenant who can prove that their nonpayment of rent is directly related to the coronavirus .
The city of Austin gave tenants an additional 60 days to pay rent .
But there is no such measure in Harris County .
And the Texas order has no allowance for coronavirus-imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to file eviction cases , but they wo n't be heard in court the order lifts on April 19 .
The notice on Jose 's door at the Ashford Westchase Apartments was n't meant to be a threat , said property manager Emerich Esqueda .
It 's just explaining the fine print .
" We 've never experienced this , " he said .
" There 's no script for anybody .
"  While Jose worries where he will live as the pandemic rages , Esqueda worries what happens to him without the rent to pay his salary .
" Long story short , we expect to see a lot of evictions , " Esqueda said .
" I think they may take advantage of the situation .
"  ' you MUST PAY YOUR RENT '  Jack Yetiv is so proud of the notice he sent to tenants in his three multifamily complexes that he thinks it should be made free to anyone who wants to use it .
Yetiv , a retired **36;4617;TOOLONG , sent a 12-point notice to each tenant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hidalgo issued a stay-at-home order .
you MUST PAY YOUR RENT and other charges as you always have , " the memo began .
" NOTHING in Judge Hidalgo 's order says anyone gets free rent -- just like you do not expect to go to Kroger and get free food .
"  Notices like Yetiv 's have gone out all around the country as landlords anticipated rent payment issues .
They 've also heard the mixed communications from state and local governments and misleading statements at the federal level ( President Donald Trump erroneously said he ordered the Department of Housing and Urban Development to suspend all evictions ; the order only applied to certain mortgages ) .
Yetiv asked tenants who think they 'll have difficulty to reach out ( point 10 ) .
He can give them maintenance to do around the property or sign what he calls a " voluntary lien " : He holds onto something of value ( a T .
, a wedding ring ) until rent is paid .
Point 9 encourages prepayment .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they prepay , that money is safe , " he said .
" It wo n't go away .
It does n't go to an alcohol habit .
"  At Villa de Cancun Apartments , management sent a notice notice shorter than Yetiv 's to remind tenants that rent is due on the 3rd of the month , with late fees to follow .
An office staffer deferred comment to a manager ; no one responded to messages left in the following days .
Rick Guttman , who sent out a notice to his nine properties warning tenants that a nonpayment of rent would trigger an eviction filing and a credit agency notification , said he does n't want to speculate what would happen if he did n't get enough rent checks .
" We have all of our expenses that are not stopping , " he said .
" I do n't have anything in writing providing leniency for us .
"  Melissa Gallegos , 35 , feels like she ca n't do anything but give leniency .
She 's known her tenants for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house she grew up in since 2015 , when her father died .
The rent is supposed to be $1,260 per month for the four-bedroom .
They have been behind since Hurricane Harvey .
" All our savings , they already gone , " said Xochitl Valadez , who rents Gallegos 's home .
" We just started running behind , behind , behind -- everything .
With this situation , everything , we 're running more behind than we used to be .
"  Gallegos 's husband is out of work because of coronavirus .
She worries about paying her own bills .
" I have had a lot of people tell me you need to kick them out , " Gallegos said .
" But I ca n't do that to them .
Especially with the kids .
"  ' You ca n't be homeless with children '  Before the coronavirus crisis , Jose had worked as a full-time Uber driver .
This is his third week without work , because people have been afraid to use rideshares .
He has a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever .
" It made me sad because these people are thinking only in money , " said Jose , who is from El Salvador and has lived in Houston for 20 years .
" They are not taking in consideration that we are having hard days .
"  The sudden crisis is devastating for renters who were already living paycheck-to-paycheck .
Gina Baptiste , 40 , is a single mother of two daughters , 18 and 11 , living in Fort Worth .
She had a history of late payments on her two-bedroom apartment but had n't been evicted .
( Amy Cox , the property 's portfolio manager , wrote in an email that the company tried " helping our residents through tough times .
" )  She can only pay $850 -- half her rent .
She was let go in mid-March .
Her apartment complex requires documentation for a payment plan .
Her old boss , she said , wo n't provide it : She said she was paid off the books .
" Clearly , this is well outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote Cox .
" We are open to accepting a payment plan if she provides adequate documentation .
"  Cox added : " We have heard many reporters , advocates , etc .
try to make the apartment industry look like bad people .
That 's not a new theme by any stretch , but the dull roar continues to get louder .
"  Cox and the management team gave Baptiste another option : Leave by March 31 , and they would not file for eviction .
She does not know where she would go .
" I know these are crazy times , but there are many companies .
that are hiring on the spot right now , " Cox wrote in a March 29 email to Baptiste .
" If you are not working right now or about to start , then it seems like that is a personal choice to not work .
If that is an incorrect assumption , then please let me know .
"  Baptiste read the email and cried .
She 's been applying , she said .
She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wishes there were some aid coming to renters .
She does n't feel like the government has done enough .
Usually her apartment is happy : Her girls drag her into TikTok dances ( she 's terrible ) and both of them come relax with her in bed .
The fridge is covered with family pictures , take-out menus and academic awards .
