LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain will spend 75 million pounds ( $93 million ) to get stranded citizens home on charter flights , foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Monday , adding that airlines would be flexible in offering commercial routes where possible .
Countries have closed airspace and restricted travel to contain the spread of coronavirus , and easyJet earlier on Monday grounded its entire fleet .
Tens of thousands of stranded British travellers will be flown home under the new arrangement , which sees airlines including British Airways , easyJet , Virgin , Jet2 and Titan offering alternative bookings where routes are canceled .
" Where commercial flights are no longer running , the government will provide the necessary financial support for special charter flights to bring UK nationals back home , " Raab said at a news conference .
" We 've designated 75 million pounds to support those flights and the airlines in order to keep the cost down and affordable for those seeking to return to the UK .
"  In a letter to the airlines , Raab and transport minister Grant Shapps said the repatriation efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended for symptomatic passengers , who should self-isolate .
The chartered flights will operate on a strict cost-recovery basis paid by the taxpayer , ticketed through a government-procured management company , at fares determined by the foreign office ( FCO ) .
" Those genuinely unable to pay will be offered an emergency loan by the FCO if they have exhausted all other avenues , " the letter said .
Talks between the government and airlines over a broader support package for the sector have so far not yielded a result .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that talks over a support mechanism were continuing , playing down a suggestion by finance minister Rishi Sunak that airlines should look to raise their own cash first .
" We acknowledge that this is a challenging time for airlines both operationally and financially , " Monday 's letter said , without addressing the issue of support for the sector .
The British Airline Pilots Association ( BALPA ) called for clarity over the support that airlines would be getting and also sought reassurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cost involved in bringing hundreds of thousands of people home will be incredible , " BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said .
" Our airlines are already struggling to cope financially and the government 's promised financial support is yet to materialize , " he added .
