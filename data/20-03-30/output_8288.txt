What changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- The two doctors spread out their charts on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office .
The projections were grim : Even if the U .
were to continue to do what it was doing , keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes , the coronavirus could leave 100,000 to 200,000 people dead and millions infected .
And the totals would be far worse if the nation reopened .
Those stark predictions grew even more tangible and harrowing when paired with televised images of body bags lined up at a New York City hospital not far from where Trump grew up in Queens .
The confluence of dire warnings and tragic images served to move the president off his hopes for an Easter rebirth for the nation 's economy .
But while Trump sided with the White House doctors over its economists , at least for now , the decision shed light on a West Wing beset with divisions and a commander-in-chief torn between an instinct to embrace the image of a wartime president fighting an invisible enemy and one protecting the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight .
The abrupt change in Trump 's tone was startling : Easter was no longer going to be the sunrise after blackest night .
Instead , it could be the darkest moment before dawn .
" We 're thinking that around Easter that 's going to be your spike .
That 's going to be the highest point we think , and then it 's going to start coming down from there , " Trump said Monday on Fox &amp; Friends .
" The worst that can happen is you do it too early and all of a sudden it comes back .
That makes it more difficult .
"  The bleak forecasts were carried into the Oval Office by Dr .
Anthony Fauci and Dr .
Deborah Birx , who displayed to Trump projections that , on the low end , could yield 100,000 American deaths from COVID-19 .
One model showed that deaths could have soared past 2 million had there been no mitigation measures .
" We showed him the data .
He looked at the data .
He got it right away .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CNN on Monday .
" Dr .
Debbie Birx and I went into the Oval Office and leaned over the desk and said , ' Here are the data , take a look .
' He just shook his head and said , ' I guess we got to do it .
' "  But as is often the case with Trump , it also took the power of images to prompt him to act .
Over the weekend , the death count in New York City skyrocketed , the silence of the city 's empty streets shattered only by ambulance sirens .
Makeshift medical tents were hastily erected in Central Park .
And hospitals , including Elmhurst Medical Center in Queens , not far from Trump 's childhood home , were so overwhelmed that patients were lying in hallways and corpses stowed in refrigerated trucks .
" This is essentially in my community , in Queens , Queens , New York , " Trump said .
" I 've seen things that I 've never seen before .
"  Aides likened Trump 's emotional response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prompted him to give the order for the first air strike of his presidency .
And the moment also revealed the sharp divides among those advising Trump , both inside and outside of the West Wing .
For weeks , those in the White House who warned that the doctors ' strict recommendations would cripple the economy -- and Trump 's reelection chances -- had the president 's ear and pushed him toward the idea of restarting business in the states where infections were low .
Trump 's decision to extend national guidelines to clamp down on activity left them disappointed .
Stephen Moore , a former Trump adviser who had been pushing the administration publicly and privately to roll back restrictions in places with low infection rates , said the economic impact would grow worse every day that the shutdown continues , with more bankruptcies and more jobs lost .
He had urged Trump to begin to re-open in places like Idaho , Iowa and Nebraska , far from the infection hot spots .
But Trump was swayed by arguments that the fiscal pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to be shut again .
As in the early , chaotic days of his administration , Trump 's White House has become increasingly siloed in recent weeks , with different working groups functioning separately and sometimes in competition .
Members of Trump 's coronavirus task force , led by Vice President Mike Pence and including Fauci and Birx , did not know that Trump would be floating the idea of a quarantine of the New York area over the weekend -- and then quickly moved to walk him back , according to three administration officials not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations .
The president is getting conflicting advice from outside the White House as well .
While some Republican governors , like Henry McMaster of South Carolina , have urged the president to reopen the economy , Gov .
Ron DeSantis of Florida considered banning travelers from hot spots like New York from entering his state , which experts believe is poised to see a surge in coronavirus cases .
After speaking with DeSantis , Trump mused to reporters Saturday about a quarantine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Connecticut , blindsiding the local governors and raising questions about federal authority .
Even if the measure was unenforceable , Trump thought it could be a signal to supporters elsewhere that he was walling off a virus hot zone comprised of three Democratic states .
But Fauci and other advisers persuaded him that it would accomplish little except ignite worry .
Like forecasts for a monster hurricane , the pandemic projection models can disagree with one another .
But the coronavirus models all agree that this outbreak and its consequences are extremely serious .
Birx singled out one by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle , suggesting it 's close to how government experts see things .
That model forecasts predicts more than 82,000 total U .
deaths through early August , with the highest number of daily deaths -- an estimated 2,271 -- occurring April 15 .
