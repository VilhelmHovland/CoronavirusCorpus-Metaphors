Researchers at the University of Oxford are looking for over 500 healthy volunteers to test if their vaccine , called ' ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ' , can prevent the novel coronavirus .
The team at Oxford will enroll healthy volunteers aged between 18 -- 55 , who , if pass screening , will be the first humans to test the new vaccine , the university said in a statement on Friday .
The trial , a collaboration between the university 's Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group clinical teams , will recruit up to 510 volunteers , who will receive either the ' ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 ' vaccine or a control injection for comparison .
The trial will provide valuable information on the safety aspects of the vaccine , as well as its ability to generate an immune response against the virus .
The trial has been approved by UK regulators and ethical reviewers .
Researchers are working as quickly as possible to get the vaccine ready to be used in the trial , which includes further preclinical investigations and production of a larger number of doses of the vaccine .
Interested individuals can volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oxford said .
While the team will start screening people now to see if they are eligible to take part in the study , participants will not receive the vaccine for some weeks .
Detailed preclinical work is being done and the vaccine is being manufactured to clinical grade standard at the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility at Oxford University .
" The Oxford team had exceptional experience of a rapid vaccine response , such as to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 .
This is an even greater challenge .
Vaccines are being designed from scratch and progressed at an unprecedented rate , " said Professor Adrian Hill , Director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford .
" The upcoming trial will be critical for assessing the feasibility of vaccination against COVID-19 and could lead to early deployment , " Hill said .
Scientists around the world are working hard to develop a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 , but there is a lot to be done .
The Oxford team led by Professor Sarah Gilbert , Professor Andrew Pollard , Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started work designing a vaccine on January 10 , 2020 .
The vaccine is an adenovirus vaccine vector ( ChAdOx1 ) and was developed at Oxford 's Jenner Institute .
It was chosen as the most suitable vaccine technology for a SARS-CoV-2 ( COVID-19 ) vaccine as it can generate a strong immune response from one dose and it is not a replicating virus , so it can not cause an ongoing infection in the vaccinated individual , the university said , adding that this also makes it safer to give to children , the elderly and anyone with a pre-existing condition such as diabetes .
Adenoviral vectors are a very well-studied vaccine type , having been used safely in thousands of participants , from 1 week to 90 years of age , in vaccines targeting over 10 different diseases .
