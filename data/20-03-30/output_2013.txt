It was a grim prediction from a man who probably knows more about the coronavirus than just about anyone else -- we should expect between 100,000 and 200,000 deaths in the United States from the coronavirus .
Anthony Fauci made his prediction on CNN , saying , " millions " of people in this country will contract the disease .
millions .
Fauci says he 's not into worst-case scenarios .
a model in which the number of deaths would soar to unspeakable levels .
Fauci says the actual number almost always ends somewhere in the middle -- between worst-and-best scenarios .
More than 2,000 people have died in the U .
from the virus .
The number doubled in the last 24 hours .
New York is a few weeks away from the apex , and it 's spread all over the country .
The figures are in stark contrast to the President pressing to reopen the country by Easter .
Same guy says people who recover will be immune ? Given the 2% fatality rate , and in his own words , no re-infection , seems highly unlikely to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those infected .
There have being reported case re infection in China Wuhan .
It pause those Chinese doctors too .
They suspected the virus remain dormant until being triggered again .
Nobody know for sure now since this virus have few mutations recorded worldwide .

1 million had already been infected in Italy100k in Indonesia5,000 cases in japan  Indon does n't even have the testing capacity , that 's why its figure always very low .
The 1% death rate is including those with medical conditions such as diabetes , high blood pressure or other underlying diseases .
No offense but these people could also die from contracting normal pneumonia .
Healthy people who have access to adequate medical help can mostly recover from covid .
Therefore I think 1% is overrated .
Anyone with medical background care to comment ?  American 's ( or rather the President ) did not take this virus seriously .
They had 3 months to prepare .
and did very little .
Now scrambling to get ready and prepared .
lots of people dying unneccessarily from the virus now .

So basically nobody knows , but you still choose to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plouffle0789 @ Mar 30 2020 , 12:53 AM )  why ? ? ?  Already explained earlier , if China death numbers not even reaching 5k deaths , you guys want to jump the gun saying US will see 200k death .
Even back in 2009 when they have H1N1 , a deadlier virus , they saw 12 .
deaths amongst 60 million infected .
Why would you believe Covid , a less severe virus , will cause 100-200k deaths ?  QUOTE ( changejob @ Mar 30 2020 , 01:51 AM )  Lol .
Look at thier efforts .
I wo n't be surprised if US death is China + Italy + Spain combined .
Then you will very surprised that it wo n't even reach anywhere near China 's .

So basically nobody knows , but you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  I do n't really care the figure corrects or not , I just want the preventive action and results show the way .
far , China showings the way to combat this .
western countries can show better ways later , we do n't know .
not at high cost of their citizens life 's .
If China did n't " overreact " with their " draconian " measures .
The number of cases will be colossal .
It would not be merely just a tiny blip for a population of more than 1 billion .
It 's a tiny blip compared to the population is because they nip it in the bud early on .
Trump already order travel ban end of January , even before msia considered any sort of restriction , kena called racist some more .
You guys really need to rethink where you 're getting your news .
How does that work ? Tell me .
You ban one country and one set of people but the virus by late January had spread to half a dozen countries whose citizens were NOT banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle to start .
they get whacked on the East Coast as people infected from Europe ( and asia ) are flying in from that side into the US .
Their infection keep climbing .
And they are still undertesting .
Only NY is doing significant test .
You still think they wo n't be more death than China ?  bkMwvmJLnc0  You moron , you do n't even know what you 're digesting is fake news , chopped up editing made to make Trump look bad .
You just consume a politicized video clip that weaponized covid for political mileage , without actually looking through the facts .
What an idiot .
Snopes , an leftist fact checker , would n't even stick to that nonsense .

Snopes , an leftist fact checker , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of April and see .
Do n't forget in America they are already testing cures , WITHOUT LOCKDOWN .
What have your magnificent new govt done ?  Haha , ok we wait .
Wait for more people to get infected and die .
QUOTE  Democrats ' criticism of his administration 's response to the new coronavirus outbreak to their efforts to impeach him , saying " this is their new hoax .
" During the speech he also seemed to downplay the severity of the outbreak , comparing it to the common flu .
Oh so democrat new hoax is he is handling the outbreak badly .
Does n't seems like a hoax to me ? .
