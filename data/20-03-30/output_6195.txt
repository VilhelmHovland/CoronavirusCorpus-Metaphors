Football will eventually return following the coronavirus pandemic , but it could look a little different .
UpdatedUpdated 1 day ago  Share  The sport 's leading competitions have been suspended amid the global crisis , and FIFA president Gianni Infantino this week suggested the pause represented an opportunity to " reform football " .
" Perhaps we can reform football by taking a step backwards , " Infantino told Gazzetta dello Sport .
" There would be fewer but more interesting competitions , maybe fewer teams but for a better balance , fewer but more competitive matches to preserve players ' health .
"  But what could post-coronavirus football look like ? What must remain ? What should disappear ?  NO MORE GROUP STAGES  Those seemingly most frustrated by football 's packed schedule are the coaches of leading European clubs .
Therefore , there is a simple way to lose four games a season .
The most exciting Champions League and Europa League matches - with greater scope for shocks - tend to occur in the knockout stages anyway , so why not play two tense legs instead of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ format used in the European Cup and UEFA Cup might mean renaming the continental ' Leagues ' , but it is a price worth paying .
Just keep the Champions League anthem !  DITCH FA CUP REPLAYS  Even before the coronavirus pandemic caused a host of postponements and cancellations , fixture schedules were a particularly significant issue in England .
The FA Cup initially got rid of replays from the quarter-finals onwards and has since extended that to the fifth round .
But now they should go all the way .
This would impact the one or two lower-league clubs each year who earn a dream replay against a top team in round three or four , but the competition has lost some of its lustre with big teams often resting their star names in the early rounds anyway .
Often the additional fixture is an inconvenience , while a one-off tie increases the drama and actually boosts the chance of a lower-tier club achieving an upset .
GET RID OF THE EFL CUP  Another sure-fire way to ease pressure on the calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French football is ending the Coupe de la Ligue after this season , meaning English football will be the only one of the top-five European nations to have a second domestic cup competition .
With early rounds dominated by second-string XIs and fringe players , and the ' bigger ' clubs largely utilising the cup as a means to give minutes to expensive benches , there is little clamour for the continuation of the EFL Cup .
AXE THE NATIONS LEAGUE  If we 're looking to cut back , how about axing the newest competition , the one that has no history and remains a mystery to your Average Joe ?  The thought process behind UEFA 's Nations League -- to have more relevant fixtures and allow countries to play those they are more closely aligned within the rankings -- is commendable , yet it was undermined by the eventual absence of relegation from the inaugural edition .
The format and its relationship with qualifying for the Euros continues to be something of a Rubik 's Cube unless you 're a rocket scientist .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  CUT THE CLUB WORLD CUP  Infantino 's calls to trim a bloated calendar are sensible , but actions speak louder than words .
Perhaps proof of his desire for " reform " would come with an early end to an expanded Club World Cup .
Although the new 24-team format would see the finals held every four years in lieu of the Confederations Cup , it still seems an unnecessary hindrance .
The competition has been won by the Champions League holders on all but four occasions since its 2000 inception and provides little in the way of entertainment .
Given the first new-look Club World Cup was due to take place in 2021 and now the Euros , Copa America and Olympics have each been pushed back to next year , Infantino has the opportunity to disregard this particular folly once .
