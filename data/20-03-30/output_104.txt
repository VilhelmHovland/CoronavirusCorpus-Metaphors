Feel-good flowers  An Aldi checkout worker shared this message on Facebook about a bad day turned good thanks to a kind customer :  " Ok , so I work at Aldi .
As you can imagine things have been getting pretty hectic at work .
Last week , alongside some pretty intense personal stuff , I had a break down at work .
Three shifts in a row I showed up , and by the time the store opened , I was already in tears .
I served my first abusive customer of the day and I broke .
I spent the rest of the shift in various states of emotional turmoil , all on the register , on show for the shop to see .
I even put my two weeks notice in mid-shift !  Towards the end of my day , I looked down to start scanning my first item , and there was a hand holding a small , white hand-picked flower .
I looked up and a very very kind man stood before me .
He said as he handed it to me , ' I really hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture ( it made me cry again in a nice way ) , did more to me than I could ever say .
I will take that moment with me for the rest of my life .
Something simple can be the best kindness .

A kind cuppa  A hot drink was all it took to make this Coles staffer feel valued , as they shared on Facebook :  " I work at Coles ( not much more needs to be said about why that is a messy situation at the moment ) and I was gutted in the morning because I 'd spent the last of my money on a delicious and giant coffee to help get me through my Monday morning and stupid me left it at home .
I was explaining to a customer ( who I 'd never served before ) that I was ' offended ' how everyone in the past 36 minutes had bought coffee and that the world was rubbing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed how much that sucked and left with ' I hope your day gets better ! '  Ten minutes later I hear ' excuse me ' and that bloody legend has his arm extended with a coffee for me .
Day absolutely made !  I took on the rest of the day with a huge smile on my face even with all the grumpy customers that I was yet to serve .
It 's the little things ! "  Woolies staffers were treated to a pizza party by Domino 's .
