As the coronavirus outbreak upends life in the state , there 's one thing many Minnesotans still continue to do no matter the risk -- take care of one another .
Whether it 's lending neighbors extra rolls of toilet paper , offering free babysitting or making bagged lunches for those in need , Minnesotans have a reputation for putting others ' needs first .
In fact , the state has consistently ranked at the top in the nation for its volunteerism .
Minnesota came in second only to Utah in 2018 , and the Twin Cities were ranked No .
1 among metro cities nationwide for its volunteer rates , according to the Corporation for National and Community Service ( CNCS ) .
As a frequent volunteer herself , Sharon Carlson , of Andover , Minn .
, said she has seen the benefits of volunteering but never quite understood why Minnesota was so good at it .
" Volunteering builds confidence and it 's empowering , " Carlson said , " but I 'm surprised that we have such high numbers .
"  To get to the bottom of it all , Carlson enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fueled by questions from readers .
The simple answer is that Minnesota has built an " infrastructure " of sorts that propels service and makes it easy for people to get involved in volunteerism .
The state 's abundance of nonprofit organizations , schools , places of worship and community opportunities in which people can volunteer gives the state a leg-up , said Samantha Jo Warfield , a CNCS spokeswoman .
Service is at the core of many of these institutions , she said .
" Each state , each community is different , " Warfield said .
" But in places like Minnesota , it was built on those values and those values have n't really changed .
"  Participating in causes one cares about is almost automatic , said Karmit Bulman , executive director of Minnesota Association for Volunteer Administration .
" That 's kind of ingrained in who Minnesotans are , " Bulman said .
" You see a problem , you see an issue , you see a community in need -- you help .
"  Maybe that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passive-aggressive part ) .
The state also has a high population of those who volunteer in general -- adults in their 30s and 40s .
In 2017 , Minnesota residents ages 35-44 volunteered the most , according to Minnesota Compass , a social indicators project of Wilder Research at the Amherst H .
Wilder Foundation .
This statistic is surprising to some , Warfield said , because many think those who are retired and have more free time often volunteer the most , but it 's actually the opposite .
Many in their 30s and 40s have young families and want to get involved in their community , Warfield said .
However , volunteerism may look uncertain for the foreseeable future , as the coronavirus crisis is forcing organizations to suspend in-person volunteer efforts in order to comply with the Health Department 's social distancing suggestions .
Even though the situation is unpredictable , many in Minnesota are still trying to help one another out , said Tracy Nielsen , the executive director of HandsOn Twin Cities .
" There 's still this overwhelming spirit of volunteerism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference , " Nielsen said .
" So it 's really amazing to see that that spirit is still coming through , even during these times that none of us really know what 's going on .
"  The majority of Minnesota 's volunteers fundraised or sold items to raise money in 2017 , according to Minnesota Compass .
Just last fall , GiveMN held its annual " giving holiday , " which raised a record of nearly $22 million for Minnesota nonprofits in one day .
Volunteering is not only done through official means , but also through simple things , Nielsen said .
" It does n't always have to look like a traditional volunteer opportunity , " Nielsen said .
" I think , as Minnesotans would often agree , it 's that spirit of caring in collaboration that I think drives people to really want to get involved .
