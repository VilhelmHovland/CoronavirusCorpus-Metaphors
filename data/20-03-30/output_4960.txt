After board exam ordeal , what coronavirus taught me about life  The coronavirus pandemic is a wake-up call for humanity to reform its ways .
Lazying around in the living room through the day , binge-watching our favourite Netflix shows through the night like nocturnal beings , and carelessly daydreaming while sitting in classrooms about what to wear to our next ' high society ' gathering , all seemed to be a distant dream as we prepared to trudge the long road to board exams .
These exams , we thought , were going to be God 's ultimate test for us students .
We were bracing ourselves to dig our social graves and suffer from modern world 's biggest fear , FOMO .
Little did we know that we were the unofficial harbingers of a movement that would soon possess the world : social distancing and isolation .
While we were thinking we had had enough of those ritual catchphrases of " get off the iPad ! " and " children , it is time to get serious ! " , destiny was making other plans , waiting to pounce at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obstacle race .
The moment we realise that we have successfully crossed one barrier , another hurdle stands in our way , twice as difficult as the former .
The coronavirus pandemic is a wake-up call for humanity to reform its ways .
The coronovirus pandemic has come as an ocean of agony to drown the parental peeves of their ' babies ' not studying , students ' worries of when the D-Day would arrive and exams would be over , and the headaches teachers faced over devising new methods to help the backbenchers pass .
The sources of stress and anxiety now originate from a virus that has invaded the world , ' the coronavirus ' .
Children have now cut themselves off from the urgency to finish their syllabus and are faced with the urgency to stock up on the sanitiser supply .
Mothers are no longer worried about us studying every day but washing our hands till they fall off .
Our blisters from toilsome hours of writing now scream for mercy from alcohol sanitisers .
Phones that were earlier flooded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a barrage of corona-related content .
The ' good morning ' forwards are now illustrated with huge diagrams of ' corona-flowers ' to make up for the lack of roses and lilies .
Teachers are not only regularly checking in with mothers to make sure that students are burning the midnight oil , but also to ensure that we are devoting enough time to personal hygiene .
We , on the other hand , are convinced that Doomsday could be well within sight .
Frankly speaking , coronavirus and the associated anxiety have become a more enduring part of our journey to the boards .
Though we had been fortunate enough not to witness any of the World Wars , taking an exam during the times of coronavirus was no less than entering a battlefield .
We left our homes armed with the strongest weapons of ( viral ) destruction : sanitisers and masks .
Upon reaching the exam centre , we were told to follow a series of safety measures , starting with the washing of hands , being checked for impermissible materials and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final ' energy shock ' before we entered our examination rooms .
Our seating arrangement was organised into regiments with only 12 students each to prevent overcrowding .
The CBSE 's proactive approach to handling the issue is praiseworthy and admirable .
Their efforts deserve immense credit .
The day we finished our exams , the government announced that they were postponing the rest of the papers in view of the pandemic .
I 'm certain that this news caused tremors to the already overstretched parents and children who were hoping to get done with the ordeal .
As we sit at home amid a crisis most did not see coming , we millennials , for the first time , look beyond Instagram memes to read posts about those in suffering , seek to talk to those who are in need of support rather than gossip , and thank God to be able to sit with all our families under the same roof .
The coronavirus , that has killed thousands and brought grief to many , is in fact , a caution to humanity .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us an opportunity to pause and reflect , spend time bonding with family and realise that love , good health and kindness are the greatest gifts .
