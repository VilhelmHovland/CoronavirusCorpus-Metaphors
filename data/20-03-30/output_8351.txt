As I sit down to write this column on March 24 , worlds upon worlds will likely have changed by the time it reaches you on April 6 ( or thereabouts ) .
As we have seen during the coronavirus crisis , entire economies can shift in two weeks .
My state-enforced stay-at-home request here in Massachusetts could be nearing its scheduled end ( or not ) .
Surely , we will all be seasoned pros at physical distancing .
That was one of the challenges with the Monitor Weekly 's April 6 cover story .
How do you write anything about something that could change everything in two weeks ? So we took some of the more thematic highlights of our recent coverage and combined them into a look at how the response has shaped us .
But no matter what has changed by April 6 , I wanted to highlight an idea that is sprinkled throughout our stories .
To me , this unprecedented moment of enforced physical isolation has only underscored the mutual power and connection we share .

Together , we are overcoming the claim that physical distance must weaken connection .
This power is active and abiding in our shared purpose and love , from Germany to Japan .
And perhaps , years from now , we will be able to say that , for several months in 2020 , we found a way to measure our common worth by something more than stocks and bonds .
