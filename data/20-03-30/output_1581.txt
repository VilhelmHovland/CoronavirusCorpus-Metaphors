How the UK 's just-in-time delivery model crumbled under coronavirus  Stockpiling has upended supermarkets .
But they 're already fighting back .
A few weeks ago , many people were no longer able to get their hands on their choice of rigatoni , any kind of loo roll or a box of eggs .
Aisles were bare and panic buying gripped the nation .
Or so we thought .
The data shows something else was going on .
Analysis by market insights firm Kantar found that a significant number of customers were just adding a few extra items to their shop had managed to break the typically well-oiled system .
The impact from that very small increase in demand from every single shopper early on showed just how poorly prepared supermarkets were for what was about to come .

Supermarkets are used to planning months in advance for seasonal events like Christmas , when people buy more than they typically would at other times of the year .
During this time , retailers start using all sorts of space in the stores , says Leigh Sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" You 'll see stock above shelves , you 'll see stock in the backroom , you 'll see trailers outside the store , " he explains .
" None of that was prepared for this time because it came with an unexpected surge in demand .
"  The inability to cope with unexpected demand has resulted in short-term supply issues and exposed the precarious way modern-day supermarket supply chains are run .
Sparks says that the majority of what you see on the shelves is all of the stock that the supermarket is carrying .
Why do n't they hold more in the back ? " If you have lots of stock holding , the price of products that consumers buy goes up quite substantially , " he explains .
Customers are the ones footing the bill for the additional cost of prime retail space , which is one of the reasons why stock in local supermarkets like Tesco Express is sometimes more expensive than at larger branches .

But during a period of economic downturn in 1977 , Tesco changed the game : it found that cash-strapped consumers were shopping far less than normal , and so started ' Operation Checkout ' .
Timed to coincide with the Queen 's Silver Jubilee , Tesco shut all of its stores and slashed its prices , and thus kickstarted the price wars we see today between the major supermarkets .
The only way that Tesco was able to slash its prices at the time was because it moved to a just-in-time delivery model , the same one that all of the major supermarkets use for many of their products today .
Just-in-time relies on supermarkets ordering in stock into their stores on a daily basis , based on the level of demand in each individual store .
To do this , suppliers send these goods to the supermarket 's distribution centres , many of which are located in the East Midlands , in an area called the Golden Triangle .

" It 's actually a reasonably complex logistics operation which for many years has worked absolutely wonderfully , " says Richard Wilding OBE , professor of supply chain strategy at the Cranfield School of Management .
" It 's a really synchronised flow of goods through that particular supply chain .
The challenge that we 've got is that panic buying creates a massive increase in demand on the particular supply chain , and then you get capacity constraints .
"  These capacity constraints have a continuous knock-on effect on every link in the supermarket 's just-in-time supply chain .
Distribution centres are running low on stock because retailers are ordering more into their stores .
But they ca n't get more stock into the distribution centres because they ca n't transport it into the supermarkets fast enough .
All the while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough backroom space to store it all .
By the time the stock is put onto the shelves , the items are already gone , which has led to our empty shelves .
There is more than enough stock in the supply chain , Wilding argues , there just is n't the capacity to get it all delivered quickly enough .

In response , Sainsbury 's opted to close all of its meat , fish and pizza counters to free up its delivery network and staff for essential products .

On social media , photos of aisles , supposed to be full of fresh produce like fruit , veg , fish , meat , eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things with a shorter shelf life , they ca n't linger in distribution centres for very long and are produced at a more consistent rate than tinned or frozen goods .
Alexander Trautrims , professor in supply chain and operations management at Nottingham University Business School , says that the production of dairy products like milk is pretty stable -- the rate at which cows produce milk and the rate at which people consume it does not fluctuate that much .
This means that manufacturing ca n't be ramped up in the same way as tinned goods .
In a crisis like this , consumers who would naturally pick the products with the longest expiration date wo n't be able to do that anymore because of high demand , and stable production levels .
" When we buy stuff at the supermarket at the moment , we would hope to buy yoghurt with a week or two of shelf life .
If demand is varying , the amount of shelf life we 're going to get is going to start to vary , so we might not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which to eat it , " says John Perry , managing director at Scala Consulting , which provides management services for the supply chain and logistics sectors .
Fresh vegetables may also be more difficult to procure because they 're often imported from countries like Spain .
Still , Trautrims is optimistic that our ability to get fresh produce will improve .
" I think at this time of the year , more fresh produce would come from the UK anyway .
We 're probably quite lucky that it 's happening at this time of the year , " he says .
" The real question here will become where the seasonal harvest workers are supposed to come from .

" If we were to prioritise moving toilet roll into supermarkets , what you 're going to end up with is all these lorries full of very low value items , and no space for anything else .
"  Those supply constraints will remain as people begin ordering home delivery as they are told to stay at home .
On Friday , Tesco began limiting shoppers to 80 items per order as the firm continued to run out of delivery slots .
The company found that shoppers had been placing orders of more than 100 items , far higher than the average number of around 60 items per order .
Customers are paying more than ever for their food ; figures from Blacktower Financial Management showed that people have increased online spending by 25 .
per cent as a result of the coronavirus pandemic .
As of the time of writing , Asda has no online delivery slots until April 10 , while delivery slots at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer available .
Iceland and Sainsbury 's have prioritised delivery slots for the elderly , vulnerable and disabled , but Sainsbury 's says there are no slots available for the next three weeks .
The reason for this massive delay is simple : home delivery broadly relies on pickers taking products from the very shelves that have been emptied in supermarkets or arrive from small specialist centres , putting more strain on the system .
" In some of the supermarkets , you will see store staff picking customer orders , and it requires people to do that , " Perry says -- and delivery drivers then need to be available to deliver those goods .
These delivery vans need to be able to carry not only chilled food and fresh food , but also hazardous substances like cleaning products , which all have to be segregated inside the van .

Sparks thinks that supermarkets will begin stripping back their range of product , so that instead of 25 varieties of pasta , there will only be two or three .
This way , the retailers can transport the goods from manufacturers which are already based in the UK rather than say , pasta from Italy .
Manufacturers could also stop delivering to distribution centres and deliver straight to the store , cutting out the middleman .
" There 's been a swing-back to some of that , so Warburtons bread might do a bit more store delivery , " Sparks says .
Retailers could also move towards a more efficient system , in which items are rolled out onto shelves by the pallet-load or in boxes , rather than individual items .
" I think what we 'll see is that the big retailers will probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you have fewer lines at a bigger quantity because that tends to be more efficient and needs fewer staff , " says Trautrims .
At the same time , drivers delivering food , which was once destined for restaurants and bars , can shift their capacity to deliver stock from the distribution centres , rather than delivering stock from restaurant suppliers .
Some have already mobilised : last week , SCALA announced that it was forming a COVID-19 supply chain collaboration emergency working group which will bring together the UK 's manufacturers to help feed the nation .
And as of March 19 , the government announced that it was relaxing competition laws to allow supermarkets to work together on a coronavirus response , allowing competitors to share their stock levels , distribution centres and delivery vans for the first time .
The government simultaneously announced that it was relaxing rules around drivers ' hours , so that more drivers can drive longer hours to deliver the necessary goods .
