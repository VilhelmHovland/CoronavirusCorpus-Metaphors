Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the percentage of new coronavirus cases each day is falling , as tough restrictions on movement take effect .
However the number of Google searches related to domestic violence is at a five-year high , as the side effects of measures to slow the spread of the virus mount .
As of 6am on Sunday , Australia has 3809 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , an increase of 431 on the previous day .
But Health Minister Greg Hunt said there were " early signs of flattening of the curve " , a week after the National Cabinet escalated social distancing measures to unprecedented levels .
" That is an early positive sign .
We have so much more work to do but , by people isolating .
Australians are rising magnificently to this challenge , " Mr Hunt said .
The term " flatten the curve " refers to an epidemic graph , which is a chart used in epidemiology to visualise the onset of an outbreak .
It is a simple curve graph with the Y-axis showing the number of cases and the X-axis showing the time since the first case .

Mr Morrison said this time last week , the rate of increase on cases was around 25 to 30 per cent a day .
" That rate is now over the last few days has fallen to about 13 to 15 per cent , " Mr Morrison said .
But while most new cases of coronavirus in Australia are still imported , a growing number have no clear link to overseas travel , particularly in NSW .
Mr Morrison said as testing criteria broadened , more cases like this would emerge .
NSW and Victoria have been eyeing further restrictions on movement , ahead of the National Cabinet meeting on Sunday afternoon .
However the restrictions were having unintended social impacts , Mr Morrison said .
" Google has shown a 75 per cent increase in searches when it comes to concerns about domestic violence in recent days , " he said .
