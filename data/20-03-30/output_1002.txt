Indonesia accounts for nearly half of the 250 deaths reported across Southeast Asia , but some officials and experts believe a lack of testing has masked the scale of the outbreak .
Most infections in Indonesia have been concentrated in and around the capital Jakarta .
The city of 10 million has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public entertainment , but so far there has been no full public lockdown which the president has been reluctant to impose .
" I 'm ordering large-scale social limits , physical distancing needs to be done more sternly , more disciplined , and effectively , " Widodo told a cabinet meeting , stressing that only the central government could decide on regional quarantines .
Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan said on Monday he had asked Widodo to approve a regional quarantine , " effectively a lockdown " for Jakarta .
He told Reuters he doubted the central government 's death tolls and had been informed by hospitals that 283 patients had died of a " contagious disease " but were treated with " Covid-19 protocols " .
" There 's a backlog in testing and limited numbers of people being tested , " Baswedan said , asking central authorities to act with more urgency .
" The hospitals have been informing us that patients had contagious disease ' , but they are not saying COVID19 .
"  Official data puts the death toll in Jakarta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing but initially questioned whether Indonesians have the discipline for full lockdowns in contrast with other Southeast Asian nations .
But he started to reconsider this approach after public health experts presented a prediction model to Indonesia 's planning agency Bappenas on Friday underlining a need for stronger intervention to prevent a rapid rise in cases and deaths .
The model , a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters , said Indonesia could instigate three stages of intervention : mild , moderate , and high .
The latter would include very significant levels of testing and making physical distancing mandatory .
With mild intervention , which includes optional physical distancing and limiting public crowds , the researchers from the University of Indonesia said the virus death toll could soar to over 140,000 among over 1 .
million cases by May .

" But we have to be ready even in these circumstances .
"  Riono characterised measures currently taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test samples , as only approaching mild intervention .
Health experts have expressed concerns over Indonesia 's significant deficit in hospital beds , medical staff and intensive-care facilities .
Riono said the priority now must be to suppress the number of cases .
" The message ( in our model ) is that we do n't want people dying , we do n't want our siblings dying , our friends dying .
