He said after some days of monitoring the level of compliance with the state government 's directive for markets in the state to be closed , he was shocked to discover that some markets had continued to violate the sit-at-home order .
According to him , the discovery had left the government with no choice than to make necessary decisions to further prevent the spread of the novel Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) in the State .
Below is the full text of his broadcast address .

After some days of monitoring the level of compliance of the State Government 's directive for markets in the state to be closed , we were shocked to discover that some markets have continued to violate the sit-at-home order .
We have no choice than to make some painful , but necessary decisions to further prevent the spread of coronavirus in the State .
Therefore , after a meeting of the State Security Council today , the following decisions were taken :  With effect from Tuesday March 31 , 2020 there will be a dusk to dawn curfew from Obiri-Ikwerre Junction ( Ozuoba , Rumualogu ) to Choba and from Education Bus Stop to Agip Junction , Ikwerre Road .
All beer parlours and public drinking joints are hereby closed because they have suddenly become an extension of night clubs that were earlier shut down .

All landlords are advised to warn their tenants who use their property as beer parlours or public drinking joints to adhere to this directive .

Any Traditional Ruler who allows markets to be open in his domain will be deposed .

Further violation by residents of these two communities will attract declaration of curfew .
Further flagrant violation of the closure of markets will attract a state-wide declaration of curfew .
We must understand that people must be alive before they eat food .
As a responsive government , we have also reviewed our earlier directives and have resolved to grant waivers to the following categories of essential services : ( a ) Medical and Pharmaceutical Personnel ( b ) Food and Beverages ( c ) Essential Oil and Gas Staff ( d ) Petroleum Products ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories of staff must identify themselves with valid identity cards .

Let me reiterate that this government will continue to do what is right no matter who is involved .
As you are all aware , no conventional war has grounded global life and economy like coronavirus has done .
Everybody is affected .
Therefore , all hands must be on deck to defeat coronavirus .
I want to sincerely express my heartfelt gratitude to our health professionals on the frontline of this fight .
Let me also thank all the security agencies , individuals and organisations who are collaborating with us to make Rivers State safe .
