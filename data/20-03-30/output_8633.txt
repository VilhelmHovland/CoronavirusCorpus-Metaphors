We agree with their comments and acknowledge that different renin -- angiotensin -- aldosterone system ( RAAS ) inhibitors have different effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) levels .
Ferrario and colleagues3 reported that administration of either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers ( ARBs ) increased the levels of Ace2 mRNA in Lewis rats compared with rats receiving placebo .
In particular , cardiac levels of Ace2 mRNA increased by 4 .

Furthermore , the researchers found that losartan treatment , but not lisinopril treatment , increased ACE2 activity compared with placebo .
However , the researchers did not shed light on the mechanisms that might account for these differences .
Nevertheless , Li and colleagues4 found that treatment with captopril ( an ACE inhibitor ) can significantly increase ACE2 protein expression in rats with acute lung injury .
Furthermore , W ? sten-van Asperen and colleagues5 reported that , in a rat model of acute respiratory distress syndrome , ACE activity and angiotensin II expression are increased , whereas ACE2 activity and angiotensin- ( 1 -- 7 ) levels are reduced .
The protective effects of the ACE2 -- angiotensin- ( 1 -- 7 ) -- Mas receptor axis are primarily mediated by reductions in angiotensin II level6 .
Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can reduce angiotensin II levels7 .
The former inhibit the substrate of angiotensin II generation , and the latter directly inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II .
Therefore , RAAS inhibitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- angiotensin- ( 1 -- 7 ) -- Mas receptor axis .
However , as mentioned in our Comment article2 , whether patients with coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) and hypertension who are taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB should switch to another antihypertensive drug remains controversial .
In one study , the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs did not increase mortality in 112 patients with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease8 .
Further evidence is required to clarify the effects of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 .
On 12 March 2020 , the European Society of Hypertension published a statement on the topic of hypertension , RAAS blockers and COVID-19 , concluding that the available data do not support the differential use of RAAS blockers ( ACE inhibitors or ARBs ) in patients with COVID-19 ( ref .
However , the authors cautioned that the statement reflected the current evidence at the time of release and might need updating according to new evidence .
Indeed , ACE2 might be equivalent to a natural ARB or ACE inhibitor10 .
Decreasing the levels of ACE2 will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- angiotensin II -- angiotensin II receptor type 1 axis , leading to lung injury and the progression of inflammatory storms .
Increasing the levels of ACE2 will transfer the balance towards the angiotensin- ( 1 -- 7 ) -- Mas receptor axis , which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects that are cardiopulmonary protective .
In their Correspondence article , Mourad and Levy also suggest that aliskiren treatment could be an interesting option in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) infection , given that aliskiren can reduce the expression of ACE2 .
Although ACE2 has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 , the role of ACE2 in the progression of COVID-19 after SARS-CoV-2 infection is still controversial , so the benefits of aliskiren use in patients with COVID-19 needs further investigation .
