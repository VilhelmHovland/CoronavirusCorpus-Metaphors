George 's flag at Westminster bridge on Brexit day  Reuters  64/66  A British bulldog toy and other souvenirs at a souvenir store  Reuters  65/66  British pro-brexit Members of the European Parliament leave the EU Parliament for the last time  Reuters  66/66  Jonathan Bullock waves the Union Jack as he leaves the European Parliament  EPA  Best for Britain said the responses broke down into predictable support from those who voted for Labour ( 84 per cent ) and the Lib Dems ( 83 per cent ) at the last election , but that the first statement was also supported by nearly half of those who voted Conservative ( 44 per cent ) and a fifth of Brexit Party voters ( 19 per cent ) .
An extension was supported by more than 50 per cent of people across all age groups , with 18-24 year olds the most supportive ( 78 per cent ) and 65-plus year olds the least supportive ( although still 52 per cent ) -- meaning there is no generational divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNP has also urged the UK government to " hit pause " on the Brexit negotiations and seek an extension to the transition period while authorities grapple with the coronavirus pandemic .
The party 's Brexit spokeswoman , MP Philippa Whitford , said it would be irresponsible and " an act of economic and social self-harm " to continue " hurtling " towards the transition deadline .
The Focaldata poll also indicated most people would like the government to seek membership of the EU Early Warning and Response System ( EWRS ) for medical emergencies , after it emerged earlier this month the Department of Health had been unsuccessful in lobbying No 10 to remain a member .
Speaking about the poll , Best for Britain chief executive Naomi Smith said : " It 's simply not reasonable to expect we will have tied up negotiations with the EU by the end of the year while dealing with a warlike emergency .
Nor is it desirable .
" By thinking it can complete both challenges at once , the government would be setting itself up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want the government to get on with the job at hand so that lives can be saved and normality restored as quickly as possible .
"  She added : " The country is simply not in a place to weather two storms at the moment .
"  Hope Not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles said : " EU schemes like the Early Warning and Response System and the ventilator procurement programme are critical tools for responding to this urgent public health crisis .
" Healthcare workers are doing a fantastic job , but they can not fight this disease alone .
They need all the help they can get .
" The government must put politics aside and urgently seek participation in these schemes .
It would be foolhardy for ideology to get in the way of practical measures to keep people safe .
"  The government has recently said it remains " fully committed to the negotiations " , which it said are continuing .
