How to safely clean your smartphone  The outbreak of Covid-19 has encouraged consumers everywhere to be a little more vigilant and conscious of how exposed their everyday behavior leaves them to harmful bacteria .
However , if you think your flagship smartphone is immune to contamination , you 're fooling yourself .
Like door handles , your smartphone is what the experts might call a high-contact point area .
And unless you 're washing your hands before you check those Facebook notifications , any bacteria that ends up on your hands is likely going to be spread onto your screen .
With that in mind , here 's a quick run-down of everything you need to know to clean your phone without breaking it :  Things to avoid  As a general rule , it 's best to refrain from spraying cleaning solutions directly onto your device .
Even if your phone or tablet has an IP rating or is marketed as water resistance , those durability tests are generally rated based on standardized tests with fresh water or dust particles -- not cleaning solutions .
If the ACCC says salt water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their devices , it 's probably not worth gambling on how resilient your phone is to a full-on blast of GermKiller .
Another thing to avoid is wiping your screen down with pure alcohol .
Since alcohol is slightly acidic , this can cause permanent damage to your display -- especially if your phone 's has an oleophobic coating on it .
Avoid getting moisture near the charging ports on your device .
A quick wipe down is fine but take care .
Getting even a little bit of liquid here can interfere with its ability to charge -- which is particularly problematic for devices that do n't support Qi or other forms of wireless charging .
We all use our devices in fairly unsanitary conditions like the bathroom or bedroom .
Of course , if you frequently wash your hands , that 's already going to bring the amount of bacteria you transfer to your phone down .
As per the World Health Organisation 's Q&amp;A on the topic , " It is not certain how long the virus that causes Covid-19 survives on surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studies suggest that coronaviruses may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days .
This may vary under different conditions ( eg type of surface , temperature or humidity of the environment ) .
"  Lastly , and this should go without saying but , do not clean your device while charging it .
Mixing active electrical connections and liquids is just asking for trouble .
Best practices  If you own an iPhone , Apple recommends an 70% isopropyl wipe .
If you own an Android phone , it might be worth skipping the wipes outright and picking up a microfibre cloth .
If you 're just looking to do a light clean , dab the cloth in warm water and use that to gently clean your device .
If you 're looking to dislodge some more tangible stains , feel free to add a little bit of soap .
Just remember to be gentle with it .
Have a Galaxy Fold and worried about breaking it ? Here are some more specific instructions about how to safely clean Samsung 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultraviolet light cleaners are a category of smartphone accessory that have recently become more popular in recent years and are likely to continue to gain in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic .
We recently reviewed one in the form of the Lexon Oblio .
This was a vase-like wireless charger that would use UV-C light to kill bacteria on either side of your device when you put it down to charge .
This crude sanitisation process took about twenty minutes in total and effectively kills off most of the germs on your device .
Other ultraviolet light cleaning products work much the same way .
Compared to manually disinfecting your device by hand , UV cleaners can seem like a luxuriously hands-off alternative .
However , the World Health Organisation advises that UV should not be used as a disinfectant for the coronavirus .
UV-C cleaners should be treated as a compliment to traditional cleaning methods , rather than a replacement .
