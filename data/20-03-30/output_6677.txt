The announcement came after a meeting between officials from the United Arab Emirates and foreign countries participating in the nearly six-month-long event that was due to begin in October .
Reuters earlier on Monday reported Expo was due to be postponed by a year at the request of participating countries who want to focus on tackling the virus .
" Many countries have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 and they have therefore expressed a need to postpone the opening of Expo 2020 Dubai by one year , to enable them to overcome this challenge , " Director General for Expo 2020 Dubai Reem al-Hashimy said in a statement .
" The UAE and Expo 2020 Dubai have listened .
And in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore a one year postponement at today 's Steering Committee meeting .
"  An estimated 11 million overseas visitors were expected to attend the showpiece of culture , business and technology featuring pavilions from 192 countries .
A final decision will be made in June by member states of the Paris-based Bureau International des Expositions , which awards the event .
Two sources familiar with the matter said it was unlikely member states would vote against postponing .
The delay is set to be a major blow for Dubai as the emirate -- which would have spent over $8 billion on Expo-related infrastructure projects by the end of the fair -- was relying on the event to boost its economy .
Dubai-based Arqaam Capital last year forecast an economic benefit from Expo of up to $9 billion in incremental tourist spending .
Expo was the last major international event that was still officially scheduled to go ahead this year .
The 2020 Tokyo Olympics were last week postponed by a year .
