How to read the news like a scientist and avoid the COVID-19 ' infodemic '  As the SARS-CoV-2 virus -- more popularly known as COVID-19 -- has spread around the globe , conspiracy theories and rumours have also gone viral on social media platforms and other outlets .
As World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rightly said in February , " We 're not just fighting an epidemic ; we 're fighting an infodemic " .
Finding reliable information in the digital age is already challenging enough , even more so during a global pandemic when fake news , misinformation and hyperbole are rife .
This is a once in a generation , perhaps even once in a lifetime event for many of us , so it 's a time when I feel grateful that I am trained in science communication and therefore equipped to see through the sensational headlines and bogus science stories .
Here are some tips to help you do the same .
Embracing uncertainty -- responsibly  This virus was only identified in December 2019 , so there has been little time to investigate it properly , let alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a great deal we do n't fully understand about COVID-19 .
Add to this that the fact that science itself is a process that takes time and sometimes studies will present contradictory evidence ( which is okay ) .
Any good science journalist will endeavour to give you the most accurate representation of which way the evidence is swaying but would caution against making statements such as " scientific evidence proves that .
" so be sceptical of anything that makes such claims .
Where 's the information coming from ?  Many people write about science , or information related to science , but not everyone who does has been trained how to properly evaluate evidence , interpret jargon or report on statistics in the way that some specialist science journalists have .
Stay mindful that information from the original source ( most likely a research study ) could have been reinterpreted , modified and even ignored altogether depending on the point the person writing wants to get across .
If you can find a reference or link to the original research in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign that the person writing it actually understands or has questioned the original work .
Depending on the nature of the claim , you should check whether it 's also being reported in other media outlets .
Chances are that if it really is a " breakthrough " discovery then many other outlets will be reporting the same thing .
If it 's a lone WhatsApp message with a certain claim with no evidence , then you should think twice .
Who 's backing up the claim ?  Ideally , reports of new scientific research should include comments from the study authors as well as an independent comment from someone in a related discipline who was not involved in the work .
That 's not always the case though , and just because someone is a scientist does n't mean that they 're qualified to comment on the work as they may not have had training or experience in that specific topic area .
During the COVID-19 pandemic there 's been a lot of " I 'm not a virologist or epidemiologist but .
" so be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority .
Other questions to ask yourself are whether the quoted sources have a conflict of interest or stand to benefit in any way from what they 're saying .
Are they affiliated with an organisation that could be swaying them to comment one way or another ?  Applying the above lenses to anything you read or share could help you to discern what sources you should trust and those you should n't , and even when well-known authoritative outlets over-exaggerate scientific findings or misinterpret them .
Of course , there is plenty of great reporting out there , especially during what is a complex and fast-moving situation .
Many of us would n't be aware of the risk that COVID-19 could overwhelm our lives and livelihoods without the power of journalism .
Even with the above in mind , if you 're unsure of where to turn or what to share , be sure to check out the World Health Organization website as a trusted source of evidence-based information .
