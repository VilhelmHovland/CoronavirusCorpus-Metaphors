employees at a New York fulfillment center plan to go on strike at noon on Monday , alleging management has been unresponsive to safety concerns and the spread of the coronavirus at the facility .

Colleagues began falling ill after Amazon managers came back from a trip to Seattle , Washington , the initial epicenter of the virus in the U .
, according to Smalls .
He left work in the second week of March out of concern for his health .
Smalls returned last week to rally support for a work stoppage among the building 's 4,500 employees and reiterate his concerns and recommendations to management .
" What are we waiting for ? " he said he told the site 's general manager and head of human resources .
" Someone to die ? "  He says the company has not been transparent about how many employees at the Staten Island location have tested positive for Covid-19 and have taken insufficient safety precautions , including allowing one of his colleagues to return to work while awaiting her test results .

" Enough is enough .
"  Athena is leading a coalition expressing concerns of the workers .

Amazon did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment .
" People need to be held accountable , even Jeff Bezos himself , " Smalls said in a telephone interview .
" These buildings all across the globe need to be shut down .
We are the breeding ground for the coronavirus .
"  Employees have taken to Facebook and Instagram groups to organize the details of the work stoppage and share stories of working conditions , he said .
