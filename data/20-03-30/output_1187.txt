Four graphs that show the effect of social distancing in the UK  30 March 2020 , 5:39pm  Text settings  CommentsShare  Those who tuned into the government 's daily press conference were given a glimpse of what will come to pass if Boris Johnson has to take a break from his duties as a result of his coronavirus diagnosis .
The government 's ' designated survivor ' Dominic Raab led the conference -- providing an update on Foreign Office efforts to bring Brits stranded abroad back home .
A ? 75 million fund has been set up with the aim of bringing tens of thousands home .
However , the main update came from Chief Scientific Officer Patrick Valance who gave a presentation on the effect social distancing has had in the UK so far through four graphs .
Valance said there had been promising signs when it comes to slowing transmission of the virus .
While Valance was reluctant to put a time stamp on how long social distancing measures could be in place in the UK , he did suggest that the peak of infections could be two to three weeks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I 've said recently is that we expect this to get worse over the next couple of weeks because there is a lag phase between getting the disease and people turning up in hospital .
So we would expect to see a continuation of this over the next two or three weeks then a stabilisation and a gradual decrease thereafter .
The number of hospital admissions - to repeat - has gone up roughly the same amount each day , suggesting that we are not on a fast acceleration at the moment .
'  This chimes with James 's revelation on Saturday that the estimate in government is that the crisis is going to come to a head quicker than expected .
The week beginning 12 April , not mid-May , is expected to be the peak of the virus -- after that is ' when we 'd expect to see things level off ' .
Here are the graphs , as presented by the government :  1 .
Social distancing has seen a big drop in public transport use  Valance said that this slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the behaviour changes ' : ' This shows the use of transport over time from the end of February through to now and you can see a dramatic fall off in the use of the London tube down to just a few per cent of what it was back at the end of February , a decrease in bus use , a decrease in National Rail and a decrease also in the use in motor vehicles .
So the measures are in place , they are making a difference , they are decreasing the contact which is so important to spread the disease ' .
New UK Cases : there has been an increase since mid-March  Valance says there has been an increase in the number of cases since the middle of March through to today -- but a decrease could be on the cards soon : ' The stay at home message will be reducing the number of cases of transmission in the community and decreasing the number of cases overall as the cases flatten off .
And we should n't take too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look over time and see what 's happening .
We would expect this in turn to decrease the number of people needing admission to hospital '  3 .
Hospital admissions : ' We 're not on a fast acceleration at the moment '  Valance says this graph shows the total number of people admitted to hospital or since the middle of March , which is now eight thousand people with coronavirus .
He said that while the number of admissions are increasing it is going up in a ' constant amount ' -- ' which may suggest that we 're already beginning to see some effects through about half of those cases ' .
Valance said when it comes to government projections , things will get worse before they get better : ' We expect this to get worse over the next couple of weeks because there 's a lag phase between getting the disease and people turning up in hospital .
So you would expect to see a continuation of this at least over two or three weeks , then a stabilisation and a gradual decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone up roughly the same amount each day , suggesting that we 're not on a fast acceleration at the moment ' .
Covid-19 deaths : UK is tracking alongside France  The final slide Valance presented tracks the deaths that have occurred globally across some of the countries currently fighting coronavirus .
He said that the UK was closest to France in its current trajectory : ' We 're tracking roughly along the same path as France .
I 've said before , we 're behind Italy in terms of the curve .
You can see that Spain has a higher number than Italy at the moment in terms of its trajectory , not in terms of the total number , but the direction in which it 's going .
The UK is tracking alongside France in this .
The measures we 're taking will stop the transmission , delay the transmission , reduce the number of cases .
They reduce the number of people becoming infected in the community .
Reduce the number of people , therefore , that need to go on to ventilators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die or will die from this infection .
