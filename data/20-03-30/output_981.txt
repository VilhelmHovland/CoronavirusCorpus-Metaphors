Just because sports is on a standstill , life should not be .
We have so much to be thankful for in life , besides enjoying cricket in a stadium or television .
December 2019 seems such a fresh memory in the wake of recent 2019 novel coronavirus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) pandemic , which was first reported in Wuhan , China .
For several health care workers including doctors and nurses , sports has often been a cathartic phenomenon .
Cricket , whether it is for local club , county and country , has provided entertainment for folks in all walks of life .
For some , it became part of their routine to watch some form of cricket .
For me too , as an oncologist , it became a mundane routine and provided me with the boost I needed for the next day to get to the hospital and see my patients with vigour .
One never thought of cricket as a medication , for some , to boost their mental health , although it might seem far-fetched to others .
If you get hooked on a medication , then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  And , now , there is a phase of withdrawal and mental chaos in the minds of sports fans .
Can you imagine suddenly discontinuing an anti-depressant for a patient who has been on treatment for depression ?  Ardent cricket fans perhaps are gripped with this state of mind .
Humans have an amazing ability to bounce back , no matter what the situation .
Just because sports is on a standstill , life should not be .
We have so much to be thankful for in life , besides enjoying cricket in a stadium or television .
This is a time for self-reflection and inner motivation .
One needs to bring out all our inner reserves and put them to use .
Life of a sports journalist in times of COVID-19  Imagine the life of a sports journalist , one who is earning a livelihood by reporting on events .
There is a lull , almost a deafening silence and a significant change in the thought process .
The entire population is focused on protecting themselves from the virus and journalists are no exceptions .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who continue to engage cricket fans worldwide .
We suddenly realise how enjoyable life used to be .
For any Twenty20 tournaments worldwide like the IPL , CPL or PSL etc , it would provide the appetiser along with their evening meal .
And , now television is full of stories related to the pandemic and the havoc it is creating worldwide .
This year 's IPL has been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak .
- SPORTZPICS  No one is immune to this disease .
The inherent nature of this virus makes it extremely infectious and all the proper warnings and suggestions need to be followed .
It may have taken a bit longer for a few sporting bodies to realise the immense impact of this worldwide horror , but better late than never .
So , what does one do ? What are the remedies ? We are in the midst of the most challenging times of our lives .
This completely unchartered modern medical disaster needs the help of every single human being .
It is a tough ask to remain positive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the other option ? We have to have faith in our human strengths and modern medicine .
Time will heal and sports will return .
