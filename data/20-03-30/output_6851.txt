Coronavirus is a reminder we need universal health care  This pandemic has shown that my health , and at times , my life , does indeed depend on the health of my neighbor .
Let us put aside all the arguments against universal health care -- they are moot now -- and go about figuring the best way to implement a national health care policy where everyone is covered , and co-pays and deductibles are reasonable .
If you have a strong feeling against a universal health care policy , remember the trade-offs that we currently make .
Right now , small businesses can not compete for workers against their larger competitors because they ca n't afford a competitive health care benefit .
By freeing them to concentrate on their core business , we improve capitalism and help their new businesses get going .
As the saying goes -- we do well by doing good .
