The average remittance fee to African countries is approx .
, according to World Bank reports .
Why ? And how can you avoid such high fees ?  Actual situation with high fees :  For whatever reasons many customers still use long time established ways to send money to their loved ones , their families and friends .
They use either bank accounts ( sending money from bank account to bank account ) or Western Union and Moneygram , the two dominating companies of the remittance market .
But the downside of these two ways are the high occurring transfer fees .
Classic banks ask a fortune of fees for these transfer which they do n't like .
Being an US bank and having to send money to a third world country bank account , full of financial restrictions and under the eyes of anti money laundering laws , that 's hard .
There are loopholes :  Me , I am working a lot with freelancers in various African countries , e .
Kenya ( learn more about it : send money to Kenya ) , Ghana or Nigeria .
When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different possibilities .
Solution 1 :  I send my money to them using mobile money providers such as WorldRemit , Xoom or ( for us here in Europe ) Azimo .
How does it work ?  Let 's assume , I want to use WorldRemit .
WorldRemit is the world leader as money transfer app for remittances .
I open an account giving my contact data and my mobile phone number .
I add a bank account or a credit card number which shall be used to draw the money from .
Then I select the receiver country and add a new recipient ( name , mobile phone number , city ) .
As last step I chose the transfer method : bank transfer , mobile money , mobile phone airtime top up or cash pickup .
Now all I have to do is to fill in the amount to send and that 's it .
WorldRemit texts me about each set of the transaction , so I am always informed about the procedure and where my money is .

USD fee  Solution 2 :  You use a cryptocurrency to send the amount of money , e .
Bitcoin ( BTC ) .
This works the best with peer-to-peer ( P2P ) marketplaces such as Paxful , LocalBitcoins or Coinmama .
Let 's take the example of Paxful .
Paxful is very well established in Africa .
From an African perspective , Paxful is the number One .
The opening of a Paxful account takes more steps compared to mobile money apps , because of the enhanced security reasons for cryptocurrency applications .
Once you have enabled your account , you are in paradise ? ?  Paxful offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " normal " ways like paying from a bank account or a PayPal account up to buying bitcoins with gift card codes ( Amazon , iTunes , etc ) .
As soon as you have your bitcoins bought in your wallet , you select the receiver wallet of your counterpart 8your family member or friend ) and just send it there with one click .
No sending fees occur !  The receiver gets the bitcoins instantly and can sell them against cash in his country .
To be honest ; my freelancer partners love this method !  Author bio :  Jens Ischebeck is specialist for money transfer apps and bitcoin based remittances for African remittances .
