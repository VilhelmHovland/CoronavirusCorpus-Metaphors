Liquor stores impose booze limit from start of trade  Major bottle shops will impose restrictions on the amount of alcohol Australians can buy in one transaction , from the start of trading on Tuesday .
Customers will only be allowed to buy a maximum of two slabs of beer or cider and 12 bottles of wine in one transaction as part of a national booze limit active from today , a voluntary initiative from the industry .
As well as the beer , cider and wine limits , there are also restrictions on pre-mix spirits ( two cases ) , cask wine ( two casks not more than 10 litres ) and bottles of spirits ( two bottles not more than 2 litres ) .
