Nurse says ' we 're not being adequately protected at the front line '  Some Ontario nurses are worried that the personal protective equipment they are being provided wo n't protect them from COVID-19 .
PPE guidelines , outlined by Ontario 's chief medical officer of health two weeks ago , were changed from heavier protection measures , and that has left many health-care workers feeling exposed and unprotected .
An intensive-care nurse at Kingston General Hospital , who asked to remain anonymous because she fears losing her job after speaking out , said she and other co-workers are afraid and emotions are high .
" I 've never seen so many people cry at work , " she said .
" I 've heard the term ' collateral damage , ' and that 's kind of how we feel .
Everyone is super stressed about bringing this home to their families and not being adequately protected or supported at work .
"  She and other nurses want to have access to N95 respirators for any exposure to all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients .
She pointed to the precautions that the Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respirators were used for all suspected interactions .
An internal memo circulated among nursing staff at KGH on Wednesday outlined the current guidelines for PPE among staff working with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients .
Nurses , doctors and other health-care workers at KGH are asked to wear gloves , gown , procedure mask and either a face shield , an attached visor or goggles .
For aerosol-generating medical procedures , they are told to wear gloves , gown , an N95 respirator and goggles or face shield .
During intubation , the guidelines step up to gown , gloves , N95 respirator , a bouffant cap , a face shield with an attached drop or a blue pad attached to the bottom .
Gerald Evans said the current PPE guidelines at KGH are effective for keeping health-care workers safe .
Evans is the medical director of infection prevention and control with KHSC .
He 's the chair of the Division of Infectious Diseases and a professor of medicine at Queen 's University .
" Nurses are a really important group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group more important to the health and care of our population .
"  Evans -- himself married to a nurse , and with nurses in his immediate family -- reiterated that science is demonstrating that most COVID-19 infections are transmitted by large-droplet spread .
" When I say that , I 'm talking about the large droplets that are generated from the upper part of the respiratory tract , the nose and throat .
Those large droplets are expelled when coughing , sneezing or speaking and tend to fall one or two metres away from a person .
Then , gravity pulls them down .
"  Surfaces can maintain the virus if droplets are deposited and remain on that surface , and it can be transmitted if someone touches the surface and then their face .
The Ontario Nurses ' Association is asking hospitals and policy-makers to " err on the side of caution " when it comes to equipping front-line health-care workers who are coming into contact with COVID-19 patients .
Vicki McKenna is the provincial president of the ONA .
In a phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science around the transmission of COVID-19 is unclear .
" We are continuing to say to the chief medical officer of health for Ontario to please monitor and analyze the latest research coming out , saying that transmission can become borne by air , " McKenna said .
Evans said that , while there is a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine that claims to point to potential airborne transmission of COVID-19 , those findings are n't applicable in real-world transmission .
He described the findings as " completely misinterpreted " by media , the public and some health-care professionals .
" It was an artificial situation that does not exist in our normal , day-to-day lives , " he said .
" It does not in any way support airborne transmission .
That 's a complete myth and based on a misunderstanding and on rumours .
"  Evans said that , as an infectious disease specialist , the research makes sense to him .
But he understands the spread of fear and uncertainty in the face of a global pandemic .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  McKenna , a registered nurse , worked through SARS in 2003 .
She said that a number of recommendations came out in the SARS Commission , a report produced by Justice Archie Campbell in 2006 .
" What we learned , to prevent this from happening in the future , was the basic premise : if the science is n't clear , err on the side of caution and protect health-care workers and the population , " McKenna said .
" Secondly , listen to the health-care workers at the front line .
"  Listening to those concerns now is vital , McKenna said , reiterating that the ONA believes hospitals should be providing more protection .
" Everybody is in it , and wants to do the very best they can to protect their patients , co-workers and families , " she said .
" Health-care workers are the front line .
Please protect them so that they can be there to provide care and assist people .
"  In the hospital memo circulated to nursing staff , Kingston Health Sciences Centre chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our professional societies provide different PPE advice .
"  " The professional societies are obliged to provide conservative advice because they can not be aware of local situations , " Fitzpatrick wrote .
" Hence , always follow the KHSC IPAC ( infectious diseases advisory committee ) guide to PPE use , which adjusts PPE use to the specific local scenario .
"  A paper published in the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health in 2013 found that health-care workers accounted for 21 per cent of SARS infections worldwide .
The paper 's author , Moira Chan-Yeung , concluded that this prevalence of illness among health-care workers was due largely to a lack of awareness , preparedness and " poor institutional infection control measures .
"  Evans said that many significant changes in public health and hospital infrastructure have occurred since SARS .
" Changes .
emphasizing the importance of infection prevention and control were introduced after SARS , " he said .
" They have all helped with us having a better and more speedy and appropriate response to COVID-19 in 2020 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 years , and he said the concept of " erring on the side of caution " is valid .
" The principle was , until we know enough about an emerging virus , in this case COVID-19 , we do everything we can do to put in droplet precautions until we know more , " he said .
That guided the provincial government 's response with respirator recommendations , as researchers studied COVID-19 .
" We know enough now that we can get rid of that airborne precaution , " he said .
Downgrading that precaution does n't put health-care workers at risk , Evans argued .
But it does preserve PPE resources for a time when they could be needed most .
" As we expected in the onset of a pandemic , there were going to be supply issues .
All hospitals across Ontario , and Canada , are beginning to see a reduction in the supply of PPE that we have .
Here at KHSC , our No .
1 priority is to make sure we have PPE for nurses , doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " If people start using N95s for everything , not just aerosolizing procedures , we 're going to exhaust that supply much sooner than supply chains can fill that in .
"  KHSC keeps a " pandemic supply " of PPE on hand .
" But we want to make sure we use it correctly , " he said .
" This is not a sprint .
It 's a marathon .
We have to make sure we are using our PPE correctly when there is a low prevalence .
When we see higher prevalence later on , we want to have that PPE to use .
"  The KGH intensive-care unit nurse said she is seeing photos of health-care workers in China , South Korea and Italy with respirators and multiple layers of protection , and is hearing reports of health-care workers becoming ill .
" It 's very scary , especially when we 're being told that we 're overreacting and we 're fine , " she said .
" I feel like there is going to be a health-care collapse .
We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like sending soldiers to the frontline wearing T-shirts and flip-flops and expecting them to make a difference .
"  The KGH ICU nurse also believes that screening is n't being done properly at her workplace .
She worked in another hospital during SARS , and she wants to see screening at KGH done similarly : staff temperatures taken when arriving and leaving , answering screening questions , and signing and dating a screening document .
She described KGH 's staff screening as lackadaisical .
" They basically say , ' You know the drill .
Was anybody away ? Have a good shift .
' "  " We 're not even in the thick of it yet , " she said .
" I think we do n't even have any idea what we 're about to face .
"  Evans said fear in the face of pandemic is normal human behaviour .
But he wants nurses , doctors and other health-care workers to know that they " are being adequately protected .
"  " They will have the equipment where and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't believe that , it 's hard to get on top of .
I ca n't make someone believe something .
part of this requires some trust .
But when you 're fearful , that 's hard to do .
