Share :  Museum of Science transitioning to digital platform during coronavirus outbreak  BOSTON ( WHDH ) - With its doors forced to close indefinitely , Boston 's Museum of Science is going digital to keep fun and learning alive during the coronavirus emergency .
" We 've got topics dedicated to dinosaurs , mammals , lightning .
We 're going to have some science snapshots .
Those are our current science and technology , science in the news , talking about some of the things that are happening in the world .
Some exciting science stories .
We 're going to have some downloadable content .
Things like educational activities you can do at home , " staffer Eric O'Dea explained .
As expected , the transition from the exhibit halls to online was not an easy one .
" It 's been a huge challenge , " O'Dea said .
" If you had given us this as a challenge to say within two weeks go from going from being mostly a museum focused on the people who come in the front door to being to be an entirely digital museum online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to do it .
"  When the museum 's doors eventually reopen , the digital experience will not be going anywhere .
" We do n't just want to turn all of this off .
We want to transition it into having that digital museum , " he said .
" We wanted to continue our mission -- which is to educate people .
Make people feel empowered about science making it accessible to every age , in every background .
Going digital was just the next step in that .
"  The Museum of Science is also launching a fundraiser on its website called " Science Matters " where donors can chip in to keep science alive during this difficult time .
