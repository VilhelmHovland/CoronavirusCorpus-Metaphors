Lockdowns are ' forcing us to use the Internet as it was meant to be used '  " Oh , I like her , " she says , referring to a berry-toned lipstick .
Sarah Hyland , the 29-year-old funny actress best known for playing Haley Dunphy on Modern Family , is trying on makeup for an Instagram Live audience while at home riding out the pandemic , seemingly as bored as the rest of us .
It 's by no means a production : just Hyland in front of her cellphone , using an in-app filter that gives her eyeliner and oversize lashes , sitting at what looks to be a desk , weeding out her cosmetics collection .
I do n't know why I 'm watching .
" Why am I watching this ? , " one of her thousands of other viewers suddenly posts in the scrolling comments , as if from my thoughts to that person 's fingertips .
Having our normal daily lives upended by the coronavirus has heightened the demand for entertainment -- and not just Netflix  Having our normal daily lives upended by the coronavirus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We 're looking for content that provides some semblance of human connection , intermittent LOL moments to briefly escape reality .
As Kevin Roose put it in the New York Times last week , " The virus is forcing us to use the Internet as it was always meant to be used .
"  There 's also something comforting about seeing celebrities going through the same thing as everyone else , flattening the societal hierarchy so that their feeds run alongside that of our own friends and families .
Social media is a place for wholesale interaction , whether it be through memes , amateur TikTok dances , silly Snapchat snaps , Instagram boomerangs of the night 's meal or photos of the view outside , where we all suddenly wish we could be .
It 's just enough pleasant distraction ; we do n't have to commit our full attention to a 45-minute TV episode , especially when there 's already too much lonely , idle couch viewing happening because of the shelter-in-place orders .
Yearning for connection  Kantar , a consumer research firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TV viewing and social media engagement both rise by more than 60% .
( At that rate , we could quickly grow bored with apps like Netflix and Disney+ .
) The US may still be in the relatively early stages , but in Italy , one of the hardest-hit countries , Facebook said that Instagram and Facebook Live views doubled in a week .
That yearning for connection is giving more adults a window into why younger people are so amused with watching their peers and celebrities just going about their lives -- even when they appear to be doing nothing special at all .
George Costanza would love it : videos about nothing .
But if that is what 's missing from Netflix and other TV , could it be that someday it 's not ? Perhaps the future of streaming is to aggregate both studio-produced content and user-generated content in a way that allows you to seamlessly scroll between both .
That 's how we 're starting to use entertainment , but that 's not yet how it 's delivered to us .
Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a long way to go .
And Google 's YouTube is more of a video-search platform than a sit-back-and-stream service ( notwithstanding its YouTube TV subscription for live programming ) .
Quibi , a streaming app launching on 6 April , borrows from the brevity of user-generated social content , but leaves out the human-connection aspect .
It 's the brainchild of Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman , a pair of Hollywood and tech old timers , who say the name is short for " quick bites " ( though it 's pronounced " qwih-bee " ) .
All of its programmes will have episodes that are 10 minutes long or less .
Plenty have scoffed at the idea of Quibi trying to get 25- to 35-year-olds to pay US$5/month for an app with bite-size content that still contains ad interruptions .
Yet , Katzenberg and Whitman have managed to raise nearly $2-billion for the service and have struck production deals with major studios and entertainers , including Chrissy Teigen and actress Sophie Turner .
Social media used to be something college kids did on their laptops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on our phones , often while the TV is playing .
It shows that what 's missing from Netflix , Disney+ and all the other emerging streaming ecosystems is the ability to connect with one another .
