El-Zakzaky , followers are victims of state terror -- IMN  The Islamic Movement in Nigeria ( IMN ) have condemned recent comments that their leader , Sheikh Ibrahim el-Zakzaky is being tried for crimes committed in Zaria in the past , saying that he and his followers are victims of state terror .
IMN , also known as Shiites , in a statement signed by president of its Media Forum , Ibraheem Musa and read to the media by Engr .
Yunusa Lawal Monday , said that contrary to recent reports attributed to Governor Nasir el-Rufai that their leader and his followers perpetrated terror in the Zaria clash of December 2015 between IMN and the army , they were the victims of the terror orchestrated by the state .
" With increasing pressure on the Buhari regime from home and abroad occasioned by the decision of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) at The Hague to investigate the crimes against humanity committed by this regime during the Zaria Massacre of 2015 , there have been increased efforts at belittling the matter and trivialising the issues .
" This reached a peak when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he remains Kaduna governor , Sheikh Zakzaky would remain in detention .
According to the governor , Sheikh Zakzaky is being tried for crimes he and his followers committed in the last 30 years in Zaria .
" On the contrary , the Sheikh and his supporters were the victims of state terror and crimes and not the perpetrators .
After the criminal invasion of the Sheikh 's residence in December of 2015 and the subsequent killing of hundreds of his supporters , including his sons and relatives by officers and men of the Nigerian Army , the Sheikh and his wife were shot at and arrested .
" The Department of State Security ( DSS ) illegally detained them without charges until May 2018 , when the pressure on the government to release them became so intense and unbearable .
It was at that point that the government thought of charging them of inciting his followers to commit alleged offences .
"  He said before then , government had struggled to find explanation for their continued detention , forcing it to claim that the Sheikh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeenat , was keeping her husband company .
" The government arrested hundreds of members of the Sheikh Zakzaky-led Islamic Movement and put them on trial for allegedly being responsible for the death of one of the soldiers , who was accidentally shot by his colleagues .
The Kaduna High Court has cleared all of them of these framed up charges and subsequently discharged and acquitted them all .
So , what crimes is el-Rufai referring to ?  " Governor el-Rufai 's fraudulent claims that only court can free Sheikh Zakzaky pales in the face of the obvious .
Firstly , the fabricated charges of inciting , aiding and abetting brought against him ( as a ploy to perpetually keep him in detention ) have been squashed in the High and Appeal courts .
Secondly , the Federal High Court had declared his detention as unconstitutional and therefore ordered his release .
" Thirdly , even when the Kaduna High Court granted the Sheikh medical leave , el-Rufai never conceded .
He took measures to thwart the medical bail , putting stringent terms and conditions independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has no respect for the rule of law .
Justice will be served .
We will intensify our peaceful campaigns until justice is done to the victims of Zaria genocide of December , 2015 and Sheikh Zakzaky and all those still being held regain their freedom , " Ibraheem added .
