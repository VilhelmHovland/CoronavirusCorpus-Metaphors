Michael Glynn , fondly known by his colleagues as " Mick The Moan " , sadly died in St James 's Hospital on Thursday after becoming infected with the coronavirus .
His son David told Dublin Live that the 78-year-old father of six had lived an amazing life and the family had nothing but fond memories of their wonderful dad .
David said shortly after his dad 's funeral on Saturday morning : " He lived a good life and we 're thankful to have the most lovely memories of him .
" He was a loving grandfather and a brilliant dad .
