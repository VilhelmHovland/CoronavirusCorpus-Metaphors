Gerth : In the coronavirus crisis , do n't be a self-absorbed jerk on the golf course  It 's not worth it .
I do n't care if you 're in great health .
While the majority of those who are being killed by this blasted disease are older or have underlying health issues , the coronavirus is n't that discerning .
Children have died , and more and more people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing .
You are not bulletproof .
I know , you want to get out of the house and do something .
I get it .
Golf is fine .
But your buddy can stand 10 feet away from you when he brags about that drive he had on the 13th hole .
Just tell him to talk louder .
Heck , I 'm sure he wants everyone to hear how he putted from 33 feet away and had his Titleist catch the rim and drop in the cup .
Know this .
The coronavirus is n't going to be impressed at all by that shot .
And you do n't need to stand in the parking lot with a cooler full of Budweiser either .
Go home .
Recap the day with your buddies by phone or by text .
We 're more connected now than we 've ever been .
Use the technology .
CLOSE  Even after Mayor Greg Fischer called for an end to street racing , 40 to 50 people showed up to watch cars tear off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  And you people drag racing and standing around to watch .
What are you thinking ?  I watched the seventh game of the 2016 World Series the other day .
( The Cubs won again .
)  But just stop it .
First of all , those of you trying to prove that you 're a man by mashing the accelerator and trying to blow away some other jerk who uses his Dodge Charger to make up for his lack of self-confidence and other things , you 're putting yourself at risk .
Keep up with this silliness and it 's only a matter of time before someone wraps themselves around a telephone poll .
No one wants you taking up a bed in the ICU that someone who has contracted the coronavirus through no fault of their own might need .
When this is all over within a month or two or whenever , you can go back to being the self-absorbed jerk you 've always been .
You can go back to doing whatever you want , whenever you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But until then , keep your distance .
Do n't spread this thing around .
Act as if your life depends on it .
Because it does .
Better yet , just stay home .
And do n't be a jerk about it .
