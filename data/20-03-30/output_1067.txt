Does anyone have news from their own neighbourhood homeless people on the streets ? There are still around a dozen on the streets of worthing and I do n't know how local councils are supposed to cope without funding from central government .
we could stop calling them rough sleepers .
It 's a term that masks the grim reality of their lives .
Spain it 's on its knees because of football fans returning from Italy .
has publicly declared that you can infect just 2-3 people if you 're sick and go to a football match/concert .
yes , he knows what he 's talking about .
You are quoting R4 interpretation of his comment , rather than his actual comments .
Listen to what he says - the level of immunity in a population is absolutely crucial to policy decisions for any government in any epidemic  Given the recent record of UK Foreign Ministers of failing to do anything or making matters worse ( Johnson did both ) - its hardly a great surprise and we 're better off going to ask the Germans for help  Try those on the NHS front line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be facetious the government 's doing as bad as Trump .
not to be quite the clown when you 're trying to be smart .
For the last week or two I have been watching these evening presss conferences with mounting panic , not once have I got the impression that the govenment is got on top of the problem .
Today for example we have learnt that the Foreign Secretary is still negotiating to get British nationals returned , those stranded overseas include a number of doctors and nurses .
Yesterday Gove lied over the already low number of people being tested and we still have nurses without sufficient PPE plus these people who are on the front line are not being tested .
No panic we 've only lost 25% of our doctors .
Then there is the news that we do n't have enough ventiators and were offered 25,000 of them but did n't get back to the supplier who went elsewhere .
stories are just from the weekend .
The government has been an utter shambles .
From the begining with the u-turns and fumbls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
People are being thrown out of hotels and onto the street .
Some have been placed in dreadful situations .
We expect our Embassies and governments to bring people home at a time of crisis like this .
That is their job .
Those flights are not for free .
They never are , with any Government .
In fact , they often cost a small fortune , and if you do n't have the cash , you 'll be in debt to the Gov at a juicy interest rate .
To be fair , all Governments like to make such missions look like Dunkirk , Also , the organisation and liaison effort necessary to charter the planes and the slots require serious effort and thus generate cost .
But the passengers have to pay for their seats and luggage .
The whole idea that " herd immunity " was a UK policy came from interviews with Vallance .
He was talking about general strategy in epidemics - the type of thing you typed above - rather than a specific UK policy .
People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then changed .
It was a spectacular failure in communication , rather than a failure in policy .
The overall UK policy has indeed been informed by science and , given the huge unknowns that still exist , was and is pretty sound .
Every Tuesday the statistics authority will provide a backdated weekly count of all suspected coronavirus deaths of people who have died in their homes , care homes or hospices which will be published in a combined form with the figures drawn from daily death toll announced by the NHS in England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland .
The figures will be backdated to the previous week , starting with the week ending 20 March .
It will include the ages of the people who died and give a regional breakdown .
It will be very interesting to see how things pan out in Sweden bearing in mind their very relaxed approach to the virus .
It guess that the government may feel and look a little foolish and cavalier if the daily death toll starts to escalate .
Saying that , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations .
