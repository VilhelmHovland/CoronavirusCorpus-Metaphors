How the LinkedIn community is shifting in the face of COVID-19  ' A tree that does n't bend in a storm will break ' is a true idiom for the current COVID-19 crisis .
Everyone is impacted in some way and are experiencing varying degrees of pain and vulnerability .
Social media and businesses are the trees that are flailing and trying to adapt to a storm which has totally blindsided them .
The world has changed within a matter of weeks and shaken the shit out of all of us ( no pun intended there regarding toilet paper-gate ) .
We are reviewing everything !  As many will know , I have strong views on what is good and poor LinkedIn practice .
I have little time for fluff and sharing **27;1606;TOOLONG content as LinkedIn holds a unique business value proposition and experience promise .
So , a few weeks ago , I wrote an article for SmartCompany on how and why LinkedIn should stay in its social media lane and not try to be everything to everyone .
But that article just does n't feel right for right now with the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beliefs for the time being .
My new question is : ' What the hell does it really matter right now what people are posting and doing on LinkedIn ( as long it is not illegal , rude or unethical , of course ) ? '  So why the change of heart ? LinkedIn is a community of business , brands and most importantly human beings .
As the crisis continues , people will be spending more time on the platform seeking to contribute and engage from their own needs and perspectives .
Dwell time and a desire to gain knowledge , new networks and learning will skyrocket .
As will the need to find solace , support and encouragement .
Albeit in the general ethos of content which will educate , entertain and enlighten .
But I will now add another E : ' emotional connection ' .
And what that will look and feel like for one will be very different from another .
Anxiety , fear of the unknown and human nature is very raw at the moment and people will respond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup .
And this is why I am taking a different stance on what people should or should n't do on LinkedIn at the moment .
Compassion and thoughtfulness have never been more important .
It does take enormous courage and willpower not to respond with anger .
We are actually being given an opportunity to show the best of us right now .
Dr Delia McCabe , a neuroscientist specialising in the neurobiology of stress and its physiological effects , wrote in a recent article on COVID-19 : " Feeling stressed is normal .
However , psychological stress impacts immune function , so managing the stress we 're feeling is critically important if we want our immune system to function optimally .
Stop reading everything you can find about the challenge on social media and before you post anything , think about whether you are helping or hindering others with your post .
"  Members will resonate and seek different types of content and networking opportunities .
What is considered trash to one , will be treasure to another .
Everyone will be engaging with and posting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many ways to tailor that to individual taste and needs .
Fulfilling needs and feeling valued and respected are human needs which are key to minimising stress .
What is happening on LinkedIn now ?  As with the bushfire response , the broader community has come to the table and engaged .
From heads of business , government ministers , PMs , industry leaders , scientists , The World Health Organisation and NPOs , the conversations and content is diverse and robust .
Webinars , free services offered , support , updates , encouragement and sharing is bountiful .
The community broadly here in Australia is coming to the fore with value .
We are all indeed globally experiencing the same issues and this is a first .
Indeed lockdowns and business stress and opportunities in Canada or Singapore are felt similarly in Australia .
There is a wide focus and mix of attitudes : from the hyper-motivational to a deeper malaise and back to factual and collegiate community support .
Many , of course , are continuing as business as usual and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue as their modus operandi now .
There is a swag of content about how to work from home and strategies to navigate remote management and systems  For the first time in many years , there has been of course new hashtags ( #coronavirus , #covid19 ) .
Existing , well-established hashtags have seen increased followers and content ( such as mental health and remote work ) .
Many outstanding posts also with important messages and a humour image to lighten the mood and some really awesome PDF document shares of valuable content and information .
A few tips  Everyone is on the optimism bandwagon of getting your business and LinkedIn geared and ready for when the crisis is over .
Indeed it 's true as the seeds now will sprout later when life starts to return to normal(ish) again .
So here are a few pointers .
LinkedIn profile .
Get it in tip-top shape .
Focus on the future which is a given to position your career or business anyhow .
Content expertise .
Share and write now .
If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job-seeker or business owner , share that expertise .
By doing so , it will not just position your own value and build your digital footprint , but it will help others too .
And write more for your own website and other niche medias .
Step out and do n't hide .
Do n't be shy .
Reach out and connect to those who you can support , and or can support you , or both ways .
This is the time to stand out with integrity so personalise everything with purpose .
When the pubs and cafes open again , people remember who to ask for a beer or coffee .
Yes , have some fun , please .
Nothing helps and supports in stress and uncertainty more than a laugh .
Add funny photos , videos , share that pet at home on your laptop .
Get the dopamine and serotonin flowing .
Motivation .
Check your motivation of why you are posting , not how or what .
Good intent is like a boomerang of reciprocation .
Self-aggrandisement and posing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Share the human that is behind the career and business hood .
For those who have the courage to share their truth ( in a relevant and appropriate way ) there are hundreds that will be encouraged .
The fact is many will be suffering enormously and others less so .
While you do n't want a pity party , you do want to reach out for the help you need at this time .
Empowerment comes with sharing and contributing help .
Future strategy .
Really take a hard look at your ideal niche and business model .
A must-read on this is from global marketing authority Mark Schaefer .
Spam ham .
Ok , despite what I said about anything goes to help with stress , engagement and human value , there is one caveat .
No one ever likes the spam and ham of sell sell sell .
Enough said !  Hashtags .
Be really mindful of how you use hashtags and do n't use more than four per post .
Check the follower numbers to check for the best reach .
For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas #workingfromhome has only 1,780 .
A plea to LinkedIn  As mentioned at the beginning , what we post and how we engage on LinkedIn needs to bend with the crisis .
But what should not bend and indeed clamped down on harder is unethical , illegal and downright gaming practices that can damage member 's visibility and their valuable content .
Please LinkedIn , get really serious about removing the fake international syndicate engagement pods , lempods , international click farms of paid likes , comments and fake followers .
These compromise the platform and more so the opportunity of content and members to be given equal and fair distribution organically .
The creator side optimisation program to give more weight to ' normal members ' versus ' influencers ' does n't appear to have made a sizeable difference .
You created an amazing global community platform that is much needed , more so now than ever before .
Do what 's right and not just what adds to the metrics and revenue .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , .
