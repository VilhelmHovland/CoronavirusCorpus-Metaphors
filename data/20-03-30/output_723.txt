LOUIS -- There is no sign of a dip in coronavirus cases in St .
Louis or Missouri .
The region 's caseload is rocketing upward , with the state seeing a more than 600% increase in total cases over the past week -- the largest percentage increase in the country as of Thursday , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of widespread testing largely means that experts are n't sure when the region will reach the peak of its curve -- clouding their ability to know when normal life might resume .
They hope they will be able to better predict in coming days how much protective measures , like social distancing and widespread restrictions on public activities , are working .
The spread of the virus in Missouri this past week stands out , even compared to neighbors .
In Illinois , where the state is under lockdown , the number of confirmed cases grew by 237% in the same period .
" The more we test right now , the more we 'll find , " said Chris Prener , a sociologist at St .
Louis University .
As of Thursday , Missouri 's per-capita rate for confirmed COVID-19 cases was 8 .
per 100,000 people .
In Illinois , it was 20 per 100,000 .
" Testing is everything right now , and the lack of widespread testing is making it very hard to grasp what 's happening , particularly at the county levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday that if area residents continue to comply with stay-at-home orders and other restrictions , the regional spread of the coronavirus could slow by mid-to-late April .
She said she talked with the heads of the area 's three major hospital systems Thursday .
" They are all doing modeling for when will the peak hit , " she said .
" They do n't know for sure .
"  " It just really depends on how much the stay-at-home order , how much it actually flattens the curve .
"  The rise here  Infiltration of the virus here is catching up with infection rates seen in other states , erasing St .
Louis ' geographic buffer , experts theorized .
And increased testing has detected more cases .
" Rapid growth of COVID cases in Missouri is rather a function of test availability and probably is not reflective of what true growth of ( the ) epidemic is , " said Dr .
George Turabelidze , Missouri 's state public health epidemiologist .
Still , recent events like Mardi Gras may have added fuel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the celebration is thought to have sparked one of the world 's leading surges in the spread of the virus .
Such large public events can multiply infections , many of which wo n't be discovered for as many as 14 days , the time it can take for symptoms to appear .
" The exponential growth is n't going to be for two or three incubation periods , " said Tim Wiemken , a St .
Louis University professor and infectious disease expert .
" That 's what we 're seeing in New Orleans , is they 're just starting to see the huge bump .
"  Data could soon reveal the extent to which the virus is slowing or coming under control , as new infections are stemmed by social distancing and other precautions -- at least at a national level .
Wiemken and some colleagues are focused on mortality rates , suggesting that with scarce testing , they 're one of the clearest reflections of the disease and its most serious toll .
Based on the progression of coronavirus death rates seen elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get to the peak of its own curve soon -- perhaps in the coming days -- and will then see levels of the disease recede to a more manageable pace .
In earlier outbreaks of the virus , the resulting death rates tended to rise and fall over about 30 days .
Assuming that the U .
will experience its own bell curve of the same length , the country is now about halfway through that window -- meaning the national volume of deaths per day could soon crest and start to subside .
" We 're still on the left third of the bell curve , currently .
How long it takes to get to the plateau , hopefully that 's in the next week , " said Wiemken .
" Locally , I have no idea .
"  The " attack rate " of the virus -- which shows the proportion of the local population that is infected -- offers another snapshot of risk .
In the St .
Louis region , for example , coronavirus currently infects about 1 in every 10,000 people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 times greater .
Hospitalization rates are another vital area to track .
" It will be very interesting to follow the curve of the hospitalizations over the next two to four weeks , " said Dr .
Elvin Geng , a professor of medicine in Washington University 's Division of Infectious Diseases .
" That may be some hint about where we are with the size of the underlying epidemic .
"  Turabelidze said the state , unlike regional hospitals , has n't produced a model " good enough " to predict the rise and fall of the virus in Missouri .
" All these parameters are unpredictable , and therefore it 's very hard to have a model that we all agree is very accurate , " he said .
Area researchers generally agreed .
" We do n't know what 's going on , " said Wiemken .
" It 's not even the tip of the iceberg of what we know .
It 's like the tip of Jupiter .
"  30 days  Experts warn that deciphering the trajectory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply watching the overall total of confirmed cases .
As more testing is done , it will be difficult to sort out how many new cases reflect transmission of the disease , and how many are the result of more widespread sampling .
And when the shape of the curve comes into focus , it still wo n't reflect the current level of the threat , thanks to the two- to 14-day lag time from when infection occurs and when symptoms show up .
" When we perceive it , we 're behind , " said Dr .
Gregory Storch , a pediatrics professor and infectious disease specialist at Washington University 's School of Medicine .
" If we 're going by cases , we 're reacting to events that happened one to two weeks earlier , and that is a challenge .
"  From this stage forward , it 's all about minimizing the spread of the disease to as few people as possible , or what some call the basic reproductive rate of the virus .
" If every case gives rise to less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its own , " said Geng .
" But if each case gives rise to more than one , then the epidemic will propagate .
"  Multiple experts said the fight against the coronavirus , even if initially successful , could resemble more of a roller coaster over time , with later , smaller peaks and valleys .
" There are gradations in the way we 'll go back to normal , " said Ana Santos Rutschman , a St .
Louis University professor with a focus on health law .
She says those plans need to be crafted well in advance by public health experts , and clearly communicated to the public .
Before that " exit strategy " begins , there will also need to be safeguards in place , such as widespread testing capacity and ready-made plans to intervene again , if needed .
" We 're going to be ready to push the button and get back to where we are now , " said Wiemken , who hopes that " tailored relaxing " of current restrictions can happen in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier .
" There is light at the end of the tunnel if we can just keep this up a little bit longer , " said Wiemken .
" If we ease up now , it will just keep spiking until everybody 's infected .
