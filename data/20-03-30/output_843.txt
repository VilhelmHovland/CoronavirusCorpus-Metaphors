My ex and I share custody of our three kids equally .
Because he is an ER nurse and is now working more than usual , we agreed the kids would just stay with me until this is all over .
The only problem with that is the finances .
I am a consultant and can generally work from pretty much anywhere .
But , now I am trying to work from home while " home schooling " three elementary school-age kids , one of whom has an IEP .
In the last two weeks , I have gone from billing on average eight hours per day to an average of 2 .
Because our incomes are almost equal , there is no child support order .
I asked my ex to pay me some voluntary support during this time frame until I can resume working .
He declined saying he is risking his life every day and thus doing his part while I get to stay home and play with the kids .
Clearly , he is stressed but he is putting an unfair burden on me .
I have enough of a nest egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food .
But it seems unfair that I should have to solely bear the financial burden here .
I understand the court is closed except for emergencies , which this really is n't , but do I have any options ?  Prepare a complaint for modification stating with the change in circumstances being you are now the sole custodial parent during this pandemic .
If you have an email or text confirming this agreement , attach it as an exhibit .
Also state that your income has dropped significantly while your ex is working longer hours and therefore likely earning more .
Ask for child support to be ordered retroactive to the date of your complaint for modification through the duration of this temporary changed circumstances .
Realize we are in somewhat unchartered waters here .
Normally , you would be issued a summons and you could request the increase retroactive to the date the summons is served .
Because you will not get a summons from the court right away and by the time you get to court for a hearing , your regular parenting plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your retroactive request .
Mail a copy of the complaint to your ex when you send it to the court .
Include a letter asking that he re-consider his position because you really are not interested in a fight , but you can not be the sole parent to kids who have no school , teach them , and work full time so your income has dropped precipitously while your bills have gone up because the kids are there all the time .
When the courts re-open , you will need to get a hearing date for a motion to establish support .
If your ex has n't stepped up to make voluntary payments by that point , mail him a copy of your motion giving him notice of the hearing and hope for a sympathetic judge .
