Covid-19 hurts the vulnerable most .
So does Brexit  Eve Hepburn  March 30th , 2020  Covid-19 hurts the vulnerable most .
So does Brexit  It is already clear that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will dwarf that of Brexit .
Yet both disproportionately affect the vulnerable .
Eve Hepburn ( PolicyScribe ) explains why .
When the Scottish government published my report on the Social and Equality Impacts of Brexit at the end of January 2020 , Covid-19 appeared to be a far-off problem in a distant land .
My aim at that point was to map out some of the potential effects of different types of Brexit on our most vulnerable individuals and communities .
I hoped this would be a valuable exercise , especially for public sector and third-sector organisations supporting equalities groups , given the absence of a detailed Equalities Impact Assessment from the UK Government .
The report identified 137 potential ' impacts ' on equalities groups , ranging from the loss of specific legal rights and benefits resulting from EU legislation , to wider impacts on people 's jobs and quality of life , due to projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with Europe now the epicentre of the pandemic , the focus of the UK and devolved governments has dramatically changed .
While the potential impacts of Brexit on equalities groups remains an ongoing concern , the greatest risk to the wellbeing of vulnerable groups in the UK -- and indeed around the world -- comes from Covid-19 .
Importantly , the impacts of coronavirus do n't just result from the spread of the disease itself ( in medical terms ) , but also the government 's response to the pandemic -- which has wider social and economic implications .
Social and equalities impacts of Brexit  The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020 .
However , after three and a half years of debate since the 2016 referendum , there remains a lack of clarity about what the UK 's future relationship with the EU will look like .
In February 2020 , the UK government published its negotiating approach , which confirmed its intention to pursue a basic free trade agreement ( FTA ) focussed on trade in goods with the EU .
While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , it seeks full control over UK regulations .
The aim is to obtain a Canada-style FTA , plus side deals on fisheries , data , judicial cooperation , transport and energy .
This is not the comprehensive trade agreement outlined in the non-binding Political Declaration signed by the UK and EU in October 2019 .
In particular , the UK mandate rejects the ' level playing field ' commitments of the Political Declaration and any role for the European Court of Justice in the UK .
The UK government has stated its intention to complete a trade agreement with the EU by the end of the 11-month transition period , i .
31 December 2020 , and that it does not plan to extend the transition period by up to two years ( which it may request up to June 2020 ) .
To keep to this tight schedule , the government announced that negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship will continue , but they would be conducted online due to the coronavirus .
Talks have since been suspended .
Despite this , the government maintains that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  While Brexit will undoubtedly bring long-term systemic changes to the UK economy , politics and society , and there continues to be uncertainty about how leaving the EU might affect the lives of the UK 's inhabitants , the government has not yet produced a full equalities impact assessment examining the potential legal and socioeconomic effects of Brexit on different groups of people .
This leaves a significant gap in our understanding : it is highly likely that vulnerable groups will be affected , and that there will be unintended consequences .
To that end , the Scottish Government commissioned research to map out potential impacts of different types of Brexit on social and equalities groups .
It asked : what effect might the UK 's decision to leave the EU have on the legal rights and protections of individuals and groups in Scotland/the UK ? Should Brexit have a negative economic impact , what might this mean for people 's jobs , spending and access to public services ? These questions were examined from the perspective of 20 equalities groups who may face discrimination as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities , migrants , people who are or were in care , the elderly , religious communities , children and young people , the homeless and women .
The report identified 137 potential social impacts across such groups , including the loss of legal rights , employment protections , funding opportunities , healthcare rights , access to public services , community tensions , and -- especially in the case of a no-deal Brexit -- impacts on food , fuel and medicines .
While some of these impacts reflect similar trends ( e .
the loss of certain rights/services ) , they are distinct in terms of how they happen , who they affect , or both .
The research also included three case studies , providing an in-depth analysis of the potential social impacts of Brexit on women , ethnic minorities , and the disabled .
If the majority of economic forecasts are correct and the UK 's economy suffers post-Brexit , the negative effects will have an impact on all those equalities groups disproportionately represented in the low-income bracket ( i .
women , ethnic minorities , the disabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in care , precarious workers ) who rely more on public services and benefits and have less disposable income and spending power .
For those living in poverty or homeless , or suffering job losses , these impacts will also be deeply felt .
Brexit has already affected the mental health of these groups -- due to the stress and uncertainty it has created -- and for some , Brexit has resulted in increased hate crimes and discrimination .
Legally , Brexit will see the loss of the EU-derived rights and protections these groups currently enjoy , such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which guarantees a freestanding right to non-discrimination .
People will no longer have recourse to the rulings and case law of the European Court of Justice .
Equalities groups are likely to lose EU funding ( in particular , the European Social Fund ) .
Everyone will lose their European citizenship ( including free movement and access to EU consular protection ) , access to EU institutions and programmes ( i .
Erasmus , Horizon , European Medicines Agency , European Centre for Disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protections that are not transposed into domestic law or which may come to an end ( i .
the European Health Insurance Card ) .
How far these will be affected depends on the closeness of the future UK-EU relationship , trade agreements with other countries , and the UK 's post-Brexit policy agenda .
Social and equalities impacts of the coronavirus  The primary impact of Covid-19 is , needless to say , on the physical health of individuals .
Research published by the government shows that elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions are especially at risk of severe disease and death .
But the effects are not just physical : pre-existing mental health conditions , such as anxiety , depression and OCD , may find their symptoms increase with the stress , uncertainty and enforced isolation caused by the pandemic .
People who must self-isolate -- especially elderly people -- may struggle .
Those whose income is cut or who lose their jobs may suffer stress and anxiety as a result , and those who are already disadvantaged will find it even harder .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they may not be able to claim sick pay or earn if they have to self-isolate , and they are more at risk of being let go if businesses need to pull in their purse strings .
Homeless people are among the most at risk , with individuals more likely to have underlying health conditions , but without the means to self-isolate and secure their basic needs for food , shelter and sanitation .
Some foodbanks have already reported shortages due to panic buying .
People who can not afford to bulk-buy or pay more for food in short supply are at a disadvantage .
Renters  Disadvantaged groups are also more reliant on the NHS ( which is already under considerable pressure ) and less able to access private treatment .
These groups are also likely to be more reliant on public transport , which has been reduced in recent days , to do their food shopping because they have a lower rate of private car ownership .
People caring for elderly and other vulnerable people affected by the coronavirus -- who tend to be women -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder for them to work .
Meanwhile , those being cared for -- including disabled people , elderly people and care leavers -- may be deprived of vital care in the coming months due to a clause in the emergency Coronavirus Bill , which temporarily removes the legal duty of local authorities to provide social care to those eligible .
Finally , some minority ethnic communities -- especially East Asians -- have experienced increased racism and xenophobia since the outbreak .
Conclusion  Brexit and the coronavirus -- despite being wildly different phenomena -- will probably affect the disadvantaged in similar ways , albeit to a different extent .
Indeed , Brexit is likely to exacerbate some of the effects of the virus .
The fact of leaving the EU will make it more difficult to fight the pandemic .
For instance , the UK has said that it will not seek to maintain membership of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDP ) , which oversees the surveillance of communicable diseases , including coronaviruses ; the European Medical Agency ( EMA ) , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU Clinical Trials Register .
According to a report published by the Scottish Parliament , this means that UK patients may not be able to participate in EU-organised clinical trials for life-saving new drug treatments , and the UK could experience delays in accessing new drugs .
The UK is now being excluded from EU decision-making -- and any collective support packages , for instance the EU 's Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative -- on the pandemic .
The loss of EU nationals working in the health and social care sector since the EU referendum , at a time when they are most needed , is particularly unfortunate .
People who face multiple disadvantage and inequality -- with less financial and social resilience -- are most vulnerable to both Brexit and the coronavirus .
Measures should be taken not only to protect the health of our most vulnerable communities , but also their quality of life more broadly -- including their financial security , mental health , access to resources , and social relationships .
Time will tell if the Chancellor 's response to the outbreak will be sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the views of the author and not those of the Brexit blog , nor LSE .

As times pass it will gradually dawn on people in the UK and mainly England that they were duped .
They will realise that there is no evidence of Europe or the EU being full of bad people .
They will realise that the EU concept was a good idea , and to make it work well one must have an open-minded and constructive approach .
They will realise that the negatives they were told about the EU were clever slogans or distortions of the truth .
You may guess that I am a Remain supporter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed and I see the best hope for my country is to stick together and eventually re-join the EU , ( if they will have us ) so that we can be part of the good influence in the world represented by the EU .
I mainly support the EU because it is the best bet for the principles we mostly claim to support .
Our government claims to support the same principles but clearly does n't .
Our present government considers that the end justifies the means , and the end is power .
Despite being more concerned with principles I had hoped to get the attention of Leave supporters by pointing out that life had indeed taken a turn downwards in many ways following Brexit , as forecast by Remainers .
I imagined that the downturn would be blamed on Remainers , the EU being intransigent , our politicians , anything but Brexit .
Now , unfortunately everything will be blamed on the virus ! Brexit is an exhibition of nationalism , which has elements , sometimes unconscious elements , of tribalism , of selfishness , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be considerate of others , to realise we are , to varying degrees dependent on each other , at many levels .
Conception of the EU=1955 by jean monnet and walter hallstein , based on the coal and steel treaty .
where is the coal industry today verses nuclear fission and fusion ? where is most of the steel made today ? europe or china ? just off the production line was the AUSTIN A40 the year the EU was thought out 1955- we were all told we wouldnt have to work much because of robots doing the heavy lifting , and we would have flying cars everywhere like the jetsons in 50 years .
so where are they ? fantasy .
Just like the EU .
A Fantasy hijacked by those wishing to milk the plum jobs in the center of it all , and hijacked by multinationals wanting to turn Europe into a factory for their own profit , whilst vaunting some kind of socialist utopia for the " people " ( sic ) Name one similar project that has worked in modern history ? none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
just because the Austin A40 was a top of the range car , with all modern convieniances and technology in ' 55 , does nt mean it is today .
1955-2020 the world is a different place today , where was china in 1955 ? a massive production and manufacturing powerhouse ? the EU was birthed for the 50s and its place its rightly reserved for the scrapyard .
