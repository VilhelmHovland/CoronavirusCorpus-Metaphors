It 's just a guess .
" The issue is that we do n't have any real good data on how the sales tax is going to be impacted and how it 's going to ripple through us , " Hamilton County Administrator Jeff Aluotto told The Enquirer .
" We 're shooting at a moving target now .
"  To prepare , the county is asking officeholders to find a way to make 20 percent cuts across the board in the county 's $276 million budget .
No one with the county could say at this point .
It 'll be up to the individual elected officeholders to come up with a plan to present to the three county commissioners .

Aluotto would n't speculate on how the county would do that .
" We 'll have to look at that if it happens , " Aluotto said .
Bruggen asked the department head to come up with a plan to make 20 percent cuts by April 7 .
