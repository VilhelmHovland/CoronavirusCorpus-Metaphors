SA mining faces 15% production knock in 2020 as it prepares for national lockdown  SOUTH Africa 's mining sector could suffer direct production losses of 8% of annual output as a result of the 21-day lockdown due to start at midnight on Thursday .
This is according to a report by Nedbank Securities precious metals analyst , Arnold van Graan , who estimates that total production losses in 2020 could be between 10% and 15% of annual output including the time taken to ramp-up mines to steady-state production .
Based on the experience of post-strike activity , restarting mines after a prolonged shutdown can be a lengthy process .
In some cases , certain marginal or loss-making shafts in the precious metals industry may not open again once the lock-down ends , he said .
The lockdown was ordered by South African president , Cyril Ramaphosa , on March 23 in an effort to contain the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus in the country .
Sibanye-Stillwater would be cursing its look insofar as its gold division had only recently recovered from a four-month strike in 2018/19 .
Similarly , Gold Fields ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new production targets and generating positive cash flow after years of burning cash .
It would be pushed back on its heels somewhat .
South Deep generated net cash of R221m and produced 222,100 ounces of gold against a target of about 180,000 oz in its 2019 financial year .
Gold Fields has guided to production of 256,000 oz for the current financial year and has locked in gold sales for 75% of that production at 702,000 per kilogram ( against a spot price of R751,000/kg ) .
It was likely that hedged production -- which is also significant at Harmony Gold -- would be rolled over by the counter-parties , said Van Graan .
Of the platinum group metal producers , Sibanye-Stillwater was the most protected against the South African lockdown as about 30% of its production was from the US whilst another 5% was derived from its Zimbabwean operations , said Van Graan .
Royal Bafokeng Platinum and Northam Platinum -- both engaged in capital intensive projects -- would show the largest free cash flow impacts as a result of the shutdown .
Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normalised levels .
Back on the gold side , AngloGold Ashanti and Gold Fields had the least exposure to South Africa , comprising 7% and 9% of total production respectively .
Harmony Gold was almost entirely reliant ( 88% ) on the performance of its South African gold mines .
SOLACE  However , there are some solaces to take , said Van Graan .
One comfort is that South Africa 's mining sector is experienced at managing the impact of disruption as a result of strikes or community disruptions , or when fatal accidents occur .
" All mining companies , therefore , have detailed emergency and contingency plans in place to mitigate the impact of a prolonged shutdown , " he said .
" We , therefore , expect the companies to put measures in place to limit some of the fixed-cost spending during this shutdown .
We also expect capex cuts .
"  Another positive was that at a time of decreased industrial demand globally , less platinum was being delivered into the market unlike the events after the 2019 economic crisis when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the shut-down , RMB Morgan Stanley 's analysts said the South African government 's implementation of a shutdown was stricter than in other countries where there was a significant mining sector .
In Chile and Peru , the respective governments had asked mining industries to continue operating but to de-densify themselves in respect of work practices .
In South Africa , the total shutdown was severe , but it was leavened with exemptions .
Allowing smelters and other metal processing to continue -- such as South32 's aluminium facilities in KwaZulu-Natal province -- as well as allowing some exports of goods supplied from inventories ( not production ) would assist the sector in delivering into contracts and avoid excessive working capital build up .
But export leniency ought to be extended without fear of compromising the national effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic , said RMB Morgan Stanley .
" Most export channels are highly mechanised and automated and those minerals help to balance the country 's terms of trade , " it said .
