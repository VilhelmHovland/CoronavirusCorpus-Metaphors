Catalysts That Have Acquired Post Pandemic Durability in India and the US  Toning down  What will the world look like after the coronavirus induced shut down ?  I am not in possession of a crystal for global survey but I can activate my intuition on the basis of two stories I have covered .
I was in the US for the 2016 Presidential elections and I have followed the 2020 drama within the Democratic Party .
In both the campaigns Democrats have been in convulsions not to select a nominee but to keep out the one they do not want -- Bernie Sanders .
And now they are all mimicking the Sanders platform .
The coronavirus has brought out in bold relief , the idea of Bernie Sanders as the panacea for the general distress .
The platform the senator from Vermont stood on was total anathema to the great American establishment , its soul torn between Mammon and Joe McCarthy .
The pandemic has brought the powerful establishment to its knees .
People now matter and democracy begins to look like one .
Neither the democrats nor the republicans will ever mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But they are all furtively lifting the Sanders manifesto .
The idea of Sanders in today 's context is larger than the possible nomination of Joe Biden .
In the Indian context , the idea of Shaheen Bagh , has likewise acquired a post pandemic , durability .
The statement issued by " Shaheen Bagh protests " speaks for itself .
" As we continue our struggle to be heard by our government , we wish to reiterate that we have merely suspended public gatherings , our movement is on .
We will use other means to continue to resist CAA , NPR , NRC .
For our detractors , it would be a sobering exercise to compare our protests with any in recent history .
"  " Shaheen Bagh all over the country now soars with our strong resolve and blooms in our hearts .
Each one of us is now a Shaheen Bagh .
"  The authors of the statement , from protest sites across the country , sign off with " Inquilab " , which means " revolution " , a term Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
And in the American context , revolutionary his platform is : Medicare for all , $15 an hour as minimum wages , expanding social security , no tuition fees , housing for everyone who needs it .
" Does this list sound all that outlandish in the time of coronavirus ? What explains the eruption of hashtags , and twitters : " We deserve Sanders .
"  This chant by the voters in total defiance of the Democratic establishment is not surprising .
I shall never forget the banners in Philadelphia explaining why Trump won .
" If you make Bernie Sanders impossible , you make Trump inevitable .
"  It was a prescient statement .
During the 2016 campaign as in 2020 when Sanders was on a roll , he had sensed the electorate 's mood .
It was totally against the Washington centered establishment .
While Sanders was hammering away at the Establishment from the Left , Donald Trump was doing exactly the same from the Right .
When even Jeb Bush failed the nomination bid , the Trump candidacy seemed inevitable .
At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let the cat out of the bag .
" Let 's support Hillary Clinton then " , she squealed .
In other words , the Bush family , the central column of the Republicans , sees Hillary Clinton as a member of the same club which goes under the label " Washington Establishment " .
The same discredited Establishment that electorates everywhere are disgusted by .
They find themselves hemmed in by two party systems serving the same corporate interests .
Even though it was universally accepted that Hillary Clinton was untrustworthy , indeed a liar , the Democratic party hierarchy chose to keep its corporate interests in humour even if it meant electoral defeat .
Three months before the 2016 election , film maker Michael Moore was prescient .
" This election is only about who gets out to vote , who gets the most rabid supporters -- the kind of candidate who inspires people to get out of bed at 5 .
on election day because a wall needs to be built .
Muslims are killing us ! Women are taking over ! First in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those who vote for Clinton are those who would do so only to keep Trump out .
They are not running towards someone they love ; they are running away from someone they dislike .
" Therefore personal persuasion on a large level was required and it was n't available to Clinton .
" Those depressed at Bernie having been grounded would need extraordinary persuasion to walk to the polling booths to vote for Hillary .
"  Had the Democratic Establishment learnt a lesson from their 2016 reversal , they would have seen the popular surge for Sanders as an asset .
But they have once again produced a candidate ( most likely ) whom Laura Bush from the other side of the aisle would reach out to in preference to Trump .
It is a compelling speculation : would Laura Bush and the Democratic establishment have acquiesced in Trump rather than risk American capitalism in the hands of a Democratic Socialist ?  And now look at the alchemy of coronavirus : even Trump is dusting up measures which Prof .
Jean Cohen , a political theory expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not free market capitalism .
" She offers descriptive choices : " regulated capitalism ; interventionist state or Democratic Socialism .
" Private profit making is making way for policies which serve the public good .
"  Ed Murrow , the great CBS reporter , had single handedly , and successfully taken on Senator Joseph McCarthy 's witch hunt against Americans who deviated from raw capitalism .
Has Bernie Sanders altered the terms of the socialism-capitalism debate in the very citadel of capitalism ?  In the same way , an apolitical movement spontaneously evolving at Shaheen Bagh , has the potential to tone down the shrill tenor of Indian politics .
Coronavirus has cast a pall on all our lives but , as Shakespeare said , " There is a soul of goodness in all things evil , would men observingly distil it out .
