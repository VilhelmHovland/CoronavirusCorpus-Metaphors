See below for graphics of the newly posted COVID-19 numbers by the Virginia Department of Health .
So , at this point ( 3/30 ) , in Virginia we 're at 1,020 total reported cases , 136 hospitalizations and 25 deaths from COVID-19 .
The number of reported cases went up 130 ( +15% ) in the latest statistics , which is a slightly slower rate of increase than the day before , when reported cases were up 151 ( +20% ) .
As for hospitalizations , they went up 24 ( +21% ) , from 112 to 136 , which is a somewhat *faster* rate of increase than the previous day ( which was up 13 , or +13% ) .
Deaths went up 3 ( from 22 to 25 ) , compared to an increase of 5 ( from 17 to 22 ) the previous day .
So overall , not great news , particularly on the number of deaths -- although it *does* appear that the rates of growth in reported cases might be slowing -- but hopefully this curve will really start flattening out in coming days if we keep up the social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a LOT more testing capacity , PPE , etc .
