ECB On Verge Of Calling Off The Hundred This Year  The England &amp; Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) is on the verge of postponing the inaugural edition of their ambitious project The-Hundred due to the coronavirus pandemic .
The franchise-driven 100-ball tournament was set to take place this year but is now under a huge doubt as the pandemic has taken a huge toll on sports across the globe .
All the international and major domestic events are already cancelled as cricket boards around the world have joined the fight against the pandemic .
Earlier this month , the ECB recalled the England team from Sri Lanka where they were set to play a two-match Test series .
According to the Times of India , a decision on The Hundred is waiting to be taken anytime soon and formal announcements can be expected between now and the next few weeks .
The Hundred is ECB 's dream project , one that was first unveiled in April 2018 , playing conditions confirmed in February 2019 and the player draft taking place the same October .
" The ECB heads had internally discussed postponing The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the COVID-19 outbreak .
At that time , it seemed like a realistic approach .
What seems more realistic right now is posting The Hundred to 2021 .
The current situation leaves ECB with no better choice , " sources told the news outlet .
The Hundred ( Credits : Twitter )  The condition due to the pandemic is very alarming in the UK .
The English Premier League is already suspended while the Wimbledon is also looking set to suffer the same fate .
In such a scenario , it is very tough to assume that The Hundred would take place as scheduled .
" Ideally , the postponement of the 2020 Olympics should 've held the ECB in good stead .
But that is not the case anymore .
Travel bans are likely to stay in place for all of the English summer .
A thorough postponement is the only choice , " said sources .
Ticket sales for The Hundred were set to commence in the first week of April and have now been indefinitely delayed .
Sanjay Patel , managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of an epidemic which is affecting the nation in unprecedented ways , it would be wholly inappropriate for us to promote and sell tickets to The Hundred .
We appreciate this may cause some disappointment to fans that were keen to purchase tickets in the April sales window , accessing early bird prices and securing tickets to the most in-demand games .
"  Meanwhile , the IPL is also looking set to be cancelled this year .
The thirteenth edition of the tournament was scheduled to start on March 29 but the BCCI had suspended it till April 15 .
But as things stand , it looks very unlikely that the tournament would take place this year .
