Follow us  Happily ever after : How Schitt 's Creek found its grand finale  Thanks to a twist of fate , Dan Levy and Noah Reid helped the offbeat Canadian comedy slowly grow into TV 's most heartfelt modern love story .
By Shana Naomi Krochmal  March 25 , 2020  " And then they get married .
"  Noah Reid is gamely summarizing the relationship his Schitt 's Creek character -- staid , sturdy Patrick Brewer -- has developed over nearly four seasons with David Rose , played by Dan Levy , Schitt 's co-creator and showrunner .
That 's where their love story ends , of course -- in a series two-part finale wedding next month , in the grand tradition of sitcoms .
It 's just not where anyone involved -- especially Levy -- expected this show to go when it premiered five years ago .
It was hard to imagine then that a family passion project would inspire a legion of heavily invested viewers with so many feelings about how the show should never end -- or , if it had to , exactly how it should .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the fans expect -- which is for us all to live happily ever after in a motel for the rest of time -- with what the characters really want , " Levy tells EW .
" For me , a series finale should just be a really fun , great episode of your show .
"  A mid-series twist of fate delivered Reid to Schitt 's Creek in what was originally conceived as a short-lived role , until he melted everyone 's hearts and led the show down a completely different path .
Since Patrick proposed to David last season , the two have marched steadily toward the altar , slowed only by typical wedding planning drama -- sky-high venue and catering costs , tragic spray tans that threaten to ruin engagement photos -- but never any artificial , will-they-or-won't-they obstacles .
" That is one of the things that I always have found troubling about certain TV tropes , " Levy says .
" It does provide an instant tension , but people watching know how solid this relationship is .
It 's a little harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was a gay relationship , wanting to show the stability and the security of these two people just getting each other and having it be nothing but love and encouragement .
Obviously , there 's bumps along the road , which we explored , but that the relationship itself would never be put into question , that these two people were in it to win it .
"  And though Levy insists the show is " a four-hander through and through , " it 's David and Patrick 's relatively subdued relationship to which Schitt 's already ardent viewers are most devoted .
Every actor gets a hefty round of applause when they come onstage at one of the show'slive events , 29 in total so far .
But when this last season 's promotional campaign featured Levy and Reid kissing -- in tuxedos , no less -- fans passed GIFs around like they were a golden ticket .
Queer couples even posted selfies beneath a giant billboard version on Los Angeles ' Sunset Strip .
As they planned for the show 's final bow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a wedding -- and that the stakes were high .
So many unlikely stars in showbiz had to align to give Schitt 's the chance it needed .
First , it was always a family show .
Levy had no serious onscreen acting credits before and was best known as a host of an MTV Canada after-show about The Hills .
He created Schitt 's with the man whose title for Hollywood 's Most Famous Eyebrows he 's now arguably snatched -- his father , Eugene Levy .
His long career includes co-writing four Christopher Guest movies , playing the dad in American Pie , and being part of the legendary Second City comedy troupe 's founding cast .
Brooke Nipar for EW  Schitt 's is set up as an offbeat comedy about the once-rich Rose family who , after losing everything in a bad business deal , temporarily resettle from New York to the titular tiny town , which they previously bought for David as a gag gift .
It does n't seem to have occurred to either Levy that they would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the characters .
Eugene plays onetime VHS rental king Johnny Rose , cowed by failure but still donning crisp suits every day .
His archly theatrical wife , Moira , is portrayed by Catherine O'Hara , Eugene 's frequent onscreen partner since their Second City days .
As David , their high-strung and higher maintenance grown son , Dan Levy channels an extreme version of himself .
( " David is a 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 -- and Daniel is a three or four , " says yet another Levy -- Sarah , Dan 's younger sister , who has a recurring role as the town 's guileless waitress , Twyla .
" But their sense of humor is exactly the same .
" ) Rounding out the family foursome is a total unknown-turned-newfound comedy genius , Annie Murphy , as Alexis , David 's Kardashian-esque globe-'gramming sister .
The Roses begin Schitt 's Creek universally flummoxed by small-town life .
For most of the first two seasons , they 're all selfishly obsessed simply with getting out of the shabby motel where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past .
Underneath the melodramatic maladjustment dilemmas , however , were always the bones of a smarter than average family sitcom .
And it did something , well , damned unlikely , especially for a comedy TV series : very slowly Schitt 's became more nuanced , at times even profound .
Under all that pomp , the Rose family proved to be vulnerable and empathetic , if deeply unaccustomed to such feelings .
" It 's about taking time to really deprogram everything that you thought was important and valuable and sending you back into the world as better people , " Levy says .
On the CBC , Schitt 's found a steady audience from the start , buoyed by its locally grown cast , but most Americans did n't even know they had Pop , or that the CBS-owned cable channel that once ran TV Guide listings was now airing original scripted series .
( Pop TV is now officially part of ViacomCBS , and the finale will also air on Comedy Central and Logo .
) Though the show is set non-specifically somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost certainly Schitt 's saving grace .
" On any other network , this show would have been canceled after season one , " Levy says .
" A lot of shows are really under the gun of ratings .
We were fortunate to not have that kind of pressure , which allowed us to tell stories in really meaningful ways over a long period of time .
Everyone is usually under the watchful eye of , ' Is this benefiting us financially ? ' You end up putting everything on the table all at once in hopes of creating something so electric that people ca n't turn away .
"  Instead , Levy held a lot back .
The Rose family kept slowly stepping closer to being self-actualized people you might even want as friends , but not without frequent backslides .
And the audience -- especially its growing core of passionate online fans -- began to swell .
When the first two seasons hit Netflix in early 2017 , followed with the third by end of year , Schitt 's went from being a cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Patrick 's romance began in earnest , and Levy stepped up to become showrunner .
" By the time that I was put in a situation where I really had the weight of the show exclusively on my shoulders , obviously with the collective of a writers ' room , I was no longer second-in-command , " Levy says .
" At that point , we were introducing Patrick .
With Patrick came this whole other conversation .
"  When Reid was cast to play a potential love interest for David , he was best known for starring in a movie called Score -- a Canadian musical .
about hockey .
He and Levy , who knew each other a little socially , did n't even have a chemistry test .
" We did n't have time , " Levy says .
" We cast him halfway through the season .
David needed a relationship because he 's so fragile when it comes to love .
We thought , if it works , great .
"  Patrick does n't start out as obvious boyfriend material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems neither impressed nor particularly fazed by David .
" Noah could have come into the show and we could 've gotten along , but there would n't have been the same spark , " Levy says .
" Then we would have probably , inevitably either written him out or had it die off at some point .
" Instead , Levy says , as Patrick , Reid brought " a stability and a sense of calm .
"  Their characters first meet because David has a third of an idea for how to transform a recently shuttered general store into an immersive experience , a stylish and " very specific store " ; Patrick helps put together a coherent business license application out of a series of stoned voicemails .
" What originally attracted Patrick to David was the intrigue of , ' Who is this strange unicorn person that I 've never seen ? ' " Levy says .
Reid was also feeling things out .
" It 's strange to walk into a show that 's already going .
I came in for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Noah , how are you ? ' And I was like , ' Okay , sure , I guess this is where I am .
' But that 's true of human relationships , too , right ? You meet somebody , you have no idea .
You know that you 're interested .
Maybe there could be something there -- and I think that 's what we were playing out in that first scene .
Then , you see where it goes .
"  It did n't take long for everyone involved to know -- on screen and off -- that the chemistry experiment was working .
In the third season finale , David finally makes his move , and they kiss for the first time .
Patrick says thank you -- because he 's never done that before , and was worried he would n't have the nerve .
" I had always intended for the character to not really have a firm grasp on his sexual orientation , " Levy says .
" But there was a curiosity to slowly reveal that side to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with those impulses .
"  Reid says simply , " The moment where we kiss in the car opens a compartment in Patrick that has n't been opened .
"  What was very clear is that Patrick would n't be leaving .
" That 's when I was like , ' Yeah , all right , ' Levy says , with David-esque understatement .
" Let 's give him another season , see what happens .
' "  Unlike pretty much every TV show ever , no one on Schitt 's Creek ever has an overt crisis of sexuality .
The newness of Patrick dating a guy is presented matter-of-factly and with far less room for dramatics than David 's reluctance to become a guy who celebrates four-month anniversaries .
" Their relationship happened pretty fast , " Reid admits .
And one song during their courtship gained hall of fame status among fans along the way .
Reid , who is also a singer-songwriter of exactly the kind of earnest folk-rock you might expect , was thrilled when a script called for Patrick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mortified protestations .
" I find it incredibly cringey , people singing generally , " Levy says .
" But I knew that Reid had such a confidence and a conviction to that side of his artistry that I wanted to use it .
" Levy picked Tina Turner 's " The Best , " a personal favorite , and Reid asked for a chance to try his hand at an acoustic arrangement .
Brooke Nipar for EW  " In the middle of the night I got this text message , and it was him singing it at home , " Levy says .
" As a single person receiving that , that 's not good for anybody -- but for me , to have just watched an episode of Downton Abbey and said good night to my dog and tucked myself into bed and then receive that .
It was like , this is both very sweet and so dark .
What he had done with that song was extraordinary .
"  ( The version released to Spotify has well over 5 million listens ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Creek live tour .
And on the strength of the show 's popularity and an upcoming album , Reid sold out a 23-city tour , about 50 percent of which he got through before having to postpone due to coronavirus shutdowns .
)  David returns the musical grand gesture in the form of a lip-sync to Turner 's original recording .
On a premium cable show , it might have been a lapdance , but despite being technically pretty PG , it 's emotionally vulnerable and unexpectedly sexy .
" We are aware that it 's a family show , which is why I think a lot of it is implied , " Levy says of how Schitt 's has tackled more mature storylines .
" I think you want to be inclusive of all of your viewers , while at the same time not betraying really truthful storytelling .
"  The scene -- which Levy performed in a leather Givenchy sweatshirt on a scorching early summer day -- is a perfect example of how Levy leads Schitt 's storytelling decisions as a writer first , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic person , " Levy says .
" You 're scripting it like , is n't this hysterical ? And then you get up to the day and it 's like -- I 'm not a dancer .
I 'm not really a performer .
The night before I was just learning the lyrics to the song .
"  He and Reid shot most of what ended up in the show on their first take -- after downing a bottle of Prosecco at lunch .
" As an actor , it was the most unsafe I 've ever felt , in the sense that I 'm going to do something that 's so outside of my own personal comfort zone , that level of unabashed lack of consideration for how this is going to appear on film .
But you get those moments so rarely .
So I was like , ah , screw it .
Let 's try this .
"  When they finished the scene , the director came over -- crying .
" I had always pictured that moment to be quite funny , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cameras were crying .
I thought I had done it wrong .
"  " More people should drink at lunch , " Reid jokes , but he acknowledges that for David 's character , it was a risk not unlike Levy 's own .
" That 's the furthest out on a limb he 's ever gone for anybody .
"  The episode marked another social-media turning point for the show .
" There are moments that come out of when you 're making TV that are unexpected , " Levy says .
" As I was performing it , and even when I wrote it -- I do n't think I knew how emotional it would be for people who were invested in the storyline .
Once it aired , people were like , ' I was sobbing through your performance .
' I 'm glad that it carried a deeper significance .
"  The confidence Levy had in working with Reid began to take on a deeper significance , too .
" I knew that things were working with Noah , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I had n't seen before on TV .
"  The show 's critical acclaim began to translate into awards ; at the 2016 Canadian Screen Awards , the country 's equivalent to the Emmys and Oscars , Schitt 's won nine times , including for Best Comedy Series .
But it was still , despite the surge of media attention , more of a local darling .
Its creators felt lucky to have been making work they loved with people they loved for so long .
They decided , as they began to consider their fifth season , that they should commit to two more years , 14 episodes each , and then be done .
The CBC and Pop TV agreed .
They planned out the big plot points .
" I knew that the David and Patrick relationship was impactful , " Levy says , " not just for me as a writer but for our viewers , and that I wanted to give these characters a happy ending that I had not seen or that is very rarely given out to gay characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big moments , " Reid says .
" To know where you 're going in that way feels pretty good .
" Patrick emotionally comes out to his family -- who in keeping with Schitt 's Creek no-homophobia-here rules were mostly worried about why he had n't felt comfortable telling them sooner -- and the couple decides to cohabitate .
And then the big penultimate reveal , sharply scripted by Levy to take place in the midst of a contentious hike up a local mountain : Patrick proposes .
David incredulously asks , " Are you sure ? " And Patrick answers , " Easiest decision of my life .
"  But Levy still had n't told fans they 'd decided on a stopping point for the series .
" We are so grateful to have been given the time and creative freedom to tell this story in its totality , concluding with a final chapter that we had envisioned from the very beginning , " Dan and Eugene wrote on Twitter last May .
" It 's not lost on us what a rare privilege it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take its final bow .
"  A motley crew of famous fans were now proud and vocal late adoptees .
Will Ferrell called it his favorite show , and Paul Rudd , Tony Hale , Anjelica Huston , and even Steph Curry all gushed about how good it was .
Paula Abdul posted photos of herself fangirling with the cast backstage after a live event .
Keith Urban swore he 'd never binged two seasons in a row of anything before .
After Patrick declared his love for David in a language he knew could n't be misunderstood -- " You 're my Mariah Carey " -- the singer tweeted out a GIF of the moment and told her followers to watch the show .
( A very calm Levy replied , " OH .
F*CKING .
" )  And so suddenly all that carefully cultivated momentum they 'd acquired hit the States , and big time : four Emmy nominations -- the first ever for Pop TV -- including , most remarkably , Outstanding Comedy Series .
That was followed by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and even the MTV Movie &amp; TV Awards , where Levy took home the prize for Best Comedic Performance .
That 's a lot of pressure for a grand finale -- and a wedding .
And life in the Schitt 's Creek bubble was starting to feel a little less secure , as all of the cast were asked ( by EW and everyone else ) how they were going to say goodbye .
Table reads got more emotional .
Levy began making what Reid jokingly calls " the noise " -- a particular blend of crying and hiccuping that would manifest during read-throughs .
" I 'm the least emotional of the cast , I would say probably , " Reid says .
" That 's probably partially because I 've lived in the house that is Schitt 's Creek for less time , but also because I think I exist in a Patrick world , where you 're sort of just holding it all together , being the glue of the situation .
So I felt like my job was just to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it .
"  Levy , who can cry on command a dozen takes in a row , says all the right sentimental things about the show ending , but manages to do so with a dry eye .
" The boldness with which these characters lived their lives is so opposite to how so many of us were as people going into this show , myself included , " Levy says .
" Even in the early days where people were like , ' I love David .
' I 'm like , ' I love David .
' But he was slightly more prickly .
He has a bit of a shell that you need to crack open in order to get there .
" I 'm still an incredibly sort of trepidatious person .
I 'm very insecure and have a lot of social anxiety .
That 's something that I have to deal with on the day-to-day , to play a character that lives their life so unabashedly out loud and is so unapologetic in their beliefs in what they want and what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself , and he walks with confidence , and believes his own worth , which I think is a really wonderful thing .
"  Ensemble or not , it 's Levy who 's now unquestionably the face of the show .
Every creative question on set and during production seems to lead back to a version of " let 's ask Dan about it , " but in a way that does n't sound fearful so much as deeply respectful of his vision .
( Victor Garber , who has known the Levy family since a decade before Dan was born , admitted after a recent guest-star appearance that " Daniel 's intelligence is daunting .
" )  " The first two seasons , I was taking a backseat to some more senior writers , which was really formative for me to see how a room is run , " Levy says .
" But the minute that I had that control , something clicked .
I think my approach to the storytelling shifted a little bit .
"  For Levy , who 'd built himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sister , a surrogate mother he 'd grown up around , and a bevy of new best friends he liked so much he 'd spend weeks on vacation abroad with them after the show wrapped -- it has also brought the inevitable question : What 's next ?  He signed an overall three-year deal with ABC Studios to develop and produce new projects .
" I really was happy to say no to everybody if it was n't right , " Levy says , but he felt confident ABC understood his approach .
" What is it worth if you 're signing yourself up to be compromised ? I do n't want that .
I want to do special things , and they might not be huge money-making things .
They might be smaller , quieter projects that move a dial for people in a slightly more intimate way , and that 's great .
" I do n't have any patience for ego unless it 's people being confident about what they 're doing and saying , ' Yes , let 's keep making more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show and for the only conversations that have come out of those two to be about , ' How do we make this scene better ? ' Giving suggestions as opposed to just criticism .
It has been such a constructive world to live in for six years .
I do n't want to do anything but that .
If that means I wo n't be working with actors who come with really terrible reputations but have really huge star power , then so be it .
I have no interest in it .
"  Despite 80 episodes starring as a now-legendary character , Levy 's own acting experience is still otherwise admittedly thin .
When cast this year in his first-ever feature film -- a Kristen Stewart-Mackenzie Davis rom-com called Happiest Season -- he was full of self-doubt .
" I had this fear of , what if it 's not the safe space that has been created for me and that I helped create for myself ? How will I be ? I do n't work very well under pressure when I 'm not the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DuVall ended up reassuring Levy there were more queer creative leaders in Hollywood who shared his value system .
" There are other people out there who want to tell meaningful stories and on a big scale .
I feel like I 've been able to give the performance that I wanted to give as opposed to coming home at the end of the day and being like , ' I was too nervous , and I fucked up , and I could n't deal with it .
It was n't how I rehearsed it in my room , ' which is so much of the case as an actor .
"  Where he once expected to spend April making the rounds of talk shows to promote Schitt 's finale , now he 's spending his self-quarantine attempting to recreate his father 's egg salad recipe on Instagram .
A 16-show upcoming live tour they had planned as a swan song may get delayed , and the impact of coronavirus could also make it challenging to stage Emmy campaign events , especially since they 're still working at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Last year they lost to Fleabag ; at SAG it was The Marvelous Mrs .
Maisel .
)  But he still knows that what he wants to make next has to be nurtured and developed the same slow way Schitt 's was .
Had it been canceled after its first season , as Levy admits was likely , " We would never have been able to tell the stories we were telling -- what a shame that would have been .
And now the show 's doing great .
Now we 're of great benefit to our network .
It took a minute , but what a wonderful thing to leave with .
"  And what a legacy to build on .
" I 'm developing a show right now that is very different , conceptually speaking , but similar in tone , " Levy says .
Just as Schitt 's Creek has become a safe space for many fans during a time of political turmoil , Levy sees , in the connective tissue of his past and future work , a warm hug .
" Television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think you can have heart and still have an edge , still have unlikeable characters , have a lot of conflict and be divisive in terms of politics .
The heart is what clearly has tied us all together in terms of Schitt 's Creek .
It is what has brought in people from all different belief backgrounds , and economic backgrounds , and age differences .
They 've come together because they 've all experienced the heart of the show , and they 're rooting for these people , good or bad .
That is an area that I 'm not finished exploring yet .
"  He 's also fascinated by satires such as JoJo Rabbit , for which he professes no real skill but great appreciation as a viewer .
" I have ideas for hour-long thrillers , " he says .
" That 'll come down the line , I think .
For right now , I 'm feeling so satiated by putting goodness out into the world and contributing to this era of joyful television , seeing just how transformative positive stories about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple effect of that is so great -- and how much people need it .
