From masks to meals , businesses come to the aid of frontliners  While some businesses have produce face shields , others are cooking up hot meals for frontliners dealing with the sick and dying .
KUALA LUMPUR/AMMAN/BARCELONA : As the Covid-10 pandemic stretches health services around the world to the limit , businesses for good are stepping in , providing everything from protective masks to meal boxes for frontline staff .
The World Health Organisation has warned that medical workers are " dangerously ill-equipped " to fight the deadly virus , a message underscored by images on social media of desperate staff with only garbage bags for protection .
In response to the crisis , businesses with a social conscience have been scrambling to help , from the Spanish shoemakers producing face masks to the Malaysian social enterprise hiring refugees to make meals for hospital staff .
" It 's the least we can do , " said Lucia C ? scales , a nursing assistant who is making masks in Alicante in the south of Spain , one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic .
" You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spanish initiative was started by a group of women volunteers who normally stitch shoes in their own homes .
They have now sent more than 5,000 face masks they made to local hospitals to help plug acute shortages .
Doctors ' pleading '  With protective equipment in high demand , social enterprises -- businesses that aim to do good as well as turning a profit -- have turned their hand to manufacturing around the world .
In Malaysia and the Philippines , there have been reports of medical workers resorting to using garbage bags due to a shortage of personal protective equipment .
Biji-biji Initiative , a Malaysian social enterprise that turns discarded banners into folders and seat belts into bags , is sending local hospitals thousands of face shields it made with elastic bands , as well as acrylic and plastic sheets .
" ( Some doctors ) were pleading with us that they need these face shields , " said co-founder Juliana Adam of the equipment that doctors usually wear with surgical masks .
" They are the frontliners , halting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just by being at work , " she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .
Elsewhere Mashghal al-Omm , a Lebanese social enterprise that employs widows and women with no income to sew garments for retailers , has asked its workers to switch to making protective suits and masks for local hospitals .
A financial crisis exacerbated by months of political instability has brought much of Lebanon 's economy to a halt , making it difficult to import these crucial supplies .
" Lebanon 's problem is that we rely on imports , " said Mashghal al-Omm 's media manager Ghassan Hankir , from its garment workshop in the southern city of Sidon .
" Before this , no one produced protective gear here , it was all from China , " he said , adding suits made locally are five times cheaper than those sourced from abroad .
Price surge  Prices of medical goods have surged since the start of the Covid-19 outbreak late last year .
The cost of a surgical mask has risen six-fold , according to the WHO , prompting calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Other companies have also stepped in , from luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton , which is switching from perfume to disinfectant gel production , to the British bagless vacuum cleaner company Dyson , which is to manufacture ventilators .
However , some experts have cautioned against relying too much on companies with no experience of producing such highly specialist medical equipment .
" On the one hand , I have seen how some businesses have shifted from making alcoholic beverages to making alcohol-based hand sanitisers .
" This is feasible and meets a pressing need , " said Keiji Fukuda , director of the University of Hong Kong 's School of Public Health .
" By contrast , it is harder to see how a company that normally makes cars can be converted into making ventilators in time to be useful for this pandemic , " added Fukuda , a former WHO adviser on pandemic influenza .
" Such machines are complex , will depend on specialised machinery , skilled workers and supplies from a variety of countries .
"  Frontline medical staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in countries under lockdown .
In Britain , one exhausted nurse was driven to tears after finding store shelves bare after her shift , prompting a government warning for people not to hoard food .
The Picha Project , a Malaysian social enterprise that hires refugees to cook , aims to make sure these workers are looked after .
Every day it sends about 400 meal boxes typically containing chicken and rice to hospitals , paid for by companies or individuals who want to thank the frontline workers .
" Everyone needs food , " said Picha Project 's co-founder Suzanne Ling .
" This is the least we can do to show we stand with them .
