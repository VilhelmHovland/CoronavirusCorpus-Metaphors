Weights fly in rush for lockdown fitness  So what are you allowed to do to stay in shape during the lockdown ? Suzanne McFadden finds out .
It was n't just toilet paper - last-minute panic buying in the countdown to lockdown was for dumbbells and punching bags too .
Fitness equipment was stripped from store shelves , as people searched for alternative ways to keep fit while gyms and fitness studios are closed during New Zealand 's four weeks of isolation to combat Covid-19 .
One Auckland fitness store owner told Newsroom he was too busy to talk on the final trading day , such was the demand ; they 'd already sold out of weights , kettlebells and dumbbells .
But he had time to share this grievance : " If the government are letting people buy cream donuts and beer at the supermarket , they should be letting us get deliveries of fitness gear to people , safely .
This is the stupidity of what 's happening .
"  It 's been the same craze across the Tasman and in the United States , where stores have emptied of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days .
But exercise experts here warn that people with a lot of time on their hands should be careful not to suddenly overdo it , at the risk of lowering their immunity .
From today across New Zealand , outdoor exercise like walking , running or cycling is still allowed -- as long as it 's done alone .
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has emphasised that you can exercise with others only if they are the people you 've chosen to live with for the next four weeks .
" You ca n't cycle through and spend time with other people outside your bubble , " she says .
Which is why gyms and children 's playgrounds are no-go areas .
People touching surfaces in a public space create the possibility of contracting Covid-19 .
" Any time you make contact in a public space it 's a risk , " Ardern says .
" Basically , you have to restart the clock " .
Playing golf is no longer an option -- all courses have been closed for at least four weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also shut down , but you can swim in a lake , river or the sea , as long as you keep your distance from other swimmers .

Walking your dog or jogging the streets - you must follow the 2m distance rule .
NZ First was even encouraging people on Twitter to " hunt the roar " -- for next month 's red stag hunting season -- but coronavirus has now put an end to that too .
But abuse the liberty to work up a sweat outdoors , and we may lose it .
Frustrated by seeing people still out and fraternising in northern Italy , the government has banned all exercise and outdoor activities -- even putting limits on how far people can walk their dogs .
A stream of Italian mayors have taken to YouTube pleading with their people to stay at home .
Among them the mayor of Delia , Gianfilippo Bancheri , who ca n't understand why so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have kept a habit of running now and then for 20 years .
There are at most 20 regular runners in our city .
How come everyone has turned out to be a running enthusiast now ? " he yells into the camera .
" I guess the last time you ran was when you were in primary school .
What are you running for ? "  In France , runners can only cover 1-2km and must not venture far from home ( couples who live together can run alongside each other , as long as they carry a permission form ) .
But cyclists have been ordered indoors .
And in Britain , Prime Minister Boris Johnson has decreed that Britons are restricted to one form of exercise per day outside of their homes .
New Zealand strength and conditioning high-performance scientist , Angus Ross , says Kiwis can do " pretty much any exercise " as long as it 's done individually , but that may be a stumbling block from some .
" Not being able to exercise in groups could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-motivated , " says Ross , who works with some of New Zealand 's top athletes .
" You can use social media to get your exercise kick -- compete with each other online , motivate each other .
And there are so many workouts online now -- videos of body-weight exercises made by trainers especially for the lockdown .
"  Celebrities are taking up the challenge .
The Terminator , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has offered a nine-step home workout that does n't require equipment to stay fit during the pandemic , while Australian actor Chris Hemsworth is giving free access for the next six weeks to his home fitness app .
Newsroom columnist James Elliott has proven fitness in isolation can be done .
He 's been walking around Auckland during his 10 days in solitude ( after returning home from Australia ) .
Now inspired by a friend on social media in the United Kingdom , he 's dragged his exercycle out of retirement and he and partner , Rachel , are going to cycle ( the equivalent of ) the length of New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic athletes he works with in Cambridge , so they could set up their own gyms at home .
With the news yesterday that the Tokyo Olympics are now postponed until 2021 to " safeguard the health of athletes " , New Zealand 's elite sports stars will have to re-think their training schedules .
Shot put specialist Tom Walsh , the Rio Olympics bronze medallist , usually takes six to eight weeks off training at the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer .
" But now Tom has to contemplate having time off now or using this time to be in better shape for next year , " Ross says .
Ross has a warning for everyday fitness warriors .
" Unless you 're an elite athlete and you 're used to it , going on a massive exercise kick now might not be the smartest thing .
Definitely keep exercising for your health and well-being , but do n't go stupid with it , " he says .
" If you smash yourself you can become immune-compromised .
If you 're doing exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less resilient to bacterial and viral infections .
" Also try not to do the same thing every day .
There are different components to fitness -- aerobic , strength , flexibility , moving well , and co-ordination .
Do something you enjoy and use social media to share ideas with friends .
"  For parents in lockdown with kids at home , not being able to visit the local playground may be a nightmare in itself .
But Sport New Zealand tamariki lead , Karen Laurie , says it 's important to have your children doing some kind of physical activity at home , even if there 's only a small space to do it in .
Her advice : to rediscover your home and backyard .
" The more we get our kids physical and active , the better their mental well-being .
Physically they are going to stay healthier .
And we want them to feel supported and have fun , " she says .
Letting kids choose what they do , so " they feel like they are part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stress brought on by the lockdown , Laurie says .
" Think about what your kids are involved with now -- like the sports they play or if they like going to the playground - and get creative .
Your lounge can become a playground , your kitchen a dance floor , your backyard a scavenger hunt , " she says .
" Do a family treasure hunt , to see what things we can find around the house to have fun and be active .
You can start the ball by rolling up a pair of socks as a ball and a glad wrap roll as a bat and have a bit of fun .
" You do n't have to go out to a park , you can be creative in a small space .
Relax the rules around climbing on the tables and chairs , and make tents with blankets , towels and cushions .
"  Laurie , meanwhile , is doing her bit to keep her distance - living on a 16m boat with her family sailing up the east coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paddle-boarding and yoga on the deck to keep active in lockdown .
