Odds of a Contested November Election Are on the Rise  What we do n't need to end this star-crossed year : an election that 's not generally accepted as legitimate .
Photo : Samuel Corum/Getty Images  Long before the advent of COVID-19 and the havoc it is playing with the right and opportunity to vote , there were fears that another close presidential election like 2016 might create something of a crisis of legitimacy .
In part those fears arose from the scattered evidence of skullduggery ( some with a Russian accent ) in favor of Donald Trump in 2016 .
But more ominous has been the increasingly evident willingness of Republicans ( beginning with Donald Trump 's blithe and totally undocumented allegation that " millions of illegal votes " were cast for Hillary Clinton ) to intensify their famously empty claims of " voter fraud " whenever demographic groups that lean Democratic are encouraged to cast ballots .
Now that state-run electoral systems are in chaos in the midst of a pandemic , with no assurances the conditions for normal voting behavior will return by November , the odds of a contested general election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both parties ) have gone up .
Election law expert Rick Hasen is sounding the alarm :  If the pandemic is still limiting our ability to move freely about society in the fall , the amount of absentee balloting is going to explode whether Congress mandates an expansion of absentee balloting or not it did n't ! .
We have already seen the huge growth in absentee ballot requests for Wisconsin 's April 7 primary , along with legal challenges surrounding the state 's voter ID law .
Vote by mail is an important step in ensuring that even if the virus keeps people away from physical polling places , millions of Americans will have a means of avoiding disenfranchisement .
But it is not perfect .
Vote-by-mail ballots are more likely to be rejected than other ballots because of problems like signature mismatches .
We also know that rejection rates for signature mismatches can disproportionately affect minority voters .
Some states do not alert a voter whose ballot has been rejected about the rejection , failing to give the voter a chance to cure something like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjective endeavor .
Even before the coronavirus pandemic , the issue has led to litigation over whether those voters are being unconstitutionally denied their right to vote .
Some disabled voters , meanwhile , may need to vote at physical polling places because they lack the physical ability to fill out a ballot at home .
These voters too risk disenfranchisement .
And in the 11 states without online voter registration , even registering to vote in time for the election may pose a great challenge if government offices are closed or maintaining only limited hours .
All these issues Hasen raises are aside from the stark inequities that may govern voting-by-mail in different states , depending in part on their experience ( or the lack thereof ) with this kind of voting , and in part on the hostility to early voting traditionally exhibited by the Republicans who govern many states and localities .
Check out this recent op-ed from conservative columnist Quin Hillyer :  To put it bluntly , widespread mail-in balloting is a mess .
It often delays final election results for days or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , much more difficult to detect and deter vote fraud .
As election-law veterans J .
Christian Adams and Hans von Spakovsky recently wrote , " Voting by mail is the single worst form of election possible .
It moves the entire election beyond the oversight of election officials and into places where the most vulnerable can be exploited by political operatives .
"  Adams and von Spakovsky are notorious conspiracy theorists of voter fraud , but Republican election administrators who pay attention to them are not likely to handle voting-by-mail in a voter-friendly manner , are they ? And 2018 's experience also shows that the slower voting counts that invariably accompany voting by mail ( because of the need to verify signatures , and in some states , to accommodate mail ballots postmarked on or near election day ) are prone to being interpreted as sinister rather than natural by a lot of conservatives .
More from Hasen :  The need to process millions more absentee ballots without adequate funds and training means November 's election results could well be delayed .
This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of poor election administration , and both of their states , Michigan and Pennsylvania , have recently adopted no-excuse absentee balloting -- and both states play a critical role in the outcome of the Electoral College that determines the presidency .
Delay is going to lead to cries of fraud , when in fact good election administration -- especially when dealing with absentee ballots -- takes time .
What if Trump is ahead in Michigan and Pennsylvania on election night and he declares victory , but after millions of absentee ballots are processed a week or so later Biden is declared the winner in those states and wins the election ? Will Republicans believe Trump if he claimed the later count was the result of fraud , despite all evidence to the contrary ?  So what can be done to reduce the risk of Election Night ( and post -- Election Day ) chaos and potentially a contested election ? Hasen does have recommendations :  If Congress is not going to step up , states need to find money in their already strained budgets to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assert more authority over local jurisdictions to manage the expected surge in absentee balloting , the added expenses of running polling places consistent with stringent health requirements , and other potential threats to the election like cyberattacks .
Too much local control in election administration is a recipe for disaster because in a close election everyone will look at the small number of places where things failed , not the vast majority of places that manage to conduct a single election well .
State legislatures need to give state election administrators more power over poorly performing election offices .
States also need to advertise and impose heavy penalties on those who would tamper with absentee ballots , especially if states send absentee ballots to all registered voters ( some of whom may have moved or died ) .
That adds up to a tall order given America 's chronically underfunded and ridiculously decentralized nonsystem of holding elections .
But the last thing we need in this star-crossed year is to end it with an intense political , or even constitutional , crisis .
CNN Health : According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems , there are at least 151,680 cases of coronavirus in the U .
; 2,781 people have died in the US from coronavirus .
CNN Health : Pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson announced on Monday that it plans to initiate human clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine candidate by September , and anticipates the first batches of the vaccine could be available for emergency use by early next year .
