In these dire times , the whole world needs every little help that we can get .
Our next batch of superheroes might come in the form of a four-legged furry cutesy , commonly known as man 's best friend .
Medical Detection Dogs , a charity movement that has spent years researching a dog 's ability to smell and detect disease .
Previously , the charity working with London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ( LSHTM ) and Durham University , has managed to prove that dogs can be trained to detect malaria .
The team is together yet again to train their dogs for six weeks so that these dogs can play a role in detecting Covid 19 .
Dogs that are trained can detect the odour of the virus as well as the subtle changes in the temperature of the human body .
CEO of Medical Detection Dogs , Dr Claire Guest in a statement published in their official website explained ,  " In principle , we 're sure that dogs could detect COVID-19 .
We are now looking into how we can safely catch the odour of the virus from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that dogs will be able to screen anyone , including those who are asymptomatic and tell us whether they need to be tested .
This would be fast , effective and non-invasive and make sure the limited NHS testing resources are only used where they are really needed .
"  We welcome any sort of effort which can help the detection of the virus especially if they are backed by science .
Early detection helps and we ca n't wait to see our furry friends in action as part of the movement to curb the spread of Covid-19 .
