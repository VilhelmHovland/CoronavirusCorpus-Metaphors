DS Smith creates boxes for safer delivery during COVID-19  DS Smith has been working closely with food retailers across Europe to design , develop and produce new boxes designed to supply emergency provision boxes to the most vulnerable .
In addition to providing critical support to keep goods moving and replenish shelves as quickly as possible , focus has quickly turned to home delivery to move goods directly to the front door of those who are n't able to make it to the shops .
As more countries implement social distancing processes and enact new legislation , this service will become essential to people facing COVID-19 movement restrictions .
To combat this , DS Smith has developed special new boxes to be filled by food retailers and left on the doorstep .
As a result of social distancing and self-isolation guidelines , the boxes can be stacked in the delivery vans , picked up and dropped off to support the safety of everybody involved in the delivery process .
Stefano Rossi , CEO of Packaging at DS Smith said : " We were approached by several of our food supply customers to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyday essentials to many of society 's most vulnerable .
" We worked very closely with our customers to design and produce a solution which allows for a ' stack , drop and go ' approach that is more time efficient , more hygienic and frees up time for more deliveries .
Our sustainably designed solution is also fully recyclable at home .
" I 'm extremely proud of the whole team at DS Smith ; their determination to support these initiatives meant that we delivered a new design in under 24 hours .
This was subsequently prototyped , tested , manufactured and delivered in less than a week .
