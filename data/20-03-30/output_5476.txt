Staff working from home for the first time ? These six tips will ease the transition  While our workspaces can come to feel like a second home , it 's what we do and why we do it that ultimately defines our relationship with work .
I 've worked for over a decade building , managing and participating in digital teams and communities .
It 's absolutely possible to nurture productive , engaged and thriving teams over the internet -- but they need some stewardship to get up and running .
When your staff are working remotely , you become an online community manager .
You -- or managers under you -- will be guiding and overseeing as you normally would , only across a keyboard or a phone , rather than an office .
Get the tools in place  The good news is , remote working is easy in the 21st century , and there 's an array of affordable tools out here to establish your virtual workplace .
Do you have an intranet already ? If so , they 'll need remote access .
If not , some of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid email as your primary tool .
It can build up very fast when you 're far from each other ! Get a chat tool for the quick conversations , and make sure employees have access to all the tools they need to do their jobs .
Remember to leave time to train and get your people feeling comfortable using these tools , or you 'll be stalled before you start .
( They 're also useful as a back-up , even if you do n't facilitate remote working very often .
)  Set expectations  When we manage communities , we have a clearly defined purpose and reason for being .
We let people know what 's expected of them in the community -- specifically , what 's encouraged and what 's not acceptable .
If your people have never worked remotely before , do n't assume they know what to do or can transition comfortably .
Chat beforehand about any questions or concerns .
Check any assumptions , and be very clear about what you want and need to see .
If the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expected , and define what that looks like .
If you need a report or status update at the end of a shift or a working day , give an example .
Give everyone the chance to switch gears in an informed way .
Empower ambassadors  If you have staff or team members who take naturally to remote working , utilise them as ambassadors and evangelists .
Let them lead by example and model how others can do it , and equip them to instruct or assist those who may need help transitioning to a different way of working .
People are often more comfortable chatting with a peer than the boss , and it 's important to have these surrogates in your online work community to mentor others and escalate issues .
Allow socialising  We 're social creatures , and one of the benefits of coming to work in a shared workplace is our in-person interactions with colleagues .
These can be the first things people miss when they work remotely , which can have a flow-on effect on productivity and morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water-cooler chat .
This gives everyone a chance to get involved without pressure , and helps people maintain relationships and conviviality .
It helps you build a virtual sense of place where staff feel they can be themselves and do their best work .
Trust  Remote working can be liberating and highly productive .
But more than any fancy tech tools , it requires trust .
If you 're already developing flexible working practices , this could be a chance to go a little further and try some new approaches .
If you 're never allowed staff to work remotely before , do n't panic .
Highly successful businesses have been working this way for a long time , and there are tried and true ways to run a smooth ship .
Have faith in your people and they 're likely to reciprocate with those shared values .
Be ready for surprises  You might find that working remotely reveals some things about your people or your working culture you did n't expect .
These could be great -- for example , relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disruption and a strong sense of connection , even at a distance .
Or they may be less welcome -- for example , you find a staff member is n't as engaged as you thought , or people are lacking motivation when they 're outside the office .
These concerns are sometimes given as reasons managers are nervous about trying remote working .
But here 's the reality .
If your people are unhappy and disengaged , it 's easier for them to hide this in the office .
Working from home wo n't make most people suddenly become lax -- evidence suggests people actually work more hours when they 're tuned in remotely .
Distributed working actually gives you the chance to uncover any hidden performance , operational or cultural issues -- it 's a chance to make your business more resilient .
So whether it 's the coronavirus , bushfire smoke , weather events , carbon footprint , or something else that has you pondering the workability of telecommuting , rest assured , you 're not alone , and it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses .
So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ? .
