The Latest : Furloughs at major U .
companies signal mounting economic distress  The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic .
The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness or death .
Major companies signaled a new wave of economic distress Monday , sending hundreds of thousands of workers home without pay , as the Trump administration scrambled to get stimulus money to Americans already feeling the weight of unpaid bills .
Macy 's announced it will furlough most of its 125,000 workers as sales evaporated with the closure of 775 stores .
Kohl 's and Gap announced furloughs of about 80,000 each .
Media giant Gannett announced furloughs for newspaper employees who earn more than $38,000 a year and pay cuts across the company .
Sysco , the country 's largest food distributor , also confirmed thousands of furloughs and layoffs of undisclosed number of workers worldwide .
The massive cuts have prompted some economists to predict that the unemployed could top 40 million by mid-April , with deep economic consequences for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation orders .
A new forecast from IHS Markit estimates that " it will likely take two to three years for most economies to return to their pre-pandemic levels of output .
"  The tanking economy has ratcheted up the pressure on the Trump administration to turn the largest stimulus package in American history into immediate relief for businesses and workers .
The Treasury Department , in particular , faces a staggering list of tasks as it tries to rapidly create massive new federal programs aimed at shielding Americans from the economic impact .
The congressional package signed into law by President Trump on Friday includes a massive increase in unemployment benefits and direct checks of $1,200 to more than 100 million American taxpayers .
It also includes close to $400 billion in loans to small businesses , as well as more than $500 billion in a fund that can go to corporations , cities and states .

"  While governments worldwide are tightening travel and other controls , the ruling Communist Party has rolled back curbs on Wuhan and other areas as it tries to revive the world 's second-largest economy after declaring victory over the outbreak .
Wuhan is the last major population center still under travel controls .
Residents were allowed to go to other parts of Hubei province but could not leave it .
Restrictions on other Hubei residents were lifted March 23 .
The final curbs on Wuhan end April 8 .
Wuhan became the center of the most intensive anti-disease controls ever imposed after the virus emerged in December .
Some researchers suggest it may have jumped to humans from a bat at one of the city 's wildlife markets .
