Who is Accountable for the Covid-19 Spread ?  As a member of the legal profession , my initial impulse was to consult the fundamentals of the social contract theory .
by Dr .
Ruwantissa Abeyratne  Writing from Montreal  " One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency .
" Arnold Glasow  On 19 March 2020 Melissa Quinn , writing in CBS News an article titled Conservative lawyer sues Chinese government over coronavirus outbreak reported : " Lawyer Larry Klayman and his group Freedom Watch filed the complaint in federal court in Texas seeking at least $20 trillion from the Chinese government because of its " callous and reckless indifference and malicious acts .
"  Stephen L .
Carter , writing in Bloomberg Opinion of 24 March an article titled No , China Ca n't Be Sued Over Coronavirus : Nation-states are immune from such lawsuits says : .
" I wish I could join the groundswell of opinion demanding that China be held liable for allowing the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 to get out of control .
The drumbeat includes , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument that we should treat the outbreak as we would an act of terrorism , because under U .
law , a country that sponsors terror ca n't claim sovereign immunity .
But I can not .
The government of China is protected by the doctrine of sovereign immunity , and the regime 's undoubted misconduct does not constitute sufficient grounds for a waiver " .
A practical ( and dare I say proactive ) view comes from an intelligent millennial ( who will remain anonymous ) who wrote to me yesterday : " Yes , China failed to contain the virus .
But other world leaders have been completely incompetent in how they have handled this crisis .
Trump knew that the coronavirus was a threat to public safety on a global scale for months and did nothing .
He refuses to send out testing kits and protective gear that health care professionals desperately need , and now the US has become the biggest epicenter for the virus .
Boris Johnson proposed letting people infect each other to develop a " herd immunity " ( even though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered from COVID-19 would develop an immunity to it ) .
Spain made no preparations for it .
Italy made no preparations for it .
World leaders and politicians everywhere have made a complete mess of things .
So why single out China ? "  Of these two views , it is clear that the former is legal , and the latter is moral .
However , both impute to the omissions or commissions that led to the global spread of the virus a certain moral reprehensibility .
Carter has gone on to say in his article that " If you want to argue that the Government of China has behaved irresponsibly , that the country 's officials deserve the condemnation of the world for letting the novel coronavirus escape when early action could have kept it under reasonable control , you 'll get no argument from me " ascribing to the conduct of the Chinese leaders , denial , bluster and censorship .
As a member of the legal profession , my initial impulse was to consult the fundamentals of the social contract theory .
The philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given to us by nature and should n't be taken away and that that people form governments in order to protect these rights , but in order for that to work , people have to follow the laws the government makes , which in turn ascribes to governments a certain responsibility to protect its citizens in return for adherence by the latter to laws promulgated by the legislature .
However , my take is that whatever be the basis of the " blame game " , it all boils down firstly to a question of leadership .
With this in mind , I have to turn the pages of history and go back to " originalism " to inquire into what the sages have said over the years .
To start with Plato , I go to his work " the Republic " where he says that people should be governed by philosophers who are endowed with wisdom and that leadership is a duty of philosopher kings who acquire the techniques and skills for the art of ruling .
Plato 's pupil Aristotle is reported to have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the result of high intention , sincere effort , and intelligent execution ; it represents the wise choice of many alternatives -- choice , not chance , determines your destiny " and that a leader should be what centuries later M .
Arnold said : " A good leader leads the people from above them .
A great leader leads the people from within them " .
My final quote is from President Woodrow Wilson : " You are not here merely to make a living .
You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply , with greater vision , with a finer spirit of hope and achievement .
You are here to enrich the world , and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand .
"  There are two dimensions to this discussion : the first is who is responsible ? ; and the second is who is accountable ? " Responsibility is taking on the burden of a task .
Accountability is paying for injury caused .
The corporate analogy for the former is a manager who is responsible for delivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairman and board of directors .
As for State responsibility , the International Law Commission in its Draft Articles on State Responsibility ( 2001 ) says : the basic principle underlying the articles as a whole is that a breach of international law by a State entails its international responsibility .
An internationally wrongful act of a State may consist in one or more actions or omissions or a combination of both .
Whether there has been an internationally wrongful act depends , first , on the requirements of the obligation which is said to have been breached and , secondly , on the framework conditions for such an act , which are set out in Part One .
The term " international responsibility " covers the new legal relations which arise under international law by reason of the internationally wrongful act of a State .
So was there a breach of international law here ? The International Court of Justice in the1964 Barcelona Traction case noted that : an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of diplomatic protection .
By their very nature the former is the concern of all States .
In view of the importance of the rights involved , all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection ; they are obligations erga omnes ( obligations to all ) .
Accountability , whether it is corporate or political is more individualistic .
For example , any leader found in dereliction of duty towards the people he/she serves will have be accountable at the next election .
Of course , this principle would apply only in a democracy .
