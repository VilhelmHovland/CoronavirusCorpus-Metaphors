COVID-19 : How Do People With Chronic Illnesses Survive a Lockdown ?  Imagine waking up in the middle of the night with an awful , excruciating pain in your entire body .
You ca n't move , sleep or think .
You need immediate medical help , but you ca n't go out because you are in a lockdown , brought about by the coronavirus outbreak .
For Anubha Mahajan , this was her Saturday night .
Anubha has Complex Regional Pain Syndrome ( CRPS ) that affects her peripheral and central nervous systems .
For her and for many others suffering from chronic illnesses , such episodes of pain and sudden attacks can be frequent .
In such situations , they need medical assistance by either somehow managing to go to the hospital themselves , or by calling a medical practitioner home .
But during pandemics , none of this is possible .
Lockdowns , risks of catching the infection , social distancing and isolation leave them where Anubha was on Saturday - waiting and praying for the pain to go away .

Pain , and Life Under Isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our routines .
We 've been advised to stay home , take care of our hygiene and isolate ourselves .
But there are countless reasons why social distancing and contagious disease outbreaks can be especially difficult for people with chronic illnesses .
First , they belong to the high-risk category .
According to the World Health Organisation , older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk for more serious complications from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
A relatively compromised immunity is what makes them more prone to these complications , and this is the reason why going out , especially to a hospital , can be extremely risky .
" I 'm scared .
I can not go to the hospital with the numbers and cases increasing daily .
Even a regular fever breaks us down .
How will be able to survive this infection ? Our bodies ca n't handle it .
"  Second , in curfew or a lockdown it is difficult for even a doctor to come to their homes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles .
Logistical issues and the risk of getting an infection can be major obstructions in getting anybody to reach them on time .
In fact , Anubha 's society has closed its gates for maids and drivers , which means that her driver , who has been with her for six months and knows what to do when her illness shoots up , is now not available to take care of her .
" If I have such an episode again , I will have nobody .
I ca n't call my family , they 're in Faridabad and ca n't cross a toll .
My driver , my friends who are aware of my illness ca n't come in .
Nobody in the society knows how to manage my condition .
My driver knew everything .
Even what to tell the doctor if I am unable to speak .
But how will he come ? "  After a cry for help on social media , Anubha finally got someone to take her to the hospital .
But she 's constantly haunted by the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? "  The Paradox : The Need &amp; Difficulties of Isolation  Purva Mittal has spinal muscular atrophy , a rare genetic disease in which one particular neuron inhibits all muscular movements and hampers lung capacity .
It 's also one of the most fatal genetic diseases , where 90 percent of the community succumbs by the age of 10 , and many of those who survive , remain in a vegetative state .
" You have to understand , even a normal fever of flu can easily get converted into pneumonia in us .
We are already dealing with the problems that coronavirus leads to : breathing difficulties , fever , or chest and nose symptoms .
All this without being infected by this particular virus .
How will we survive this one , knowing it 's harsh on the lungs ? "  This makes isolation crucial for them .
She tells me going to the hospital is the last resort because she is so prone to infections .
But on the other hand , there also is a constant need of medical attention and physiotherapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need someone around me all the time .
So what do we do ? How do we reach a middle ground ? "  Knowing how other countries are dealing with the peak of the outbreak have made the fear more real for Purva and Anubha .
" I was doing my research on Italy .
They had to selectively treat infected patients based on the chances of survival .
Where do we stand in such a criterion ? Will we be left to die ? Because if we do n't get immediate medical attention , we will die .
"  The Community Needs to Step In  Dr Khan Amir Maroof , Associate Professor , Community Medicine , UCMS and GTB Hospital , Delhi tells FIT , " More often than not , chronic illnesses are hidden , and consequently , neglected .
Chronically ill people need medication for a long period , and if this is interrupted , their symptoms will exaggerate and the complications will flare up .
"  He makes a few recommendations that may help make the situation better :  Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for follow-up check-ups .
Doctors can make themselves available for online consultations so that nobody has to step out .
It 's also important for patients to keep their records on their phones for these consultations to be possible .
Support groups are paramount in these cases .
We need more support groups to exist and to step up to help people in case of emergencies .
For instance , if someone runs out of medicines , they may not be able to go themselves .
We need volunteers to help people out .
Engage people from the community and beyond .
Neighbourhood connectivity is another must , especially during lockdown and isolation .
People around should be aware of the patient and should constantly offer help for whatever they may need - groceries , medicines or a visit to the hospital .
Physical activity is extremely important .
At-home yoga or stretching exercises should continue as much as possible , otherwise , the problem may aggravate .
Their fear is confounded when the general public hoards up medicines and painkillers that people with chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 packets of paracetamol .
12 packets ! What will be left for us ? " , Anubha said .
She requests for this to not happen , for people to not unnecessarily hoard medicines and deprive those who may not be able to survive without them .
In these difficult times , the solutions will have to come from the community .
Knowing and identifying vulnerable people around and checking up on them is crucial .
On an individual level , following precautions is a must , because there is no better way to help than to contain the spread of the disease .
" Do n't go out , do it for us ! "  ( Chronic Pain India is a support group for chronic illness and chronic pain sufferers in India .
Here 's a list of COVID-19 guidelines compiled by the group for vulnerable people and caregivers .
