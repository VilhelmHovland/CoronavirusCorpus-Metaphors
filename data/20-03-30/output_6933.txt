Ventilators are one of the best weapons in the fight against COVID-19 .
In the most serious cases , people can become too sick to breathe on their own and can die if their lungs are n't assisted by the oxygen-pumping machines .
In Laredo there are 57 ventilators available for adults and eight for children , with more in reserve , Health Department Director Dr .
Gonzalez said .
A study by the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University said that across the U .
, nearly 65,000 people could need ventilators during a " moderate " pandemic .
But if the coronavirus pandemic rises to the level of the 1918 Spanish Flu , more than 742,000 Americans could need the machines to survive .
The total number of existing machines in the United States is a fraction of that : an estimated 160,000 ventilators at most .
If hospitals run short , there are just 16,600 ventilators in the federal government 's emergency stockpile , the Center of Public Integrity recently reported .
A state plan for the years 2012-2016 reported that Texas ' emergency stockpile stood at 428 ventilators .

While ventilators will help those infected by COVID-19 , early detection , including rapid coronavirus testing , is key to stopping the spread of the disease .
The city was expecting to receive a supply of rapid tests late Sunday or Monday .
They hope to test-run drive thru testing Monday , which will be available to Laredoans who have a prescription from their doctor .
" Internally we will initiate a process for us to test out how the system is going to work before we go live with the public , " said Emergency Management Coordinator Steve Landin .
It 's got to be systematic , it 's got to be precise , otherwise we 're creating more issues for ourselves .
"  Rapid tests take a finger prick and 15 minutes to complete , Landin said .
But they only confirm a negative .
If a patient tests positive for COVID-19 through the rapid test they will need to be given a CDC-approved confirmatory test before they are officially considered positive .
