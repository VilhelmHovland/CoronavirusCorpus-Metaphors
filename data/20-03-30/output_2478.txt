trillion dollars to weather the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic , the UN official said on Monday .
The UN Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , Secretary General , Mukhisa Kituyi said this in a statement in Geneva .
This is in the same order of magnitude as the national U .
2-billion-dollar stimulus package that U .
President Donald Trump signed last week .
UNCTAD , a UN think tank and aid body , said that the shock wave from the pandemic is dramatic , even in comparison with the 2008 financial crisis .
In the two-and-a-half months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developing countries have been hit by capital outflows , currency depreciation , falling commodity prices and dwindling tourism revenues , according to UNCTAD economists .
" There are clear indications that things will get much worse for developing economies before they get better , " Kituyi said .
The G20 group of major economies last week promised to inject more than 5 trillion dollars into the global economy to limit the impact of the coronavirus pandemic .
While the G20 efforts are targeted at the group 's own firms and households , the rest of the world needs additional help , UNCTAD Chief Economist Richard Kozul-Wright said .
" If G20 leaders are to stick to their commitment of ' a global response in the spirit of solidarity , ' there must be commensurate action for the six billion people living outside the core G20 economies , " he said .
UNCTAD called for 1 trillion dollars of liquidity aid , 1 trillion dollars in the form of cancelled debts , and 500 billion dollars to fund economic recovery .
