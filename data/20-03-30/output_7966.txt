Immunizing the Labor Market ? Protecting American Workers During a Pandemic  As COVID-19 spreads throughout the country , more than a million workers are expected to lose their jobs by the end of March .
Those who remain employed face other obstacles , especially healthcare workers , who may lack protective gear , and minimum wage workers without paid sick and family leave .
As federal and state governments mobilize to combat COVID-19 and shore up the economy , what can they do to protect American workers ? How can gaps in our social safety net be addressed in the short and the long-term ? And what role should industry play in cooperation with government to make sure that workers are central to whatever solutions are adopted ?
