" In the event the interstate participant tests negative , Racing NSW will immediately resume racing subject to any government restriction .
"  RV chief executive , Giles Thompson , said the licensed person did the right thing by contacting them as soon as they were told of their situation .
" We spent a lot of time putting protocols in place and educating the participants , " Thompson told broadcaster racing .
" The participant has done exactly the right thing and we 've been notified and everything we put in place has swung into action .

" But when you do have a potential exposure ( it is important ) to contact and trace as quickly as possible and identify whether there are others that have been exposed and deal with that us well .
" Unfortunately this exposure came before those protocols were put in place , 13 days ago .
"  Harness racing in NSW has also been shut down after an employee of the Penrith club tested positive after coming into contact with another person outside the industry .
