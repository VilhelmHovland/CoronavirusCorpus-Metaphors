Scientists reveal how Covid-19 attacks humans  There are many jokes and memes doing the rounds about coronavirus , not least of all the one that Karen -- it could be Debbie , Caitlin , Jade or Charlotte -- is an expert on all things Covid-19 .
The bottom line is that there 's always a know-it-all on Facebook , or the Daily Me , as media expert Nicholas Negroponte calls the social media platforms that have replaced the mass media outlets and allowed individuals to filter what they see .
Personalising media feeds can be useful , but it can also be damaging and contribute to fake news .
In this piece , The Wall Street Journal separates fact from fiction on how the coronavirus attacks us .
It moves away from what Karen knows to what the scientists have ascertained about how Covid-19 shows up .
As we all sit on our couches locked in self-isolation , these symptoms are worth mulling over .
Got a cough or fever ? Let 's hope you have got a mild dose of Covid-19 so that the deadly plague of the 21st century , which has brought much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

How the Coronavirus Attacks Your Body  By Sumathi Reddy  ( The Wall Street Journal ) -- It starts , most often , with a cough or a sneeze .
Thousands of tiny , often invisible droplets of saliva or mucus disperse in the air .
You walk by -- within 6 feet of the offender -- and inadvertently inhale the droplets .
The novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 begins like most other respiratory viruses .
Scientists are still studying what happens in the body when someone gets infected and how the virus in some patients progresses to the lungs , causing viral pneumonia , difficulty breathing , and even death .
The race to better understand the virus comes as global death tolls spiral , patients flood emergency rooms , and hospitals at the centre of the growing US crisis clamour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the virus works as they go .
But there are some things scientists know based on how other similar respiratory viruses work .
That coupled with recent case reports from infected patients in China and Washington state have given scientists a basic understanding of how it works though they say there is still much to be learned .
The virus most commonly enters the nose through minuscule droplets from someone 's mucus or saliva , says Steve Lawrence , an infectious disease physician at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St .
Louis .
This is the primary way of spreading the virus , which is why public health experts and governments are focusing on social distancing as a prevention strategy .
It can also enter through the eyes or mouth .

The coronavirus is distinguished by spiky proteins on its surface ; these spikes latch onto cell membranes .
The virus then enters the cells and disassembles so its RNA -- molecules that carry instructions from DNA to the body 's cells -- can start to reproduce .
" You can find very high levels of virus in the nasal passages even before people have developed cough and fevers , suggesting that it is initially an upper respiratory infection , " says Daniel Kuritzkes , chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston .
Though most people likely start with an upper respiratory infection , it 's also possible that respiratory droplets are inhaled more deeply and go directly into the lungs , says Brian Garibaldi , an associate professor of pulmonary and critical care at Johns Hopkins University .
" It has a special protein that binds more tightly to cells in the lower respiratory tract , " he says .
Wherever it lands , the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viral particles that flood the body .
" Like other viruses it takes over the cellular machinery of the cell and makes more copies of itself and spreads , " says Dr .
Garibaldi .
When your immune system recognises there 's a new virus in your body it starts using signalling molecules called cytokines to start calling in reinforcements to the site of infection .
" Many of those cytokines end up causing a fever , " says Dr .
Garibaldi .
Once the virus has attacked enough cells in the upper respiratory system , most people will start to feel symptoms .
This happens on average five days after being exposed to the virus but it can be sooner or as many as two weeks later , studies show .
These early symptoms usually include a dry cough and fever , and sometimes a sore throat , as well as aches and fatigue .
Loss of taste and smell have also been reported as early signs of infection .
For the majority of people -- roughly 80% according to reports from China -- the symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But for some people , predominantly older people and those with other medical conditions , the virus keeps traveling down and invading cells in the lungs .
When the cells start moving down the respiratory system into the lungs it becomes a lower respiratory illness , which is considered more serious .
That could happen two to seven days after symptoms start , says Dr .
Kuritzkes .
Once the virus starts infecting the cells that line the air sacs in the lungs , viral pneumonia develops , which is inflammation of the lungs .
Shortness of breath is an indication that the virus is damaging the lungs .
" Those people who develop pneumonia or get seriously ill , it 's because they 've had infection of the lung itself , not just the upper airways , " says Dr .
Kuritzkes .
And the lungs often face a two-way assault .
There is damage from the virus but a second equally debilitating response takes place : The body 's own immune system goes into overdrive , causing more lung damage .
Some patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white blood cells that flood the infection site in the lungs , causing damage .
They secrete a lot of cytokines that enhance the inflammation , says Dr .
Kuritzkes .
" That can make it difficult for people to breathe .
All this fluid that accumulates and all these extra cells that do n't belong there create a barrier for oxygen exchange , " he says .
One key feature that distinguishes Covid-19 from other viruses such as the flu is the high frequency of pneumonia , even in people with only mildly symptomatic cases , he says .
Studies of Covid-19 patients whose lungs were examined show several distinctive and unusual patterns .
Adam Bernheim , a cardiothoracic radiologist at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York , and co-researchers studied the chest CT chest scans of 121 positive coronavirus patients from China .
They published their results in the journal Radiology last month .
The researchers found a striking pattern : The pneumonia progressed along the lungs ' outer edges , as evidenced by hazy , gray circular spots .
" A normal lung is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernheim .
" In coronavirus with pneumonia , air is being replaced by cells , inflammation , fluid , debris and pus , so it starts to turn gray or even white .
"  The spots developed in some patients within two days of symptom onset and were nearly universal in patients three days or more later .
Bernheim says the pattern is different from garden-variety bacterial pneumonia that the flu often leads to , which often shows one very dense white area in the lung .
When the lung becomes progressively more damaged , that triggers what is known as acute respiratory distress syndrome , or ARDS .
This typically develops seven to 14 days into the course of the illness .
The lungs become less efficient at exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide and continue to become inflamed .
Patients need assistance breathing because there 's no therapy to treat ARDS .
" The ventilator is buying time for the lung to repair itself after a virus has run its course and the immune system response has calmed down , " says Dr .
Garibaldi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland , Wash .
, published a study in JAMA earlier this month looking at the chest images of the first 21 critically ill Covid-19 patients in the US .
Two-thirds of the patients were from nursing facilities with an average age of 70-years-old and most had chronic medical conditions .
Eighty-four percent required mechanical ventilation and only four people survived , says Dr .
Arentz .
Chest X-rays demonstrated pneumonia in 19 of the 21 patients , all of whom developed ARDS .
Most of the patients who died were unable to maintain adequate oxygen levels due to diseased lungs .
But one-third developed heart failure , which is another way some Covid-19 patients are dying .
Some doctors say that abrupt onset of heart problems seems to be another distinctive trait of Covid-19 -- heart failure was reported with MERS and does occur rarely with the flu , but appears to be a striking feature in some severe cases of Covid-19 , says Dr .
Kuritzkes .
Case reports from other countries , too , show that some Covid-19 patients experience heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Physicians say it 's unclear what 's causing the heart issues .
It could be that people 's hearts weaken , or that the hyperactive response of the immune system stresses the heart .
Though the risk is greater for those with pre-existing heart conditions , there are also reports of patients without heart disease experiencing cardiac failure from Covid-19 , says Dr .
Garibaldi .
" We do n't know if the virus is doing something to the heart or the heart may have been stressed by the patient 's critical illness because a lot of these patients are older and have other health problems , " says Dr .
Arentz .
