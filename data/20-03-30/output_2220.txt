Financial support  Re Canadian Charities Ask Ottawa For $10-billion In Support ( March 27 ) : I certainly empathize with charities .
But after reading the various names and looking up how much some organizations ' administrations are paid , as a taxpayer I would suggest cutting the inflated salaries of the top echelon .
Some of these employees are making hundreds of thousands per year , some over $1-million .
Charities should first reduce payroll and bloat before coming back to the table .

Re Essential Workers Receiving Temporary Pay Boosts ( March 25 ) : Companies currently recognizing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see one glaring omission : Long-term care facilities seem to have failed in following suit and increasing compensation for employees , most notably personal support workers .
PSWs often earn little more than minimum wage , are female and , in Toronto , are first-generation immigrants .
Many are also hired as casual or temporary workers without benefits or pension plans .
Yet LTC facilities remain an epicentre for COVID-19 outbreaks and deaths .
The top brass of Canada 's LTC companies should step forward and immediately , and retroactively , increase compensation for the very workers placing their own lives in danger to care for our frail parents and grandparents .
NoonanToronto  Going the distance  It seems some Canadians still believe the COVID-19 pandemic is blown out of proportion .
I met two such people last week while walking along the river in London , Ont .
Almost everyone respected the two-metre rule , but two men brushed past within a couple of feet .
When I said , " Hey guys , two metres , please , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're that scared , stay home ! " Here 's the problem with that attitude : My right to swing my fist ends at the tip of his nose , but his virus would go right into my lungs .
At my age , I run a higher risk that it will kill me if hospitals are swamped -- by such neglect -- and run out of respirators .
That 's why my space should be respected .

Learning experience  Re As Schools Move Online , Education May Shift Dramatically ( March 26 ) : " The history of education is too often a history of untested assumptions , " I heard in grad school three decades ago .
Perhaps it is still true in our rush to find online solutions to learning during this time .
Reporter Caroline Alphonso hints at the complexities .
Students need to learn many things and many kinds of things : knowledge , skills , habits of mind , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , so we should strive toward the levels of sophistication medical research has achieved in the last century .
I can only hope that we are collecting evidence on the impact of online learning .
Otherwise , we may repeat past mistakes .
John Myers Curriculum instructor , elementary and secondary education , Ontario Institute for Studies in Education , University of Toronto  Children who have difficult home situations may be especially disadvantaged in the coming months without the sanctuary that school provides .
As well , some children reside in households without internet access or computers .
And we know there were already children whose home lives were barely manageable before the adults in their families were suddenly faced with great financial uncertainty .
For many of them , money will not be enough to avoid desperation .
The consequences of not addressing this issue could be large .
Provinces should provide safe and healthy daytime spaces for these children during the COVID-19 crisis .
Years ago , I had a pneumothorax and wound up in ICU .
It happens sometimes to skinny guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck the thousand tubes into me and gave me some morphine , my brain started once again to focus .
Over these three days , I had occasion to reflect : The only things that were worthwhile in my life were my wife and my work .
Life took on a new perspective .
Needless to say , the pneumothorax did not occur in the United States .
Bankruptcy would have been upper-most in my mind otherwise .
At the edge of life , which presently cuts through northern Italy , philosophy should give way to theology ; the only tale worth telling boldly gestures toward a transcendent horizon .
Imagining myself in the shoes of a suffocating coronavirus patient , I find genuine hope in Father Giuseppe Berardelli , the Italian priest who recently died after giving up his own ventilator so that another man could live .
Or in the dozens of other priests who have risked death and paid the price , so they could remind dying patients , in shaky voices , that life is not absurd .
Patrick SmithEdmonton  Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computer Tourney For Canadian Baseball Crown ( Sports , March 25 ) : I fell in love with baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays in 1985 , and have fond memories listening to Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth 's broadcasts through my pillow and checking the box scores in the paper before heading out on my paper route .
The Globe 's Canadian in silico tournament is a welcome distraction in these strange times .
Kudos to reporter Brad Wheeler for convincing baseball writing .
What would really make every Canadian baseball fan 's day is if Mr .
Howarth would come out of retirement and call even just one of these Strat-O-Matic games for us .
Please , Jerry ?  Yolanda WiersmaSt .
