Original Jem Voice Actor Updates Classic PSA for COVID-19  A feature of many 1980s cartoons were " Public Service Announcements , " which offered lessons on some of the more complex aspects of growing up and being a responsible individual .
The most famous example comes from G .
Joe and its famous catchphrase , " Knowing is half the battle ! "  But other children 's cartoons of the time followed suit , including superhero rock stars Jem and the Holograms .
In the wake of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , original Jem voice actor Samantha Newark has shared a remixed PSA from her original run on the show , instructing fans on how to mitigate the spread of the disease .
In the original PSA , Jem is warning a group of children to never take medications unless a parent or guardian is nearby .
A young boy feeling ill is offered medication by a friend who has just picked it up for a parent .
Jem warns them of the dangers of taking drugs without parental supervision .
The remixed version also addresses the use of medications , but instead notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that social distancing practices are the best methods of stopping the spread of the virus and keeping oneself healthy .
Newark 's new voice over is a perfect match for her old Jem work , allowing one of the icons of the last century to lend a hand in our time of need .
Jem , or Jem and the Holograms , ran for three seasons from 1985 to 1988 , and featured the voices of Samantha Newark , Cathianne Blore , Cindy McGee and Linda Dangcil .
