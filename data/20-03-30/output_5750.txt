CEBU , Philippines -- After hotels and accommodation facilities in Cebu logged lousy occupancy rates , another sector of the local economy , the transport sector , has reported suffering the unwanted effects of coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) .
Local land transport industry players , including operators of taxis , buses , and jeepneys , said they are now on the verge of bankruptcy and crisis given the scanty to zero bookings since late February .
The same situation is faced by some 120 other tourist buses operating in Cebu , he said .
" Very affected .
Zero bookings now .
Problema namo ang day to day nga pang-kaon sa mga drivers and family .
Bayad sa amortization and all other fixed expenses .
Mas daghan ma-bankrupt sa COVID kaysa mahawaan ( Our problem is the daily provisions for the drivers and their families .
Plus , there are the amortization and all other fixed expenses .
More people will go bankrupt with COVID than those who will contract the disease ) , " said Yu .
Yu said the tourist buses ' main market are the foreign tourists , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clientele .
The rest are local tourists .
" When the Chinese tourists were banned here in January , the bookings significantly declined .
It was manageable then because there were still the Koreans , but when the Koreans were also banned , it worsened , " Yu said in Cebuano .
Because of the present situation , land transport operators are now relying on the small market of local tourists who have booked them for company outings/tours , school tours , pilgrimage , among others .
But another problem arose .
" There are no more classes so no more school tours .
And the pilgrimage activities have been cancelled .
There are no company tours as well .
So tourist buses are now practically left with zero bookings , " said Yu .
As an interim solution , Yu said they are finding ways to employ their drivers as company or family drivers .
Buses affected  The pinch is not only felt by the tourist bus operators .
Julieto Flores , spokesperson of Cebu Provincial Bus Operators Association and president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are affected even if their main market is the local tourists or passengers .
" People are afraid of taking the bus , especially the airconditioned ones , because of the risk of contracting the virus , " he added .
But since there are still passengers who opt to go to their hometowns , especially on weekends , Flores said he already issued a memorandum to all members to provide alcohol for these passengers .
Flores said if the pandemic remains in the next few months , the volume of passengers will also continue to dwindle .
Taxis , too  Chiquito Obeso , vice president of Metro Cebu Taxi Operators Association , said more and more taxi drivers no longer ply .
Out of the 6,200 taxi units in Cebu , Obeso estimates only around 3,000 units are operational .
But MCTOA president Richard Cabucos estimates that of those 3,000 taxi units , only around 1,000 are actually plying the streets .
Cabucos owns 136 units of Richielda Taxi , of which only 46 units are actually operating .
Cabucos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their usual places of convergence such as the malls .
Obeso , owner of Spider Taxi and general manager of Airland Taxi and Scorpion Taxi , said that he has 400 units in his fleet but the number of drivers is only at 180 currently .
He expects this number to further go down next week , with no local tourists around .
Obeso , also the vice president of Cebu City Airport Taxi Operators Inc .
, which operates yellow taxis at the Mactan-Cebu International Airport , said that his drivers have suffered from the lack of passengers .
Cabucos , president of CCATOI , said that he has 120 units of yellow taxi but only 40 are actually operating .
Jeepneys , a basic mode of transportation among Cebuanos , are not also spared .
Perez said that PISTON-Cebu has over 500 members-drivers and so far , none among his members have stopped driving despite the dwindling number of passengers .
No overcharging  As if to add salt to the injury , public utility vehicles are required to carry up to only half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart " scheme in efforts to help contain spread of the virus .
Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board-7 Director Eduardo Montealto said the regional agency will adopt the directive of the central office to reduce vehicle capacity by 50 percent but not double the amount of fare collected .
Violators , he added , will be slapped with a P5,000 fine for overcharging .
Montealto said that a mini-bus with a capacity of 50 should now accommodate only 25 passengers .
Same as jeepneys .
The LTFRB-7 director is calling for extra patience and understanding on the part of the riding public as the government strives to contain the virus .
