Willem Buiter compares the plans for monetary-financed deficit spending in the United States , Britain and Europe  With the COVID-19 pandemic intensifying , the United States has just adopted a $2 trillion economic-rescue package ( equal to 9 .
of 2019 GDP ) .
The legislation follows unprecedented actions by the US Federal Reserve , which will engage in open-ended quantitative easing , and has introduced new mechanisms to backstop businesses and keep credit flowing .
Much of the US response will come in the form of " helicopter money , " an application of Modern Monetary Theory ( MMT ) in which the central bank finances fiscal stimulus by purchasing government debt issued to finance tax cuts or public spending increases .
The US economy is deteriorating at a spectacular rate , partly because of the direct health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic , but mostly as a result of social-distancing mandates that are preventing people from producing and consuming .
Given the circumstances , it is safe to assume that the Fed 's incremental asset-purchase program will reach at least $2 trillion if that is what it takes to spare the federal government from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives .
In January , before the coronavirus had become a recognized threat , the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the US government would have an annual recurring federal deficit above $1 trillion for at least the next decade .
A few weeks ago , when the severity of the crisis started to become clear , some federal officials warned that US unemployment could rise to 20% in the absence of a strong fiscal-policy response .
But even with the new legislation , job losses could continue to mount in the second and third quarters of this year .
To be effective , the fiscal support must be targeted meticulously at households that have lost incomes and at companies ( large and small ) that have lost revenues as a result of the pandemic .
It remains to be seen if the US response will include such targeting , or whether such targeting is even feasible in a timely and orderly fashion .
Meanwhile , the United Kingdom is also pursuing a vigorous experiment in MMT/helicopter money .
For starters , the Bank of England is preparing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of UK government bonds and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds -- a monetary stimulus equal to just under 10% of 2019 GDP .
And on the fiscal side , Rishi Sunak , the new Chancellor of the Exchequer , is unleashing an avalanche of deficit-increasing stimulus measures .
For the calendar year 2020 , the British government is looking at a deficit of at least 7 .
of GDP , and perhaps as high as 10% .
But even at the upper end , the deficit would still fall within the range covered by the BOE 's monetized debt purchases .
In other words , despite the extraordinary size of the fiscal stimulus , the government still will not have to go to the markets to borrow .
There is less fiscal space in the eurozone .
But the European Central Bank has already committed to net asset purchases of ? 120 billion ( $130 billion ) , in addition to the ? 750 billion it announced on March 18 .
Its new Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program will even buy Greek sovereign bonds , something that was ruled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 .
All told , the ECB 's additional asset purchases ( which typically are monetized ) amount to just under 7 .
of the eurozone 's 2019 GDP , placing its response somewhere below that of the US and the UK .
Unfortunately , the bloc 's fiscal policy has been utterly pathetic .
On March 16 , member states ' finance ministers announced that they would pursue stimulus worth a meager 1% of GDP over the course of 2020 -- and this for an economy that was already struggling to achieve growth .
While eurozone leaders indicated that they would do more if needed , that is scant comfort .
The only positive development on this front is a commitment to institute liquidity facilities -- public-guarantee schemes and deferred-tax payments -- worth at least 10% of GDP .
Because the eurozone lacks a serious central facility with independent budgetary powers , the European Stability Mechanism ( ESM ) is the obvious institution through which financially strong member states could provide politically transparent support for weaker members should the need arise .
And yet , there does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ESM could be used in this way .
The remaining option , then , is for member states to increase their national fiscal-stimulus programs to , say , 7 .
of GDP , while the ECB acts as the monetary helicopter .
This , however , would engage the ECB in quasi-fiscal actions involving cross-country redistributions of fiscal risk , requiring either a change in existing treaties or a collective willingness to ignore the obvious legitimacy issues raised by such operations .
Unlike in the US and the UK , where there is one central bank for one country , the ECB can not so easily assume the role of fiscal agent for the government .
Euro-system purchases of , say , Italian sovereign debt would shift sovereign risk to the national central banks of the financially stronger member states and , ultimately , to those countries ' taxpayers .
But even if that is the case , it would be criminally negligent to allow a design flaw in existing treaties to inhibit the appropriate use of helicopter money at a time of existential crisis .
Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDP -- most likely more -- and some combination of the ECB and the ESM must enable it to do so .

5 Comments  Comment Filter  MMT is not something that needs to be introduced or adopted , it is a description of how a sovereign currency issuing governments finances always operate .
Even here in little old NZ , government spending must come first before taxing and borrowing and every dollar that the government spends is a new dollar .
MMT is a useful framework to understand the effects of all these monetary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helicopter money " ( which is not helicopter money , but QE / direct monetary financing ) .
MMT is about describing how money moves in the macroeconomy ( government spending in / taxation out , private bank loans in / repayments out ) ; how that affects inflation/deflation , private/household debt ; and what that means for the real economy .
Real resources are the key : we-the-people can always afford what we-the-people can do .
JK most likely at this point silently try to assist NZ through backdoor means , another direct visit to CCP no 1 , special quarantined jet with collection of mask from both NZ &amp; OZ , collected and fly over to Beijing as good will sign .
Beijing shall reign a helicopter funds assistance for NZ in every sectors - Rest assured , we are all safe here .
The immediate question becomes ; can the EU technocrats con the German people into this ? Or will Germany leave the Euro , as the Italians suggested as the easiest and fastest solution to the Euro disaster zone ?  Beyond that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk deepest from the EU cup take ? .
