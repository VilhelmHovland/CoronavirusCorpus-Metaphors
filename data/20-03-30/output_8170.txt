NYU Langone Health , one of the nation 's top academic medical centers , told emergency-room doctors that they have " sole discretion " to place patients on ventilators and institutional backing to " withhold futile intubations .
"  A March 28 email from Robert Femia , who heads the New York health center 's department of emergency medicine , underscored the life-or-death decisions placed on the shoulders of bedside physicians as they treat increasing numbers of coronavirus patients with a limited supply of ventilators .
New York state guidelines , established in 2015 , recommend that hospitals appoint a triage officer or committee -- someone other than the attending physician -- to decide who gets a ventilator when rationing is necessary .
The guidelines say that removing the decision from the physician treating the patient avoids a conflict of interest , allows an officer or committee with access to overall ventilator availability to make the call and prevents health worker burnout and stress .
Femia said in his email , which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal , that experts and leaders at NYU Langone were creating internal guidance on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City .
But the emergency department could n't afford to wait , he said .
" In Emergency Medicine , we do not have the luxury of time , data , or committees to help with our critical triage decisions , " he wrote .
" Senior hospital leadership recognizes this and supports us to use our best clinical judgment .
"  Dr .
Femia wrote that decisions about " airway management " and whether to use a ventilator or other respiratory support devices were at the sole discretion of treating physicians , but he told doctors to " think more critically about who we intubate .
"  " For those patients who you feel intubation will not change their ultimate clinical outcome ( for example cardiac arrests , some chronic disease patients at end of life , etc ) you will have support in your decision making at the department and institutional level to withhold futile intubations , " he wrote , referring to the tubes attached to ventilators that are inserted in the mouths of patients and sit above the lungs .
Jim Mandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Femia 's email outlined guidance that had long been in place .

Mandler added that NYU Langone was " not at the point in which these judgments need to be made within the current scope of care .
"  Dr .
Femia 's email came amid a surge in patients at NYU Langone hospitals .
NYU Langone Medical Center in Manhattan recorded 332 coronavirus patients in hospital beds on Monday , an 84% increase since Thursday , according to internal figures sent to staffers .
Another 125 patients were in intensive care on Monday , more than double the number reported by the hospital on Thursday , according to the internal figures .
At NYU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 21 over that same period .
NYU medical-school residents also treat patients at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue , the city 's largest public hospital , which had 448 coronavirus patients in intensive care as of Monday , according to the figures .
Some NYU Langone doctors said they were unsettled by Dr .
Femia 's email .
" Asking ED physicians to make snap judgments about how well a patient will do based on little to no information is a tremendous burden to place on them , " one doctor said .
" As a doctor , I do n't know how to make the call , " another said .
The doctor said so far there was no evidence of anyone withholding care from patients .
But what the email calls for " seems way too close to playing God .
"  The same day doctors received the guidance from Dr .
Femia , they also got a reminder not to speak to news reporters without permission from NYU Langone 's Office of Communications and Marketing .
Kathy Lewis , executive vice president for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langone 's longstanding policy required faculty , residents and staff to forward all media inquiries to her office .
" Anyone who does not adhere to this policy , or who speaks or disseminates information to the media without explicit permission of the Office of Communications and Marketing , will be subject to disciplinary action , including termination , " Ms .
Lewis wrote .
