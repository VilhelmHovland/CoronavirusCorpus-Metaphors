Ventilators can help some of the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients who start losing the ability to breathe on their own .

There are about 160,000 ventilators available in America but as many as 740,000 could be needed , according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security .
some automakers are even switching from building cars to ventilators .
They are teaming up with existing ventilator makers to help them ramp up production .

But it 's a race against time .
Already , sick patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is headed for a situation like the one that played out in Italy , where ventilator shortages forced doctors to choose which patients get to use the potentially lifesaving machines .

Ventilator makers are under pressure to sharply increase production even as the pandemic has disrupted the transport and supply of crucial parts , such as hoses , valves , motors and electronics -- some of which come from China .
In Italy , the government is turning to help from the military , enlisting other manufacturers and even looking to 3D printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life-saving breathing machines .
A team of doctors has developed a way to provide oxygen to two people from one ventilator , therefore doubling capacity , according to the Italian region of Emilia Romagna 's commissioner for coronavirus .
