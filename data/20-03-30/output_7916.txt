PETERSBURG , Fla .
-- OneBlood will soon begin collecting plasma from people who have recovered from the novel coronavirus .
This is called Covid-19 convalescent plasma .
The FDA has given emergency permission to allow this treatment to be used for critically ill people .
That plasma will then be transfused to people with life-threatening coronavirus infections in hopes of helping them recover .
OneBlood walked us through how this works .
People who recover from coronavirus have developed antibodies that remain in the plasma .
Transfusing that plasma to a person fighting the virus can boost their immune system .
" We already have all the processes in place to collect and test blood donations , including plasma donations .
There are additional protocols that are being required per the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this " says Susan Forbes , senior vice president with OneBlood .
This is something Forbes says has been around since the 19th Century .
It 's been used for other viruses like polio or measles and has shown success .
