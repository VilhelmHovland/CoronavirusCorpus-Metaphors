Eales says MLS is more fortunate than other leagues around the world that play the traditional fall-to-spring schedule and may have trouble completing their seasons in such a compressed time frame .
MLS was just two weeks into its season when play was halted March 12 because of the pandemic .
The league has set a tentative return date of May 10 , though the growing death toll in the United States could force that date to be pushed back .
Eales says everything is on the table , including the possibility of resuming league play in empty stadiums .

" We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

That slot is now taken by the Tokyo Olympics .
The governing body of track quickly committed to pushing back its world championships to 2022 .

-- -- --  The governing body of triathlon says it wanted the rescheduled Olympics to be held earlier in the year to avoid the summer heat but has accepted the new dates .

The IOC and Japanese organizers last week postponed the Olympics until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic .
This year 's games were scheduled to open on July 24 and close on Aug .
But the near exact one-year delay will see the rescheduled closing ceremony on Aug .
There had been talk of switching the Olympics to spring , a move that would coincide with the blooming of Japan 's famous cherry blossoms .
But it would also clash with European soccer and North American sports leagues .
