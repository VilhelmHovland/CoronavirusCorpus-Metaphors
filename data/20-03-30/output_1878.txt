Staying calm in the face of the Covid-19 storm  Last week , a 62-year-old patient under investigation for Covid-19 was found dead in Serdang Hospital .
Initial investigations suggest that the patient killed himself .
He was suspected of suffering from depression .
This incident , and many others , has highlighted the issue of mental health , which has long been stigmatised and not really talked about .
With the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) now extended to April 14 , the medical fraternity has called on the public to focus on their mental and emotional well-being as reports of cabin fever and other mental conditions triggered by the current crisis are on the rise .
" We live in unprecedented circumstances where there is an overarching sense of ambiguity and lack of control .
It is understandable that everyone is confronting their own challenges and may not fully recognise or understand their internal and external responses to this environment , " says Ivy Tan , head of counselling at ThoughtFull Hub PLT .
ThoughtFull is a mission-led start-up working to improve access to mental health services by making it more accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety are possible and common reactions during a crisis .
" As humans , we are hardwired for the fight-or-flight response .
Some can persevere through such challenging situations to build resilience .
If we have proactively engaged ourselves to practise some form of self-care during such times , these emotions do fade over time as we get back into our routines .
"  However , if not properly dealt with , these emotions can become excessive and disruptive .
" They start interfering with your daily activities .
And if left untreated , they can lower our quality of life because it may lead to decreased productivity at work or school , social isolation or even mental health disorders .
"  According to suicide prevention and support group Befrienders , there has been an increase in the number of calls to its hotline , with people expressing anxiety over financial issues due to their inability to work and restlessness over movement restrictions .
News portal Free Malaysia Today reported that the centre receives an average of 60 calls a day , two-thirds of which are related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important to be honest about our emotions and to be aware of our emotional state , says Tan .
" It is highly recommended that you seek professional help and support should you encounter or know of someone who is experiencing such persistent distress , " she tells Enterprise .
In times of prolonged alarm and stress , mixed emotions are common and it can manifest itself in what may seem like " unusual behaviour " , says Tan .
Everyone responds in their own unique ways to adapt to the current shift and ambiguity , she points out , adding that it is important to pay attention to a loved one 's moods , instead of taking the behaviour at face value .
" If we do notice a shift in moods or behaviour , try to refrain from blaming and shaming as that will only intensify the distress and create a relationship setback in the long term .
Rather , look out for their strengths and practise gratitude towards each other .
It could be as simple as saying ' please ' and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to communicate how one feels to people who understand and accept their feelings , she adds .
" Talk to a trusted family member or friend about your concerns .
Staying connected helps you build a healthy relationship and strong support system .
In times of extraordinary circumstances , however , our usual support systems may not be enough , so do not be afraid to ask for extra support .
" If you are still feeling distress and it is affecting your daily life , reach out to professionals .
Psychologists and counsellors can provide supportive coaching at such times , even if it is as simple as giving a third-party perspective or keeping you accountable .
In the light of the situation , telehealth services , such as ThoughtFullChat and others , are accessible through phone , mobile apps and online platforms .
"  She also advises people to engage in healthy activities that will bring them comfort and stability at this time .
" For example , getting restful sleep , eating a well-balanced meal or exploring some indoor exercises and activities .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
A good starting point is to exercise once a day or in small amounts throughout the day .
" For those who do not normally exercise , it could be as simple as starting with deep breathing or body stretches .
We could also engage in activities that have mental and emotional healing impact such as journaling , making art , cooking , meditating , listening to music or carrying out religious and spiritual practices .
In times of duress , anything that goes under the umbrella of ' self-care ' is essential .
"  Tan says it is pivotal to develop a routine to adapt to the " new normal " as the grounding effects of having a structure is powerful and restores our sense of normality .
For personal routines , it could be creating an exercise schedule , setting aside time for podcasts or audiobooks , committing to specific hours of work and taking breaks in between , she adds .
For family routines , it could be planning meal times , play and home-schooling time with children .
For couples , setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space is important , especially when creating space is more difficult than before .
" It could be retreating to a separate room or corner in your home for an hour or two each day to ensure a healthy balance between time spent together and time spent apart , " says Tan .
Recognising the stress caused by the MCO and fear of the pandemic , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , in its " Mental Health and Psychosocial Considerations During Covid-19 Outbreak " statement , advises people to minimise watching , reading or listening to news about it .
While Tan reiterates WHO 's recommendation , saying that the sudden and near-constant stream of news reports on the pandemic can cause anyone to feel anxious and worried , she appeals to the public to be mindful of the source of the information to avoid being overwhelmed .
" Keeping ourselves informed of the latest news about the situation can ease our nervousness and stress or anxiety that results from uncertainty .
However , before we start reading , take a moment to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source ? Is this information evidence-based ?  " There are many helpful resources available on social media , but there are also unregulated news sources that may lead to more distress and chaos if we are not making informed choices of the knowledge that we pick up .
So , always look for facts versus opinion .
Under duress , we tend not to filter the information accurately .
" Prolonged exposure to crisis news may cause duress .
So , to avoid excessive exposure , set a time to watch , listen or read the updates from official websites .
"  ThoughtFull is responding to this situation by extending its services to the public , says founder and CEO Joan Low .
ThoughtFullChat , which is in its testing phase , is now open to all so they can access affordable emotional support and daily bite-sized coaching through the mobile chat platform from the safety of their homes .
ThoughtFull has also launched an ' Ask Me Anything ' campaign on Instagram and Facebook so that individuals can ask their certified mental health professionals any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From this campaign , we have received a wide range of questions , mostly surrounding the following topics : 1 ) management of stress , anxiety and transitions on a personal level ; 2 ) management of stress , anxiety and transitions on a family level ; 3 ) adapting and navigating these changes in their professional setting , " says Low .
