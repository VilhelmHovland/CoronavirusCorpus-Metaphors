Coronavirunomics : How the financial world is shaping up  Coronavirus infection ( aka COVID-19 ) , is spreading worldwide like bushfire .
Like the fallout from a nuclear explosion , no one , no country , is immune from its deadly effect .
It is a pandemic on the much heralded biblical ( apocalyptic ) proportions in its scale and reach .
It is more than just a disease ; it is a rude awakening for humanity .
There are two dimensions to it though ; the medical and the economics .
' Coronavirunomics ' as we name it here , is the economics of survival within the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic .
The $2tn emergency spending just passed by the United States Congress , largest in its history ( 10% of its GDP ) , and already signed into law ( in a country with natural disdain for government intervention ) represents a good example of this newest economic doctrine .
Other countries are bound to do likewise sooner or later .
It is the defining moment of our generation .
Its consequences will linger long after the scientists have come up with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " inflation " , " tariffs " , " growth " " employment " " work ethics " " deadlines " " bottom lines " " vacation " and " family values " in a way unimaginable even a couple of months ago .
It is on a par with the " dot com " revolution of the 1990s whose impact has reshaped humanity beyond recognition .
The airwaves are filled to the point of saturation in the West not only with the medical , but also with the financial implications on the stock market , distribution of goods , interest rates , quantitative easing , panic buying , growth forecast , recession , etc .
It could lead to a global financial meltdown on the scale not witnessed since 2008 , according to the International Monetary Fund as well as the European Central Bank .
Treasury ministers across Western capitals are scouring around to debate , and decide on emergency economic measures ( cut in interest rate , mortgage freeze , unemployment pay , small business rebate , etc ) , to cushion the effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By contrast , in Africa , the focus has been almost exclusively on the medical ; absence of test kits , inadequate medical personnel , lack of manpower , porous borders , containment , and self-isolation in naturally cramped environments .
It is almost as if we are living , in this part of the world , on an economic island , totally divorced from the happenings elsewhere .
Almost as if our leaders on this side of the Atlantic have connived to hand to the Europeans , Americans , and others , the response and strategy for the economics , while we concentrate solely on the medical .
Why are we not banging on the economic impact more forcefully , and measures to curtail it ? Is it another " Third World " , " underdeveloped " mind-set ? We just sit and wait on Western governments to do what is right for their own economies , then , accuse them of not having thought enough of us ? If predictions come to pass , Africa could yet be the repository of the greatest proportion of the casualties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent becomes a real basket case , relying on Western charities and celebrities to make our case .
The West 's main concern in this regard is in not allowing our innate inability to cope with a major disaster become a secondary issue for them later on .
So , what are the immediate economic challenges , and the measures being talked about to ameliorate them ? First , it is about the stock market going down .
The stock market is where large companies go to borrow money to keep their business going .
It usually involves millions and billions of dollars changing hands in minutes and hours .
When it goes down , it usually means money going out of those businesses , reducing their capacity to invest in new equipment , expand their productive capacity and create jobs .
Eventually , if this continues , workers will be laid off , and prices of consumer goods will go up .
There are a number of things governments do to ameliorate this .
It is called providing ' stimulant ' , meaning , encouragement to market participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ' monetary ' tool , meaning , that central banks will act to cut the rate at which people borrow money in order to encourage them to take risks .
In Nigeria , for example , the cost of borrowing money is already too high .
It ranges from 15-35% even higher in some extreme cases .
The CBN can do very little to cut this directly , but it can engineer a cut in inter-bank rates .
If there is a diminution in the rate at which banks lend to each other , it is hoped that this will be passed on to customers .
Another thing being done in Western economies is what is called " quantitative easing " , which means in ordinary parlance , government pumping money into the economy .
There are so many means open to government to do this , mainly through their capital markets , but also , ultimately , printing money .
The situation we have in Nigeria is that the CBN is forever afraid of doing this kind of thing because we have a stubbornly high rate of inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( 16% ) inflation .
It is structural , meaning , that it is in-built because we lack the capacity to produce and sell .
Inflation in advanced economies in the West is hovering around one , two , three , four , or five per cent .
What then will the government do when demand is choked up later on ?  There is hardly a single African country without a huge borrowing gap in their budget .
This runs into trillions of naira in our own case .
The globalised nature of the world economy makes this even more acute .
When China suffers heavily from coronavirus , which started in their country , their growth forecast has been revised down as a result .
And , this affects the supply chain throughout the world , as China is responsible for 1/5 of the world 's GDP .
China has also been investing heavily in economies throughout Africa , in the billions of dollars .
This will inevitably be revised down as well .
So , there is every likelihood of a recession happening at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make ends meet .
The price of crude oil has already dropped from $57 to $22 , and it is scheduled to drop even further down .
Our currency is struggling to maintain its value , which means we will pay more for consumer items .
These are some of the little things , everyday issues , that are not being talked about .
They have been exacerbated by coronavirunomics .
That said , the main area that government in African countries ought to direct the most attention is debt re-scheduling .
If you have less revenue coming in , you are not selling as much , and you rely on borrowing from outside the continent , the gap for servicing the debt will widen and unless you start renegotiating the terms of repayment now , we are all heading for the rocks in the near future .
The way things are shaping up , African countries may soon be forced into the arena of asking for debt forgiveness again .
Not repayment , but ' forgiveness ' .
Even if this materialises , it is bad news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch in capitalism .
If lenders are going to take a hit for having lent us money in the first place , it will make the terms of any future lending even more unfavourable , creating a vicious circle of borrowing for consumption , reduced industrial capacity , and increased poverty .
Our focus on the medical side of the virus to the exclusion of its economic ramifications may be wise , but it is rather foolish .
If we do not prepare for the economic fallout , then , that leaves us vulnerable to the consequences of any spillover from the financial sector .
It leaves us sitting ducks basically .
It is not too late , but the window of opportunity for countermeasures is closing .
