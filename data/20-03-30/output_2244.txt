How 24-team Stanley Cup Playoffs could look after halted season  NHL insider Justin Bourne joins Good Show with Ben Ennis ( in studio ) and J .
Bunkis ( via phone ) to discuss why it will be much more challenging and unlikely for the NHL to salvage their season then any other of the major sports .
Four days into what will likely be a long period of self-quarantine , I know I can certainly use something fun to think about .
Even though the prospect of seeing the Stanley Cup lifted this summer seems to grow dimmer with each passing day , the timeline spelled out in Monday 's memo to NHL players does appear to leave room for what is believed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  A 24-team , play-in style playoff format designed to maximize revenues -- hello Montreal and Chicago ! -- while including every hopeful from a regular season that will almost certainly be halted at 85-per-cent completion .
It would be a touch gimmicky , yes , but not completely without precedent across NHL history ( more on that later ) .
It would ensure that every team with a .
percentage or better gets in .
And in theory , at least , it would create the kind of gauntlet you want any champion to survive before getting its name etched into the rounded silver edges of the Cup .
How likely it is to happen is impossible to say .
This is still very much pie-in-the-sky with those at the highest levels of the league focused almost exclusively on navigating the events of the minute and hour during this ever-expanding coronavirus outbreak .
The NHL still does n't know exactly what kind of window it will get to stage a playoff tournament -- or if it will be left with one at all -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are looking at every contingency and what 's doable , so , yes , everything for consideration is on the table .
It does n't mean that any of those are going to happen , " commissioner Gary Bettman cautioned Friday during an appearance on Hockey Central .
Just for fun , let 's try our hand at one possibility .
Rumours about a potential 24-team tournament have started spreading on social media because multiple NHL front offices believe that 's the preferred direction under these special circumstances .
According to sources , that format would see eight teams get a bye -- Boston , Tampa , Washington and Philadelphia in the East , and St .
Louis , Colorado , Vegas and Edmonton in the West -- while the next 16 participate in a best-of-three play-in .
Those initial games could be held across four days in a fashion similar to how the NHL began the 1978 Stanley Cup Playoffs and set the matchups for Round 1 .
The concept is n't without seeding challenges .
Teams had played an uneven number of games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points percentage would have to be used .
And there 's also a belief among clubs that there would need to be a nod to the divisions rather than just a straight conference ranking .
That would see Toronto bumped to a higher seed as the team with the third-best points percentage in the Atlantic Division , and Edmonton and Vancouver seeded higher due to their standing in the Pacific .
The seedings could end up looking something like this as a result :  East  1 .
Boston ( .
)  2 .
Tampa ( .
)  3 .
Washington ( .
)  4 .
Philadelphia ( .
)  5 .
Pittsburgh ( .
)  6 .
Toronto ( .
, 3rd Atlantic )  7 .
Carolina ( .
)  8 .
Islanders ( .
)  9 .
Columbus ( .
)  10 .
Florida ( .
)  11 .
Rangers ( .
)  12 .
Montreal ( .
)  West  1 .
Louis ( .
)  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( .
)  4 .
Edmonton ( .
, 2nd Pacific )  5 .
Dallas ( .
)  6 .
Vancouver ( .
, 3rd Pacific )  7 .
Nashville ( .
)  8 .
Calgary ( .
)  9 .
Winnipeg ( .
)  10 .
Minnesota ( .
)  11 .
Arizona ( .
)  12 .
Chicago ( .
)  Using these assumptions , the play-in series would look like this :  Pittsburgh vs .
Montreal  Toronto vs .
Rangers  Carolina vs .
Florida  N .
Islanders vs .
Columbus  Dallas vs .
Chicago  Vancouver vs .
Arizona  Nashville vs .
Minnesota  Calgary vs .
Winnipeg  Now , from a competitive standpoint there 's an argument to be made for a 22-team tournament that would see Pittsburgh and Dallas each get a bye and then have 6 vs .
11 , 7 vs .
10 and 8 vs .
9 in the play-in round .
But that would drop Montreal and Chicago from the picture , and given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be viewed as kindly as the 24-team setup .
If the NHL manages to get up and running again , everyone will be keen to recoup as much lost revenue as possible -- a challenge made tougher by the fact they 're likely to have empty buildings to start the playoffs , if not the whole way through .
Among the other playoff ideas floating around are a March Madness-style bracket tournament that includes every team .
The league has also let it be known that it 's open to suggestions from team executives .
" I do n't want to speculate as to which direction we 're going in , " Bettman said on Hockey Central last Friday .
" We are analyzing every conceivable option that is available to us and that 's not something that 's static .
In other words , what 's an option today , there may be different options -- fewer options , more options , who knows ? -- next week .
" My hope and expectation is that we can finish the season in some form , award @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that we accomplished that goal of finishing the season for our fans .
"  In these strange times , I hope the commissioner will forgive a little bit of harmless speculation .
