One of Malaysia 's active longest-serving footballers have attempted to clarify Malaysian footballers ' reluctance towards having their wages reduced during the ongoing absence of competitions .
Kuala Lumpur centre back Shukor Adan , in an interview with the Malaysian Football League ( MFL ) , explained that Malaysian footballers ' rejection of paycuts during the global coronavirus outbreak is due to their fear that the decision may be used by Malaysian clubs to avoid paying them altogether .
The Professional Footballers Association of Malaysia last week issued a statement that they will not accept a paycut eventhough clubs are not able to generate revenue at the moment due to the absence of competitions .
" It is the responsibility of the employers to pay their employees .
But the issue is players are worried that the Covid-19 outbreak is being used as an excuse to slash or defer their wages .
" They are aware that there are teams that have constantly failed to pay wages , while other clubs are still hounded by unpaid wage .
The players do n't want any parties to take advantage of the situation , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lumpur , 2019  Shukor Adan .

" All the parties involved need to act professionally in this matter .
In the corporate world , any forms of paycuts and bonus payments are not discussed in the open , " he noted .
