" I wonder if I will be able to string a coherent sentence together in a month 's time "  Kathy Samuel -- head of business partnerships in the division of philanthropy and global engagement  What is different from working in the office ?  The physicality of getting into the office provides a structure to the day .
A few days in , I am feeling the need to recreate a structure to give focus and to be as productive as possible in these changed times .
The first week I was going out for a walk to bookend the start and finish of the day , and a lunchtime stroll , but the seriousness of the situation will curtail that now .
What 's more difficult ?  The work setup .
Living in a small London flat , I do n't have available space to set up a dedicated work station .
Plus also my husband is also WfH so negotiations have to take place about who is using what space , times to have space for video/voice calls .
What 's easier ?  The transition to using Teams has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more efficient with use of time ( do n't have the usual 10 min lag at the beginning of a meeting waiting for someone to arrive who has a diary of back-to-back meetings ) .
Business processes have had to be adapted to work around the situation and some well-established bureaucracy has disappeared overnight and I hope does n't return !  Back in ordinary work times , I relished a WfH day as it gave me opportunity to have a more freeform day and to also have quiet time to focus on some tasks I needed thinking time for .
After a couple of days WfH , I realised how much I was missing going into central London , campus .
I miss being active and moving about between buildings that came with everyday work life on campus .
Personal to me , I realise how the interaction with colleagues and being in the office kept my communication sharp .
I feel my spoken communication is not as sharp as it was last week .
I do wonder if I will be able to coherently string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We want it to stay our ' home ' "  Wim Van der Stede -- professor of accounting and financial management , and head of the department of accounting  Let me start by confessing that working from home was a lot more fun when it was optional instead of required .
That is not surprising by any theory of human behaviour or motivation .
People do n't like things imposed on them ; it erodes their engagement and commitment .
But this was not imposed by a boss who did n't care to give his colleagues a say .
It was thrust on us as an exigency .
This rallies people 's collective spirit , causing them to rise to the challenge .
A different but very powerful type of motivation .
This is why everyone takes it in good stride .
It is truly uplifting how colleagues have got on , are pressing on , and making it work ( from home ) -- pun intended -- with little or no time to prepare .
In my immediate experience , I have heard no one complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it more workable of course , even makeshift .
I do n't care if it 's Teams or Zoom ( although I have a preference ) , as the invitation makes connecting effortless by clicking a link , and voila .
Oops , my old laptop has no mic .
No problem , quickly also sign into the same meeting using my smartphone from the calendar invite on my phone .
Next time smarter ( now , with virtual meetings all the time , the next time is less than two hours later ) by having my daughter 's basic earphones ( the wiry thingies ) plugged in .
Next time smarter again by having a proper headset bluetooth pairing ready to go , plus two screens , as I now also have my tablet set up next to my laptop , plus my smartphone , too , if need be .
A great amount of learning in a very small amount of time , and thus , a learning curve conducive to help " flatten the curve " by being able to and effectively working from home .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a WFH person in normal times , it is me .
I have always made quite a separation between home and the office , probably spending an above-average time in the office ( helped by having a short and easy commute ) .
Home is home , not work , other than things I can do on my smartphone from the sofa like emails .
It is this that I find needs the most getting used to : how and where to " make my office " at home ? It 's not the technology : that I think is great , works as well as it should , and will only get better .
I already used that extensively anyway from anywhere .
It 's the work routines ; the work-home rhythm .
Of course , our " house " is now not only an office ( two offices actually ) but also a school ( two grades actually ) , and yet , we also want it to stay our " home " .
We manage , but in the first two days , we have been moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
As I said , the technology is generally great , even at a basic level ; it 's amazing how far we can push our connectivity with our day-to-day devices .
So good that some are already warning that we may find that we will continue some of these virtual practices long after we have returned to ( the new ) normal .
That would not be a bad thing where it makes sense humanly , environmentally , and economically .
But I personally believe that as humans we will also remain strongly drawn to the value of face-to-face interactions even if our meetings , teaching , and travel goes more mixed between in person and virtual .
We will see .
One thing I already do ( after three days only ) is to not use video when I am having a meeting with just one other person .
The phone for that still works remarkably well ( like it did in 1999 ) .
We do not need to see each other every time we " meet " virtually , and we do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the conference is really only a chat between two people .
This may reduce screen and conference call fatigue .
On the whole , we manage , and we appear to be quite resilient .
But we will always be human , too .
Now there is more community spirit in what can often feel like a very anonymous city  Sandra McNally -- director of the Centre for Vocational Education Research and the education and skills programme at CEP , as well as professor of economics at the University of Surrey  For me , this is the end of week 3 of working from home on a compulsory basis .
I had an early start because I came back from Rome just before the national lockdown in Italy and when I got back , having a cold put me in a high-risk category ( to others if not to myself ) .
By the time it was established I did not have Covid19 , most of my colleagues had started to work from home and now it is all of us .
I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is entirely feasible and even productivity-enhancing .
However , I am in the happy position of not having to teach this semester .
My colleagues at University of Surrey have been exchanging numerous emails about putting their classes online .
Many also need to juggle work with continuous childcare .
I do n't know how they manage .
It 's taken a while to establish a consistent work pattern .
I find that a very rigid one is best for me -- a clear delineation between work time and free time .
And whereas the news and social media used to be a distraction from more humdrum work tasks , I now find that work takes my mind off the anxiety-inducing news .
I 've become much more appreciative of the power of technology to keep in touch with people .
Although I miss all my activities and being around other people , being regularly tuned in on some newly-found app enables the opposite of ' social distancing ' .
My elderly aunt has been introducing all her friends to the joys of FaceTime .
It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing capable of rapid transmission !  Like many others , I wonder if this time in relative seclusion will change me and my work in the longer term .
I hope it does .
I 've come to better appreciate the jobs of ' key workers ' who keep the show on the road during a crisis .
There is more community spirit in what can often feel like a very anonymous city .
This is an awful time , yet it has also brought about much goodness and generosity in people and given more space ( at least for some of us ) to reflect on what 's important .
" I can hear birdsong "  " All we can hear " , said the Italian woman on the news , " are church bells and emergency sirens " .
It 's not like that in London , yet .
As I write this , from the settee in my front room , it 's the first day of lockdown and I can hear birdsong .
And that 's not all -- the North Circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this afternoon the postman delivered my son 's Match of the Day magazine ( it is an " activity special " ) .
Then there are the sounds of children , who would normally be at school , playing .
I 've now worked from home for seven days .
I run the @CEPLSE Twitter account , and today I tweeted Vox .
's interview with Nicholas Bloom , economics professor at Stanford University and a CEP associate .
Professor Bloom conducted a famous study of a Chinese travel agency , which found that working from home made employees more productive and less likely to quit -- perhaps , asked the interviewer , lots of people working from home could be a good thing ?  No .
Professor Bloom pointed out that context is all -- working from home can be lonely and isolating .
In the study it was voluntary and part-time , now it is compulsory and full-on .
We all understand the necessity , but still productivity will be affected .
Mental and physical health will be affected .
Bloom suggests recreating social contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to catch up .
Managers could also make time to talk individually with employees .
And that is what we are doing at CEP .
Three times a week , our group of seven support staff have an 11am virtual coffee .
I dial in from my laptop -- it 's balanced on my " adjustable desk " aka the ironing board .
I like this coffee time .
It 's a break from these days in which things go wrong : I crash out of zoom meetings , forget passwords , the Skype ring tone has invaded my dreams .
But I am not complaining , I am grateful to have this work , at this time .
Although my thoughts do sometimes wander to the dregs in my office coffee cup that will now sit untouched on a sunlit desk for months .
The CEP 's founder director Richard Layard has talked about the things we need to do every day to keep our spirits up ( the challenge of supermarket shopping means we are certainly all trying out new things ) .
He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a society with more fellow feeling .
I hope so .
Above all , I hope we will all get through this .
That our families stay safe and well .
That in 12 weeks ( or sooner , or later ) we will all be back -- to hear colleagues grumbling about their tube ride , to chat with people in the real Bean Counter cafe , to give the IT team a standing ovation .
And I shall wash up that coffee cup .
Thank God for my clingy cats  Sonja Grussendorf -- senior learning technologist  I 'm part of the team tasked with moving our academic colleagues to teaching and supporting learning online .
I 've had an interesting two weeks , where " interesting " does not do the experience any justice .
My workday -- voluntarily , self-imposed -- starts at 6 .
and ends at 16 .
I am a lark where most of my colleagues are night owls and I find it difficult to think coherent thoughts any later than 6pm .
Surprisingly , I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days than I usually do in the office .
I feel close to and supported by them all ; we meet in zoom and teams and moan a bit and laugh a lot ( though some of that may be overwork hysteria ) .
When I do my bit in eden .
( first port of call for eLearning queries ) I have shifted tonally from what used to be soothing hand-holding to efficient , short pointers to our wiki guides .
However , the response from academic and PS staff has only been understanding and effusively grateful , they write only when really stumped and I thank them all for that .
Zoom still allows us to continue giving ' intimate ' care and guidance both to individuals and groups .
This week a definite highlight was ' zooming ' with an academic in our pyjamas at 7am , when her spouse in dressing gown brought breakfast and waved at me .
I hope that all these positive changes will stay with us beyond the Covid-19 crisis .
In particular , educational technology has long had a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that it has become a little clearer that EdTech expertise is quite valuable .
There has been one negative development : if the virus does n't get me , my lifestyle will .
Being at work prevents me from smoking as much as I now do .
That 's nobody 's fault but my own , of course .
Anyone have advice , email me .
Finally , as with everything in life that you only miss when you no longer have it , I learnt that physical contact is incredibly important .
My mother is celebrating her 80th birthday on Friday in the Netherlands , and as all of her four daughters live in different countries ( USA , UK , D ) , we will have to do it via zoom ( courtesy of the new LSE license , thank you ! ) .
My partner does not live with me and for the foreseeable future I will not be able to see him .
Luckily I have very clingy cats that are giving me a lot of love , though I resent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic , we are shopping for each other , sharing food , advice , stories and jokes , and are planning a doorstep dance party .
If all of that seems a little too happy-clappy , then it 's early days and what else can you do but put a positive spin on everything ? It 's the end of days , so we may as well go down with a bang , not a whimper .
( The author 's cats , Samson and Delilah by Sonja Grussendorf )  We all thank technology , but .
Helena Vieira , managing editor of LSE Business Review  Many of us who are not health experts may have missed the early signs of a pandemic , and went about our business blissfully ignoring the emergency fast approaching our doorstep .
So , it came to me as a surprise that LSE was able to switch gears and become an online organisation in what seemed to me like the blink of an eye .
I 'm sure that 's not what it looked like for the management and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours they put in to make this transition work .
We all thank technology for the ability to stay professionally active and connected .
Like many of my colleagues , I had more meetings last week than I would usually have , and work flowed at a steady pace , with the help of technology .
It does n't escape my attention that this can be the death knell of whatever remained of our privacy .
Even more of what we do now is mediated by technology .
Work meetings , family meetings , and now even our parties have gone online .
What a godsend for the data extraction lords .
They wo n't exactly tell you what they 're doing .
The risks to our freedom are not insignificant .
