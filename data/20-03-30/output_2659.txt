Maintaining a Productive and Healthy Workforce During Coronavirus  THUNDER BAY -- There are countless people now learning to work remotely due to COVID-19 .
This situation should it continue for more than a few weeks , is likely to generate a paradigm shift in how business works for a lot of companies .
The use of the Internet , video conferencing , and tools to enhance working remotely has the potential for businesses to co-work remotely .
As the country gets used to being in lockdown and more people than ever before are discovering how to work from home , attention is shifting to how we maintain the health and wellbeing of our army of new homeworkers .
Jonathan Berry , European Practice Director at leading international change management consultancy Expressworks , offers these expert tips .
" In some ways , we are lucky that we are in this situation now , rather than even a decade ago , " comments Jonathan Berry .
" Even 10 years ago , plenty of people thought ' working from home ' was a euphemism for taking the day off .
As that has changed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown past all recognition .
We can be much more productive at home than we could be back then .
The meteoric rise in the share price of Zoom is one example of how popular this tool has become , but Teams and Slack are adding armies of new subscribers too .
" The problem is there are still many people in our workforce who are not familiar with these tools .
People are being confronted with an incredibly complicated set of tools and are being asked to make sense of them in just a few days or even hours .
At a time when many people are extremely stressed about their situations , this can be an unwelcome additional cause of anxiety .
" Imagine looking at an airline cockpit for the first time .
There are buttons and instruments everywhere , you have no clue what any of them do , and you are worried that pressing the wrong one could be catastrophic .
And you are given two hours to make sense of it .
Many people facing the new world of digital communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us would feel in the cockpit scenario .
" One of the best ways for managers to overcome this anxiety is to allow team members to be organic about how they collaborate .
Do n't try to be prescriptive .
Let them find the ways that work best for them through trial and error .
The team will need time to talk about it and discover what works best for them , so a good practice is to add 10 minutes at the end of calls to discuss ways of working and how everyone is feeling .
" Managers trying to replicate business as usual , just from remote locations , will find that productivity over time will decrease .
Those who allow an organic evolution of new ways of working may find their team is even more productive than it used to be .
" For people used to working in a busy environment , full of other people , isolation can be a real issue .
Isolation can cause people can retreat into themselves , so it is important to make sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to start each day by talking to someone rather than going straight to email and where possible show your face -- use video not just voice .
Team drinks over video at the end of the day ensures your day has been topped and tailed with human contact .
" The type of manager who tends to micro-manage others will find the remote working scenario stressful for other reasons .
The inability to see your team and be hands-on with what they are doing will result in a lack of control that some will find deeply uncomfortable .
One way around this is to agree to a set of outcomes that you expect from your people .
This will allow you to judge whether or not they are being productive .
Attendance on certain calls , the production of pieces of written work and meeting reasonable deadlines are KPIs that can be easily managed remotely .
" It may not be possible to ascertain whether your team members are glued to their computer screens from 9 am -- 5 pm but shifting to an outcome-based method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a happier team and increased productivity .
" My advice to managers is to trust your people .
How they respond to that trust will tell you a lot about them .
" Businesses and individuals are experiencing huge levels of change in ways of working because of the necessary restrictions being imposed on us .
We can expect some of these changes to last .
Will people be prepared to go back to the lengthy , expensive , polluting daily commute once they have discovered how to successfully work from home ?  " Will companies want to continue to pay the huge costs associated with physical offices , when a significant proportion of their workforce can work effectively remotely ?  " Coronavirus is having and will continue to have , a profound impact on our economy .
What remains to be seen is how significant and lasting that impact will be and , in the long term , what will be the positives as well as the negatives for businesses .
"  The companies that ride this wave successfully will be ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
