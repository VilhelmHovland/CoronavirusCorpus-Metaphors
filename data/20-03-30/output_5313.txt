Dr Young asked all Queenslanders to limit visiting others in their home and to consider other ways of keeping in touch , such as phone calls .
" We need everyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing at all times .
Unfortunately this no longer means you can invite your friends over , " Dr Young said .

"  Dr Young said this did not apply to households where more than 10 people ordinarily reside in the household .
" For example , if 12 people live in one household , they can be there at the same time , but no visitors are allowed , " she said .
The restrictions came into effect on midnight 27 March 2020 , until further notice .

Washing your hands properly and often is the gold standard of health advice that can help prevent viruses from entering your body .
" Queensland Health is urging anyone who has been overseas in the last 14 days and has a fever or any respiratory symptoms to see a doctor immediately .
Please call ahead to the GP surgery and let them know your symptoms and travel history , this will help them prepare for your arrival .
