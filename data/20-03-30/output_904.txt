Today is the day I run out of HRT patches .
Consider yourself warned  The coronavirus crisis threatens to worsen the menopause-medication shortage  ' I have admitted defeat and swallowed the realisation that HRT patches are in short supply in Ireland .
' File photograph : iStock  The World Health Organisation is rather busy right now , but my own guidelines on social distancing , which I intend to release for the good of the public 's health , are to keep well clear of me , in case you catch a bit of a tongue lashing .
May I recommend the whole nine yards ? Two metres will not suffice .
After 22 phone calls to 22 chemists I have admitted defeat and swallowed the realisation that hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) patches are in short supply in Ireland .
I had read Sylvia Thompson , in the Irish Times health supplement , saying that some HRT patches will not reappear in pharmacies until May .
But that was before the Covid-19 pandemic started to bite .
Denial has often served me well .
First , I was in denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like King Canute , I was wrong .
Then , I was holding on to the belief that Ireland and its pharmacies would provide .
Not this time .
Dr Deirdre Lundy , co-ordinator for women 's health with the Irish College of General Practitioners , says some Irish women had been asking friends and family to buy HRT supplies in Spain and elsewhere .
The coronavirus lockdown has ended that .
Hasta la vista , HRT .
Women 's health will retain its place on the back burner , it seems .
A friend and I joked about behaving like characters from Breaking Bad and selling HRT patches to sweaty middle-aged women .
In the Irish Examiner , Alison O'Connor recounted setting up such a deal .
" I brokered a drug transaction this week , " she wrote .
" It involved two school mums .
One is almost literally climbing the walls because she is without a medication ; the other had a box of it in her bathroom cupboard , which she had never used .
The exchange took place on a local footpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus-related face mask at the moment , you should try sourcing a HRT patch from an Irish pharmacy .
"  Useful treatment  HRT is a useful treatment not only for classical menopausal symptoms , such as night sweats , hot flushes and difficulty sleeping , but also for depression , anxiety , panic attacks , and poor memory and concentration .
" Many women in their 40s and 50s benefit from these hormone treatments and feel healthier on them , " Dr Lundy says .
Now , just as we ca n't get hold of HRT patches to stem our sweaty menopausal flushes , we are told that temperature is a useful diagnostic tool for Covid-19 .
We are currently on high alert for a high temperature .
Now that is a double bind .
Good luck detecting if your raging temperature is a menopausal symptom or a terrifying coronavirus signifier .
Welcome to the 2m between a rock and a hard place .
Before the coronavirus crisis , the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said that many women were unable to fill HRT prescriptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " .
Everyone is getting used to distress and inconvenience in these distressing and inconvenient times .
Many find themselves locked down with someone for whom " distress and inconvenience " are watchwords .
So stand well back , and do n't light the blue touch paper .
