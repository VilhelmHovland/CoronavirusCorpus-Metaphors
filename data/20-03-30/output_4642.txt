A pandemic stopped the Paralympics , but it ca n't stop one of America 's greatest sprinters  Double amputee Hunter Woodhall learned early on that he would need to work harder than most .
As a three-time NCAA All-American and two-time Paralympic medalist , that work has paid off .
Harry How/Getty Images  On the afternoon of March 11 , University of Arkansas track athlete and double amputee Hunter Woodhall landed in Albuquerque , New Mexico , to prepare for the NCAA indoor national championship .
Heading into the weekend meet , Woodhall and his 4x400-meter relay teammates were favorites for a top finish .
After practice the next day , the NCAA canceled the meet due to the coronavirus outbreak .
Soon thereafter , all collegiate athletic seasons abruptly ended .
Two weeks later , on March 24 , the 21-year-old learned that the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics , where he had hoped to compete , had been postponed until 2021 .
" I was extremely happy with the decision because I 'll take postponement over cancellation any day of the week , " said Woodhall , who 's staying with his girlfriend in Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the safety of everyone -- the athletes and viewers and everyone involved .
"  Still , the decision left Woodhall , like so many others , with time to assess where he has gotten -- and how far he still wants to run .
A 2016 Paralympic medalist in the 200 and 400 meters , Woodhall is the first double amputee to earn a Division I track and field scholarship .
He was born with fibular hemimelia , a rare condition in which some or all of the lower leg bones are missing .
When his parents were told he would likely never walk , they decided to have Woodhall 's legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old .
But that did n't stop him from participating in sports .
Soccer , T-ball , wrestling , skiing -- anything his two older brothers competed in , Woodhall wanted to as well .
Running ultimately won out .
Now the Utah native has gone , in a matter of days , from a potential national champion and repeat Paralympic medalist to a sprinter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-foot-3 with light blond hair and a wide smile -- says he views the changes as temporary setbacks .
The rising senior and three-time first-team All-American is embracing a rare break in full-time training -- but still keeping his fans ( including close to 2 million followers on TikTok ) entertained on social media .
As he continues to prove , determination has defined Hunter Woodhall 's life .
His Instagram tagline echoes that : " They said I 'd never walk , so I learned to run instead .
" Here 's his story in his words .
The Arkansas Razorback says he excels at the 4x400m because he has a running start and does n't have to get out of the blocks , which is more challenging with blades .
Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports  FOR THE LONGEST time , I was treated by everyone as -- I do n't want to say a charity case , but the general connotation of " The kid with the disability is here , and we 're content with him just showing up .
"  My dad would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to treat you as such .
It will make you a better person , but you might have to work a little harder to get to where you want to be .
" It was up to me to show people I can do more , that my athletic ability extends past my physical disability .
Editor 's Picks  Running was my way to do that .
When I first started at 8 years old , I ran fun runs and 5Ks on normal prosthetics -- and it was extremely difficult , like running in a medical boot .
I was always far in the back .
I got my blades in seventh grade , right around 2012 , when Oscar Pistorius ran in the London Olympics .
At the time , that was so far out of the idea of what I could become or achieve .
I 'd finish last in races , and people would still be clapping and cheering .
I realized everyone was just happy I was there .
In no other case do people cheer for the loser .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option .
If I give up now , then they win .
Still , there were many times where I was just done .
My dad -- who 's very blunt -- would tell me to shut up and get back to work .
I thought , " What can I do to get people to stop seeing me as a kid with no legs and instead see me as an athlete ? " I figured it out in junior high when I started running track and found new friends : If I want to be respected as an athlete , I need to become the athlete I want to be .
After finishing with a silver medal in the 200m and bronze in the 400 at the 2016 Rio Paralympics , Woodhall was poised for more podium finishes at the 2020 Paralympics in Tokyo .
Now he 'll have to wait until 2021 .
Paul Harding/PA Wire via AP  SOON I STARTED to become that athlete .
Once a week , my parents drove me an hour and a half away to train with a private coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could get more comfortable in my legs .
He had n't worked with a runner with blades , but he was a former 400m runner , so he knew what he was doing .
I also gave up my summers to go to San Diego by myself and train with Joaquim Cruz , an Olympic gold medalist in the 800m , at the Olympic Training Center .
I was 15 years old .
I did n't have a car , so I 'd stay on campus .
I give my parents more credit than anyone for my being where I am today .
They made so many sacrifices and put me in the best position to succeed .
I ran my first Paralympics world championships in 2015 when I was 16 -- and then I went to the Rio Paralympics the next year .
I got silver in the 200m and bronze in the 400m in those events at each competition .
Oddly enough , I was much more comfortable in an able-bodied setting because I had been running there since seventh grade .
Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , but I was at a world Paralympic championship -- so the level of competition , on scale , was a lot different .
The better I raced in able-bodied events , the more people asked questions .
My senior year of high school , I had broken the state record and won a state championship individually .
It was a really cool moment , something I cherished .
Then someone in the stands stood up in front of everybody , three seats away from my family , and yelled , " You should n't be here , you 're a cheater .
" It sucks that somebody else 's ill wishes or negativity can tear down that moment .
That same person had put in an appeal days earlier to the Utah state commission , saying I should n't be allowed to run with able-bodied runners ; instead , I should run in my own category by myself -- with no one else in the state .
My coach had pulled me aside on the day of the state championships and said , " Somebody put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run until we get this straightened out .
" The next morning , he said , " Every other coach in the state has vouched for you , and this man was roasted in the meeting .
" Just to see that was super cool , even from the rival schools .
Woodhall was home-schooled until fifth grade , then transitioned to a public school -- where he was bullied and had few friends .
Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports  The next step for me was college .
Running for a D-I school was always an idea -- even though a D-I coach told me I was n't fast enough and should be looking at D-II or D-III schools .
I love to prove people wrong -- but the start of my recruiting process was difficult .
My high school coach and I sent probably 100 emails and letters to Division I colleges .
Nothing .
At the end of my junior year , I had run 46 .
in the 400m , which was probably top 10 in the nation for my class .
So when it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm going to get tons of calls .
" But not a single call .
It was so bad .
I remember going through every possible reason I was n't getting a call .
I reached out to Tracy Sundlun , a former assistant track coach at USC , and asked him , " What do you think is going on ? " Sundlun contacted some coaches , and they said , " One , it 's never been done .
We do n't want to take that risk .
Two , we do n't know how to train him .
Three , we do n't know if he can run indoor .
" So our idea was , let 's start knocking things off the list and show them it 's possible , which we did .
In late April of my senior year , I got the call from Arkansas .
Earning a D-I scholarship to a Power 5 school is definitely one of my proudest accomplishments .
From the minute I arrived , the coaches said , " Whatever you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work for a spot .
Nothing is given .
" It 's exactly what I needed and wanted .
My first year was hard .
I did not run well my whole freshman year until outdoor regionals .
At one point , I had to take a six-week break because my body was dead : My quads felt like rocks .
I had run 46 .
my senior year of high school ; indoor my freshman year , I never ran faster than 48 .
, and outdoor , I never ran faster than 47 .
Thankfully I finished my freshman year well , and I 've carried that momentum ever since .
Now with the season canceled and the Paralympics postponed , I 'm just enjoying life .
I have n't had a chance to sit and relax in a long time .
But I 'm still training .
I 'm doing long runs and pool workouts .
And my coaches said they 'll send workouts I can do when I can find a track that 's safe and open .
" I will never be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodhall said .
" A foot creates its own energy , so out of the blocks , your foot is pushing off .
With blades mine start from zero .
It 's easier on the back end for me to maintain speed .
" Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports  WHEN I WAS younger , I never would 've imagined I 'd be where I am now -- with running and in life .
I love putting out content on social media and being open about my disability , my life and the things I do -- despite the fact that the biggest pushback I 've experienced has been through social media .
In high school , one of my race videos would be posted , and if I went through the comments , I knew they would destroy me .
Now I brush off the little things .
In turn , I learned to use comedy as a way to make people feel comfortable with my situation .
If I can make fun of myself before they do , then they have nothing to make fun of me for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of times , it 's corny things : I tattooed a pair of scissors on my leg last summer , as a reminder not to take things too seriously .
The biggest thing people do n't realize -- me , along with anyone else -- this is n't something people like me with disabilities chose .
I did n't choose to have my legs amputated and to run without legs .
I 'm just a normal kid trying to live my life and chase my dreams .
