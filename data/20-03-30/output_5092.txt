How To Handle Toxic Relatives  The Well  ADVERTISEMENT  Lorraine Corne , a psychologist who specialises in anxiety and depression , explained to The Quicky that feelings of anxiety often make us exaggerate anything that 's a little wrong , resulting in " OMG thinking " .
" This produces adrenalin in the body , and this adrenalin runs around and affects the parts of the body that are the weakest .
You end up on high alert too long , and this affects your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also manifest physically in a tight throat , headaches , and churny stomach as you try to manage everything around you .
" We can not control everything around us right now , we can only control what we can control , " said Lorraine .
Here Lorraine 's 6 tips for looking after your mental health , and focusing on the things we can control at this time of uncertainty .
Getting into nature .
Obviously we 're operating in a time of social distancing .
But walking , going to a park , exercising , and getting into nature are all still allowed right now .
We , Australia , are not in lockdown , and Lorraine says things like " smelling the ocean " tend to reduce the adrenaline and produce more serotonin ( aka , the good stuff .
)  2 .
Manage your day differently .
When we 're feeling anxious , we tend to feel overwhelmed by all of the things and tasks ahead of us .
If you are working from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before reduces the feelings of being overwhelmed .
" You can pretend you 're in the office and give yourself a 15 minute coffee break and a proper lunch break when you usually would , " she explained .
Hold a family meeting .
At the moment , we 're being encouraged to spend a lot more time at home .
Lorraine says it 's worth getting everyone together for a family meeting so everyone is clear on how , exactly , that 's going to work .
She suggests discussing everyone 's movements and work schedules , and plans for the kids , to pinpoint what possible irritations and stresses could arise before they do .
If your kids are at home with you , having some structure written down for their days will help ease both yours and their stress .
Write a list before bed .
Unfortunately , no matter how tired you are , sometimes your brain just refuses to turn off .
" You need to get ready for bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a half hour of turning off everything that could distract you , calm yourself down , get everything onto a notepad you 've got to do tomorrow , so they 're down on that paper and not in your head when you get into bed , " she added .
If you fall asleep okay and instead wake up in the early morning tossing and turning , Lorraine says just get up .
" The body is very sluggish , the metabolism is not working properly so you need to get the mind and body back into sync , " she explained .

Half an hour later ( according to Lorraine ) you should find it easier to drift off .
Practice this quick relaxation technique .
Lie in bed and tighten every muscle -- hold for 10 seconds -- and slowly let the whole body go .
Repeat three times .
Get the whole family involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , " said Lorraine .
" And what that does , is it focuses the mind on to something other than all that craziness that has been going on in the mind .
"  5 .
If your kids ask questions , answer them .
For children up to nine-years-old , Lorraine says the two things that are important at this time of crisis are information and intonation .
" The information they need to know is what they want to know .
They might need to know whether their grandparents are going to die .
That 's one of the things that keeps coming through the news , " Lorraine told The Quicky .
Lorraine suggests parents take five minutes in a quiet corner to ask their kids some questions , things like : ' what do you know about coronavirus ? ' ' what are your friends saying ? '  Answering their queries and concerns calmly and normally will help ease little minds .
With teenagers , Lorraine says you need to show them respect .
" In the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" They will tell you what their ideas are .
Then you can often feel like you 've connected with that child on an adult level , which helps them feel in command .
"  6 .
Call a loved one .
Connection has a lot to do with reducing anxiety .
Speaking to someone who can listen and understand you , helps you feel more secure , says Lorraine .
So pick up the phone , and have a debrief with your mum , bestie , or boyfriend .
