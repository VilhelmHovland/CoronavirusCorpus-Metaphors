Once you 've been with someone for a long time , it 's easy to forget about making an effort to make them happy .

For example , if they mention that they like a new band , why not add it to your digital playlist , and play it during dinner ?  It does n't have to be a big effort , you could even pick up their favourite chocolate when you go grocery shopping , just as a sign to say " I was thinking about you , and I care about making you happy , and we 're going to get through this together .
