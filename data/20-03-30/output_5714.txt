Bureaucratic wrangling is delaying a solution they require immediately  Imagine a farmer setting foot in his poultry farm and thousands of chicks swarming up to him in the hope that he will feed them .
They have been hungry for days .
But he has no feed , and with the little he can find , there is a stampede the moment he throws it to them and hundreds perish .
This is the scene playing out in poultry farms across Punjab over the last few days , following steps initiated by the state and central governments in response to the COVID19 scare .
The scene bears uncanny resemblance to what Chigozie Obioma describes at length in his brilliant work Orchestra of Minorities which came out last year .
Developments in the last few days have spelt doom for the poultry industry in Punjab with similar reports coming in from various other places in the region .
It all began with the buildup to the coronavirus outbreak scare when certain unscrupulous elements started a rumour campaign saying people could get infected with COVID19 if they consumed eggs or chicken .
This led to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that things were so bad even before the lockdown that no one was purchasing chicken for even 5 rupees a kilo .
Once the Centre imposed the lockdown , the Punjab government stated that poultry shops would remain open along with other essential items .
But the farmers are still hard pressed for relief , because the majority of shops that are open are keen on selling their frozen stock of boneless chicken , or in many cases selling the stock of fresh chicken available with them at a huge premium of up to Rs .
per bird .
Apprehending losses , also because the Navratras are on when many people give up eating eggs and meat , they are not procuring anything from poultry farmers .
Poultry farmers are in a very desperate situation here .
To begin with they are facing an immense shortage of feed amid the lockdown and curfew as transporters are not willing to bring their deliveries .
This has affected the produce that is ready for consumption .
" The birds that should have been 1kg to 1,300 grams in weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell them even at 5 to 10 rupees a kilo but we need a mechanism in place , " said Manpreet Singh Chahal who owns three farms in Sangrur district .
According to him no fewer than 1 .
lakh birds in Sangrur district alone are ready for consumption .
Sources disclosed that the scenario is so grim that many farmers have clandestinely been dumping their birds on the roads .
" We can not even seek permission to cull them as we might be deprived of compensation if any is announced by the government later , " one farmer said .
Another said that because of the shortage of feed many of the birds have started killing and eating each other .
According to Chahal , " I am looking at a huge financial loss : the cost of raising a bird comes to Rs 70 approximately and I have around 50,000 birds .
Right now sales are a big zero .
You can calculate where the losses are running .
"  Farmers did say that officials in many districts have shown sympathy for their plight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution where doorstep delivery can become feasible .
They say that if this can be worked out they may still get some respite , because there is a sizeable non-Hindu population in the state like Muslims , Christians and a large section of Dalits who do n't stop consuming poultry products during the Navratra religious observance .
Moves have been initiated in this direction , they say , but bureaucratic wrangling is delaying a solution which they require immediately .
The longer the administration delays , the greater their losses will be .
" There can be a mechanism where one or two butchers move around in a mobile van and provide freshly slaughtered birds to consumers at an affordable rate .
This way all the stakeholders including the farmer , van owner , driver and butcher can earn a bit in these trying times .
We have provided all the details and statistics to the authorities and are looking for a go-ahead by Monday , " said Chahal .
Another farmer , Amritpal Singh , says that if the ready produce of birds and eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next five to seven days and the eggs will rot .
" We as a society will be facing a shortage of protein that comes from chicken and eggs .
We also need immediate veterinary assistance in many places .
The government must ensure movement of feed and medicine on the ground , " he said .
Rajesh Garg , president of the Punjab Poultry Farmers ' Association , revealed that while the state government has allowed the transport of eggs to other states , the people transporting them are facing police harassment in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar .
" Our trucks are being stopped and drivers are being thrashed , " he said .
He further said that while the government notification has placed chicken and meat shops under the category of essentials providers , poultry shops are not being allowed to open on the ground .
" It needs to be understood that eggs are the best source of protein in such trying times .
Those who are performing difficult duties on the ground need a constant diet of eggs , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
