" I miss laughter , working from home is very quiet " : Virginia Sharma  Share Via :  In the latest edition of Viral Diaries , afaqs ! catches up with Virginia Sharma , ( outgoing ) director of marketing solutions at LinkedIn India .
Virginia Sharma has over 17 years of experience as a marketer and , yet , working from home ( WFM ) during the Coronavirus outbreak has taught her to stay more grounded and connected with her family .
After spending six years as director of marketing solutions at LinkedIn India , she announced , last week , that she was moving on from the organisation .
A conversation with the marketer on WFM during a global pandemic .
What 's your tip for media/marketing professionals dealing with anxiety during these times ? How can one focus better while working from home ?  Forgive yourself if you 're having a slow day .
Many of us are used to being around people , and being productive and efficient with our time -- since our industry itself is pretty fast-paced .
Because of the circumstances , everything is slowing down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're used to .
The worst thing you can do is to put pressure on yourself .
Do n't beat yourself up for not being able to read without getting distracted , or do n't feel guilty for not getting enough done .
We have never had the time and space to allow ourselves to feel things -- we 've always been so busy .
Take the burden of expectations ( away ) -- otherwise you 're going to feel really bad .
As far as staying productive is concerned , for me , being routine-oriented has been very important .
If you were to wake up , workout and shower at a particular time -- try to make sure that you continue following that system .
If you socialise with people at work or after work , schedule that in , too .
For me , I know that around 12 p .
daily , I like to take a break and chat with someone in the office .
Now I have a standing 12 o'clock mentoring session , in its place daily , which remotely replaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .
So , routine is very important , you have to try and make an effort to know yourself and how you spend your time -- and plan for it .
Which app/tool are you using to video conference with your team/clients ?  With global MNCs , not much has changed with how the team works because we were always on video calls and using virtual team meetings , and we always had systems for information exchange .
If you think about it , most of us are used to working with other markets and we 've learned to understand how to schedule particular meetings and structure calls , according to time zones .
People tend to have different energy levels when we 're doing morning and night calls , and we need to account for that .
Sometimes , what can be done is to use an agenda to make sure we do n't waste time on calls .
Our communication across the globe has been consistent , as always .
The main thing that 's changed is , how do you communicate with the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper/website to stay updated ?  I do n't watch the news on TV or read newspapers .
LinkedIn has a section dedicated to updates about the Coronavirus , so we 're following that .
I also follow the CDC and the WHO for official data and numbers .
I do n't read news forwarded to me on WhatsApp .
I automatically assume it 's unverified .
Most of the WhatsApp groups I 'm a part of , are for work , or to organise volunteer work .
We set rules on these groups , requesting members not to forward any kind of unverified news about the Coronavirus , and to only focus on work .
It 's important to keep your workplace clean -- in the same way you 'd keep your desk clean .
It 's important to ensure that your social channels do n't bleed into each other , otherwise you lose focus very quickly .
I used to read the New York Times , but not that often because that information is n't that relevant .
How do you draw a line between using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all honesty , I have not dealt with this all along , because I was never big on social media .
But the amount of consumption I 've done in the last week is more than I 've done in three months .
I used to only come to social media for work-related content .
On LinkedIn , most of it is related to connecting with my network and I 'm highly productive at that .
Now , I come to social media to watch puppy and dance videos .
I 'm using social media to procrastinate .
I 'm not a good example at all because I 'm loving using social media this way right now .
Talk to me in a week and I may have a different answer .
What do you miss most -- and least -- about office ?  I miss laughter , honestly .
It 's very quiet when you 're working from home .
I do n't think I 'm used to this much quiet ! When working in an open workspace , we used to complain about needing a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I miss the noisy people , the loud laughers .
There 's nothing as such that I do n't miss .
I really loved my workplace .
But I will tell you the benefit of being home is that I 'm checking in on my family regularly and more people benefit from my time .
I feel like when I was at work , I was 150 per cent at work , and now I wonder , what it would 've cost me to just take a break and call my mom .
I do n't miss the complete focus , at the expense of everything else .
Can you tell us how WFH has changed the dynamics with your coworkers ?  Women have been more natural at working from home than men are , because we 've always had the pressure cooker going off or the kid crying or someone at the doorbell to attend to .
More women colleagues of mine have worked from home more often and are more comfortable with that identity and understanding that things can fall apart any minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like their children showing up on video calls , but I think , eventually , they understood , over time , that it 's okay if their kid interrupts , or if they need to step away to take care of something .
I think it 's going to be great for building a lot of empathy towards those who work from home on a regular basis -- such as mothers , who are returning to the workforce .
It 's a great equaliser in that sense .
One of my colleagues had his wife and two sons join the video call , and he introduced me to them .
They were so happy to meet me because , apparently , they 'd heard a lot about me at work .
They had the chance to meet me , see who I was , and they were really happy about it .
What 's the one thing you see yourself doing differently once the WFM phase ends ?  I want to continue to make time to mentor people who are not from my ecosystem .
Normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organisation , but there are many people in our industry , and outside of it ( such as entrepreneurs and students ) , who would benefit from having me around .
How frequently do you check in on your team while working from home ?  I 've deliberately tapered off in terms of being on call because this is my last week -- I 'd announced that on my LinkedIn blog post .
Normally , I 'd check in with a once a week ' virtual happy hour .
'  We realised that the minute you have more than four people on a call , you 're not going to have a conversation -- you 're going to be having fun .
So , we do things like wear hats and sunglasses based on a theme .
We have different themes every week -- and last week 's theme was ' crazy hats .
'  You need to keep your meetings frequent and small .
People assume that in times of crisis -- what is needed is inspirational leadership ( one single leader inspiring an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a balance between that and shared leadership .
It 's better to have eight leaders for eight smaller groups , rather than a single leader , who tries to connect with the whole group .
Inspiration does n't translate very well through video calls and calls , you ca n't really form a connection .
Whereas in smaller groups , more people assume the role of team leaders and mentors .
What are some of the ways you 're attempting to give back to the society , during these trying times ?  We have four different streams of self-organised volunteers .
I am the tower lead for my individual building and we check in with senior citizens daily .
The second is that we did a bulk medicine collection drive to ensure that the people in the building have adequate medicines .
The third thing is that we have two in-house stores which are overwhelmed with lack of assistance so we take one hour shifts to help the store organise aspects related to payments , delivery , pick ups , stock of items , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building do n't run out of food and essential commodities , and to support the employees who get very tired by the demand .
The fourth is that we have around 20 guards and workers in the building , so we organised for their food and stay .
We 've organised for a mess for them with bedding , etc .
If they 're there for us 24 hours , we need to make sure they 're fed and taken care of .
All in all , we have about 70 people in different work streams .
We also have families in quarantine , and we walk their dogs ( for them ) and get supplies delivered to their doorstep .
We 've also started a meal collection drive for daily wage labourers in the neighbourhood who were unable to leave the city .
