Science of controlling pandemics : Lessons for countries in tackling COVID-19  Last Updated : Monday 30 March 2020  The interventions needed to curtail the spread of the novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) remain unclear , despite the world grappling with the problem since the first reported case in December 2019 .
In South Korea , hailed as one of the best examples of what a country should do to control the disease , the government took action immediately after the first case was identified in January .
It spoke to manufacturers of diagnostic kits to produce not only enough kits for domestic use but also for export .
Licences were fast tracked to make this possible .
The moment the kits were available , the country started mass screening to identify the infected and isolate their contacts .
People were also asked to maintain social distance and wear masks to stop transmission .
The country , however , continued to operate as before .
People went to work and schools remained open .
China , in contrast , went in for massive lockdowns in January 2020 , along with travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perplexing .
The country only took targeted steps , despite having a huge elderly population .
Schools were closed in areas where positive cases were found .
Though there were government directives to avoid social gathering , they were not mandatory .
As a result , people got together , went to work , travelled in public transport and even went out in groups to celebrate the spring .
The government tested only the sick for positive cases of infection with the virus ( SARS-CoV-2 ) .
Some said the country did not need to take drastic steps as the Japanese already kept a healthy distance from each other , bowed instead of shaking hands and wore masks daily .
A recent spurt in cases , however , suggest that these methods are not enough .
The United Kingdom -- just like Japan -- did not take action , other than asking the sick to stay home .
The government justified this by saying that they were protecting the most vulnerable without unnecessarily overloading the health system .
The number of cases increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India released an advisory on January 17 on travel safety and began to screen passengers coming from China , as the virus spread across the globe .
The Union government released another advisory on January 29 , saying Indians should not travel to China .
India reported the country 's first case on January 30 , despite this .
This was the same day that the World Health Organization ( WHO ) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern .
India suspended visas of all foreign nationals on March 11 .
A total of 60 positive cases were reported in the country by then .
The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on the same day .
More restrictions were put in incrementally , with a voluntary curfew on March 22 , followed by a nationwide lockdown till March 31 that was subsequently extended to April 15 .
Will these measures work ? Maybe .
A team led by Jeanne Fair , a biosecurity and public health expert at the Los Alamos National Laboratory , modelled the spread of influenza virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the infection and reduced symptoms by an average of 16 per cent , the team said in a study published in the International Journal of Risk Assessment and Management in 2012 .
The concept of social distancing found support recently as well .
Social distancing -- both self-imposed and enforced by the government -- was important , said researchers from the UK and the Netherlands , in an opinion published in The Lancet on March 2020 .
Government actions including banning events , closing workplaces , schools and institutions and making sure that good diagnostic facilities and remotely accessed advice , like telephone helplines , be widely available , according to them .
There is a need , however , for vigilance , as methods such as social distancing and following advice on cleanliness depend on adherence .
A team of researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health , Boston and Imperial College London studied the response of people in Argentina , Japan , Mexico , the UK , and the US to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in 2012 .
Nearly 73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing at the time , according to the researchers .
Approximately 27 per cent of them did not wash their hands or use hand sanitisers , according to the researchers .
Waning interest brings in an added problem , according to a 2015 study published in journal BMC Infectious Diseases .
Those from poorer backgrounds were less likely to adhere to norms as they needed to earn a living and had less flexibility with working hours , according to the study .
The current state of lockdowns harms the economy .
Social distancing is 50 per cent more expensive to impose than using antivirals to combat a disease , said the 2012 study in International Journal of Risk Assessment and Management .
Researchers suggested that a mix of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions were needed to contain the flu epidemic .
This suggestion does not help in dealing with the current crisis , however , as pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 are still being developed .
These interventions are our best bets till the time drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobility and epidemiological data in China showed restrictions of travel from the epicentre came too late .
Local transmission had become more important than imported cases , as the virus incubated for as long as 14 days .
The ban was defeated , said researchers from the University of Oxford and Northeastern University , in a study published on March 25 , in the journal Science .
The next few days will tell us whether India took action in time or not .
