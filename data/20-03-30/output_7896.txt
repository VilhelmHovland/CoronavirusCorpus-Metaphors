LAFAYETTE -- It was Day 6 Monday of Hoosiers hunkering down to the confined to spaces of their homes , which is not unlike what Purdue professor Marshall Porterfield prepared astronauts for while he worked at NASA .
Porterfield , a Purdue University professor of agricultural and biological engineering , served five years as NASA division director for Space Life and Physical .
Porterfield worked with astronauts , teaching them about living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The skills are surprisingly transferable to Gov .
Eric Holcomb 's stay-at-home order that started March 25 because of the coronavirus emergency .
" These people really are mission oriented , " Porterfield said .
" They know what they 're doing has a broader interest on human impact .
"  In times of social distancing and shuttered social lives , parts of life might feel meaningless .
It 's not .
" Collectively , the mission plan is to prevent the spread of the virus , " Porterfield said .
To that end , Indiana State Health Department 's numbers Monday indicated that there are 1,786 cases of COVID-19 in the state -- 14 in Tippecanoe County .
The virus has killed 35 people from Indiana , including one patient in Tippecanoe County .
While President Donald Trump suggests that April 30 might be the start of returning to a normal pre-coronavirus life , that might not happen so soon in Indiana .
Indiana 's stay-at-home order still was set to expire April 7 , as of Monday .
" We 'll adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gov .
Eric Holcomb said Monday during a briefing in Indianapolis .
" We absolutely factor their guidance into the decisions we make .
Our numbers will determine our executive orders in Indiana .
"  Holcomb anticipates the number of people infected with COVID-19 will peak in mid-April or mid-May before subsiding , he said of the best estimate .
Meanwhile , Hoosiers abiding by Holcomb 's stay-at-home order are trying to cope with confinement and isolation from offices and social interactions .
Focusing on the mission plan , as Porterfield said , not ourselves or those things -- or people -- that irritate us is helpful .
Astronauts also have a two-hour exercise program each day , Porterfield said .
The workouts serve more than just to maintain muscles in space .
" There 's a lot of evidence that being physically active helps prevent depression , " he said .
If you exercise at a gym , continue the workouts at home .
If you do n't exercise , now is good time to start , he said .
On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take a walk .
But even with the stay-at-home order , people can walk .
Just remember to keep a six-foot distance between you and the people with whom you 're walking , Dennis said .
" We have done as much as we can to make people aware of social distancing , " Dennis said .
Many of the cities ' trails remain open , but the playground and playground equipment in parks are closed because of possible spreading of the virus , Dennis said .
He noticed over the weekend people who are familiar with friends tend to violate the social distancing guidelines and walk shoulder-to-shoulder while they talk , Dennis said .
All this togetherness can wear on people living in the same house , though .
Porterfield is n't surprised .
Astronauts must learn how to cope with irritating situations and personality conflicts , including children who might not have an appreciation of how important the stay-at-home order is .
Explain to the children and teens and make it a team-building experience .
" It 's important for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Porterfield said .
" Help them understand why and the limitations .
"  When the children and teens understand , discuss the schedules and allow them input into the decisions , he said .
Ultimately , those decisions will fall to the parents , but making the children a part of those decisions is part of building the team , Porterfield said .
And when a younger or older siblings -- or parents -- are on their last nerve , what then ?  " Hopefully you have enough space to create a buffer zone to smooth those situations out , " Porterfield said .
While in that buffer space , it 's important to reflect on the situation .
" You ca n't get too self-absorbed in what 's happening to you personally , " Porterfield said .
" There is an end to this .
" Do n't focus on self .
Focus on the mission .
"  And the mission is to stop the spread of the coronavirus , in case anyone needs reminded .
