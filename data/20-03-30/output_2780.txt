The models used to project the spread of cases and demand for services were based on the trajectories of COVID-19 in South Korea , Hubei province in China and northern Italy .
The most likely outcome will be case numbers similar to or below levels in China 's Hubei province , provincial health officials said at a morning briefing .
That scenario would see a peak need for 438 ventilators , which help patients with the virus breathe .
But Northern Health would be 12 ventilators short of the projected demand and Interior Health would not be able to provide the life-saving devices to two patients .
The models are conservative , provincial officials said .
They assume 13 .
per cent of people infected will require hospitalization and 4 .
per cent of cases will require critical care .
In other jurisdictions , 11 per cent have required hospitalization and 4 .
per cent intensive care .
The models estimate the average individual will be admitted five days after having their case confirmed , and stay 10 days in critical care or 12 days for non-critical patients .
The briefing did not include information on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the province would address the shortage in some regions .
Health Minister Adrian Dix said the models are intended to help the province plan and prepare .
" These are not expectations of what will happen here .
"  Henry made similar points .
" We are going to have our own epidemic .
These models are just a basis for change , " she said .
" We are confident that this gives us a good sense of where we are in our trajectory in B .
compared to these other countries , " said Henry .
But the province is still developing plans to respond to anything from the best to worst-case scenarios , even though a northern Italy level of per-capita hospitalization is unlikely .
" There is value in our planning for these high-level responses , " said Health Minister Adrian Dix .
Seventeen hospitals have been identified as primary COVID-19 critical care centres .
If B .
were to see northern Italy levels of hospitalization , another 341 intensive care beds would have to be opened up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transported or in lower levels of care would also have to be found .
It would also mean opening additional sites so non-critical patients without COVID-19 could be moved to create additional capacity for those with the virus .
Dix and Henry stressed the importance of being able to provide critical care for non-COVID-19 related illnesses .
The most strained for ventilators and beds in the worst-case scenario would be Interior Health , Northern Health and Fraser Health .
The 100 ventilators that arrived in the province in the last week are being directed to those regions .
Health authorities have been asked to make staffing schedules for the next six weeks based on the projected needs .
More frontline workers are being directed towards ICUs , and approvals for trainee health professionals and those needing to be re-registered are being expedited to bolster the workforce to deal with the virus .
Dix and Henry stressed the modelling will change as more data becomes available on the spread in B .
" Next week they 'll be better , and the week after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry reported that physical distancing and other measures have already reduced the rate of transmission .
The rate per capita growth rate of cases was 24 per cent on March 4 , before distancing was mandated .
It 's fallen to 12 per cent since physical distancing measures were enacted .
But planning is still of the essence , Henry said , and physical distance is more important than ever to further slow transmission .
