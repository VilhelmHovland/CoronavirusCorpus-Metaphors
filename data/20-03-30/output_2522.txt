Saudi Arabia plans to boost oil exports to 10 .
million bpd from May  DUBAI : Saudi Arabia plans to boost its oil exports to 10 .
million barrels per day from May because the country is burning less oil for power generation and there is also lower domestic consumption , a Saudi energy ministry official said on Monday .
The world 's top oil exporter has already made plans to boost its crude supply and exports sharply after the collapse earlier this month of a three-year deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers , led by Russia .
The rise in crude oil exports will be " starting from May by about 600,000 barrels per day , " the official said .
" This increase came as a result of displacing crude with natural gas from the Al-Fadhili gas plant as a fuel for generating electricity , " the official said .
He also said it followed a decrease in local demand for petroleum products due to the reduction in transportation as a result of precautionary measures in place to limit the coronavirus outbreak .
Saudi Arabia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep supplying crude at a record rate of 12 .
million bpd in coming months and export more 10 million bpd from May .
The country is willing to maintain its survival-of-the-fittest oil strategy by using its vast supplies and financial muscle to drive out higher-cost rivals for the long term , sources have told Reuters .
Saudi Arabia produces more than a tenth of global crude .
But with demand tumbling because of global measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak , oil companies have been reducing refinery processing rates and global oil demand is expected to plunge 15 million to 20 million bpd , a 20% drop from last year .
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday , with U .
crude briefly dropping below $20 and Brent hitting its lowest level in 18 years , on heightened fears that the global coronavirus shutdown could last months and demand for fuel could decline further .
Brent crude , the international benchmark for oil prices , was down $2 .
, or 8 .
, at $22 .
by 1127 GMT , after earlier dropping to $22 .
, the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to rise in April after Aramco cut its official selling prices ( OSPs ) to stimulate demand , but a sharp increase now appears less likely as demand plummets due to the coronavirus and a freight rates surge .
On Friday , two Indian refiners declared force majeure on crude purchases from the Middle East after fuel demand plummeted due to a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus and because the companies ' tanks are full , sources told Reuters .
" Saudi Arabia is evidently struggling significantly to increase production and exports as planned after the failed OPEC+ meeting , likely leading to continued deep discounts for Europe and the U .
, " JBC Energy , an oil and gas research firm , wrote in a note on Monday .
