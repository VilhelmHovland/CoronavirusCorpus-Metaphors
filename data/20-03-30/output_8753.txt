Garbage collectors brave coronavirus to keep Paris clean  PARIS ( Reuters ) - While most Parisians are indoors complying with a coronavirus lockdown now in its third week , Geffray Serbus and his fellow garbage collectors are out in their truck helping to keep the French capital running .
Though Serbus , 30 , and his crew wear masks and extra gloves to guard against the virus , they are well aware of the risks -- several colleagues from the garbage collection depot have shown symptoms .
" But there you go , we have to work .
If we do n't , ( then there will be ) disease , " said Serbus , out on his truck before dawn on Monday in Paris 's 17th district .
" So we have to do this .
"  The coronavirus outbreak in France has left more than 2,300 people dead and over 37,000 infected .
The government has imposed strict movement restrictions , ordering all but essential workers to stay at home .
The staff who operate the capital 's 130 garbage trucks are considered essential workers .
As a concession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working two to three days per week instead of five to six .
They have been given protective gear , and the trucks are disinfected daily , according to the Paris mayor 's office .
Refuse truck driver Marc Delsalle , 54 , said the virus and risks of infection weigh on workers as they go about their rounds .
" There 's a bit less joking around between work mates , " he said .
" You can feel that there 's a certain tension .
"  But there are compensations too .
Because restaurants are shut and tourists have departed , there is much less rubbish on the kerbside to collect .
Before the lockdown , crews would pick up 3,000 tonnes of trash daily .
Now that figure is down to 2,100 tonnes , the mayor 's office said .
And if before the outbreak most residents paid little attention to the refuse collectors , the virus has prompted Parisians to show their appreciation .
Workers say they are finding notes attached to the household refuse bins with the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
