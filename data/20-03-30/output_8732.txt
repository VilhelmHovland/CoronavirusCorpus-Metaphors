Marijuana sales bloom during COVID-19 outbreak  Whatever it is , one thing is clear : If ever there was a business for these troubled times , it might be ones like The Greenhouse .
The marijuana dispensary and others in Metro Detroit have watched their sales bloom during the coronavirus outbreak .
At least until Gov .
Gretchen Whitmer 's recent edict for residents to stay home .

Greenhouse , which has 14 registers , was so busy one day last week , it had to call in more workers , he said .
It was his busiest day since opening the shop last year .
Sales slowed the next day with Whitmer 's stay-home order , which also limited the sale of marijuana to deliveries and curbside pickup .
But the dispensary still was handling about 500 cars a day , Millen said .
The steady procession of vehicles continued Monday .
Greenhouse is n't the only one enjoying a boost as the disease circles the globe .
The 76 marijuana retailers in Michigan finished their most profitable week ever earlier this month , which also is when the state reported its first case of COVID-19 .

The figures were n't yet available for last week , but businesses said the closing of their interiors cut sales by nearly half after the initial boom .
Most of the demand has been for recreational marijuana , according to Metro Detroit merchants .
Customers have told them about being worried about the pandemic .
A worker at the Flower Bowl , a dispensary in Inkster , said its phones last week were ringing constantly .
Pot shop owners said they were buoyed by Whitmer 's order , which allowed their businesses to remain open , along with others deemed critical to the state 's well-being .
It was another step in marijuana 's transformation from its old image of illicit sales , merchants said .
