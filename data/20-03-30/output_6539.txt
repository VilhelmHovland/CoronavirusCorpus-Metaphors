Healthcare workers are putting in long , hard hours these days , doing their best to aid in whatever ways are possible during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic .
We should all be appreciative for everything they are doing .
Illinois head coach Lovie Smith voiced that very opinion recently , wanting to give a shoutout to everyone working in the healthcare profession .
Smith , who has some family who work in that field , is thankful for all the work those individuals are putting in right now .
" There 's a lot of healthcare people out there that are doing so much to keep this country safe and help us fight this disease , " Smith said in an audio clip shared by Illinois Twitter account .
" Talk about some MVPs .
"  As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continue to rise across the country , the jobs done by healthcare workers continues to rise in importance .
They are putting their own interests and health on the line for the betterment of the nation .
We should all be commending those healthcare workers .
