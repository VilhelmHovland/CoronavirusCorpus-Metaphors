Thankful for those who keep people safe  In this crazy time , we are thinking of and are thankful for our medical personnel and first responders , and yes , they are on the front lines .
But I would like to say we should think of and be thankful for other important but overlooked people who are helping to keep us somewhat normal .
They are those who keep our utilities and power sources going , ( electricity , water , gas ) ; those who take away our waste ; those who provide our food and medicine by transporting and staffing the grocery stores , restaurants , and pharmacies ; those who deliver our mail ; those who make sure we have continued access to others by phone , the internet and social media ; those educators who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home who are working to provide needed medical supplies ; and those in governance who are working to hold all of this together .
And there are those who are not mentioned here , but also work to keep us safe .
Those of us who are doing our small part by staying home owe a big THANK YOU to all of them .
