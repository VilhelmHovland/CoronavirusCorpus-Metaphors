However , now that China says it 's beaten the virus , the markets seem to have resumed business as usual .
I think we all deserve some blame by enabling China and allowing them for what they 've become with our ever quests to find the cheapest priced items for years .
Maybe we can learn from this crisis and deal China in a way to tame the beast .
We should invade China .
And all you MAGA-mooks should volunteer to be on the front line of the invasion if you truly believe in your crusade .
If you want war , you do n't get to sit it out playing armchair general , you 'll have to go ahead and put your arse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frick The Chinese government and frick anyone that supports them .
You mean like all the U .
corporations who also prop up the corporate Democrats AND REPUBLICANS you all vote for ? I guess you 'll have to frick yourself , too .
