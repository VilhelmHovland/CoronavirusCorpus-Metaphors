The Lockdown Chronicles #3 : Pele , Ronaldo and me  If there 's one thing that we are good at as South Africans , its " sneaking one past the goalie " .
I mentioned in my previous Lockdown Chronicle that Nielsen is reporting increased TV audience ratings in a number of major US markets during these early weeks of voluntary isolation .
One wonders how it will play out here in Mzansi and which channels and programmes will be the beneficiaries .
One thing we know for sure it wo n't be the sports channels .
Having said that , I have to acknowledge that many #media stakeholders are valiantly trying to extract whatever residual value remains in programming and sponsorships , and stoking up viewers ' sporting passions and rivalries , by rerunning classic games and generally creating new sporting narratives .
There was an interesting show this morning with Pele deliberating on whether Cristiano Ronaldo or Messi was the GOAT .
Personally I would n't look further than Pele himself .
Now there was someone who knew how to sneak one past the goalie .
But I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ( because Bafana Bafana 's last decent goal was scored by Shabba against Mexico in 2010 ) , but also metaphorically .
Actually .
On reflection .
Who am I kidding ? Saffers just do n't follow the rules .
One of the biggest barriers to adoption of ES as a functional planning tool has been the lack of trending .
it is certainly no longer a valid argument for continuing to use , as many agencies are , five-year old data from AMPS .
On the very first day of #Lockdown2020 , over 50 people were arrested for ignoring the rules .
Sorry to say but there 's also more than enough video evidence of " skop " and " donner " and even a little bit of " skiet " to know that Cyril 's plea for the armed forces to win over the hearts and minds of the people has fallen on deaf ears .
After watching some of the video content , I ca n't help wondering how someone could imagine for one moment that they would get away with carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sneaking one past the goalie requires some finesse .
I mean , what 's wrong with an old fashioned ' inspuiting ' ? That 's a time-honoured South African tradition that has served generations of rugby-goers well over the years .
Nobody would have got arrested yesterday for carrying around a bag of naartjies !  But I digress .
Someone else tried to sneak one past the goalie yesterday when ES2019 AB was released .
This is the most recent of the Establishment Surveys in the post AMPS environment and it will also be the last under the joint banner of BRC and PRC .
What is interesting is that this release gives us a great opportunity to trend some of the key datasets over a three-year period from Jan-Dec 2017 through to Jan-Dec 2019 .
One of the biggest barriers to adoption of ES as a functional planning tool has been the lack of trending .
Not that the argument held much value in the first place , but it is certainly no longer a valid argument for continuing to use , as many agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the big advantages of Lockdown2020 .
We 've got time do the kinds of things we always mean to but never get around to .
So over the coming days I will review some of the key trends coming out of ES2019 AB .
Unless I run out of naartjies of course , in which case I 'll have to go out shopping .
