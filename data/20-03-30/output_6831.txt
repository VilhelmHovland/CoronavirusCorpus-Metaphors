2M Alliance Announces Deep Cuts to Asia-Europe Services  Maersk and MSC , the world 's largest ocean carriers and the two primary partners of the 2M alliance , have implemented deep cuts in service on the core Asia-Europe trade lanes due to the COVID-19 outbreak .
This new round of cuts is driven by falling demand in Western consumer markets , not by the supply disruption in China that forced carriers to slash dozens of sailings in February and March .
The new cuts include a temporary suspension of the 2M AE20/Dragon and AE2/Swan services for all of the second quarter of 2020 , beginning with the sailings of the MSC Venice and the MSC Sixin .
The MSC Sixin is one of MSC 's new Megamax-24 class of ultra-large container ships , the largest of their kind at 23,500-23,700 TEU each ; in general , ULCVs achieve economies of scale when sailing full .

Other shipping alliances have not yet announced parallel reductions , but Sea-Intelligence forecast more cuts to come from the competing Ocean Alliance and THE Alliance .
