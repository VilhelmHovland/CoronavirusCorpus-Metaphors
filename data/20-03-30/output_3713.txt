Ramaphosa on SA lockdown : ' There is a light at the end of the tunnel '  The President of South Africa says there 's hope in the tale of the Wuhan evacuees .
President Cyril Ramaphosa has urged South Africans to stay strong and disciplined during the national lockdown , which is aimed to curb the spread of COVID-19 , as the country enters its first full week under the new regulations .
Focusing on the 114 Wuhan evacuees as a prime example of self-sacrifice and determination , Ramaphosa , in his customary Monday letter to the nation , noted that while the country was experiencing severe challenges -- in both fighting COVID-19 and attempting to alleviate the fierce financial pressure on citizens -- a united South Africa would overcome this difficult period .
Wuhan evacuees : A story of resilience and hope  Ramaphosa , who , on Sunday , met with the South African expatriates who were evacuated from Wuhan in China earlier this month , praised the efforts of all involved in the rescue operation .
During a media briefing in Polokwane , Ramaphosa confirmed that all evacuees had tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51 days in Wuhan and 14 days at the Ranch Hotel in Limpopo .
The evacuees would now embark on the next leg of their quarantine regime under South Africa 's national lockdown .
Fortunately , as pointed out by the president , these citizens would now , for the first time in months , be able to spend time at home with their families .
While the lockdown continues to embattle South Africans on all fronts -- financially , psychologically and socioeconomically -- questions loom over the country 's road to recovery post-lockdown .
The recent downgrade the ' junk status ' , delivered by global ratings agency , Moody 's , over the weekend , has done little allay fears of a lengthy financial recession .
Still , the primary focus remains on keeping South Africans healthy and safe , as the number of global COVID-19 infections exceed 700 000 , with a death toll of over 33 000 .
Lockdown and beyond : South Africa braces for tough times ahead  Ramaphosa reiterated that while the lockdown may be extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of COVID-19 and remained the country 's best chance of survival .
Ramaphosa elaborated on the topic :  " The containment of the disease in Wuhan City , in Hubei Province and in other places across China required a massive and extraordinary effort .
It involved drastic restrictions on daily life and is having a severe impact on the Chinese economy .
Other countries that have taken similar measures are having greater success in managing the spread of the disease than countries that have been slower to respond .
It is now abundantly clear that the most effective way for a society to contain the spread of the disease is for the population to remain at home and physically isolated from each other for at least several weeks .
"  Ramaphosa added that the lockdown 's effectiveness in curbing the spread of COVID-19 would ultimately be decided by citizens ' obedience .
Since the lockdown officially began at midnight on Thursday 26 March , hundreds have been arrested for flouting regulations under the Disaster Management Act .
Both the South African National Defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been kept busy enforcing the lockdown laws , particularly in densely populated areas .
Adhering to the lockdown law  Ramaphosa added that while the strict rules added strain to citizens , especially to those living in poorly-constructed abodes in close proximity to one another , regulations , no matter how stringent , needed to be adhered .
The president said :  " But the lesson from the South Africans in Wuhan is that a lockdown works .
It shows that if we strictly observe the rules in place to stop the virus spreading , we will be able to bring infection rates down .
It shows that if we cooperate with health authorities in doing what we have to do , we wo n't be just saving our own lives but those around us too .
"  ' A light at the end of the tunnel '  The president ended his Monday-letter by calling on all South Africans to observe the regulations during this difficult period , noting that a unified approach was necessary to combatting COVID-19 .
Recounting the efforts of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story of our South African returnees from Wuhan should give us encouragement and hope in the difficult weeks that lie ahead .
Their story tells us that there is a light at the end of the tunnel , that if we stay the course , that if we remain disciplined and respect the lockdown , that if we work together , we will overcome .
"  On Monday 30 March at 08:00 the number of confirmed COVID-19 infections in South Africa stood at 1 280 , with two recorded deaths .
