AFL considering best-of-three grand final series  AAP  March 30 , 2020 8:06AM  The AFL is still open to a wildcard finals series and best-of-three grand final format , but time is running out due to coronavirus lockdowns .
League fixtures boss Travis Auld says the wildcard format , which could allow teams just outside the top eight to compete in the opening round of the finals , is still an option but it will further lengthen an already truncated season .
" If we have got the time maybe but things would have to change really quickly for us to be in a position where we have spare time , " Auld told the Herald Sun .
" If we had kept going from Round One we would have had spare time but every week that goes by you lose that space .
" Getting 17 rounds away in a shortened period of time and then four weeks of finals is our base .
"  In response to the unprecedented conditions presented by COVID-19 , the league has already shortened the season to 17 rounds and shrunk quarters to 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to rule out playing a grand final as late as December away from the MCG , with the league to get creative if given the green light to restart the season .
The AFL was on Friday handed the flexibility to play games deep into December when the AFL Players ' Association agreed to a new pay deal to slash wages by up to 70 per cent in response to the shutdown .
