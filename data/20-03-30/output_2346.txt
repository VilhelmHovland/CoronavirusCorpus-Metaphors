Managing the Stress of COVID-19  Finding calm in a world of chaos .
THE BASICS  If you find it hard to stay calm during this COVID-19 pandemic , you are not alone .
From the constant news about the most recent death counts to border closings to the long lines at your local grocery store , it is hard not to feel the effects of this health crisis .
If you are lucky , your business can still be run remotely without much impact on your bottom line .
But if you are in the hospitality , restaurant , travel , or event business , you are definitely feeling the impact on your bottom line as people stay home , travel bans get implemented , and major events get canceled .
No matter who you are , feeling stressed and afraid is a normal response to an illness about which there is still so much to learn and a health crisis for which the country seems unprepared .
But even if you do n't succumb to the coronavirus , the chronic stress that may result from constant fear and anxiety about the illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarantine , can cause physical symptoms of their own .
Common symptoms of chronic stress include headaches , insomnia , muscle tension , stomach distress such as heartburn and acid reflux , and joint pain .
You may also experience behavioral symptoms , such as increased smoking , eating , or drinking , and emotional symptoms , such as irritability , anxiety , or depression .
Furthermore , the demands of social distancing may mean that your usual stress management strategies , such as going to the gym or hanging out with loved ones , are no longer accessible to you .
So here are some stress management techniques for getting you through the next few weeks until life goes back to some sense of normalcy .
Breathe .
Taking slow , deep breaths is a great way to calm down your entire body and your mind .
To do this , close your eyes and take in a deep breath through your nose on a count of five , hold for a count of three , then breathe out through your mouth on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time you feel stressed , to start your day in the right mood , and to get calm at the end of your day so you can get a good night 's sleep .
Focusing on the breath is a simple start .
You can also meditate , with or without a mantra .
You can take some time to sit quietly and repeat affirmations that keep you thinking positively .
For example , during these times when we have to be socially isolated , you could repeat several times , " This will pass , " or " I will get through this , " while sitting quietly with your eyes closed .
And if you have not yet tried yoga , you can find lots of free yoga classes on YouTube to get started .
Go outside .
If you are one of the millions of people now working from home , and the weather is amenable , find a spot outside to take the laptop and the phone calls .
This will help keep the stir crazies away .
Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the virus or the stock market , but listening to the news all day every day is going to exacerbate any feelings of anxiety , stress , or sadness .
Check the news and social media at set times of the day , and limit yourself to 15 minutes at a time .
And when you get on social media , spend some time on things that make you smile or laugh and touch your heart in some way .
Exercise -- and do it outside .
You need to exercise now more than ever .
Take a walk , ride a bike , go for a run , take the yoga mat outside , or do some calisthenics in your backyard or on your balcony .
Movement releases the pleasure hormonedopamine , which makes us feel good , and fresh air and sunshine are also great for boosting your mood .
But remember to keep your distance .
So go outside early in the morning or late in the evening , stay in your neighborhood , and forego public parks and trails .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with others , now is a great time to spend some quality time together .
Bring out the board games and the puzzles .
Have long conversations .
Call that friend or cousin you have n't spoken to in months .
Do mindfulness exercises together .
Develop a schedule for calling your parents , children , siblings , or friends .
And if you find yourself needing some personal space from the people you live with , then formally structure some alone time for everyone to reduce the stress of too much togetherness .
Get your financial house in order .
Do your taxes .
Go through your bank and credit card statements and cancel those unwanted subscriptions .
Cancel travel plans .
Make a budget .
Manage your investments .
If you have lost a job , or your income has been impacted by the economic impacts of COVID-19 , now is the time to make a financial plan for getting through the next three months .
Get creative .
With all this time on your hands , you can skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crafting or household project you have n't had time to do .
Indulging your creativity is an excellent distraction and a great way to de-stress .
Knit , paint , sew , or create a photo book of your last vacation .
Paint a room or some furniture .
Write .
If you were not someone who journals , now is a good time to put your feelings and thoughts down on paper .
This is a historic time , and this wo n't just help you process your emotions in the present but help you put this time in context later .
You can also express your creativity through poetry .
Learn something .
Now is the time to learn a language , build professional skills , or learn a new hobby .
If you had a trip planned that you had to cancel , maybe you want to learn a new language to help you when you do finally get to travel again .

There are lots of free classes on YouTube , and you can also explore classes on a learning platform like Coursera or Teachable , etc .
It can be easy to focus on all the negatives that result from dealing with a pandemic , so being deliberate about being grateful is a great way to counteract the negativity .
Start and end each day by stating -- or journaling -- at least three things you are grateful for .
Research shows that this reduces stress and increases feelings of optimism .
For organizations that want to help employees manage stress during this challenging period , start meetings with a one-sentence or one-word check-in , or provide a prompt for people to respond to that will put them in a positive space .
Check-in with your staff 1 to 1 .
Acknowledge that your staff may have mental health challenges as a result of the stresses of COVID-19 and remind them of the mental health resources that your organization provides .
Set up online drop-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of online resources that they can access for meditation , exercise , and mental health .
Lastly , it is important to remember that this period of crisis is temporary , and if we all take the appropriate public health steps to reduce the likelihood of infection , the pandemic will slow down , and life will get back to normal sooner rather than later .
So wash your hands frequently , wear a mask if you are sick , stay 6 feet away from each other , and keep calm and carry on .
