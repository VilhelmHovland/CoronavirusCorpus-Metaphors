Police officers are taking measures to protect themselves from the new coronavirus , operating on what 's known as a differential response plan .
Under the plan , a Cincinnati police officer may not show up in-person to report certain crimes like thefts or property damage , but every report is being investigated .
Officers work closely with the public and each other , meaning precautions have to be taken to prevent the spread of the virus .
In Detroit , the Detroit Free Press reports , the spread of the new coronavirus has swept through the Detroit Police Department , infecting Chief James Craig ( who formerly was Cincinnati 's police chief ) and putting nearly 20% of sworn officers in quarantine .
