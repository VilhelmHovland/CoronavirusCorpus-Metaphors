The discussion starts with a look at the pressure on global markets , with the potential of a worldwide recession a definitely possibility .
Els says the duration of the crisis is uncertain as the medical fraternity is still trying to understand much about the disease .
The full cost of the outbreak can only be determined when the threat is over and life returns to normal worldwide .
Despite the chaos caused by Covid-19 , he does acknowledge that the government has taken strong decisive action in dealing with the crisis .
The lowering of interest rates and stimulus announced in the US and by local authorities such as the Reserve Bank are a step in the right direction but it is unlikely to be enough to stem the negative effects of the crisis , says Els .
He is however hopeful that when the crisis is over there will likely be a recovery as people get back to work and start buying items that are restricted , unavailable or perhaps not a priority now .
With global oil prices having fallen dramatically in recent weeks , a petrol price decrease is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Though many South Africans wo n't be putting petrol in their cars due to the lockdown , Els says this is good for consumers as it will help with lowering input costs for many other goods and services .
