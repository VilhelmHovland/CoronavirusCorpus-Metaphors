You know what America wants to know ? Why Trump ca n't give a straight answer to journalists about his response to the coronavirus crisis , why he has n't consistently instituted protocols consistent with the advice ( and warnings ) of medical experts , and why he wo n't ensure that all the states get the resources they need without their governors having to genuflect in his presence .
Meanwhile , you know what Trump does want America to know ? That we wo n't be paying for the security detail of new California residents , the Duke and Duchess of Sussex .

While living in Canada , a nation that is part of the British Commonwealth , the Sussesexes did receive federally funded security assistance as part of their royal status .
After it was widely reported on Friday that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had relocated from Vancouver Island to Los Angeles , where their small family has been sheltering in place , the announcement peaked excitement , concern , and derision , depending upon who you asked .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being senior members of the British monarchy will be complete tomorrow , March 31 -- ever ask the United States to pay for their security detail in their new home .
In fact , as CNN reports , " a Sussex spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Sunday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the US government for security resources .
Privately funded security arrangements have been made .
"  But apparently , your president ( whose ego is likely still smarting from the fact that the couple has wisely avoided any and all direct contact with him since his election ) would rather be petty and discuss nonexistent issues than the very real and increasingly deadly issue facing his country at this moment .
Seriously , why , when we 're now the epicenter of the coronavirus , is Trump fixating on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ? .
