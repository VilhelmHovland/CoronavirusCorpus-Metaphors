Daniela Germano The Canadian Press Published Sunday , March 29 , 2020 10:15AM EDT  SHARE  Luciana Infusino-Tomei has been left alone to care for her young daughter during the COVID-19 pandemic after her husband was sent to prison last year on a drug-related charge .
The 38-year-old woman from Vaughan , Ont .
, is one of many worrying about the health and safety of their incarcerated loved ones , whose living arrangements make them particularly vulnerable to the novel coronavirus that has so far infected thousands of people and killed dozens across the country .
" Sometimes I find myself having to hold back my tears , " Infusino-Tomei says .
" My anxiety is through the roof , and so is my husband 's , because he is away from us .
"  She says she has n't been able to get support in caring for their 19-month-old because her parents are older and in poor health .
Her husband , Adrian Tomei , is serving a three-year sentence at Beaver Creek Institution north of Toronto , after he pleaded guilty last year to possession of cocaine for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- who have no other criminal history , were convicted of a non-violent crime and have a safe place to stay -- should be released from prison , where she fears COVID-19 would spread uncontrollably .
" There is no excuse for making bad decisions , " she says .
" He is paying his dues .
He plead guilty from the onset and he was a man from the beginning by standing up and facing the music .
"  But she says prisoners are unable to self-isolate and have limited access to hygiene and sanitary products , so sending those who are not a risk to public safety may be the best thing during a pandemic .
" We know mass quarantines do n't work because of those people left on cruise ships for weeks at a time , " Infusino-Tomei says .
" If something like that happens in prison , it 's going to be far more dangerous , far more catastrophic on a far larger scale .
"  She says her husband has applied for parole by exception and is working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Chip ) O'Connor , Tomei 's parole lawyer , cites a section of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act that allows early release for an offender for whom continued confinement would constitute an excessive hardship .
" My argument is that the pandemic is a public health risk for prisoners and the risk of getting the virus is a hardship that was not previously foreseen , " O'Connor says .
He says he has suggested to the commissioner of corrections and the Parole Board of Canada that efforts should be made to release non-violent prisoners soon , as the pandemic is expected to peak in Canada in the coming weeks .
He , as well as other legal advocates in Canada , are also calling for the government to recognize parole officers as essential workers , since they play a key role in getting applications processed .
" I 'm not asking that they let everybody out of jail , " O'Connor says .
" But if they would just take that step , and if they had the political will to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put people in their homes and it would .
flatten the curve .
"  He notes he has many clients who are older or have compromised immune systems that would cause major complications if they were to get the novel coronavirus .
In a statement , the Correctional Service of Canada says measures such as a contingency planning for food , supplies and necessary medical equipment has been adopted .
" CSC has taken full inventory of existing personal protective equipment supplies and has worked with the Public Health Agency of Canada to purchase additional supplies as necessary , " it says .
" We have also distributed additional soap , cleaning supplies and hand sanitizer to staff and inmates and we are educating staff and inmates on the prevention and spread of illness , including the importance of good hygiene practices .
"  The CSC , as well as the office of Public Safety Minister Bill Blair , says there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the federal system .
But , the province of Ontario confirmed Thursday that an inmate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Saskatchewan announced Friday that two workers at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre also contracted the virus .
It 's something that worries Infusino-Tomei , who says it 's just a matter of time before COVID-19 enters the federal system .
" If we want to get out of this with the fewest deaths .
the only way to do that is to give these inmates an opportunity to isolate , " she says .
" Let 's not look back and say we should have done something , let 's do something now while there is still time to save lives .
