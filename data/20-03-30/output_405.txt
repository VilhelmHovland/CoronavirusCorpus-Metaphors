Last week , the baseball site FanGraphs was supposed to be rolling out positional power rankings and celebrating Opening Day .
Instead , David Appelman , FanGraphs ' founder and CEO , was cutting his roster to keep the site in business .
Ten full-time staffers , including Appelman , had their salaries cut .
Appelman laid off more than 20 freelancers .
He closed the longform site The Hardball Times , which was founded in 2004 .
With its suite of metrics , FanGraphs is a go-to site for statistically inclined baseball writing , with an alumni network that stretches into front offices ( Dave Cameron ) and media ( FiveThirtyEight 's Travis Sawchik ) .
Until the ad crunch caused by the coronavirus , it had none of the battle scars of , say , newspapers .
" We 've always grown , " Appelman said .
" This is the first time I 've ever had to do a layoff in 15 years running this .
"  In March , FanGraphs ' traffic usually soars as readers put together their fantasy drafts .
Without baseball games , Appelman said , traffic has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Think weekends in the offseason , " he said , " or maybe even some time like Thanksgiving .
But it 's every day .
"  FanGraphs is also funded by thousands of readers who buy memberships starting at $20 a year .
This is mostly a goodwill gesture , since the site does n't put articles behind a paywall .
Most recurring members have stayed with FanGraphs .
But after March 12 , the day Major League Baseball announced it was delaying the season , the site 's new membership sign-ups virtually stopped .
" If baseball starts in July , things can potentially start to ramp back up , " Appelman said .
" But from a yearly budget standpoint , I have to essentially find hundreds of thousands of dollars that are not there .
That 's the problem .
I mean , they 're not there .
"  In a pandemic , all hell is relative .
There are people suffering dire medical and financial consequences .
With that proviso , the next few months are going to be a disastrous economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted through the sheer frivolity of their work went away as soon as the leagues stopped playing games .
This may be the first economic crisis that singles out sportswriters for layoffs , pay cuts , or terminated freelance work .
The early signs are incredibly grim .
The Athletic paused some freelance contracts .
The soccer magazine First Touch , which is distributed in New York 's now-shuttered bars and restaurants , suspended print publication .
Newspaper layoffs have claimed the jobs of everyone from the Penguins beat writer at the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review to the sports editor at the Imperial Valley Press in El Centro , California .
Freelance writers have lost thousands of dollars they were counting on because games they were supposed to cover this month were canceled .
There were already plenty of forces bearing down on legacy media .
The coronavirus and the recession that might follow have become their accelerants .
" It 's already over , " a poster wrote on the site SportsJournalists .
this month .
" We 're all done .
All of us .
"  According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts now .
" We could have kept on staff for another month or two , " he said .
" But we would have hit a liquidity crunch .
We would have been insolvent .
We would have been bankrupt .
It was not an option .
" ( The Ringer 's Ben Lindbergh hosts a podcast at FanGraphs .
)  Rowley said the site tried to preserve deals for writers who derive their entire incomes from sportswriting , rather than the site 's contributors who have full-time jobs outside of media and write for FanGraphs as a side gig .
" It makes you realize how inessential in the grand scheme of things this kind of work is .
But a lot of people do really good , smart work and they face uncertainty .
It 's scary personally and it 's scary for the industry .
" -- Meg Rowley , FanGraphs managing editor  Brendan Gawlowski falls into the latter camp .
He works at a higher education dot-com in Seattle .
Before getting laid off from FanGraphs , the site paid him slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money was just getting to write for a website like that , " he said on Saturday .
Gawlowski 's case is instructive because he hopes to land a full-time gig in journalism or with a team .
The coronavirus has cut off even that audition period .
" When you 're entering a permanent offseason for the foreseeable future , things are only going to get tighter , " he said .
If the ad crunch hits small-margin companies and then reaches ESPN or The Athletic , some massive dominoes could fall .
During national emergencies , sportswriters first suffer an identity crisis .
Now , they 're suffering an economic crisis .
" It makes you realize how inessential in the grand scheme of things this kind of work is , " Rowley said .
" But a lot of people do really good , smart work and they face uncertainty .
It 's scary personally and it 's scary for the industry .
"  Seth Rorabaugh , the Penguins beat writer at the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review , got the news he 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he has performed odd tasks like paying bills and working on his taxes -- a process of unplugging from his all-consuming beat , which he compared to the military idea of " embracing the suck .
"  " Sometimes you wonder what it would be like to have a more normal 9-to-5 , " Rorabaugh said .
" To be able to go to friends ' and families ' birthday parties and weddings and things like that , instead of going to a practice or a game .
" I really do n't want a 9-to-5 , " he said .
" I like the fact that it 's so chaotic and erratic and irregular .
Maybe I 'm just an irregular person .
"  The cuts that got Rorabaugh , which Trib Total Mediablamed on a plunge in ad revenue , showed just how widespread the damage from the next few months is likely to be .
Sports columnist Kevin Gorman , who joined the paper in 1999 , also lost his job .
So did writers and broadcasters who worked for the TribLIVE High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the beat writer , and the high school writers , you 've pretty much gotten everybody .
Newspaper sportswriters already knew the horrors of the ad crunch , shrinking budgets , and the stewardship of hedge funds like Alden Global Capital .
Now , the carnage is moving faster .
On March 23 , the New Orleans Times-Picayune and The Advocate announced they had " furloughed " -- that is , sent away without pay -- multiple reporters , and reduced the rest of their staff to a four-day workweek .
Sportswriters at the Greenfield , Massachusetts , Recorder and the Daily Hampshire Gazettesaid they had been laid off .
Last Wednesday , Aaron Bodus lost his job as the sports **26;1472;TOOLONG at the Imperial Valley Press in California .
Bodus was one of four regular reporters in the paper 's newsroom .
When Rorabaugh broke into journalism in 2000 , his career followed a typical newspaper trajectory .
He filled in agate and box scores at the rival Pittsburgh Post-Gazette until he scored an in-house blog and started helping with Penguins reporting .
He left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he later did a stint at The Athletic .
Last fall , Rorabaugh got the call for a big job : the Penguins beat writer at the Tribune-Review .

Rorabaugh held the job for all of about seven months .
" I kind of figured at some point something like that might happen , maybe not as soon as it did , " he said .
He has applied for unemployment and has enough savings to get by for a while .
Rorabaugh 's insurance expires at the end of the month , though like a lot of writers , he has been without insurance before .
Rorabaugh said Susan McFarland , the Tribune-Review 's executive editor , was kind when she delivered the news .
" She told me if there 's an opportunity , once things stabilize for the paper , they 'd like to have me back , if that opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " temporary " is one you hear a lot with coronavirus cuts .
In cases like Rorabaugh 's , the cuts will surely be temporary , because someone needs to cover the Penguins when the NHL returns .
But " temporary " supposes the country wo n't be mired in a recession -- or , more optimistically , that a new golden age of newspapers is around the corner .
When FanGraphs ' Appelman laid off staffers , he was careful not to make promises , in case the site had discovered its new normal .
In his Twitter goodbye , Rorabaugh hinted that he might be finished with writing hockey .
" I 'm kind of resigned to the fact that I might not be able to go back to this , " he told me .
" If that happens , I 'm at peace with it .
I certainly hope it does n't happen that way .
"  On March 12 , Jeff Arnold was covering the Big Ten basketball tournament for TheNew York Times when players were pulled off the court and the tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event for a memoir .
For a freelancer like Arnold , it was a disaster .
As he drove home to Chicago , he realized the subsequent cancellation of March Madness would cost him three weeks ' worth of income .
" It 's a long time in the car , " he said .
" You 're just thinking , Wow , this is all going away .
"  Sportswriting has a sprawling freelance class that chips in game stories and features and bulks up the roster of newspapers already stretched thin by budget cuts .
When Arnold covers the Big Ten tournament for the Times , he makes a newspaper seem like it has a greater reach than it does .
If freelancers live in a near-constant state of economic anxiety , the cancellation of games has made it worse .
When former newspaper staffers enter the freelance market , there are fewer assignments for everyone .
Moreover , content farms have created a permanent freelancer class .
In an economic downturn , that makes writers even easier to cut .
Dave Hogg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost seemed recession-proof .
Hogg writes Pistons and Tigers gamers for the Associated Press and Red Wings gamers for NHL .
Those gigs evaporated when the leagues suspended play .
" I get paid by the game , " Hogg said .
" I have n't gotten a dime since they stopped .
" In his free time , Hogg started simulating games across sports , and set up a Patreon so readers could pay him to be a deadline writer in absentia .
Paul Harris , a hockey writer in Detroit , freelances Red Wings gamers for the AP .
" Things were tight , anyway , " he said of the period before the crunch .
Harris , too , found out that all his gigs had vanished .
" This is certainly undiscovered territory , " he said .
To call the New Orleans writer Guerry Smith a " freelancer " is like calling Jrue Holiday a glue guy .
Over the past 12 months , Smith said he 'd written 370 articles for the Times Picayune and The Advocate , most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per article ; the rest of his income comes from writing for the Associated Press and running the Tulane Rivals .
site .
TheAdvocate told Smith his freelancing was being paused for six weeks .
In a nervy period in New Orleans , which has more than 2,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus , Smith is able to get insurance through his wife , a college professor .
One night this month , Larry Lage , an AP sportswriter , got to thinking about such cases .
The next morning , Lage told me , he woke up in tears .
On March 13 , he set up a fundraiser on Facebook with a goal of raising $2,000 to distribute to freelancers he knew who 'd lost work .
Lage quickly met that goal .
He reached out to reporter pals to publicize the fund and help find worthy recipients .
With donations from Adrian Wojnarowski and Jemele Hill , Lage has raised more than $16,000 .
He has put money into the Venmo accounts of everyone from writers like Arnold and Hogg to TV makeup artists .
Lage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to distribute less than $3,000 per week .
" There 's a lot of people that are going to get hurt by this , " Lage said .
" And it 's the fear of the unknown .
There 's no one who can tell you how or when this is going to end .
" I 've kind of thought , how could I make this sustainable long term ? " he continued .
" Is there a nonprofit here ? " It 's a noble sentiment that doubles as a terrible comment on the viability of sportswriting .
Arnold , the Chicago-based freelancer , is trying to refit himself for a sports-less world .
He sent a White Sox story to TheNew York Times in hopes it could be squeezed into the section .
He helped the Times ' Chicago bureau with its interactive coronavirus map .
He has been spelling overworked editors at the local Patch site .
Arnold finds it easier not to think about the money he has lost .
" We 're all looking at each other like , What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
