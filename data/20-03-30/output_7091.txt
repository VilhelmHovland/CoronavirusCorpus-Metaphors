Most fixed-line broadband packages were already advertised as having " unlimited " data , with the exception of cut-price packages for those on benefits .
It used to be the case that many " unlimited " packages had hidden data caps in their small print , known as " fair usage policies " .
However , changes made to the UK 's advertising rules mean that references to " unlimited " can no longer involve such caveats .
Even so , some households still on older contracts which were never updated could still have had data caps in place , and going over those limits can be expensive .
Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said it was " fantastic " to see the industry " pulling together to do their bit for the national effort " .
The announcement was , however , light on detail on some of the commitments .
It is not yet clear what fair treatment for those with difficulty paying bills looks like .
And the " generous " new packages to be offered include things like " data boosts at low prices " and free calls , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost .
Similarly , those who are waiting on repairs to their broadband should be given " alternative " methods of communication , the statement said , without specifying what that meant .
