The Manitoba government says that the travel restrictions they imposed on March 23 , 2020 , that recommend 14-day self-isolation and self-monitoring for international or domestic travellers will not apply to residents who are travelling to border communities including visits to their camps or cottages .
This would mean the thousands of Winnipegers who have cottages and camps in the Lake of the Woods area would not be impacted .
Effective March 23 , public health officials recommended anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their return .
This recommendation does not include : * the commercial transportation of goods ; * workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work ; * health care workers who travel to work from outside the province ; and * normal personal travel in border communities including visits to a cottage .

No one will be denied entry into Manitoba at these locations .
Signage will also be placed at the Winnipeg Richardson International Airport and the Brandon Municipal Airport to ensure people arriving on domestic flights have similar information .
The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage in good social distancing protocols including practising following the 3P 's -- protect yourself , protect your loved ones and protect your community .
