This 7th grade teacher , now stuck teaching online , has found a way to spice up his lesson plan with a trip to City 17 .
Feature by Mathew Olson , Reporter  Updated on 30 March 2020  Charles Coomber is a virtual reality advocate , a big Half-Life fan , and a very responsible teacher .
He teaches multiple subjects at Otay Ranch Academy for the Arts , a Chula Vista , California middle school in the Springs Charter School network .
Every weekday , for a class of 32 students , Coomber covers everything from world history to art instruction .
Coomber still teaches his 32 students every day , but now he 's doing it remotely .
Earlier this month , as California enacted a strict statewide stay-at-home order in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak , teachers across the state took home their computers and prepared to rework their lesson plans .
Along with his computer , Coomber took home his classroom 's Oculus virtual reality headset .
Last week , shortly after the release of Valve 's highly anticipated VR exclusive Half-Life : Alyx , a video Coomber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiteboard markers in Half-Life : Alyx 's opening area -- used by many others to draw Simpsons characters or more obscene doodles -- Coomber put up an entire math lesson on angle vocabulary , complete with pristine diagrams .
USgamer spoke with Coomber last week about his love for Half-Life , how his VR lesson came about , and what it 's been like for himself and other teachers during the pandemic .
USgamer : Did you buy a headset for Half-Life : Alyx , or have you been into VR for a while ?  Charles Coomber : I mean , I 'm part of the gaming generation that all played Half-Life and Half-Life 2 , and then we 've been waiting a decade , or however long it 's been , for Half-Life 3 to come out .
When Half-Life : Alyx was announced , a lot of gaming people were like " Aw , no , I hate this .
" I was like " yeah ! "  I 've been a very forward adopter of VR .
I have three VR headsets right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now I have a Rift S and the Quest .
I love it .
It 's so immersive .
When I 'm in it , it feels like I 'm gaming in the future I always imagined I would as a kid .
Are you using the Rift S and Oculus Touch controllers in the video of the lesson ?  Yeah ! I made that video , really , because I had to teach the day Alyx came out , but I really wanted to play .
So I played just a little bit , and thought , " It would be hilarious to film a video here , my kids would love it .
"  People have been marveling at your impeccable VR board handwriting .
Which is amazing , because in real life , y'know -- if you go into an elementary school class , you 're like " the boards are all so beautiful .
" My writing is not .
They 'll figure it out , they 're in middle school .
I definitely was being really careful .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " That 's more straight than I can do in real life .
" I do think the game has an assist .
What 's your regular class load like ? Where would this angle vocabulary lesson fall in the course of a normal week of teaching ?  I teach seventh grade right now , and I teach multiple subjects .
So , similar to a traditional fifth grade class where you teach the same kids all day and you teach every single subject .
When we 're not under coronavirus lockdown , I teach live with my 32 kids , and I actually keep my Oculus Rift S at school .
I almost always have a student in VR , unless we 're taking a test .
We use it for a few different things .
First , as an incentive : there 's this kind of boring math program that the kids have to do to up their math skills , so I say " every time you get five percent on that , I 'll give you five minutes in VR .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes at once , then play Beat Saber for half an hour .
There 's a lot of good immersive history simulations and history games in VR right now , so we 'll use it for that , and for a lot of art projects we do them inside of VR .
They 're so mind blowing to the kids .
Their parents will come into exhibitions where we show off the art , and they always go , " Wow , this is something everyone wishes they had when they were growing up .
"  Your video lesson came about not just because of Half-Life : Alyx , but because of the coronavirus pandemic .
What was the transition to teaching remotely from your home like ?  It 's actually such a cool arc .
It just happened on a Friday .
Even earlier that week , we got an email saying , " No , everything 's going to be as usual , we 're just going to continue with normal classes .
" Then , throughout the course of a single Friday , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting after school : " So , it looks like we 're not going to have students here anymore , but we 're still going to be teaching full-time .
" It was really lucky for us , or for my job at the moment , because we 're kind of a hybrid homeschool and in-class school .
Students work from home every single Monday , even in normal times .
All the teachers were really used to creating five hours of home study for those Mondays , so they basically said , " Whatever you do on Mondays , you just have to expand it to include the rest of the week .
"  After a week of that , on March 19 , Governor Gavin Newsom said , " Shut it down ; California 's on real lockdown now .
" The charter administrators said , " If you need anything from school , grab it tonight .
All these teachers came to school at 8 p .
and were taking home all their computers .
It was like extreme looting .
Everyone was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to need a whiteboard , " or " Oh , Clorox wipes , I should definitely take these home .
" It was such a surreal moment .
It 's the safest version , I guess , of an evacuation .
So you 're in a good position to handle this , but do you know anyone who is in a more typical public school scenario who has approached you or your peers for help ?  Yeah , I have live Zoom meetings with all my kids , and it 's actually really nice .
The best part of teaching live , rather than if I pre-recorded five hours of lessons and said , " Go watch it , " is that they still have that community and a role model .
We 're really tight , since I do teach the same 30 kids all day .
I assume most kids have a more personal relationship with , say , their third grade teacher than they would with a normal middle school where you see five teachers a day .
I 'd say it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion from teaching at the site to teaching at home was pretty easy .
Not only were the teachers prepared , but the students were prepared .
A lot of school systems right now , to my understanding , have done nothing .
It 's extended spring break , and they 're slowly ramping up .
I have family friends who have said , " I noticed you 're still teaching , and my kid 's just sitting at home not learning , can you just send him a copy of the work ? " And I say yeah , that 's okay .
Editor 's Note : Springs Charter Schools is also offering free online public education courses for grades K-8 during the pandemic .
Do you have any key advice you 'd pass along to other teachers who have struggled to adapt to this ?  One , any age can do it .
At my school , we have kids as young as pre-kindergarten , literally doing this , mostly with parents helping .
As a middle school teacher I 'm fortunate since my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good programs out there that make things easy , you do n't need to reinvent things .
If you think , " Man , I wish there was some way to do this thing , " it probably already exists , because a lot of other schools have done it .
Also , a lot of educational organizations are making their premium stuff free during this pandemic .
How could people go about supporting your class or other teachers ' classrooms at this time ? What 's the government doing to help , and what do you think it should be doing ?  I absolutely agree that teachers need to be paid more -- and not just paying teachers , but funding schools .
I feel like I 'm pretty talented and smart , but I have friends who are more talented who do n't even consider teaching in the first place , who go , " You ca n't support a family easily on that salary .
" Some people I met in my teaching program have left prematurely , I would say , because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need more money .
If random individuals want to support us , DonorsChoose is really good .
The reason I 'm able to do this is n't that I have so much teacher money to buy fun toys for my classroom .
I use DonorsChoose a lot -- this is my fifth year teaching now , and I keep asking for more and more things .
The community around me has been so gracious .
It 's not just people , corporations sometimes will do it .
It makes such a difference .
It 's such a direct impact on my students .
My karaoke mic is a good example : that one purchase cost the public , I guess , and some of my friends and family , $150 .
It 's been amazing , with Karaoke club at lunch , these middle schoolers who are so shy and cliquey , end up becoming like Glee club .
It 's fun and teambuilding .
So , this is a very minor Half-Life : Alyx spoiler , but there 's at least one other place with whiteboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson from City 17 ?  I might do one more just for the sake of it ! It 's not the most efficient teaching system , but I think that my students would really enjoy me doing one more .
I do n't want this to be my gimmick , though ; middle schoolers have a short attention span , as I 'm sure the regular public does .
Is there anything you hope that Valve or another company involved in VR could learn about the tech 's role in a classroom ?  I think there 's an incredible market for a really solid program or game that could do immersive teaching that would run on Quests .
Right now , a lot of schools can afford Chromebooks .
I envision , I think in the near future , that there could be some decent , MMORPG-style thing with whiteboards where you can also teleport to a mountain when you learn about ecology .
It can be transformative to education .
Even now , with my hybrid school , the kids are not getting quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
With even current levels of technology , I think that program could be pulled off if some triple-A company would make that .
You can see the potential with VR already , more than just being a whiteboard simulator .
