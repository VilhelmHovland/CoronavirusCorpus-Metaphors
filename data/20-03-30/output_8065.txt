COVID-19 : 14-day limited shelter in place order for Abilene goes in effect Tuesday  The Abilene City Council set in place Monday a " limited shelter in place " order to quell the spread of COVID-19 in the community .
The order requires all residents to stay in their residences except for essential activities , such as employment to support their families , shopping for food and medical visits , Mayor Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday , City Manager Robert Hanna said , and continues to April 14 .
" Violations of this order .
can be fined not to exceed $1,000 or confinement in jail up to 180 days , " Hanna said .
" And the violation of any other provision of this is a $1,000 fine .
"  The order was announced during a specially called City Council meeting in Council Chambers at City Hall .
" For some , this order will be more restrictive ; others , not restrictive enough , " Williams said , adding the decision was " not made in isolation .
"  That is , the city took into consideration what other cities are doing , and recommendations from state and health officials .
Behave responsibly  The intent is to slow the spread of COVID-19 using the least restrictive means possible , Hanna said , while encouraging the " highest levels of personal responsibility .
"  " This does n't work if people do n't take this seriously and behave responsibly , " Hanna said .
Businesses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily .
They include :  hair salons  hair stylists  barber shops  nail salons  tattoo parlors  game rooms  bowling alleys  miniature golf facilities  smoking rooms inside tobacco stores  food truck gatherings of more than one truck  Pet groomers also are closed , Williams said in response to a question during the public part of the meeting .
Drive-thru and carryout still will be available at restaurants .
Residents also will be able to go out for activities related to their mental or spiritual health , though distancing and gathering restrictions will be required .
Retail stores have to reduce occupancy by 50 percent or more .
For example , a store with an occupancy limit of 1,000 customers would now be reduced to , at most , 500 , Hanna said .
Stores are to monitor customers entering and exiting the buildings to ensure compliance with social distancing guidelines .
" If the 50 percent maximum building occupancy is not enough to maintain adequate social-distancing requirements in the store for customers that are present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that good social distancing practices are being maintained , " Hanna said .
Allowed movement  The mayor has the option to close additional facilities in the future , and the order allows the city manager to enforce the order " by any means necessary , " Hanna said  Parks will be open , but playground equipment and basketball courts will be closed , Hanna said .
Robert Hanna ( Photo : Contributed photo )  There are no current plans for a citywide curfew , Williams said in response to a question .
Public transportation options remain open , Hanna said .
Indoor and outdoor gatherings will remain limited to 10 people or less , mirroring orders by Gov .
Greg Abbott .
Individuals may seek medical care but are asked to call ahead to their doctors to let them know they are coming .
" It 's important to know if you 're sick or currently experiencing common COVID-19 symptoms including a fever , shortness of breath , or dry cough , you 're required to stay home , " Hanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not end until infected individuals have not had fever for 72 hours , symptoms such as cough have improved and at least 14 days have passed from the time symptoms have first appeared .
" If you do not , we will fine you $1,000 per day , per occurrence , " Hanna said .
" And I can tell you with all seriousness , I will pursue every legal option available to me to make sure that you stay home .
"  That can include monitoring by the Abilene Police Department , or ankle monitoring .
One man confirmed for COVID-19 in Abilene had traveled to New York City and did not self-quarantine , even after showing symptoms and being tested for the disease , Hanna said .
The man now is quarantined at home with an ankle monitoring device , he said .
" This is a serious thing , " Hanna said .
" The fact that you may not feel ill .
does n't mean that your neighbor is n't going to have a severe health reaction to this disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a little bit of self-sacrifice to make sure that our neighbors are healthy and protected .
"  Technical difficulties  Monday morning 's meeting was conducted via digital platforms with the public and media not in attendance because of social distancing guidelines .
The meeting started late because of technical difficulties with the phone system that people could call to ask questions during the public comment part of the agenda .
Individuals attempted to ask questions , though determining who was speaking at any given time was difficult .
Questions ranged from hazard pay for health workers , how those who were easily able to get food , supplies , payment assistance or other necessary items should proceed .
The United Way of Abilene 's 2-1-1 Texas service is a good first option , Hanna said , as is Community Foundation of Abilene , both of which are receiving funds to be administered to nonprofits for assistance .
