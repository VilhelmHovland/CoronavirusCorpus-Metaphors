For all of our safety , the incarcerated population in Northampton needs to be capped based on local hospital capacity .
How many people our jail can hold safely during the COVID-19 pandemic is a product of Cooley Dickinson Hospital 's capacity to absorb a " jail surge , " a sudden spike in the number of hospital admissions coming from the jail .
Hampshire County Sheriff Patrick J .
Cahillane is currently maintaining a population at the Hampshire County Jail and House of Correction of 200 inmates at or near its pre-COVID-19 level .
This is far , far too many for our small local hospital .
Because Sheriff Cahillane is maintaining an inmate population of 200 without social distancing , the COVID-19 jail surge he brings to Cooley Dickinson Hospital will be about 30 patients in a three-day period .
Of these , 15 will need care in the intensive care unit .
These numbers are based on widely available statistics about the rate at which COVID-19 spreads ( exponentially ) , and the proportion of infected people who need hospitalization ( 15% ) and ICU care ( 7% ) .
Cooley Dickinson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICU beds .
By maintaining his incarcerated population at or near its pre-pandemic , 200-person level , Sheriff Cahillane will monopolize the entire ICU capacity of Cooley Dickinson .
All of it .
Every single bed .
Anyone who falls ill while the hospital is treating the jail surge simply will not get ICU care at Cooley Dickinson .
This is unacceptably dangerous .
The sheriff must ask Cooley Dickinson how many of his inmates it can safely accommodate during a three-day surge of admissions from his jail .
Then he needs to release inmates to their homes and families until 15% of his resident population is less than that number .
This is math , not politics .
Reducing the incarcerated population to limit the jail surge is an urgent matter of public safety .
Sheriff Cahillane must not wait another day to identify and achieve a safe jail size .
