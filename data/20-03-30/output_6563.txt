I 'll get straight into it .
The concept of work from home might seem new to some people- laptops and desktops became popular very recently after all .
But here 's a thing- people have been working AND earning from their homes even before the electronic media got into the mainstream market .
Truth be told , the Internet has made this entire process even more feasible .
There 's nothing more disastrous than the way this nature is hitting humans this 2020 .
But is it too bad to work from our bedrooms with a cup of coffee beside us ? I do n't think so .
There are , indeed , challenges while your employees work remotely , especially when you are an SEO company that deals with a lot of sensitive data .
It is very tough to manage employees when they are not working around the corner of your eyes , but it 's certainly not tougher than COVID-19 itself .
Do you want to know how ? Bear with me as I dive into it .
The Problem  Before getting into how to section , let 's answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 86% of employees feel more productive when they work alone .
But how can we rely on this information when it is merely an interpretation of what employees think they do .
Is there any statistical backup ? Certainly not .
But the points that I am going to mention are just a compilation of what employers have actually observed when employees work remotely :  Delay in the completion of tasks .
Goldbricking among telecommuters .
Miscommunication between co-workers .
Data breaching and security issues .
Internet and System errors .
Okay , hold on .
Do n't panic .
This article is nothing about elevating your anxiety and concern for your organization .
I am here to tell you how to cross these hurdles in the best possible ways and brag about it later .
( Just kidding , you do n't have to )  The Solution  With COVID-19 spreading like wildfire , there 's literally no other option than telecommunicating .
And come on , can work from home REALLY hamper your business ? It can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below :  Table of Contents  1 .
Delay in Tasks :  Let 's face it , how is it possible to not get distracted when your sibling plays EDM on the speakers , and your dog sits right beside you ? One of the main issues that remote workers face is the lack of concentration on the assigned task .
The result ? Delays .
Lots of delays .
Delays become a part of the work culture , and seldom does someone finish a task before the deadline .
Solution : Keep regular updates of what your employees are up to and ask them about their work status at regular intervals .
Allot them a deadline , and make sure they complete it by then .
Always ask them to work on shareable and editable files like doc sheets and keep checking their work history every now and then .
Keep up the discipline among the online work premises .
Take necessary actions against the employees who violate the rules and appreciate the ones who complete the tasks before time .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people- the ones who actually do their best to finish a task and the ones who do it just for the sake of doing it .
In short , some people get paid for doing less than their co-workers ; I 'm not even kidding .
And obviously , they will work even less when their bosses are not around at their homes .
( Duh ! )  This phenomenon is known as goldbricking ( for the people who did not know ) and is pretty common among the telecommuters .
Solution : Keeping your employees ' activities in check is important , as I already mentioned in the above point .
But using employee monitoring software is the best way to capture everything that your employees do while they work from home .
There are various options , like EmpMonitor , Teramind , Desktime , Hubstaff , etc .
Get regular screenshots of their screens , graphical records of the work they perform , analyze , and measure their productive and non-productive hours .
Make use of constructive criticism and formulate better strategies to meet your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-to-face communication is a VERY BIG DEAL that people often do not take very seriously .
But if you look closely , you will find many loopholes that indicate a disbalance among your workers only by virtue of improper communication .
Communication issues , when not resolved , create confusion , misinterpretation , delay in work , and may even instigate conflicts among the work from home employees .
( Gulp )  Solution : Allot a single platform for communicating with your employees , for instance , a messaging application .
Install it on all the systems of your employees .
Make groups for separate tasks and assign them to work accordingly .
Apart from text messages , communicate with them via video conferences and voice calls .
Hold regular meetings this way , resolve issues among the employees by allowing them to chat with their colleagues during the spare time while you still monitor them .
Data Breaching :  Here comes the point that is the most obvious among all .
Any SEO company commencing work from home is worried the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ! A recent report shows that a company protects only about 5% of its official data .
Sounds scary ? Yes , it is .
Maintaining data security is already a challenge in the office premises , and it gets even more difficult when sharing this data with your remote employees .
Solution : Create separate user profiles for your employees , starting from Google drive to everything else .
Allow them to work on official tasks using only these accounts , and not their personal ones .
This way , you get access to all the documents they handle and possibly avoid potential threats , if any .
You can also monitor their systems regularly and get updates about everything they do .
Employee monitoring software also lets you track the user logs and keystrokes of the user .
Meaning , you virtually know each and everything that they type and do on their laptops and PCs .
Internet and System Issues :  It is the responsibility of the IT team to look after the internet and system errors in the premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at home .
It becomes problematic for telecommuters to resolve system issues if they lack technical skills , and it gets worse if they bring their office PCs home .
The lack of high-speed Internet also hampers the productivity of these telecommuters .
And not every employee is willing to pay for it .
Solution : As an SEO agency , having high-speed Internet is a basic necessity that you can never compromise .
List the employees who do not have an Internet connection and let the company pay on their behalf .
Ask your employees to keep in regular check with the IT department and ask them to follow a set of protocols to ensure that there 's no issue in the systems .
And even if there is , ask the employees to call a software engineer immediately , let them talk to the IT department of your agency , and take necessary actions .
Ready To Rock The Quarantine ?  Whether you are a startup or a big firm , self-quarantine is for everyone , and let 's be honest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start focusing on the long hours we get at home and utilize it productively instead of lying on the bed ?  Be safe at home , but never compromise on your company 's profits .
COVID-19 has pushed people inside their homes , but that does n't indicate any kind of a downfall if you follow some of the crucial steps , as I have mentioned above .
