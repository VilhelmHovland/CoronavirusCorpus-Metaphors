A Craigavon firm at the centre of a row over its social distancing measures has laid off hundreds of temporary workers .
A number of employees at Thompson Aero Seating ( TAS ) based at Seagoe near Portadown had voiced concern in recent days regarding " cramped " working conditions they claimed were putting them at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19 .
One told the Portadown Times , " We have expressed concern and feel uncomfortable in the current working climate .
" Our workers are being denied simple safety measures .
Are we lesser value people or why is this being allowed ? " they said .
At the time , a company spokesperson said : " Thompson Aero Seating has implemented a number of social distancing practices within its operations where reasonably and practically possible .
These include increasing spacing between operators and redesigning our facility layout .

The letter sent to one of the temporary workers states that their contract , which was due for renewal at the end of this month was now terminated , and that they would be paid one week 's wages in lieu of notice .
" Your P45 and monies due will be forwarded to you through bank transfer in April pay date .
"  The letter reminds the employee of their right to appeal the decision , and adds : " I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your commitment and work with the company over the course of your contract term and I would like to wish you all the best for the future .
"  Speaking to the News Letter as he left the workplace for the last time , one worker said he feels the company should have paid the temporary staff off a few weeks ago rather than have them in the factory during the Covid-19 crisis .
" It 's unbelievable , " he said .
" They worked up through the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a job in the middle of a pandemic , " he added .
In another letter issued to staff members , the management at TAS said : " We are doing everything within our power to keep TAS operating as effectively as possible and minimise the impact COVID-19 has on our business .
"  It added : " These are extremely difficult times for our airline customers , and they are taking difficult but understandable decisions to delay , reduce and reschedule their orders and projects .
" It is therefore with deep regret that , as a direct result of the rescheduling of key projects , we have had to review our production plans and will be releasing the majority of our remaining agency , temp and contractor resources with immediate effect " .
Sinn Fein 's John O'Dowd said the company should have accessed the government 's furlough scheme set up to protect jobs during the current crisis , and added : " I call on management at Thompson 's , even at this eleventh hour , to release these workers under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
