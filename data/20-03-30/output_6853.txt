JOHNSTON -- The novel coronavirus is on a trajectory to peak in Iowa during the next two to three weeks , a state public health official said Sunday .
Sarah Reisetter , deputy director of the state public health department , also cautioned that peak projection could change in the coming days and weeks .
" We 're thinking that we might see a first peak ( of the virus ) in the next two to three weeks , " Reisetter said during Gov .
Kim Reynolds ' latest briefing on the state 's response to the coronavirus .
The briefing was held Sunday at the State Emergency Operations Center at Camp Dodge .
" That 's the best information that we have right now , " Reisetter added .
" I would reiterate that things are changing on a daily basis , and we continue to look at numbers , both here in Iowa and what 's happening in other states .
So that certainly could change .
But that would be our best estimate right now .
"  Thirty-eight new cases of the novel coronavirus were confirmed Sunday , bringing Iowa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier this month , according to state public health data .
A fourth Iowan passed away as a result of the virus on Saturday night , state officials said .
The individual was an older adult --- between the ages of 61 and 80 --- who lived in Linn County , officials said .
They declined to offer any further information .
Fifty-one infected individuals remain hospitalized , while 17 have been discharged and are recovering , according to state data .
Despite their projection of a potential peak in a few weeks , state officials continued to urge Iowans to be cautious in helping to limit the virus ' spread .
Reynolds continued to urge Iowans to stay home as much as possible , limit public trips for essential purposes , and contact a physician when they experience symptoms of the virus , including a fever and difficulty breathing .
" It should be everyone 's assumption that the virus is currently circulating in their community , " Reisetter said .
" Those mitigation strategies are so very important , regardless of where you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing , Reynolds also defended her office 's assertion that surgical abortions are considered non-essential medical procedures , and thus are temporarily banned under her order that such procedures be suspended .
Reynolds said her order to suspend non-essential medical procedures is part of an effort to preserve health care equipment that is needed for health care workers to care for patients infected with the coronavirus .
States with high numbers of the virus are dealing with shortages of that equipment .
When it was suggested that some individuals may not consider an abortion an " elective " or " non-essential " procedure , Reynolds said those individuals should take their concerns or complaints to the state medicine board .
She said other questions have arisen , such as whether removal of a kidney stone is an essential procedure .
" We kept the ( proclamation 's ) language broad , " Reynolds said .
" With every one of the directives that we 've made , or every one of the orders that we 've put in place , there are questions .
So I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the enforcement or the oversight for this .
So as people have questions , that 's where they can go and then they can maybe get the answers that they 're looking for .
"  Reynolds said her decision to suspend non-essential medical procedures , and include surgical abortions in that order , was based on data and the recommendations of health care experts , not her personal ideology .
Reynolds and other Iowa statehouse Republicans have supported myriad legislative proposals to restrict and come close to banning abortions .
Reynolds compared the non-essential medical procedure decision to other orders she has given , including to close restaurants and bars other than drive-through and carryout service , to close schools , and to suspend church services .

SIOUX CITY -- A pallet-load of personal protective equipment arrived in Sioux City Sunday afternoon , delivered by the Iowa National Guard and bound for local medical facilities .
The equipment , including face masks , rubber gloves , smocks and other similar gear , came through state agencies and was delivered to an empty retail warehouse in Sioux City .
The exact quantity of supplies delivered Sunday was not known .
Woodbury County Emergency Coordinator Rebecca Socknat said this was the county 's second delivery of personal protective equipment , the first having arrived last week .
The supplies will be divvied up among medical facilities in the county .
" We 've been reaching out to the hospitals , the long-term care facilities , clinics , our local responders , and a variety of other agencies that are in need of personal protective equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests into the state , because we know we can not purchase them locally here .
"  The lack of personal protective equipment in hospitals and clinics has mushroomed into something of a nationwide crisis in recent weeks , felt most acutely in places like New York City .
Iowa National Guard soldiers from the 1133rd Transportation Company of Mason City , and its detachment in Iowa City , have been mobilized to deliver personal protective equipment to counties throughout the state .
Josh Holt , who was on Sunday 's delivery , said he thinks soldiers from the 1133rd " are going to go to all of " Iowa 's counties .
" Everybody needs all these medical supplies , " Holt said .
Sunday 's drop in Sioux City was their last delivery of the day .
" Who knows how long it 's going to go on .
But , we should have stops every day , " he added .
Though Woodbury County has only a few cases of COVID-19 -- four confirmed , with none known to be hospitalized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Even with the low numbers of cases , our medical providers and staff , our EMS personnel , are still required to have that personal protective equipment , " she said .
DES MOINES , Iowa ( AP ) -- Iowa health officials said Sunday that they have confirmed 38 more cases of COVID-19 and a fourth death .
The Iowa Department of Public Health said the state now has 336 positive cases , up from 298 on Saturday .

Iowa Gov .
Kim Reynolds has ordered bars , dine-in restaurants , theaters , casinos and businesses that sell furniture , books and clothing to remain closed until at least April 7 to help limit the virus ' spread .
Schools have also been closed statewide .
" Our way of life and how we do business has changed dramatically here in Iowa and all across the country , " Reynolds said .
Reynolds said all the decisions she has made to impose restrictions on the state , including an order issued last week banning elective surgeries and abortions through April 16 , has been designed to conserve medical resources and slow the spread of the virus in the state .
" By ordering that order , that will free up a significant amount of ventilators -- or anesthesia machines that will be able to convert to ventilators -- and as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short demand , " Reynolds said .
" We want to make sure that we 're able to take care of Iowans if we get to the point where we have more and more Iowans that require that service .
"  Other governors have recently taken similar action .
The governor of Oklahoma halted abortions there until April 7 and similar moves were made by governors in Texas and Ohio last week .
" If we do what we need to do now , then hopefully we 'll get through this and we 'll get things back to normal sooner rather than later , " Reynolds said .
OMAHA , Neb .
( AP ) -- Four more Nebraska counties are now covered by an enforceable order limiting public gatherings to 10 people as the number of COVID-19 cases in the state topped 100 .
Pete Ricketts ' order was extended to Burt , Cuming , Madison and Stanton counties on Sunday after a community spread case where health officials ca n't trace the source of the infection was confirmed in Madison County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Butler , Hall , Hamilton , Merrick , Polk , Seward , and York counties effectively shutting down the dining rooms of restaurants and bars and closing churches , theaters , schools and gyms in those areas .
Funerals and weddings are also limited to no more than 10 people .
The area covered under the new orders includes more than 150,000 people .
Ricketts earlier this month issued the order for Douglas , Sarpy , Cass and Washington counties , then Lancaster , Dodge and Saunders counties .
Combined , all of those counties account for well over half of the state 's population .
State health officials said Sunday that Nebraska has at least 109 cases of COVID-19 , up from 99 on Saturday .
The first two deaths linked to the disease in the state were reported Friday in Douglas and Hall counties .
The Douglas County Health Department said Sunday that nine new cases of the virus were confirmed in the county , including two long-term care residents of the Douglas County Health Center .
The residents remain in isolation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve a man and a woman in their 20s , a woman in her 50s , two women and a man in their 60s , two women in their 70s , and a woman in her 80s .

For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .
SIOUX CITY -- Morningside College student Samuel Padilla loves spending time outside of his on-campus housing in the springtime .
However , this year , the normally-bustling college campus is nearly empty .
Due to COVID-19 concerns , all of Morningside 's classes have been moved online .
Most of the few remaining students on campus are international students like Padilla .
Born in Columbia and raised in Brazil , Padilla chose to stay in Sioux City while the vast majority of Morningside 's international students opted to study online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be just as safe in Sioux City than I would be in Brazil , " said Padilla , a junior majoring in computer science .
Sofia Marrufo , a senior biology major from Venezuela , thought the same thing .
In her case , she also was slated to graduate in May .
" I was hoping my mom , dad and family would see me graduate , " she said .
" That is n't going to happen any more .
"  Originally set for May 9 , Morningside 's commencement and graduation ceremonies have been moved back to Aug .
Across town , Kyle Chinen , a Briar Cliff University senior mass communications major , thought he was going to graduate on May 10 .
Instead , the ceremonies were postponed as a result of public health recommendations that no public gatherings of 10 or more people be held during the pandemic .
Like Padilla and Marrufo , Chinen is taking his classes online .
But unlike the other two , he is not an international student .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honolulu , Hawaii , " Chinen said .
" It 's far away , but it still the United States .
"  While Briar Cliff is still allowing students to live in dormitories , Morningside said they 'll be closing down their residential housing , with the exception of special circumstances , on April 8 .
This , too , will impact international college students , Marrufo said .
" We were coming off from an extended spring break when we heard the college would closing due to the threat of coronavirus , " she explained .
" International students literally had a day or so to decide if they were staying in America or going back home .
"  That was because if they waited too long , air travel to their home country might be canceled .
If they left America , students had no guarantee they 'd be able to return to Sioux City .
According to Marrufo , many international students had to leave without taking their belongings .
" Students did n't want to lose their window of opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody knows how to react to a pandemic , so everybody was understandably scared .
"  Plus , Morningside 's nearly 60 international students looked for answers from Marrufo , the president of the college 's international student association .
Similarly , Padilla had experience working with international students .
He , along with friends Alexandre Medeiros and Lucas Gomes , created STEVEN , an online mentoring program that helps international students adapt and thrive in the United States .
" College and universities do their best to keep essential services , like food and housing , available , " he explained .
" Once colleges start closing residential halls , international students have very few options .
"  That 's because international students are n't allowed to work off-campus .
Many support themselves with campus jobs , which disappear with school closures .
Otherwise , they subsist on money they get from home .
Another problem for international students is a sense of loneliness .
" Students are in a strange country , " Padilla said .
" Under normal circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those students now back in their native country , the few who remain feel even more alone .
"  Marrufo said this is something she can identify with .
" Initially , I was very sad with how my senior year was ending , " she said .
" Then , I realized I was luckier than others .
"  After all , Marrufo had already lined up a post-graduate job -- as a laboratory assistant for GELITA USA -- and still has high hopes that her family will get to see her receive her diploma in ceremonies taking place a few months later than expected .
" Nobody knows how to act in a pandemic because it is new for everyone , " she said .
" I did n't expect to being graduating from college under these circumstances but we do what we can .
"  SIOUX CITY -- The COVID-19 outbreak is complicating a custodial agreement between two Northwest Iowa parents .
Chris Mason said he is self-isolating at his Le Mars home as a precaution after one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-worker , who is awaiting test results , is a relative of one of the Woodbury County residents who have tested positive for COVID-19 since March 21 .
Mason said he and his wife , Amber , are raising his two daughters , 10 and 12 .
Chris Mason noted he is not feeling ill , and it 's uncertain if the girls have been exposed to COVID-19 .
But , as a precaution , he wants the girls to remain in the home , rather than attend a state-ordered visitation Sunday with their mother , Michelle Edwards of Sioux City .
Mason said the Iowa Department of Human Services , which is monitoring a reunification process with Edwards , told him last week the visitation would go ahead as scheduled .
Edwards said Friday that she wants to see her children , and does n't believe Mason has been exposed to the virus .
Matt Highland , a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Human Services , said privacy laws prevents him from discussing details of individual cases .
But Highland said DHS social workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time of trying to prevent the spread of the coronavirus , so they tell families to keep away from those who are sick and to practice social distancing .
Highland said custodial agreements are put in place by courts and continue , absent any compelling reason for judge to change them .
" We have no direction to end those visitations ( due to the possibility of coronavirus ) .
Court orders are still in place unless otherwise directed by the court , " Highland said .
Amber Mason argues the DHS should not make the two pre-teens move for the time being .
She said the family is taking precautions in their home to limit potential exposure to the virus .
" I prepare the food .
( Chris Mason ) stays upstairs .
They spend most of their time downstairs in their rooms , " she said .
The emergency legislation covers a range of issues , including pushing local elections back until at least June , allowing the secretary of health to put restrictions on group gatherings and creating a fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pandemic .
All the bills have an emergency clause that would put them into effect immediately , which means they need a two-thirds majority to pass .
They all have a sunset clause to expire later in the year .
Lawmakers will also consider action on bills the governor has vetoed .
Most lawmakers wo n't be in the Capitol building Monday .
They 'll be hundreds of miles away , speaking and voting via a video call system .
In the last week , legislative staff have scrambled to put together a teleconference system that will allow legislators to virtually signal when they want to speak and to cast their votes .
Here is what Noem is asking from lawmakers :  ELECTIONS  Legislators will consider a proposal to allow the secretary of state to move local elections , some which are scheduled in April , back to at least June .
The bill allows the elections to take place as late as July 28 .
GOVERNOR 'S EMERGENCY POWERS  Noem has said that her emergency powers in this situation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her emergency powers .
The bill she is pushing adds " pandemic " to the list of reasons she can declare an emergency .
It also allows her to suspend regulatory statutes during the emergency .
EDUCATION  As the governor has ordered schools to close their buildings until at least May , she is pushing two bills that will waive the requirement for schools to provide a certain number of hours of in-person teaching and to cancel state assessments this year .
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH  The governor is also pushing to allow the secretary of health to close restaurants , stores and other gathering places during a public health emergency .
She also wants lawmakers to add the coronavirus to the list of diseases for which the Department of Health can petition courts to enforce the closure of businesses .
LABOR  The Department of Labor and Regulation has seen a surge of unemployment filings .
Noem wants lawmakers to specify that people who lose their jobs because of the coronavirus are covered under the state 's unemployment laws .
DRIVER 'S LICENSES  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of driver 's licenses during the emergency .
BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS  Noem is pushing lawmakers to create a fund of about $11 million for loans to small businesses affected by the crisis .
Her staff also hopes federal dollars from a relief package could be filtered through that fund , which would be administered by the Governor 's Office of Economic Development .
COUNTIES  The governor 's strategy for the outbreak of COVID-19 has so far pushed the decision to close bars , restaurants , retail stores and other non-essential businesses to municipal governments .
But it is not clear in state law if counties have the authority to mandate businesses to close .
This bill makes it clear that they do .
KEARNEY , Neb .
( AP ) -- The last thing families and friends can do for loved ones is plan and attend funeral services .
Doing that in the usual way , with full churches or funeral home chapels , is impossible now because of concerns about spreading the coronavirus .
" We 're following the ' 10 limit ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families that they follow it , " Horner Lieske McBride &amp; Kuhl Funeral and Cremation Services co-owner Mark McBride said about Gov .
Pete Ricketts ' directive to limit gatherings to help stem the spread of COVID-19 .
Co-owner Spencer Kuhl told the Kearney Hub most people are aware of the limit , but not everyone knows it applies to funerals .
Especially families who had to change funeral plans already made when Ricketts set the limit .
The funeral directors said an option for those families and others for the foreseeable future is having a private family burial and a memorial service later .
" This is changing every day , or so it seems , " McBride said , " maybe more than once a day as to what you can and ca n't do .
"  Older people are among the high-risk groups for serious COVID-19 health issues .
They also are likely attendees at funerals , he noted .
" I tell people if you have any concern about going , do n't go , " McBride said .
" Call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  Kuhl said most churches have ceased Sunday services , but some still allow funerals attended by 10 or fewer immediate family members .
At O'Brien Straatmann Redinger Funeral Home , recent services have had family-only viewings and private services that followed the ' 10 limit ' rule .
Redinger said the funeral home has space to have groups of 10 in several rooms that are linked by closed-circuit TV .
" In the 18 years I 've been a funeral director , I never thought I 'd be counting people as they enter and moving people from one room to the other to be sure we 're following guidelines , he said .
Funerals can be livestreamed to larger off-site audiences or recorded and posted to a website , Redinger added .
Kuhl said livestreaming has become a more important service provided by HLMK in the past few weeks ; families always receive videos of their loved ones ' services .
When asked about delaying funerals in hopes that larger groups may attend , Kuhl and McBride said state law allows 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we like to have that concluded as soon as the family can get that done , " Kuhl said .
McBride understands why families may want one service now and another after the pandemic has passed .
" I feel for those families who may want to do that because of the stress of having two services , " he said .
In addition to the such two-service arrangements , he said funerals originally scheduled for last Saturday and next Saturday have been postponed with no new date set yet .
" I think the hardest part is not being able to pay tribute to the loved one in the way they envisioned , " Redinger said .
" That does n't mean they ca n't do that later , but they ca n't under the current ( limit of 10 ) guideline .
"  Kuhl said it can be most difficult if a loved one had a funeral directive .
He explained that being able to fulfill a directive can be comforting to the family , but " when they 're not able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Another change in HLMK 's routine came Thursday when a florist told them the business no longer will deliver funeral arrangements .
Kuhl said they will pick up the flowers or ask someone else to do so .
Kuhl said some state and national reminders , plus Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information specific to the coronavirus , have been added to the universal standards .
" So I do n't want to say it 's business as usual , " he added  McBride said funeral homes , like medical facilities , are concerned about shortages of masks and other protective equipment purchased in large quantities by the public .
" Even the shortage of cleaning supplies .
We 're facing the same challenges as everyone , " Kuhl said .
When asked about health safety measures followed when he 's called to a hospital , nursing home or other site where someone has died , Redinger said , " Most or all of the facilities are screening us before we go in to make a removal .
They 'll ask questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  If the location has confirmed or suspects that someone has COVID-19 , he would take extra precautions .
" We always wear PPE ( personal protective equipment ) , gloves , for sure .
In that case , we may wear a gown or face shield , " Redinger said .
" They train us to treat every body like it has a communicable disease because with HIPPA , we never really know .
"  Social distance is on McBride 's mind more now .
" I 've always been a handshaker , " he said .
" I still want to do that , but I find myself putting my hands in my pockets more now .
"  " It 's hard to turn that off , " Kuhl added .
" It 's hard to convey the personal part of the job we do when there is that distance , " McBride said , especially after learning so much about each family in such a short time .
It 's a fine line you 're gon na have to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trying to decrease contact , such as shaking hands .
" But if someone reaches out a hand , I 'll still take it , " he added .
A Stanford University study published in 2015 found that participants who went for a 90-minute walk through a park reported lower levels of rumination and showed reduced neural activity in an area of the brain linked to risk for mental illness .
The Journal picked seven Siouxland trails or trail systems where you can walk off your stress -- from easy to moderate .
" I would say all of our trails are very popular , " Sioux City Parks and Recreation Director Matt Salvatore said .
" The one at Bacon Creek gets a lot of usage .
Perry Creek Trail gets a lot of usage .

Another 1 1/2 miles will be added when the city finishes a section between Chautauqua Park and Chris Larson Park at the end of September .
" The Riverfront and Big Sioux trails are just very scenic , but very popular , " Salvatore said .
Floyd Trail  The Floyd Trail spans about 4 miles as it follows the bank of the Floyd River out to the Leeds neighborhood .
This flat trail is primarily used for biking , walking and jogging .
In July 2018 , a nearly half-mile connection with a pedestrian bridge that spans the Union Pacific tracks opened , providing a direct link between the Floyd River and Outer Drive trails .
Perry Creek Trail  The Perry Creek Trail runs from Second and Jackson streets to Stone Park Boulevard for about 3 1/4 miles .

I want to go out in that suit and feel like life is back to normal and I 'm not thinking about scary numbers , dwindling supplies or social distance .
I want to hug my friends .
I want to go someplace for no good reason .
I want to turn off my TV set and avoid anything designed to scare me .
I want my old life back .
Three weeks into this coronavirus pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed it would be .
Sure , work can be very stressful and the idea of having absolutely nothing to do can seem heavenly .
But when you 're limited in what you can do and where you can go , it 's not all that great .
I put together a puzzle for the first time in 30 years and found that oddly comforting .
It reminded me of the times I did them with my family .
Now , though , I do n't have anyone else to find the piece that fell on the floor , cheer the section that got completed or admire what nimble hands had done .
After taking a photograph of the puzzle , I pulled it apart and put it away .
I went through closets and sorted things -- as I promised I 'd do years ago -- and realized I really did n't need all this crap .
I also realized I was n't a very good steward of prescriptions .
I had pills from forgotten illnesses that were at least 10 years old .
I purged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipts .
I still have closets of clothes to go through but that seems so final .
I know there are styles ( and sizes ) I 'll never wear .
But there 's something comforting about having the past mingling with your sweatpants present .
In those closets are suits -- suits I 've worn to fancy occasions , suits I 've worn to church , suits I 've worn to meet important people -- and they remind me of the life I led before we became focused on viruses .
I like computers , cellphones and tablets .
They 're great devices to bring in other worlds .
But when they 're your only connection , they become oddly intrusive .
They 're like the old party line we had when neighbors could listen in on phone conversations .
Barriers .
So often we say , " If I only had the time I 'd .

I 've got the time .
But I do n't want to do that .

Go to a movie .
Drop off my dry cleaning .
Linger in the grocery store aisles .
