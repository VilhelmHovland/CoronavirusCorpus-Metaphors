" Working together with Governor John Bel Edwards and following the guidance of state public officials that we improve surge capacity for COVID-19 patients , we are rapidly modifying our St .
Mary Medical Center , located in the Highland neighborhood of Shreveport , La .
, to accommodate the inpatient pediatric , labor and delivery units currently at our Academic Medical Center on Kings Highway , " Daigle said .
" By creating a new location for these inpatient areas , we can increase our capacity at the Academic Medical Center to allow for an additional 100 patients requiring intensive care , which is critical to supporting COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms .
Construction for the project at St .
Mary Medical Center is scheduled to begin this week , and the initial phase is expected to be operational in less than two months .
" Currently , we are also transforming a number of existing rooms to intensive care capability to meet the state 's increase in patients needing intensive care due to the COVID-19 virus .
