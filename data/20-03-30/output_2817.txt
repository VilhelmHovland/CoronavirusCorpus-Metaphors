THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck  As the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic ripples across Canada , another wave may crest within the week as rent comes due for residential tenants .
April 1 is a pressing deadline for tenants and landlords alike as the novel coronavirus keeps people at home and closes businesses , leaving tens of thousands of Canadians out of work .
" It reminds me of a ' Mission : Impossible ' movie , where tick , tick , tick , the time is ticking down and someone has to try to save the day before everything explodes , " said William Blake , a landlord who spoke Tuesday on behalf of the Ontario Landlords Association .
" This is how a lot of tenants and landlords feel about this April 1 rent deadline coming up .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the federal and provincial governments to offer some kind of relief before April 1 .
Geordie Dent , the executive director of Toronto 's Federation of Metro Tenants Associations , spoke on behalf of a group of six tenant associations from across Canada that issued a joint statement on Wednesday asking for governments to ban evictions due to lack of payment and to offer financial assistance to renters .
" Tenants have basically had the legs cut out from under them , " said Dent , noting employment insurance applications are even higher than during the 2008 financial crisis .
British Columbia 's Premier John Horgan said Wednesday the province would suspend evictions and offering a $500 monthly rebate to help renters and landlords during the pandemic .
joined Manitoba , Nova Scotia , Ontario , Quebec , Prince Edward Island and the Northwest Territories in banning any evictions resulting from non-payment of rent .
But other provinces and territories have moved to teleconference hearings , with Saskatchewan 's Office of Residential Tenancies noting on its website that rents are still due .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past two weeks , calling on tenants to withhold their rent payments -- either out of necessity or in solidarity with those who ca n't make ends meet .
" We definitely agree that the government should be making a rent freeze and finding ways to support low-income people .
But for now , we 're focusing on just organizing amongst ourselves because we ca n't really wait , " said Paterson Hodgson , a spokesperson for a Toronto-based neighbourhood group calling on tenants to go on rent strike .
Dent recommends that any tenant worried about making their rent on April 1 should first check to see what steps their province or territory has taken in regards to tribunals .
" You do n't want to see people prioritizing their landlord 's mortgage payments over their ability to feed themselves and their families , " said Dent .
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that federal officials are looking at ways to get money to community housing providers and the nation 's renters .
Another government source , who was not authorized to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with at least six provinces to sign up for a new rent supplement to avoid evictions for hundreds of thousands of renters .
Blake , who owns small rental properties in Ontario , Alberta , British Columbia and Nova Scotia , said he sympathizes with his tenants and does n't want to have to evict any .
But he said banning evictions or going about business as usual are just delaying an inevitable wave of evictions as landlords will eventually need the money to pay taxes , mortgages and maintenance fees .
" What we 're pushing for , and we were hoping the tenant groups across Canada would be pushing for , is for the government to give tenants .
something like student loans , where you 're in trouble , you need a loan , you can get it to pay your rent , " said Blake , who pointed to the City of Toronto 's rent banks as a model example .
Landlords " do n't want government handouts .
We only want the legal system that we use to continue to be efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay rent , " he said .
