A message claiming to be from a friend 's uncle who works in a hospital in China has been circulating lately .
A MESSAGE WITH a number of claims about Covid-19 symptoms , the length of time the coronavirus lives on surfaces and ways to stave it off has been widely shared on WhatsApp recently .
However , most of the claims in this message are false and many are misleading .
The claims include that the virus is " killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees " ( false from the evidence so far ) and advises people to " try not to drink liquids with ice " because drinking warm water is " effective for all viruses " ( false ) .
The advice in the message claims to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree and worked in Shenzhen Hospital in China .
Here is the full message  Let 's break these claims down one by one .
If you have a runny nose and sputum , you have a common cold  Sputum is another word for phlegm .
Although a runny nose and phlegm are not the most common symptoms of Covid-19 , some patients do report having nasal congestion and a runny nose , according to the World Health Organization .
Symptoms of Covid-19 can be similar to cold and flu symptoms , the HSE has said .
Therefore , a runny nose and phlegm can not immediately equal a common cold .
The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever , cough shortness of breath and breathing difficulties .
Coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough with no runny nose  It is incorrect to say that pneumonia brought on by Covid-19 always involves a dry cough with no runny nose .
Dr Kim Roberts , leader of the virology research group in Trinity College Dublin , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the illness will develop into pneumonia .
Pneumonia is a term to describe the swelling of tissue in the lungs .
" Many people with a cough might have been diagnosed with the virus , but this might not develop into pneumonia , " Roberts said .
Pneumonia brought on by Covid-19 inflames the lung membrane and fills liquid into the lung air sacs needed for the intake of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide in our bodies .
People who have pneumonia are likely to have a cough , according to the HSE .
This can be a dry cough or patients might produce phlegm .
Other common pneumonia symptoms include breathing difficulties , rapid heartbeat and fever .
This new virus is not heat-resistant and will be killed by a temperature of just 26/27 degrees .
It hates the sun .
At the moment , scientists do not know how temperature changes influence the behaviour of SARS-Cov-2 , the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease .
From the evidence so far , the World Health Organization said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hot and humid weather conditions .
The WHO also said there is no reason to believe cold weather can kill this coronavirus .
If someone sneezes with it , it takes about 10 feet before it drops to the ground and is no longer airborne .
When people cough or sneeze , they spray droplets from their nose or mouth .
If somebody with Covid-19 coughs or sneezes without covering their nose and mouth , droplets containing the virus will travel .
If you are standing too close to an infected person when this happens , you could breathe in these droplets or they could land on you .
" When we cough and when we sneeze we create a whole range of different sized particles , " Dr Kim Roberts explained .
" We think that this virus is transmitted through the big particles and these land very quickly within about a metre of you , and that 's why standing two metres apart is thought to protect you from these droplets .
" We do n't think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang in the air for longer .
"  The droplets believed to hold the virus are too heavy to be airborne and they land on objects and surfaces surrounding the person , which is why the HSE also advises cleaning surfaces regularly .
The WHO recommends maintaining a distance of one metre ( three feet ) between yourself and anyone coughing or sneezing , but the HSE advises keeping a space of two metres ( 6 .
feet ) between yourself and others .
If it drops on a metal surface it will live for at least 12 hours -- so if you come into contact with any metal surface -- wash your hands as soon as you can with a bacterial soap .
Official advice from the WHO states that it is not certain how long the virus that causes Covid-19 can survive outside the body .
However , the same guidance does note that the new virus appears to behave like other coronaviruses that have been tested before .
It claimed that the virus will " first infect the throat " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four days .
The message continues to say the virus " blends into a nasal fluid " that enters the trachea and then the lungs , causing pneumonia .
This , it claims , takes about five or six further days beyond the first few days of a sore throat .
The message says a high fever and breathing difficulties come with the pneumonia .
Its final point is that the nasal congestion " is not like the normal kind " and instead feels like drowning .
This is incorrect .
Symptoms differ on a case by case basis .
It can take up to 14 days for any symptoms of the disease to appear and they can be similar to cold and flu symptoms .
Only some patients experience nasal congestion as a Covid-19 symptom .
According to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) data from China , an estimated 80% of all cases had mild to moderate disease ( including non-pneumonia and pneumonia cases ) , 13 .
had severe disease and 6 .
were critical .
Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees Celsius or above  A cough -- any cough , not just dry  Shortness of breath or breathing difficulties  People who have any of these symptoms are asked by the HSE to behave as if they have the virus and self-isolate for 14 days .
People who fall under the current testing criteria in Ireland will be tested .
****  There is a lot of false news and scaremongering being spread in Ireland at the moment about coronavirus .
Here are some practical ways for you to assess whether the messages that you 're seeing -- especially on WhatsApp -- are true or not .
STOP , THINK AND CHECK  Look at where it 's coming from .
Is it someone you know ? Do they have a source for the information ( e .
the HSE website ) or are they just saying that the information comes from someone they know ? A lot of the false news being spread right now is from people claiming that messages are from ' a friend ' of theirs .
Have a look yourself -- do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being reported elsewhere .
Secondly , get the whole story , not just a headline .
A lot of these messages have got vague information ( " all the doctors at this hospital are panicking " ) and do n't mention specific details .
This is often -- but not always a sign -- that it may not be accurate .
Finally , see how you feel after reading it .
A lot of these false messages are designed to make people feel panicked .
They 're deliberately manipulating your feelings to make you more likely to share it .
If you feel panicked after reading something , check it out and see if it really is true .
