" Even if you 're travelling alone , there are always risks .
" Please help us by following the government 's advice to stay home and stay safe , so we can all throw a line in when life returns to normal .
" The reaction was mixed on Facebook , including support , opposition and resignation .

" Shooters , Fishers and Farmers Tasmania spokesperson Rebecca Byfield was supportive of Hydro 's move , but concerned about the Tasmanians whose diets relied significantly on catching fish .
She said that would be more of an issue with many Tasmanians having lost their jobs because of the virus response .
Ms Byfield was not surprised by Hydro 's move and saw it as consistent with decisions by the state government and agencies shutting access to areas because of the virus .
She said she understood people 's concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government is doing and we all need to do our part .
