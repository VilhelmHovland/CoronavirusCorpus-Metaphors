Hong Kong 's ' dirty teams ' : medical workers at the front line of the war against the coronavirus share their stories and fears  David ( not his real name ) is a doctor who works in a Kowloon hospital in Hong Kong , but his colleagues avoid him , and he only goes home once every two weeks to see his wife , spending other nights alone in a hotel room or at his office , which has a foldable mattress , clean clothing and food .
He belongs on a " dirty team " -- medical workers at the front line of the war against the coronavirus .
While such units have no official title , the term is widely used among peers in the sector .
The name captures the grit and grind of a group of health care staff who are the first to receive highly suspected cases and who deal most with infections , but it is also a label that unintentionally represents their isolation and loneliness .

" Some colleagues will avoid us .
even though from the Hospital Authority 's perspective , we are very clean as we are in full protective gear , " David , who has been attending to patients since mid-February , said .
His work is physically demanding .
To scrimp on limited stocks of protective gear , he usually stays in his suit and mask for hours on end while in the isolation ward .
There were some days when there were inadequate amounts of eye shields , or perhaps just a few pieces of protective gowns  David ( not his real name ) , doctor  " If you do n't take off the mask , a new one will not be used .
But it is rather hard to wear an N95 respirator for four hours consecutively , " he said .
Tasks to be carried out in each ward visit require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of protective gear .
It is a delicate balancing act .
David and his colleagues ' frustrations stem from the insufficient stock of protective equipment , something he claimed management painted a different picture on .
" There were some days when there were inadequate amounts of eye shields , or perhaps just a few pieces of protective gowns , " he said .
For Tracy ( not her real name ) , a nurse who worked in the Hospital Authority 's Infectious Disease Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital , the fear of the rising number of cases leading to a worst-case scenario for Hong Kong regularly gnaws at her mind .
" I 'm really worried that there would be a massive outbreak , " she said .
" With this rate of increase and taking in that many cases daily , one day health care workers could get infected .
"  Last week , a doctor issuing quarantine orders for arrivals at the airport became one of the first medical workers in the city to get infected .
But so far there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The workload in Tracy 's ward , which handles patients highly suspected to be virus carriers , has gotten heavier since mid-March .
" After we transfer a patient who has been cleared of infection to a general ward , we have to rush to attend to another incoming case .
"  She said she worried that eventually infected patients would have to be placed together from lack of space , delaying their recovery from the dreaded disease , or resulting in complications .
As medical workers , under such a situation , procedures such as intubation -- inserting tubes into a patient 's body , especially through the mouth -- would present a high infection risk for them , according to Tracy .
My mother has been asking me to go to her home for dinner , but I dare not  Tracy ( not her real name ) , nurse  She volunteered for her four-week duty on the dirty team in early March , hoping to learn more about handling people with infectious diseases .
Her personal fears were soothed when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the protective gear she would receive .
" There are enough protective gear and we do n't need to reuse masks .
"  But this has not prevented her from taking extra precaution to protect her family from the dangers she could bring home .
Before the pandemic , Tracy would visit her mother , who lives separately , once or twice a week .
But she has stopped doing so since the start of her dirty team duty .
" My mother has been asking me to go to her home for dinner , but I dare not , " she said .
Meanwhile , at Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital , nurse Cindy ( not her real name ) , started her dirty team duties with unease after drawing lots with colleagues in January .
" The disease was new and you did not know how infectious it was , " she said .
When she first began and before she actually received confirmed cases , she would anxiously check with colleagues if patients she had collected samples from had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cindy recalled her time as " lonely and miserable " , as she was not able to see her parents and friends .
To reduce infection risks to others , she stayed in the hospital dormitory and only hung out with colleagues who were also on the same team .
Her birthday was spent quietly with her boyfriend , unlike her usual way of celebrating with a big group of friends .
While away from her parents , their safety was constantly on her mind .
" The public may think hospitals are dangerous , but from our understanding , the wider community is even more dangerous , " she said .
" People usually are not vigilant enough with what they come into contact with .
"  As cases in Hong Kong grow in number , Cindy echoes the concerns of her colleagues in other hospitals .
" More wards and more nurses would be needed .
It is easy to become infected if you do n't observe all the preventive steps .
