from NBC .
Five News This is Breaking news .
Good afternoon , everyone .
We 're breaking into programming to bring you the latest from New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu about to give an update about the response to Cove in 19 .
Let 's take a listen , uh , managing through the different aspects of what we 've put into place over the past couple weeks , but also looking at innovative ideas and bringing some solutions to the real front of the table force .
So again , as we 're making these decisions as removing forward , we 're being responsive to what those individual needs are really at the grassroots level .
We want to thank them .
I was on the phone call this morning with all the different mayors .
I was on a call this morning with a lot of different House members all just giving feedback over the past few days in terms of what they 're seeing on the ground .
Maybe some of the the issues that we have to still address these are unprecedented and times that were going through again .
We just want to make sure we 're being responsive to those individuals .
But today 's we want announce three pretty significant efforts on a variety of different areas the first being want folks to know that today I 'll be informing the federal government and the Department of Education specifically that standardized tests will not take place in New Hampshire this semester .
And while remote learning has gotten off to a incredible start , we have to continue to have flexibility in our approach to education and owner standardized test from Washington , I think definitely send the wrong message to New Hampshire .
Families were are already working incredibly hard to adapt to this new learning environment .
The New Hampshire Department of Education will continue to work with the College Board to create access for students wanting to take the S A .
T s this summer or in the early fall .
And New Hampshire Department of Education will also work with all New Hampshire schools to develop options to help gauge student performance and will continue to work with teachers , schools and families to have access to the assessment materials from remote instruction for all of our students .
Secondly , in conjunction with the Federal Cares Act that was recently passed , we are increasing benefits for those on unemployment .
Granite Staters , currently drawing from the state 's unemployment insurance program , will in most instances be shifted to the federally funded Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program and for those on the pandemic unemployment assistance .
We 're increasing the weekly minimum benefit from $32 a week to $168 a week , and then starting next week , we 're adding an additional $600 per week per individual to their weekly benefits , all 100% federally funded .
We 're extending the length of time a person can receive benefits by 13 weeks for up to 39 weeks , which again will be federally funded here in New Hampshire .
It 's important to note that those who are already drawing from unemployment insurance will not need to take any new or additional steps .
You should just continue to file as you have been through the state channels .
This opportunity is really building on the fact that New Hampshire was able to be one of the first states in the country toe offer Theo expanded unemployment insurance benefits on the fact that the federal government has coming in come in behind us .
Enhancing those benefits as well will create an incredible opportunity for those individuals and families around the steak on those same notes .
I just want to always extend a big thanks to , um , Employment Security Commissioner George Keypad is Assistant Commissioner Richard Labors .
They have really been working around the clock the fact that the federal bill just passed a few days ago on The Cares Act and that they 've been working to help ensure that these benefits can be access to immediately a cz early as today , just a real testament to them on their team , working with the U .
Department of Labor On all the folks on the ground here in New Hampshire .
I also want to just one final point .
That also kind of goes to the fact that we started this program so early .
You know , New Hampshire had the highest increase in unemployment benefits between the time of March 14th to March 21st anywhere in the country .
But again , it was really because we had opened up our unemployment benefits more aggressively than any anywhere else in the country on the fact that the federal government has come in to just support but enhance those benefits will provide a lot of opportunity for individuals across New Hampshire .
Third , we will be announcing later today that the state will be extending the business tax payment deadline to June 15th for approximately 98% of New Hampshire small businesses , As many continue to adapt to these unfortunate new realities of the Cove in 19 crisis , the state will also be extending interest in dividends tax payment deadlines to June 15th for again approximately 98% of the interest and dividends taxpayers , as was discussed last week .
Congress , as we know , passed and the president signed The Cares Act .
But as a result of this bipartisan legislation , we have gone through the bill and we have confirmed New Hampshire New Hampshire will be receiving at least $1 .
billion in covert 19 relief .
It 's an unprecedented amount of relief for the state of New Hampshire , but given the unprecedented times on the severe needs from families , education , businesses , individuals , there is going to be need all the way around .
So while this is ah , large amount of money is being allocated and dedicated to a variety of different programs throughout the state .
Um , among the highlights , the federal legislation creates the paycheck protection program where small businesses can get 100% forgivable loans to cover the salaries and benefits of their employees mortgage interest , rent and utilities for up to eight weeks again , a real incredible opportunity for a lot of the small businesses out there .
There 's also support for the child care and development block grant financial support , where funds can go towards our day care initiative that we announced just last week .
So ah , lot of the subsidies and supplements that we provided in our child care and day care initiatives again are going to now be backed by the federal government , which is very exciting .
They 'll be additional support to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service 's administration for mental health and substance use disorders through certified community behavioral clinics , in addition to the $50 million health care relief fund that we set up very early on in this process , the federal legislation will provide additional grants , toe hospitals and on profits and other institutional providers to help cover the unreimbursed healthcare costs of this cove in 19 crisis .
We started a plan on how to best operationalize all of these different opportunities and will continue to dig into the details so that we truly can better understand what the state allocation will be what restrictions the federal government may have placed on him .
And again , just how best to use thes funds for the citizens of New Hampshire .
We will , as always , continue to update the public as we explore more opportunities .
Ah , and knowing that working with our congressional delegation this is the third supplemental enhancement dealing with the Koven 19 crisis , there will likely be 1/4 probably in a month or so .
It is what the hope is , and so any of the coals of the gaps in the system that are n't being covered by the current funds .
We always will have another shot to go back and work with our partners in a bipartisan way within the federal government to help again provide some of these federal funding opportunities to fill those gaps and respond to the citizens of New Hampshire .
Ah , and lastly today I want we want folks to know that we are requesting today are major disaster declaration for New Hampshire from the federal government , and in doing so , it will allow a variety of opportunities .
But one in particular are our National Guard to be fully reimbursed by the federal government should we enact title 32 status to mobilize our state National Guardsmen and women to help respond to the cove in 19 crisis in a lot of the different staffing realms that they potentially could be could be called up for .
I 'm now going to turn it over to Dr Benjamin Chan , who will come up and give us Ah ! Update from the Department of Public Health .
Doctor .
Great .
Thank you very much , Governor .
And good afternoon .
Let me first start by providing some updates on the numbers in terms of what we 're seeing in New Hampshire for testing .
Ah , and diagnoses of Cove in 19 .
So to date , over the last several weeks , there have been more than 5700 people in New Hampshire tested for covert 19 and currently we have 314 people who have been diagnosed confirmed with covert 19 .
That 's an increase of about 56 individuals from yesterday .
So over the weekend Saturday and Sunday combined , we have had about 100 individuals diagnosed with with covert 19 .
The more the majority of these individuals are people with more mild infection who are at home and self isolating at home .
About 45 of these individuals were about close to 15% have required some hospitalisation during the course of their illness , and unfortunately , three individuals have passed away as a result , either directly or indirectly as a result of their infection .
All three of these individuals were people that were older than 60 years of age and had multiple underlying chronic medical conditions , which is exactly the age group that is most at risk for severe complications from Cove in 19 .
And so our sympathy and our thoughts are with the families that have been dealing with this situation in these difficult times .
And I want to also remind everybody that this is exactly the population of residents in our state who we want to protect , especially from from covert 19 .
And so I think we all have a role in playing To do that as covert 19 spreads both globally as well as within the United States , we can expect to see an increasing number of cases in New Hampshire .
You may have heard , it said , and I will repeat here that , uh , the United States is in the acceleration phase of the pandemic for cocoa Vin 19 .
And so we 're going to hear about increasing numbers of cases in the United States as a whole .
Over the coming several weeks , we will continue to see increasing numbers of cases with in New Hampshire .
Um , and this is something that we 're obviously actively monitoring .
But we 're not just sitting back and watching .
The numbers were actively out investigating people diagnosed with covert 19 to identify a potential susceptible contacts who we reach out to and recommend either go on quarantine if they are without symptoms , meaning stay at home even with a lack of symptoms or , if they are symptomatic , have recommendations for staying at home , potentially testing for those that are at higher risk of potentially transmitting Copan 19 Within our within our communities , we 've gotten a lot of questions over the last several weeks about where this virus is .
Is it spreading their in their individual communities ? We 're seeing an increasing number of people being diagnosed that have no specific risk factors identified , meaning they may not be identified .
Contacts of other people with Cove in 19 may not have travelled , and so we believe there are increasing numbers of people with community based transmission of covert 19 .
And so I think one of the key messages now is that this virus is out in our communities .
It is circulating , and so everybody needs to take steps and precautions against not only getting infected themselves but also spreading infection to other people within our community .
Certainly those who are who are most vulnerable , I wantto make quick mention that , um , there is , as I 've mentioned before , there 's increasing evidence that people can spread this virus before they may have symptoms what we call pre symptomatic transmission .
There have been a couple of studies that have come out in the last couple of weeks looking at different populations like the Diamond Princess cruise ship in certain long term care facility populations , for example , in Washington State .
And what some of these newer studies have shown us is that of the people that have tested positive in these organizations .
Ah , large percentage of people potentially up to half or more have potentially shown virus tested positive for this virus in the days before they showed symptoms .
And I say this to highlight a point that it 's not just people that are symptomatic in our communities that need to take steps to stay home to prevent transmission within our communities .
This is the reason for the recommendations around social distancing in general .
And so everybody in our communities need to take steps to prevent exposing and passing on this virus to other people within our communities s o .
If people do n't need to go out urgently , please stay at home .
If people are out , for example , at a grocery store or needing to go into the hospital , for example , social distancing recommends maintaining at least six feet of distance between oneself and another person .
So we ask that everybody in our communities whether they 're , um even if they 're not having any symptoms and otherwise feeling well two , please abide by these recommendations for staying home if if going out is not necessary and for maintaining at least six feet of distance between between people .
When I went out in the community , for example , at a grocery store that includes waiting in lines or or other even walking outside , you know , please try and maintain social distance between between other people .
I want to also particularly mention that those who are 60 years of age and older people with chronic medical conditions , as I 've already mentioned , are at increased risk for complications of covert 19 and potentially requiring hospitalization , potentially even dying from this infection .
And so those individuals , especially we recommend , try and more strictly stay at home .
Those individuals need tohave Ah , 30 day supply of needed medications at their homes , maintain a supply of food and groceries .
And I think all of us in our communities need to try and protect those more vulnerable groups by unfortunately avoiding close contact with people that that may be more susceptible to serious infection that could that could cause a loved one to end up end up in the hospital .
So we are continuing to monitor and track the situation .
There have been requests for Maur information potentially at the community level .
We 're going to be releasing more information on our website and the next day or so , including maps .
Looking at the number of cases at the town level , we have heard the request on the need for more information not only from the public but from local health care and public health partners .
So we will be releasing more information on this in the next day or so , But I want to stress again that even if you live in a town where a map may not show , that Cove in 19 has been found to be circulating that you know , we would encourage people to operate under the assumption that Cove in 19 is circulating in your communities , even if there has not been somebody officially diagnosed and to take the appropriate precautions to maintain social distancing , to stay at home if it 's not necessary to go out in order to not only protect your own family and friends , but people that may be more vulnerable in your communities , including older parents , grand parents , neighbors that may be of an older age or certainly people living in long term care or assisted living facilities .
So thank you very much .
Well , thank you , Dr Chan .
Um , with that , I guess we can open it right up for questions .
If looks like do I think the Granite State needs to do better instead ? Look .
No , I Well , look , we can always do better , right ? But I got ta say , I think the grand state is on a very , very good job .
So I guess that 's my pre eminent statement .
We saw a lot of folks out and about this weekend , they 're out exercising .
They were out getting their groceries .
They 're doing things that they need to do or that are allowed to do under the state home order .
Um , and then they were headed home .
We saw a lot of folks in the parking lots at Mount Major and others where they were hiking , but at the same time , if you looked at that crowd control , that was really happening on the out while people were hiking or at the top of the mountain we have .
We had staff up there looking and very few instances where people really not managing the social distancing .
I think people are taking this incredibly seriously .
I 've been at the supermarket myself , and people will literally walk on one side of the aisle on the other side of the aisle , that trying to keep his much space between themselves , Um , so and they 're realizing they can do that without really hindering their ability to go grocery shopping , actually do things that they need to in their everyday life or at work .
Of course .
So , no , I think the Grand Staters has done I have done a great job , but we 're in this for the long haul .
We need stamina .
We need discipline .
We need to do this , not this week , but next week and next month , and probably the month after that .
And so building these these practices now and seeing how they work in in the in the real world , so to say , has given us a lot of useful information .
I think ill individuals , a lot of better information and how we see each other act right .
Also , I think helps us say , Well , boy , they 're doing that .
I got to do it too .
You know , there 's almost like a , ah , social rising , if you will , of this idea of not just social distancing .
I think we 're kind of devolving that term for more physical distancing , right ? We want people to socialize using technology .
We want people to socialize with Anneli , parent or relative that might be in a nursing home that right now ca n't have visitors .
We want that community connection and use technology to do that while maintaining this physical distances .
So I guess that 's a very long way of saying I think we 're doing a great job but we need the discipline in the stamina .
We can all always probably find individual moments where we can do better .
I found myself in the office today .
I rarely come closer than six feet with almost anybody .
Nowadays .
I 'm incredibly careful myself on .
I found my staff , you know , even making sure the limited staff we have to the State House .
Everyone 's kind of staying in their area , you know , waiting to focus or you .
Only one person goes through a doorway at once on the one person might use an elevator at once .
They 're taking it very seriously , so they need to be commended for that .
What about you ? As people long ago ? Yes .
What was your thing ? There are other particularly concerned people with second homes , people coming cities ? Well , sure .
So the question really revolves around the thinking behind the social distancing request and , more importantly , the quarantine request of out of staters .
The thinking is , just , frankly , common sense .
The fact is that most states have a much higher prevalence of covert than we do right now .
Ah , lot of folks are coming specifically out of Massachusetts or maybe even the New York region where the prevalence is incredibly high .
If you 're coming here for an extended stay , you need to really be self quarantining for 14 days and practicing those same social responsibilities that you had in your states .
Here we take those very seriously just cause we 're New Hampshire , we do n't have this Khyber right now that surge is coming .
As Dr Champ pointed out , we 're in an accelerated phase .
Our numbers are going to continue to accelerate .
Everyone has that responsibility of taking it very seriously .
If you 're coming from out of state , we 're asking you , you need to self quarantine .
Yeah , sure , Yeah .
We 've heard the concern all up and down the state to be sure .
I think the concern is a couple fold .
The concern is Well , we 're been very , very aggressive and successful in our state building .
Our surge centers right in terms of the excess bed capacity .
I think there 's a concern that if other states around us , I do n't have that same capacity .
If they 're surge comes faster and harder than ours here .
You could potentially have folks from Massachusetts coming over to use our healthcare facilities right on dso again .
We want to make sure that regionally , all of our state partners are also in that same boat building that surge capacity .
So one state is n't over handling the potential health care surge of another .
There 's folks up in the North Country that again , that 's where a lot of these secondary homes for folks out of Massachusetts might might be .
And so there 's just a natural concern there from local officials .
As I said it last week , we 're not shutting the borders down .
I do n't have the power to do that .
I know Governor has the power to do that , but we just have to maintain vigilance and a good , strong community message that if you are from out of state , you do need to self quarantine for two weeks .
We want to be able to react at a moment 's notice to know that we can do so with the federal funding behind us .
So at some point will get well .
Will we get there ? At some point , it could .
For example , Massachusetts called up some of their National Guard for the primary purpose of filling in the gaps with first responders , firemen , firefighters , those that might be quarantined because they may have come in contact with somebody we find we 're finding a lot of folks on the front lines are being quarantined , and then those frontlines staffs are getting depleted .
So that was one reason that he did it .
States I talked to governors all over the country .
They 're doing it for a variety of different reasons , So we do n't know exactly why we may need to do it .
My senses .
At some point , we will .
We just wan na have the readiness and know that the federal federal government 's gon na be behind us when we do .
Sure .
Thank you .
Uh , yeah , that 's a great question .
We pulled my notes here is to make sure that , um , I have accurate numbers here .
So correct .
314 people diagnosed in New Hampshire with Cove in 19 .
And as of today , we 're aware of at least 46 of those that have who have been diagnosed and recovered again .
The majority of these individuals that have been diagnosed with covert 19 have not required hospitalization .
So we 're we 're communicating with individuals about how long they need to stay home for , and it 's going to be at least seven days from when they developed symptoms , possibly longer , depending on how the symptom progression continues , but the majority of these individuals will be coming off .
Additional people will be coming off home isolation in the coming days so we can expect more people to have recovered four our new cases or testing .
Yeah , it 's always hard to know the reason for their not being diagnosed cases in a particular area .
And as I mentioned earlier , I think we all need to operate under the assumption that Cove in 19 is is potentially circulating in our communities .
That includes towns in southern part of the state that might not have had anybody diagnosed with Kofi 19 .
It also includes the northern part of our savings in Coop 's County .
Some of the reason for their not being diagnoses could be , you know , more mild illness that 's not being tested and clinically die over and laboratory diagnosed .
But I think that given the way we 've seen this virus spread and how easily it spreads between people that , uh , you know , the assumption here is that it 's circulating and most of our communities around the state Yeah , them Not really .
It 's just Max results , right ? Idea Why ? Well , I think partly what you 're seeing in terms of the numbers again that the majority of cases that have been diagnosed are in Rockingham , followed by Hillsborough County .
Ah , and those were those of the areas of this state that have the higher population density centers .
Um , obviously , as you mentioned , those areas of the state are closer to through ways for people potentially travelling up from Massachusetts .
But there 's also , I know , probably a large percentage of the population that live in New Hampshire that might travel down to Massachusetts toe work .
So we 've certainly seen instances of , you know , cross border transmission where people are coming up from another state .
But also people excuse me , that live in New Hampshire that go down toe work or interact with family in different areas .
And so that 's certainly a risk factor .
And I think it likely reflects the numbers that you 're talking about , where the greater number of cases are in Rockingham , in Hillsborough County 's light levels , even if those even if no 90% of stay in their cars , is that a problem ? So So I guess I want to stress that , um , you know , this is a virus that we know is circulating in our communities .
So So it 's it 's spreading between people in New Hampshire .
Travel continues to be a risk .
And , as I 'm sure many are aware , over the weekend , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released some travel advisory guidance around people from certain states avoiding non essential travel because of the risk for carrying it from one part of the United States from one state to another state .
And so that 's That 's certainly a risk factor .
But I want to stress again that anybody who may be coming into our state from these higher areas of incidents need to self quarantine for 14 days .
That has been that that is advice consistent with what the governor mentioned but also advice put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
And as a general rule , people need thio even if they 're outside .
Hiking on a trail , need to maintain a distance of at least six feet between people to try and limit transmission of this virus .
Given how easily can spread person to person reports essential .
Why , no , not not so much of folks defying the order .
I think we 've had a lot of non essential businesses use our website to request some sort of exemption .
We had a lot of people that want a golf on .
We can appreciate that .
And I guess that 's something that we can look at down the road .
Um , you know , one of the benefits of something of an organization like that .
Is it still April ? We 're showing the shoulder season for , ah .
Lot of businesses that can that were n't expecting a whole lot of business .
Anyways , I think the fear is that , um you know where we 're gon na be in May or come Memorial Day in June and July , and obviously we 're not quite sure .
I think we all know that the surge is still coming .
Is it two weeks away , three weeks away , four weeks away ? Not sure , but again , our job is just to be as prepared as we can .
You then mix in .
Not just on the business side , but , you know , we talk about testing and the fact that you know , when we were first started this three or four weeks ago , we were doing 101 150 maybe even 200 tests a day .
Now we 're ramping up to close to 4 500 test today and hopefully a Some of the other additional labs and other testing capabilities come online for other hospitals and facilities in New Hampshire .
That 'll keep ramping up on escalating as well .
And all those our good tools and data that we can use to help again suppress that viral spread .
That 's what this is all about .
So , um , we did n't hear so much of folks defying the order .
But I One thing I can tell you is that we had a lot of businesses .
Colin say , Well , can we Can retailers do curbside pickup right if they 're not interacting with customers , if we 're just doing curbside pickup , no cash transactions , no transactions at the window you call ahead or you go online and buy the product and you show up in .
And yes , I want to encourage that .
And we are providing those exemptions , if you will , because that 's we want incentivize people to challenge themselves , to change their model right to meet the needs of public safety and meet the needs of the physical distancing .
So if anything , we 've heard good stories .
I think of people trying to change the model , understanding their social responsibility in this but we 'll deal with issues on a case by case basis .
No problem .
Yeah , so yep .
So those requests will be made to the Department of Business and Economic Affairs .
They have a small group there , along with myself that , you know , if they 're things that rise to the level where instances or business dynamics that we did n't anticipate , that might have more flexibility than we thought that might allow for the physical distancing more than we thought or just the opposite .
Maybe we have .
There are essential businesses that were realizing they 're still creating a a social dynamic that is n't acceptable , a physical proximity that is n't really acceptable in the model .
We could go harsher as well , again all uncharted territory for a lot of us .
And we 're sharing our ideas and what we 're seeing with other states and seeing you know what what they 're doing about certain certain instances .
One thing I 'll bring up with the beaches or a golf course or something like that .
One of the challenging parts of that is if the states around us are n't opening their beaches in their golf course , that means that when we open , if we were to even find a unique model .
All these folks from Massachusetts and Maine and Vermont again a Russian did n't Hampshire to use those types of facilities , which again is counter productive .
Encounter active to what we 're really encouraging people do , which is stay in your own homes , whether in New Hampshire and Massachusetts , stay in your own homes .
We want folks to stay in their state and stay in their homes as much as possible .
So we do n't want to .
Even if we have a creative model , we have to be cognizant of what ? Our partners around New England or doing so .
We do n't have a run on the system from outsiders .
Dr Chan with people .
Oh , sure .
No , no .
Look , one thing that we 're should be everyone in state should be very proud of is this has been a team effort all along .
So I meet with Where 's Perry ? Plumber , Lordship ? Annette .
Dr Chan .
Ah , General Conway .
We have our senior team that really comes in and provides a lot of the kind of final checkoff on a lot of the decisions that were making .
And also , when we get some constituent issues that come up , whether they 're from a business , an organization at a larger level in the individual level , those air all flowing through a single chain of command as well .
So the communication has been very , very good at the state level and will continue to do that to make sure we 're making We 're all in the same boat on the picture .
We have n't looked at Ah , the only I made a unilateral decision and not you .
I should say , you know , little and talking to them .
We just made that decision on Friday .
I believe we made two decisions .
One with real estate , the real estate association and brokers how they can continue to do transactions .
And we looked at the language and stipulations that were given it in other states to do that and provide them some flexibility against similar to our neighbors .
Ah , the other one being the curbside , that made perfect sense .
I was talking to Senator Soucy about that , about some of the businesses and some of her district 's that were calling and asking if they could have that flexibility and knowing that , you know , there was gon na be the weekend was coming up .
We want to again .
Before they just shuddered and got rid of a lot of their employees want to provide that flexibility .
But going forward , we 'll take him on a case by case basis .
That 's one of the benefits we have in New Hampshire .
Ah , that we can really focus on the individual of the individual businesses in their needs .
No , they were going to escape .
Would , like provide .
Hello .
Right .
Yeah .
Um , right now , we 're not in the position to provide that kind of relief .
One thing we are looking to say , Look , you do n't have to pay your property taxes or we 're gon na cut them in half or anything .
That 's really a local decision .
But one thing we can do is possibly create a pathway so folks do n't get the interest and the penalties and things of that nature again .
So we 're not penalizing folks that can not pay Early on , we 're allowing them to defer maybe a couple of months at the local level .
We do n't want to create a new opposite situation where you take everything away and you 're just incentivizing .
Folks just not pay , even though they could .
So it 's about really striking that right balance with community .
So folks are paying when they can , but allowing some flexibility for those who are who are a bit in some economically challenged times right now .
Just the waiver on testing the request of the waiver with that sustained baby .
Good .
Right now .
No , I 'd say that we 're waving standardized testing for this school year .
The testing that we refer to that might come back in the summer .
The fall would be like the college boards and the S A T s .
But no , I think we 're going straight straight .
Wave the testing for this year because come the fall , the kids will be in the next grade and moving on to thio that academic curriculum for those tests .
Oh , next message .
Stay at home .
Get out there .
Absolutely .
No , look , it 's very tough to balance .
I mean , the question really about Is there a mixed message that well , we do n't think there 's a mixed message , but there is a balance in the message , right ? There 's a balance of social responsibility that where we say , Look , you can go out , you know , if you want the exercise and you need to go get groceries or whatever it is , but if you do n't need to be doing once one of those three or four stipulations that we 've outlined , You got to be at home .
That 's the order .
You really do need to be at home .
But we want people to again not just , you know , be outside frivolously because that is n't in their best interest of their health .
There 's there 's just no question about that and the best interest of the health of the community .
So , um , it 's not a mixed message As much as it is kind of a balancing act of saying , Look , this is where we 're coming down in terms of the government , that 's a very tough call to make as a government and the lift free or die state as you can imagine and we do n't take any of it lightly at all .
But it 's also part of the benefit of this is elevating that message .
We want folks to understand how serious it is that we 're taking this and that they have to take this in their individualized with their workplace , with their communities and their families .
That 's really one of the underlying points here .
And talking to the hospital system , that was one of the points they made very loud and clear that we want this message to be elevated , understand it ? It is , unfortunately , probably here for the long term , long term , being weeks , two months , and then we 'll see .
Someone asked me today what are the metrics to undoing a lot of this ? What are the metrics To provide a more flexibility .
I wish I had a good answer for that .
But we 're not there yet in that we 've never seen the models on the back end .
We 've never seen any community in this country .
Come on .
The downside of this in terms of how how they come out and provide more flexibility , I can tell you this .
I think the challenge is gon na be greater in providing flexibility than it was in providing the restrictions .
Because what you do n't want is truly that mixed message where we 're saying we can provide more flexibility .
But still , we want people to take the social responding personal responsibilities very seriously .
As we see numbers go down as we can provide a little more flexibility .
But we do n't want to do it so fast that we see another surge on the back end .
And that is gon na be I think one of the more challenging decisions that we 're gon na have to make .
And we 're already starting planning for that .
Do n't know exactly what the metrics will be .
We 'll have to look at some other communities , but and see where our data is .
But I can tell you that 's one of the ones that really weighs on our mind that it 's gon na be That 's gon na be a bit of a balancing act for for all of us , I think .
Yes , sir .
Trying what ? From the medical examiner 's office , I assume , right ? Yeah , sure .
Right .
All right .
So first , I 'm gon na ask Dr Chan to come up to talk to specifically how we how we determine the number three .
So ? So maybe if I can ask for a little bit clarification of your question .
Are you Are you asking about a backlog of people who died at the medical Examiner 's or you 're talking about at the funeral home ? Because not everybody .
I mean , people , unfortunately , are passing away in the state and other states all the time .
Yeah , s o I 'm not aware of a large number of people that have died that have that are awaiting testing without said we may not be the first people to know if someone has passed away and is being tested for Cove in 19 .
Um , but as I 've , um , um , as I 've mentioned before , that we can expect to see an increasing number of cases , uh , of Kobe 19 in this state in the coming days and weeks , certainly an increasing number of people who are hospitalized .
And that includes , unfortunately , an increasing number of people that also die or passed away from from Cove in 19 .
Sometimes there can be a lag time between when somebody passes away and when a test result can come back .
But as testing capacity increases , hopefully that there should be a shorter and shorter lag time between that between that waiting period , that may not directly answer your question , but , um , I think part of the part of the decision makers on who gets tested in the event of a death not only the health care providers but also potentially the medical examiner 's .
And so it 's hard to give an exact answer .
But I 'm not aware of a large number of people that have died that are waiting Cove in 19 testing somebody like , Yeah , I think I think partly .
That 's a question for the medical examiner .
But oftentimes testing can be different in someone who has who has passed away from a disease , especially if it 's unknown .
The reason with cause from being passed away .
But certainly whether someone 's , you know , in the hospital or is passed away , the same kinds of samples , like nasal swabs , throat swabs can be run .
Um , if there is question regarding the cause of the death there , there could potentially be more extensive testing that is performed .
And some of that testing may need to be done through the medical examiner or potentially even at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
So it depends on the situation and the events surrounding a person 's death in terms of how much testing gets done .
Thanks especially , yeah , yes .
So we we are public health laboratories has we have worked through the majority of our backlog , I think currently pending , there 's only about 60 to 70 tests that are pending at our public health laboratory .
So that 's certainly down from the middle of last week , when we had eight or 900 tests pending .
Uh , I think we have .
We have Dartmouth , Hitchcock medical centers to thank for that .
Who took some of our samples and work through some of the backlog that we had ? Um , I think we 're hearing these reports as well of , you know , people that have have waited a week or more for test results to come back .
Now that our public health laboratory has worked through the backlog that we had testing at our public health laboratories should be much , much less , you know , within the order of a day or two .
We would hope , um , from from the time that we received a sample .
But I am aware of other testing centers , commercial labs , for example that also have backlogs where the turnaround time has has greatly lengthened .
Given the demand for testing on DSO , I think it 's important .
Oh , for providers that are waiting on tests toe understand where their tests are going , they may not be coming to the public health laboratories .
They may be going to a commercial lab out of state on DSO .
We are hearing that there are backlogs , but we said our public health laboratory in New Hampshire , we work through the backlog that we 've had and have a much more reasonable turnaround time now accepted .
Come on , standing by .
You need not .
Yeah , that 's a great question .
And , you know , I think in the ideal world , we would we would do as much testing as we 're able to .
Sorry , providers would do as much testing as they 're able to , um , especially if that 's combined with contact investigations to identify potentially exposed , susceptible individuals .
And our public health team continues to do those contact investigations on the 314 people .
Um , as the number of cases increases , it becomes harder and harder to keep up with with those types of investigations , which could be very time consuming .
So as we 've as I 've mentioned before , you know it 's not .
It 's not test kits themselves that air the limitation with testing here it 's the whole ah supply chain for the testing process that includes the personal protective equipment that providers need to wear to do the testing .
The swabs were sampling the transport solutions that are needed to transport a swab from the site of collection into the laboratory .
So many of those key pieces of supplies and equipment still remain a limitation , were actively working to try and increase supplies of personal protective equipment and the swabs and the re agents that are needed for testing .
And I think as as we have increased capacity to test , we will certainly encourage providers to do testing on patients .
But given the reality of the situation in New Hampshire and nationally understanding that there are limitations certainly in personal protective equipment in some sampling supplies we continue to prioritize testing for for those who are at highest risk of potentially spreading this in communities that can include healthcare providers , first responders , people that live or work at long term care facilities , for example , people who live or work with the vulnerable populations .
But I want also stress that you know , testing and public health investigations are are an important tool to try and slow the spread of this virus .
But we ca n't test our way out of this pandemic , right ? This this virus spread so easily and with the potential for people shading and transmitting virus even before they might have symptoms , really highlights the need that you know .
Yes , testing is important on important tool , but one of the key ways to slow and prevent spread of this virus in our communities really with social distancing steps that we have and will continue to recommend people take people take to prevent the close contact .
That 's that 's required for this virus to spread between people .
Thank you .
Okay , well , thank you all very much again .
We 'll just kind of keep bringing updates .
Today was , I think there 's a lot of positivity out there , a lot of relief in terms of what the federal government is doing in backing up some of the initial programs that we got started here .
It 's all about providing that flexibility but also maintaining that social responsibility , that physical distancing within our home , in our workplace , in our private lives that we are gon na have to be in this for quite a while .
So we appreciate everybody 's patients .
We 're in this for the long haul .
We 're in it together and we will get through it .
Thank you .
