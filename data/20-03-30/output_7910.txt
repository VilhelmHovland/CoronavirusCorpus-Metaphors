Red Bull official proposes camp for F1 drivers despite virus  VIENNA ( AP ) -- An official at Formula One team Red Bull has proposed holding a training camp that would expose drivers to the coronavirus so they could build immunity to the disease while the season is suspended .
The idea by motorsport adviser Helmut Marko was rejected by the team .
Marko said it would be good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover in time for scheduled races later in the year .
" We have four Formula One drivers , we have eight or 10 juniors and the idea was to hold a camp where we could bridge this rather dead time mentally and physically , " Marko told Austrian public broadcaster ORF on Sunday .
" And then it would be ideal , because these are all young , strong men in really good health , if the infection comes then .
Then they would be equipped , if it starts up again , for a really hard world championship .
"  Marko , who was responding to a question about whether he would recommend drivers should contract the virus , said the idea of holding a training camp " was not accepted positively " within Red Bull and was abandoned .
It was n't immediately clear if by " four Formula One drivers " Marko meant Red Bull 's two drivers and two reserves , or the two drivers from sister team Alpha Tauri .
Marko also praised Red Bull driver Max Verstappen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp , and said the drivers were focusing on their fitness .
" Max Verstappen is having more races than in a regular season , " Marko said .
" If we come to a season with 15 or 18 races , it will be very hard and there wo n't be a chance to rebuild the conditioning .
"  The first eight races of the season have been canceled or postponed , leaving the Canadian Grand Prix in June as the first event still on the schedule .
That could be followed by a string of scheduled and rearranged races .
The 76-year-old Marko , who raced in F1 in the 1970s , acknowledged he could be at risk for COVID-19 .
" I belong to the high risk group but I 'm not frightened .
I respect it , " he said .
Marko added he had what he thought was a " heavy cold " in February but now thinks it could have been coronavirus symptoms .
