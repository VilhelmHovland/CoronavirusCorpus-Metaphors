St Jude 's Research and Shriners Hospitals for ChildrenPosted by sms151t on 3/30/20 at 6:58 pm  50  Have not seen if they are getting any help from Stimulus package .
I know many of their costs are covered by donations .
I wonder how bad of a hit financially they 'll take and if that will cause reduced services .

There are very very special people working there , &amp; their only goal is to help the children who come there for treatment .
The administrators sit you down &amp; give you a complete , itemized breakdown of where your dollars go .
There is no " administrative waste " .
