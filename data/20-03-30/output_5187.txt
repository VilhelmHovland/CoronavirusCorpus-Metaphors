ICU nurse with lupus is battling a need for own medicine and protective equipment amid coronavirus crisis  Alicia Bligen , RN , works in a cardiac ICU in central New Jersey .
On top of concerns about catching the coronavirus , she 's also worried about a shortage of the medicine she takes to function .

But for Alicia Bligen , a nurse with lupus who works in a cardiac intensive care unit in New Jersey , it 's uniquely perilous .
In a state with more than 13,000 cases of the coronavirus , Bligen has two separate but equal concerns -- and both revolve around supplies .
For one , she 's concerned about the lack of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) at her hospital , especially as a person with an autoimmune disease ( meaning she 's more at risk of serious infection ) .
On top of it -- in the wake of the Food and Drug Administration approving the drug hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) for treatment of COVID-19 -- she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function .
Bligen was diagnosed in about 2014 with lupus , an autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its own tissues , causing symptoms such as severe joint pain , extreme fatigue , fevers , rashes and headaches .
Not long after receiving the diagnosis , a doctor prescribed her Plaquenil , the brand-name for hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , an anti-malarial drug that has been shown to ease the symptoms of lupus .
Along with a few other medications she takes daily , hydroxychloroquine helps keep flare-ups at bay .
But now , doctors are hoping it 's a silver bullet against the current pandemic .
That theory stems almost entirely from a single , non-controlled study published in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents on March 20 .
Although the results have been praised by President Donald Trump , medical experts ( including Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ) have insisted more research is needed , and that a study of 26 people should not be taken as proof that a drug is effective .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors in the United States , Italy and France have all begun prescribing the medicine for patients with COVID-19 , putting the more than five million people living with lupus worldwide , many of whom rely on the drug , at risk .
Bligen says hydroxychloroquine is the first line of defense for patients with lupus but also other auto-immune conditions , like rheumatoid arthritis .
" It 's one of the main medications they put us on because it helps minimize the flares that you go through , " Bligen tells Yahoo Lifestyle .
" I 've been on it for so long .
"  Luckily , Bligen recently refilled her three-month prescription of the drug , but she worries about what will happen once it runs out .
" It 's a concern , " she says .
" I do n't think that it should be something that should be just given out .
From what I 've read , it 's not a preventative medication , so people should n't be taking it if they do n't have the virus .
"  Shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One woman in Florida told Bay News 9 she 's called six pharmacies so far and has n't been able to track the medicine down .
Another in California told NBC News she was informed that it 's " back-ordered everywhere .
" On its website , the Lupus Foundation of America posted a letter calling on state pharmacy boards to protect the diminishing supply .
" There are reports of hospitals , health systems , health plans , and providers stockpiling large quantities of HCQ and chloroquine .
In some cases , these stockpiles are for exclusive use for COVID-19 or even the potential use of the drugs for COVID-19 , " the letter reads .
" While we recognize the urgent global need to have treatments for COVID-19 like HCQ and CQ available for that use , we should not deny access to these medications for the people who already rely on them and for whom they are proven to work .
"  As someone worried about contracting the disease herself , Bligen understands the desire to get the medicine " Everybody 's going to jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a time of hysteria , " she tells Yahoo Lifestyle .
" So everybody wants to try and get on what they think is going to help .
" Still , she hopes doctors will be more thoughtful about who they are prescribing it for .
Even more urgently , she hopes that the supplies she needs to protect herself against COVID-19 will not run out .
As of now , she says staff in her hospital are only given supplies when a suspected COVID-19 patient is present , but that does n't feel like enough .
" Right now that 's my biggest concern .
It 's a concern with all medical personnel , " says Bligen .
" You know , we go in to help people .
That 's the profession in which we chose , but we also need to be protected ourselves .
And right now we 're not .
I mean there are people who are going to work with trash bags instead of having proper garments on to protect them from the exposure .
"  She says that frustration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a lack of both preparedness and protection .
" People are angry , people are fearful , people are anxious .
It 's you just do n't know what you 're going to walk into each day .
You do n't know what 's going to change each day , what protocols they 're putting in .
You 're just uncertain , " Bligen tells Yahoo Lifestyle .
" And although you may not be on a unit that 's specifically dealing with those patients , you 're still within the hospital .
And so we have to go around with the presumption that everyone has it .
"  Bligen , who lives with her parents and sister , is weighing whether or not she 'll continue to work if her hospital suddenly has an influx of COVID-19 patients .
But for now , she 's speaking up about the failures that are putting her in danger .
" You know , I 've heard nurses say they feel like they live in like a third world country , " says Bligen .
" You would think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
