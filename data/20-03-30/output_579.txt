Grim numbers do n't lie  The numbers alone are telling a grim story about coronavirus -- dark beyond President Donald Trump 's efforts to invoke a future " victory " over the pandemic .
White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr .
Deborah Birx predicted anew Monday that U .
deaths from COVID-19 could reach between 100,000 and 200,000 .
That is a " best-case scenario " if all precautions are followed , but Birx warned that " we 're not sure .
that all of America is responding in a uniform way to protect one another .
"  New York State 's official death toll reached 1,218 .
" That 's a lot of loss .
That 's a lot of pain .
That 's a lot of tears .
That 's a lot of grief , " said Gov .
Andrew M .
Cuomo .
The total number of confirmed cases in the state reached 66,497 as of Monday evening .

The U .
totals rose to more than 160,000 infections and over 3,000 deaths , The Associated Press reported .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more than 1 million coronavirus tests have now been administered across the U .
He did so , of course , without acknowledging the difficulty his office has had for weeks getting them developed and distributed -- or that other nations , including South Korea , have tested more per capita .
Trump also touted 6 million hydroxychloroquine doses distributed to hospitals without noting scientific limitations and doubts surrounding it .
Ford and General Electric have retooled factories to make 50,000 ventilators in 10 days , Trump reported -- also without noting how slowly this has gone .
Also regarding numbers : Trump has famously minimized the possible impact in advance of the fatal spread , saying for example on Jan .
22 that " we have it totally under control .
It 's one person coming in from China , and we have it under control .
It 's going to be just fine .
" Asked at his Monday briefing to explain this and similar claims , Trump rambled and attacked the reporter for the question .

Cuomo 's calm dismissal  Despite the life-and-death crisis , Trump made it about himself again early Monday , telling " Fox &amp; Friends " of Cuomo : " I would n't mind running against Andrew .
I 've known Andrew for a long time .
I would n't mind that but I 'll be honest , I think he 'd be a better candidate than sleepy Joe .
"  Pushed to respond later at his own briefing , Cuomo dismissed Trump 's remarks and said he would n't take the bait .
" This is no time for politics , " he said .
" I 'm not going to rise to the bait of a political challenge .
This is no time for that , not in this state , not in this nation .
"  When asked about Trump 's bizarre and vague statement about a mysterious loss of New York 's medical equipment , Cuomo said : " I do n't know what that means ; I do n't know what he 's trying to say .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing , Trump offered a convoluted riff about something a mask-producing company 's executive told him .
As Newsday 's Gormley reports , nearly 9 in 10 New York voters approve of Cuomo 's handling of the outbreak , according to a Siena Research Institute poll .
Still to be addressed  Among the mounting national problems that the administration has yet to address is the staggering toll on health care professionals .
Cuomo is talking about an interdependent hospital system that breaks down the walls between public , private , small and large hospitals .
He also appealed to health professionals in other places not now pressed by the outbreak to come to New York and volunteer their help .
Can Trump assist on a national scale ?  A supervisor urged surgeons at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Manhattan to volunteer for the front lines because half of the hospital 's intensive-care staff had already been sickened by coronavirus .
" ICU is EXPLODING , " she wrote in an email , The New York Times reported .
Rhetorical reversal  While parading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Monday at the White House : " The economy is No .
2 on my list , first I want to save lives .
"  Just a week ago , Trump was talking in a different direction .
" Our country was not built to be shut down , " he said .
" We are going to be opening up our country for business because our country was meant to be open .
"  Biden 's bounce  Maybe not being able to run around to campaign serves front-runner Democratic candidate Joe Biden well .
Or maybe he 's benefiting from the underlying issues , such as the economy .
The latest Harvard-CAPS poll shows the former vice president with 55% to Trump 's 45% among registered voters .
Biden shows 96% support among Democrats ; Trump has 89% support among Republicans .
Independents break for Biden by a 54% to 46% margin .
Bernie Sanders , the other Democratic candidate , appeared to be besting Trump 53% to 47% among registered voters .
Overall , the president 's job approval rating is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now say the economy is on the wrong track .
