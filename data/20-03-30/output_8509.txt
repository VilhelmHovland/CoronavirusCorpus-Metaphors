WASHINGTON ( The Borowitz Report ) -- In a conversation over the weekend that reportedly left the President " shaken , " Dr .
Anthony Fauci warned Donald Trump that if everyone in the United States dies , it would adversely affect his television ratings .
Although Fauci was quick to add that the everyone-dying scenario was purely hypothetical , he stressed that , from a medical perspective , alive people were more likely than dead ones to watch television .
According to a source familiar with the conversation , the possible impact of COVID-19 fatalities on Trump 's ratings " totally blindsided " the President , who immediately convened an emergency meeting of the White House Coronavirus Task Force .
Trump first raised the idea of a massive parade early Saturday morning , arguing that it would address the " biggest problem " created by the pandemic thus far : the lack of appreciation for his own efforts regarding it .
