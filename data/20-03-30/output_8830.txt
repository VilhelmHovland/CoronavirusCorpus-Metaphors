You know , when a lot of us first got our shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders , we were given end dates of April 1 or April 7 .
Not June 10 .
But that 's what the state of Virginia is looking at now .
Governor Ralph S .
Northam issued an executive order forcing citizens to stay in their homes unless absolutely necessary until June 10 .
The order is effective as of April 1 and , while it excludes certain activities like buying food or seeking medical care , most Virginians will find themselves holed up at home for the spring months thanks to the novel coronavirus pandemic .
Right now , it seems a little bleak , which means that , more than anything else , we need a good laugh right now .
And Twitter users have delivered on these stay-at-home memes .
This is a live look at the rest of the country .
Where 's my pitchfork ?  Everyone in Virginia on June Eleventh heading over to the homes of the people who went to the beaches during the weekend and forcing their governor to make the quarantine lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
If you 're mocking Virginia 's pain right now , you may want to take a seat .
Because we 're all going to be sitting inside for a while .
But , hey , at least we 're not alone .
