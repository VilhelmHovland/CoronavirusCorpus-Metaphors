Nigeria Must Not Waste the Opportunity Called COVID-19 Crisis , By ' Tope Fasua  This COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant shutdowns and global panic offer us an opportunity to throw away the box in which we have imprisoned our minds for too long as a people ; as it pertains to our economics that is .
Why have all the indices come up short for us .
No light .
No water .
Stinking environments .
No public housing .
No health systems .
Nothing ! Who do we think will invest in them for us and our people ?  First the bad news .
Expect no less than a global economic depression in the realm of what happened between 1930-39 .
This time it may even be worse .
Why ? The world economy has never been more integrated .
There has n't been so much reliance on the allocative power of markets .
The fragility of world economies has never been so cheaply exposed .
And never has everything come to such a sudden , shocking , screeching halt , almost worldwide .
The effect of the shutdowns and lockdowns , the quarantines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peoples across the world .
The upside is that the world has , since 1939 , built considerable communications infrastructure and technology , that may aid a rapid economic recovery , such that the period of global economic downturn does not have to last a decade and result in a world war ( some say we are passing through one already ) like the last experience .
It is also important to know that some countries learnt serious lessons from the Great Depression , while some countries were not even born then .
Most of the countries this side of the world are n't really very good in picking up these hard lessons of history by the way .
But it is time to learn .
Recession Versus Depression  The above rigmarole pops a question into mind .
What is an economic depression ? Economists hardly agree on anything .
Some say it is a prolonged recession , recession itself being a drop in the level of a country 's Gross Domestic Product ( value of goods and services produced in a country in a given year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drop in the GDP of a country by 10 per cent or more over a period of time .
It has been predicted by economists at the Bank of America that global GDP will fall by 12 per cent .
That is a proper global depression for those who go by the numbers .
The symptoms of an economic depression are however unmistakable -- high poverty rates , high unemployment rates , high inflation rate or better still , stagflation ; high crime rates , lower life expectancy as a result of broken down health systems , high illiteracy and so on .
Sounds familiar right ? Most sub-Saharan African countries have never known anything but economic depression , irrespective of the figures their governments post , to impress the international community .
We will also find that since 1939 , no OECD ( Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ) country , in other words the big Kahunas , has ever fallen into depression , even if many have dipped into recession a number of times .
In fact , the terminology seems to have dropped off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reality have not alarmed themselves enough with such a terminology , preferring to celebrate their occasional 6-8 per cent GDP growth as ' Africa Rising ' , even when 80 per cent of their people roil in all of the miseries associated with economic depression ( including bad or no housing , little or no electricity , little or no water , sub-human transport systems etc .
) , in addition to the regular symptoms listed earlier .
Already , with round-the-block queues to buy basic items ( and others not so basic ) in parts of the world , empty shelves in stores , spiking unemployment ( 3 .
million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week and 550,000 in the U .
) , it looks like a depression is afoot .
Some are celebrating the takeover of Artificial Intelligence , Machine Learning , Internet of Things etc .
, and the likelihood that these phenomena will rapidly replace human beings in the workplace .
True .
But these innovations will also lead to mass unemployment around the world -- just as it happened with the Great Depression of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigeria , take advantage of this unique , unprecedented and profoundly destabilising crisis to open a new chapter ? Or will we generally hide away , obey toxic instructions , try some copycatting and generally waste a crisis ? Has it not been said that nations should never waste a crisis ? Are great nations , just as great organisations , not forged in crises ? Did Europe and the Americas not emerge as greater regions from World Wars ? In fact , did the U .
not leverage on the Second World War to shove the United Kingdom aside as the world 's dominant nation ? This may just be an opportunity that will not present itself to us again .
I propose that we grab it with both hands .
How ?  Exiting Our Perennial Budgets of Mediocrity  I have always complained about our budgeting .
I see that the fiscal response to this crisis is to slash the N10 trillion by N1 .
trillion because the price of crude oil crashed in the global markets from about $80 as at June 2018 , to around $26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the obviously logical thing to do .
But I say we should hold on a second .
Is that the best we can do ? We should recall that we are not our own competition .
Our children are not supposed to be competing with themselves along the usual tribal and religious lines .
We should be competing with other countries .
We should be preparing the children of Nigeria , and provisioning for them in comparison with children of other nations .
Even within Africa , we have examples we can benchmark against .
Why is Nigeria cutting a $30 billion budget when South Africa is working on a $130 billion budget this year ? And they have just 60 million people there against our own 200 million ! What is there to cut in a budget of $140 ( barely N50,000 ) per person in a given year ? I have asked that we open our minds to this reality ; this enveloping mediocrity .
Perhaps this is a good time to revisit the issue .
This is not the time for easy economic decisions .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit , invest in the people and reap back in the future .
Looking at this scenario , evidently Nigeria has an advantage .
We can issue government bonds at 10 per cent and get domestic subscribers .
We can even run up to 14 per cent and issue 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 year bonds .
The only problem is that we still have corruption in the system and we can not afford for monies so raised to be embezzled or totally mismanaged .
What to do ? Rather than slash the 2020 budget , we should reorder the spending in the budget away from non-value-adding items and all those ego-boosting things into the critical sectors mentioned above that improve the human capital of the country and unleash our productivity .
The overriding assumption in our budgets is the expected ( benchmark ) price of crude oil and how much of it we wish to produce daily .
I believe we should populate that section a bit more .
Other assumptions must come in .
Other sectors must feature .
This involves deep thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and honest brainstorming .
I believe it is very doable .
In the current budget are proposals for the purchase of luxury cars for big civil servants and political appointees .
The elected officials have already received their own luxury cars .
There are provisions for new office complexes for a public service that should be more on the field and less in offices .
There are proposals for the purchase of generators .
The irony of making such a budget , and within days seeing everything unravel as crude oil crashed more rapidly than ever before , has n't shocked us .
To this kind of mediocre , one-track-minded , anti-people budget that feeds the politically powerful and panders to our usual excesses and penchant for white elephant projects , we must say : NEVER AGAIN ! The people of Nigeria need to rise up this time .
The political leaders are waiting to hear from us .
We must reclaim our power .
A Serious Fiscal Stimulus With An Eye On the Future  Thus far , Nigeria is slow in bringing up a fiscal emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary policy guys through loans to some industries , chiefly pharmaceuticals and manufacturers .
The focus is for us to stay alive first since the chemist shelves , as we call them here , will soon be bare .
That is okay , but we must think ahead .
The N1 .
trillion budget is regarded in economics as a procyclical policy as it deepens the problem , and does n't solve it -- it intensifies our vicious cycle of poverty , want , lack of infrastructure , or investment in human capital .
What we need right now is a COUNTER-CYCLICAL fiscal policy that helps to turn back the hand of the clock by reflating and incentivising the economy for productivity .
National budgets anywhere in the world are very critical , even to business .
The government is still the biggest spender in any economy too .
So if we can not increase that budget size , we should leave it alone .
Or better still we need to pump in at least N10 trillion into this economy this year , and maintain that new fiscal pedestal going forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other serious economies , on per capita basis and in terms of the provision for human capital development .
The monetary stimulus is limited to lending to usually large companies or moratoria on loans .
This leaves out the majority of our people , who do n't run companies that take bank loans .
This is why the Nigerian government should not sit on its hands this time .
Those grassroots people are also waiting to hear from government .
Direct palliatives and cash bailouts should be arranged for our most-vulnerable .
How Do We Fund Higher Budgets and A Massive Fiscal Stimulus ?  We are now challenged as a people .
We have no experience in managing these things but we can learn from others .
The U .
is intervening with ? 330 billion ( about 10 per cent of its GDP ) , 12 per cent of which will be given out directly in cash and transfers to people who could use some extra cash .
They do n't have much reserves .
So they are issuing domestic bonds .
The coupon is worthless at nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate to 0 .
per cent .
I read somewhere that they know that investors will not rush the bond , so the proposal is that the Bank of England will buy up the government bonds and issue cash to banks ( print money in effect ) .
The U .
will suffer some inflation as money supply rises .
But though the Bank of England warehouses the bonds , the financial instruments could still be traded in the secondary market at discounted rates .
This is not the time for easy economic decisions .
In fact , this is time for government to take the hit , invest in the people and reap back in the future .
Looking at this scenario , evidently Nigeria has an advantage .
We can issue government bonds at 10 per cent and get domestic subscribers .
We can even run up to 14 per cent and issue 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 and 30 year bonds .
The only problem is that we still have corruption in the system and we can not afford for monies so raised to be embezzled or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to help our people and invest in the sectors mentioned above .
Again , we should say : Enough Already ! to the profligacy that has come to define our nation .
Whereas I am proposing a focus on domestic bonds , something to whip up our people 's sentiments by reminding them how every country has closed its doors on everyone , foreign borrowing may come in handy too .
The World Bank has positioned $8 billion concessionary loans for countries like ours .
The African Development Bank ( AfDB ) also has a much smaller plan .
The suggestion of domestic borrowing is important because that is how every great country developed : local bonds , infrastructure bonds , war time bonds and so on .
monies lent by the people to the state for pecuniary and/or patriotic reasons .
Never Waste A Crisis !  This COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant shutdowns and global panic offer us an opportunity to throw away the box in which we have imprisoned our minds for too long as a people ; as it pertains to our economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short for us .
No light .
No water .
Stinking environments .
No public housing .
No health systems .
Nothing ! Who do we think will invest in them for us and our people ? We wanted to borrow $17 billion out of a total of $22 .
billion from China .
Now they have their own problems .
Still I do n't believe we should shrink the economy .
I propose a more aggressive approach .
I propose we look inwards , and try to raise N20 trillion in domestic bonds/debts .
This comes to about $65 billion ( roughly 15 per cent of our GDP ) , with which we can prime the economy over the next two to three years .
This will have impact on our banks in terms of their liquidity but only for a while , as the money goes back into the banks through the payment for contracts .
The banks will also be involved in the money creation process that expands the economy through loan creation .
The only issue to wrestle with will be the value of the naira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naira ? Already , analysts have predicted the death of the naira , even as the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) swears that it will continue to defend the currency .
The death of the naira is predicted from the sharp drop in crude oil prices and our fast-eroding reserves .
Target Market For The N20 Trillion Domestic Bond  The target for the loans could be expanded to include :  1 .
Local Residents 2 .
Nigerians abroad 3 .
Interested foreigners and portfolio investment companies who are attracted by the yields .
There is a reason the U .
is spending $2 trillion ( over 10 per cent of its GDP ) , the U .
? 330 billion , Canada CAN$75 billion etc .
, just to tide over this season .
Those countries already understand how to handle such a massive downturn and what to spend on .
They know that they can not afford to see their productive sectors ruined .
They know the value of keeping people at work .
They learnt the lessons of the Great Depression and they swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since independence to exist in the reality and with the symptoms of a country in economic depression .
The challenge we have therefore is how to heave out of this unpalatable reality , not how to keep managing to remain in it for as far as the eyes can see .
If we took my advice , we can use this opportunity to launch .
The domestic bond of , say , N20 trillion ( $65 billion ) should be split over five to say 30 years at 10 to 13 per cent .
The focus should be on Nigerians .
It could even be called a wartime bond as government leverages on current sentiments .
Let Nigerians know that they are all they have and as we can see , there are instances in which all countries shut their doors on globalisation .
Yes , this country is all we have and it is worth investing in for the long term .
Interest Rates , Exchange Rates and Inflation  My idea is certainly not perfect .
It could do with more fine-tuning .
The bond may flop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a total meltdown as the COVID-19 takes a higher human toll here than elsewhere -- not in terms of those who die by the disease but the upheaval that comes after the health scare subsides .
The monetary authorities should also begin to reduce the Monetary Policy Rate ( MPR ) at the same time to boost domestic lending .
Equally , they should reduce the Cash Reserve Ratio and Liquidity Ratio .
They should maintain the Loans-to-Deposit Ratio at the current 65 per cent .
Banks should be assisted to focus on core lending business and maintain professionalism at this tough epoch , to reduce incidences of non-performing loans .
Very importantly , by beginning to reduce MPR , we send a signal that rates may be lower in the future , so any smart investor should lock in with the new domestic bond at 10-13 per cent or so for 15 to 30 years .
The secondary market can always rescue those who wish to get out before maturity .
Nigeria will continue to battle with inflation , but I believe we should target economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development than low inflation , by all means .
In the wake of the Eco currency controversy , I found out that all our Francophone brother nations have inflation in the region of 0 .
per cent to 1 per cent .
They may be commended for managing their economies well , but they are actually stunting their economies , and France actually encouraged them along the journey .
They have choked their economies and most entrepreneurial activities in those countries are run by the French and Lebanese .
None of these economies can withstand Nigeria as we know , in spite of our 12 .
per cent inflation .
In this trilemma , I believe inflation is something we can let go temporarily , as we try to control it by other means e .
preventing price gouging , better regulation of all sectors to prevent sharp practices , and enforcement of competition laws to give our people a smorgasbord of choices .
The only issue to wrestle with will be the value of the naira .
What will be the effect of this approach on the naira ? Already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) swears that it will continue to defend the currency .
The death of the naira is predicted from the sharp drop in crude oil prices and our fast-eroding reserves , but something can be done .
I always take a cue from the 3 Generations of Currency Crisis in looking at what may happen with the naira .
A lot is still within the control of our monetary authorities , in spite of the fall in the quantum of our foreign reserves ( currently around $34 billion ) .
The first generation of currency crisis says speculative attacks will come when a country tries to maintain a fixed rate , while the second speaks about what is called the ' self-fulfilling prophecy ' in that when people speculate that a currency will fall , then it will .
The CBN can subtly attempt to work on a reverse self-fulfilling prophecy , apart from just putting out information that it will defend the currency ( a scenario that puts the CBN on the back foot ) .
The idea of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange by locals who have money abroad , and Nigerians living abroad who wish to invest at home .
This will help strengthen the naira and increase our reserves .
Foreign investment companies will also buy in .
This strategy needs to be rolled out soon in order to ease the pressure that the naira is presently under .
As the global economy grinds to a halt , the CBN has suspended the sales of currency to Bureaux de Change .
We have too many of them anyway ( perhaps 8,000 ! ) .
People are still buying the dollar to keep , speculatively ( a self-fulfilling prophecy ) .
When the world economy resumes , a lot of business transactions will have to be concluded , leading naturally to a massive net outflow .
It will be a good idea to stem the hemorrhage ahead of time .
We must never waste such a great crisis .
The Nigerian economy must take off finally .
