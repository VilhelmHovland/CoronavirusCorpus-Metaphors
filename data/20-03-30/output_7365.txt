SOME GENERAL GOOD TIPS : NALP has also established guidelines to assist business owners .
These tips include complying with all federal , state and local advisories ; actively urging employees who are sick to stay home ; and thoroughly disinfecting personal protective equipment .
While the Centers of Disease Control assessed that for most people the immediate risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should start preparing for more employee absences .
The NALP suggests cross-training personnel in the event that a key member of the team is absent for an extended period of time .
It 's also important to note that the Coronavirus is a reportable illness with OSHA .
It 's also recommended that companies begin reviewing policies and procedures , along with preparing to alter business practices if needed .
According to the CDC , Oregon has 75 reported cases , while neighboring state Washington has reported 1,012 cases and 52 deaths .
For Ben Bowen , head landscape designer with Ross NW Watergardens in Portland , his company has already begun putting preventative measures in place .
" Right now , it 's still business as usual for us .
We had a discussion with all of our teammates , " Bowen said .
" We made sure everyone understood the symptoms , and we told them we expect them to stay home if they have any of them .
"  Bowen added that at Ross NW Watergardens , employees have a pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal and vacation days .
" Usually , our employees will come to work if they have a minor cold , " he said .
" However , we made sure they know to stay home , and if they have to take off for this it wo n't impact their normal pool of paid time off .
"  Bowen noted some companies may not be able to offer the same courtesy to their employees .
" For states that do n't have mandated paid time off , there could be a problem , " he said .
" There can be a little hostility toward those who are perceived to be spreading the virus .
"  According to Bowen , Ross NW Watergardens has already begun to be negatively impacted by the growing panic over the Coronavirus .
" I just got an email from a client who was very motivated to do a backyard project with us , " he explained .
" He loved all the ideas but told me with things being so uncertain he could not invest the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry we 're seeing people worried about the economy .
"  Bowen said he expects the maintenance and manufacturing sectors of the industry to be affected as well , especially in areas that quarantine .
" If we were to see something like what is going on in Italy , then crews could be idle for weeks , " he said .
" Manufacturing disruptions could increase wait time for parts and equipment .
"  While everyone is being cautious , Bowen said that employees are staying calm in the meantime .
" The tone is really that we 're not worried for ourselves but realize there are people in the community who are especially vulnerable .
We want to protect those people by being , " he said .
Bob Grover , president of Pacific Landscape Management , also in Portland , said that while the health risks are undeniable , he is more concerned about the economic impact .
" My biggest concern over the Coronavirus is the potential impact on the economy , " he said .
" We are hearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Coronoavirus has on the travel , hotel and convention industries will have ripple effects into the overall economy .
"  Grover added that beginning late last week , Pacific Landscape Management began researching and formulating a plan .
" We want people to practice good hygiene , " he said .
" That means washing your hands when you get to work , when you go home and throughout the day .
Also , coughing or sneezing into your elbow .
We told employees do n't come to work if you feel sick .
If you do come sick , and we feel that you 're coughing , or feverish , we will send you home .
"  Grover said he believes that in states without mandated sick leave employees will show up to work even if they have some of the symptoms .
" The good thing about Oregon is we 're a very progressive state and it 's required that all employees have sick leave , " he said .
" So , it 's not as big of an issue here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  At Pacific Landscape Management some employees have scheduled travel plans that may be cancelled and others may choose to cancel trips in highly affected areas .
" We told employees that they have the choice to self-select out and not go if they are not comfortable , " he said .
" We want everybody to take their personal health into their own hands .
We want to encourage people to do that and not feel like there will be any retributions .
