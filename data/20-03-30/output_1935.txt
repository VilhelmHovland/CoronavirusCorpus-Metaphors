Obviously football played behind closed doors would be a bit rubbish but surely we can all agree it would be better than the current situation of no football at all ? Plus it would mean we hear what players shout at each other during games .
We 'd also get a great insight into the impact of home/away advantage .
If you void this season how do you resolve the Leicester/Spurs conundrum .
One has earned a place in the Champions League whilst one has been awful .
Do we void and say it 's Spurs ' turn again ? You ca n't make one award without making all of them .
Bias implied in sign-off .

The solution is actually crystal clear .
If there is a Premier League season where we have to compromise , it ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2020/2021 season .
Be it resuming this current season in May , or June , or July , or even November , this season simply has to be completed because of sporting reasons .
Back in 2005 , Real Madrid played a ' six-minute ' game because that game was postponed in the 86th minute weeks ago due to a bomb scare .
While today 's context is different from that 15 years ago , the end result should be the same and that what is left unfinished should be completed before we start anything new .
Look , if football could resume before August 2020 , we should have enough time to finish this season , and start the next one with a bit of compromise in terms of schedule arrangements ( e .
no winter break ) .
If the coronavirus is only under control in October or November , I do n't see how we can finish the 2020/2021 season by June 2021 , and because of this , does that mean that the 2020/2021 season will be nulled and voided too ? It would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the case , we could continue the 2019/2020 season in November or December 2020 , and then allow it to complete by March 2021 .
Of course that would leave us with a big break in 2021 but we could occupy ourselves during those empty months with international football , or even the League Cup which has already been completed this season with a winner .
What I am trying to emphasise here is that every result deserves its recognition and nulling or voiding a result because of non-sporting reason is simply unacceptable .
Even when the champions have been decided , or when teams have been relegated before the end of the season , matches involving these teams still proceed .
While the results may not be material in terms of securing titles or avoiding relegation , it is precisely due to sporting reasons why the games have to proceed because every result must be respected .
I am a Liverpool fan and I have been waiting for 30 years for our team to lift the holy grail .
But I am sure every Liverpool fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find a cure to this pandemic .
We could lift the trophy in an empty stadium , or we could even lose all the remaining games and surrender the title to Man City .
Those are really secondary to what we are facing now .
But when we are finally done with this coronavirus , we want things to continue from where they have paused , in the right manner .
, Singapore .
I am really struggling with the concept of voiding the season .
I 'm a social distancing Liverpool fan with a young family and my own business so its probably other things I am struggling with but I am going to take it out on every player , ex-player or supporter of a Premier League tea who had a crap season who wants the league to be voided .
Void is n't cancelled .
Voided means never happened .
We know that clubs will have to return nearly ? 800m of TV money that they already have in their bank .
They would lose out on bonuses based on where they finished .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money from their betting sponsors as if the season is voided and never happened then neither did all those bets .
Finally we see may see a skint bookie as they refund the duped masses .
There is no way voiding the season makes financial or legal sense .
Sky are showing Premier League years and highlights .
This is what football is about .
Memories , moments , emotions .
Voiding the season takes away all of these .
They never happened .
You were wrong to take joy from them as they can be taken away from you .
As a Liverpool fan there is a crazy amount of bloody excellent football that would be taken away .
From Curtis Jones 's first goals to literally the best first 29 games of Premier League football that has ever been .
As an England fan this season saw record-breaking champions elect play with two young English defenders , a legendary old boy and a captain getting his trophy lifting twinkle toes ready yet again .
Joe Gomez and TAA were often touted pre-match as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on to get 12 assists and Gomez has a ridiculous unbeaten record .
Voiding the season takes all that away from them .
The Premier League is n't actually that competitive .
This is genuinely a rare chance for a new Premier League winner .
And it 's not even unlikely .
Based on City 's form Liverpool already have enough points to win the league .
The only bookies taking bets on it are trying to get you addicted .
It already is a title-winning performance .
And it is worth being remembered .
I do n't want to hear from anyone associated with a team who have had a forgettable season about how they want to take people 's memories away .
There are nine games left .
Round 9 happens in mid-October .
That 6-7 months away .
Based on what the Government is saying it is unlikely that we 'll be having mass gathering again in 6 months .
Even if we get there and there is a managed restarting of society and games are played without a crowd you would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear in the playing and backroom staff .
There would be no festival of football until there is herd immunity or a vaccine .
If we void this season because the season ca n't be finished then we have to void next season if the season ca n't be started again by mid-October .
The Premier League years of this season is a cracker , and not just for Liverpool .
It ca n't be forgotten .
Thanks for listening .
, south London  Go straight to penalties I have read almost everything on the matter of calling this season null and void .
And possibly all the arguments pro and against .
Can I just propose a simple solution to all concerned ?  Let 's go straight to pens .
Let 's decide each remaining game in football through penalties like in a proper match which after 120 mins is a draw .
Drastic circumstances call for ingenious insight .
Lets give each side a 5 pen count .
So , instead of 90 minutes , we would have 5 penalties .
There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 pens all is square it is a draw .
A win 3 points .
A loss -- nil .
The competition would be fair , social distancing kept alive -- 11 meters is more than enough between two players -- TVs and sponsors and players would get their money and the drama might be quite astonishing in these dire times .
The competition would be fair and broadcast live on TV .
Footballers wont need pre match practice to get football fit .
Goalkeepers would be analysed in every possible way .
Those who miss and those who score would suffer and enjoy properly .
Fans too .
The whole thing can be over in less than 20 minutes and the spirit of football and proper competition would be kept alive .
You never know what might result from the remaining ' games ' , this way .
And at the end of it all we might have a deserving winner and some real escape from this existential mess .
The specialists can sort out the finer details but in my opinion it is a possible solution that cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the arguments why it ca n't be sorted out this way .
( LFC , Tirana , Albania )  But it obviously would n't be .
No sensible person would suggest scrapping a programme of 38 fixtures per team rather than 8 or 9 -- the 8 or 9 that have actually been disrupted I might add .
If things can resume as normal from August/September ( a big if ) and if something was to be abandoned , then the balance of this season is up for the chopping block .
it does n't suit me either , as I fancied United to lock down a Champions League place .
The thing is though , talk of scrapping either is , for me , extremely premature .
Some musings on the matter :  Whenever football resumes , the starting presumption should be to pick up where we left off and finish this season , play next season 's league fixtures and be flexible about start and end dates -- even if that means 2-3 years of adjusting the exact calendar dates of the season .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relegation , continental qualification and/or being crowned a first time premier league winner/the GOAT ( delete according to preference ) .
The above approach is doubly necessary because we can not assume that there will not be further lock-downs .
There is every chance that we may all get let out over the summer and for this all to happen again next winter -- the most sensible approach would be to put a pin in the relevant season(s) and pick up where we left off -- scheduling fixtures and breaks ( including breaks for international tournaments , which are logistically trickier than domestic leagues to rearrange ) as necessary .
To find time in the calendar , international friendlies , the Carabao and FA cup could be scrapped ( in that order ) .
Ideally , this season 's cup should be finished , but no-one could complain about the cup not going ahead next season if that means no teams are being discriminated against .
I have no time for the suggestion the season should be scrapped because of player contracts expiring .
The simple solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit in with adjusted programmes ;  As a starting point , continue to not allow players to register with new clubs outside those adjusted windows ;  If a player 's contract would expire in the meantime , clubs and players should be encourage to agree at least a short extension on the current terms ;  If the player does n't want to and lets their contract expire , do n't let them register for a new club until the window opens ;  If the club does n't agree to extend , let the player register for their new club as an exception -- the club would n't be able to sign a replacement until the window opens .
( MUFC )  A Caribbean Premier League XIHere is my attempt at the regional XI games , in this case a Caribbean Premier League XI .
Players must have represented a Caribbean nation as their main international side ( some have flirted with other countries or played for youth teams ) so this rules out the likes of Kingston-born Raheem Sterling .
Think this is a decent team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in attack .
Midfield a bit weak but I reckon would be good for mid table and some cup runs .
GK- Shaka Hislop ( T&amp;T ) Clear choice for this position , Hislop was part of the Newcastle Entertainers side , won the Championship with Portsmouth and collected an FA Cup runners up medal with West Ham in 2006 .
Represented T&amp;T in their World Cup debut in 2006 .
One of the stars of this team , Hislop currently works as a pundit on ESPN .
RWB- Pascal Chimbonda ( Guadeloupe ) I remember him as being a marauding , entertaining player for Wigan and Spurs .
He was in the PFA team of the year after Wigan 's debut season in 2006 .
Gets in on a technicality as he does have a cap for France , but initially played for Guadeloupe .
If this annoys purists , sub in Emmerson Boyce instead ( Barbados ) .
CB-David Sommiel ( Guadeloupe ) Crowbarred into the team after I found out he scored Man City 's first ever Etihad goal .
Props .
CB- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 's and won the League Cup with them .
Rounds out a decent-looking central defence in front of big Shaka .
LWB- Ricardo Gardner ( Jamaica ) ' Bibi ' played 12 seasons for Bolton in the Premier League , including being part of the iconic Okocha side .
Has 111 caps for Jamaica and played in the 1998 World Cup .
Scored for Bolton against Bayern in the UEFA Cup in a colourful career .
Currently runs a reggae label and is a dedicated Rastafarian .
CM-Jloyd Samuel ( T&amp;T ) Tragically died in 2018 in a horrific car crash , Samuel played most of his Premier League games for Villa and Bolton .
Interestingly rounded off his career with four seasons in Iran , and won the league there .
His job is to hold the fort and let the attack do their thing .
CM- Robbie Earle ( Jamaica ) Part of the Crazy Gang , played 284 games for Wimbledon and scored 59 goals .
Adds a cultured presence to the midfield .
Was dismissed as a pundit by ITV in 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenwyne Jones ( T&amp;T ) Fast and physical and a nightmare to defend against , Jones played for Stoke and Sunderland .
Began his career in T&amp;T for a wonderfully named club ( Joe Public ! ) .
In the team mainly as I seem to remember him being great value on MOTD highlights .
First of all the world has much changed today .
Football on television and as an actual sport may be one of the entertainment venues for kids in the days Johnny grew up .
That is not the case anymore as we have so many more alternatives for entertainment .
Fortnite for example is free to play on most electronic devices you own and gives you the interactivity and competition without leaving your home .
There 's also Netflix , social media , YouTube , etc .
More competition for your time .
I 'm not saying football as a active sport is not popular but to link and solve the entire full medical tab of diabetes and depression to justify buying the rights , especially as football is already the most popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely assumes that a ) people who play football never experience depression and b ) people can not get depression from non football or non physical exercise reasons .
Johnny 's philosophy is simple : change everything back to this good old days , which given what I read about the period , he is cherry picking which aspect to emphasize .
But guess what , the globalism of the EPL is here to stay .
Proof ? Some random young adult in Malaysia is writing a mail to an older British guy on a website .
And he checks out their news and website of a football league oceans away .
Manchester United , Chelsea , Arsenal , Liverpool , etc are n't going to lose their fans .
Overseas TV rights will still be a thing ( and under the upcoming new deal , local rights fell down while overseas went up ) and will go to the highest bidder .
Merchandise sales for those clubs will still be a force to be reckon with and they will have more revenues and income than most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be here to stay .
Like any free market , there will be some times where it will be lower and higher but unless football itself goes out of fashion , they 'll always be huge demand and the ability to supply for it , leading to prices that are higher than a certain level .
It ai n't gon na be infinite growth but it ai n't gon na be peanuts either .
And lastly the British government has got way more important things to spend on than a bunch of people kicking a ball around .
Important to communities yes , but there 's already controversy on how to fund the BBC going forward , with an economic crisis looming and debts that need to be repaid , you can bet they have other more important things to worry about than whether people get their football fix even after this is all over .
