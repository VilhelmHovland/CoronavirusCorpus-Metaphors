Trump speaks during the Coronavirus Task Force press briefing on the coronavirus .
Monday 's daily White House briefing on the coronavirus was very much in tone with all of the others : Lots of upbeat , boastful remarks of how far the administration has come in fighting the pandemic -- overshadowing some disconcerting warnings that the worst is likely to come .
Most of the reporters at the press conference were spaced out in socially safe distances in the Rose Garden on the unseasonably warm day , and some of the journalists again proved to be Trump 's favorite foils , raining on the parade of good news he had to tell about the rising availability of coronavirus testing .
At the start of the briefing , Trump declared that the U .
had passed the 1 million mark in tests performed -- a milestone , he noted , that was more than any other country .
Related Story  But Yamiche Alcindor , the White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour , questioned why the U .
was still not testing as many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why is that , and when do you think that number will be on par with other countries ? " she asked .
Trump answered , " I know South Korea better than anybody .
It is very tight .
You know how many people are in Seoul ? Do you know how big the city of Seoul is ? 38 million people .
That is bigger than anything we have .
Thirty-eight million people all tightly wound together .
We have vast farmland .
We have vast areas where they do n't have much of a problem .
In some cases they have no problem whatsoever .
" The population of Seoul is closer to 10 million .
He then repeated that the U .
has done " more tests by far than any country in the world .
" " I 'm not talking about per capita , " he said , adding that " our testing is also better than any country in the world .
"  And then he expressed his annoyance with Alcindor .
" Rather than asking a question like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this testing , " he said .
He pointed to a recently developed five-minute test from Abbott Laboratories , and also praised Roche for their progress in producing kits .
" You should be saying congratulations instead of asking a really snarky question , because I know exactly what you mean by that , " Trump said .
He then ended the briefing .
Alcindor is the same reporter who Trump criticized on Sunday , when he called one of her questions " threatening .
" She had been asking Trump about his doubts , expressed on Sean Hannity 's Fox News show on Thursday , that some state governors needed all the ventilators that they had been requesting .
With regular airplay on the cable news networks and sometimes on broadcast TV , the briefings have been a sizable ratings draw , as Trump noted Sunday .
But as the crisis drags on , there is increasing consternation in the journalism community over whether the briefings should be aired live , along with plenty of criticism among the president 's detractors that the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , CNN cut away from Monday 's briefing as Trump called up a selection of corporate CEOs offering assistance to the coronavirus relief effort , including the CEO of MyPillow , Mike Lindell , who said that his firm is manufacturing cotton face masks .
His company is a well-recognized sponsor on Fox News and Lindell is a longtime Trump booster .
Other corporate chieftains went to the lectern and praised Trump ; Lindell said that " God gave us grace on November 8 , 2016 to change the course we are on .
" Lindell himself may be on a new course : During the event , Politico reported that Trump has told Lindell that he wants him to run for governor of Minnesota in 2022 .
To little surprise , Trump did spar with Jim Acosta , this time as CNN 's chief White House correspondent asked the president what he would say to Americans who are upset with the way he " downplayed this crisis over the past couple of months .
" Acosta then read some of Trump 's quotes back to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country .
It is very much under control .
It is going to disappear .
It is like a miracle .
It will disappear .
" Acosta listed others .
" If you look at those individual statements , they are all true , " Trump insisted .
" Stay calm .
It will go away .
You know it is going away ? And it will go away and we will have a great victory .
And it is people like you and CNN that say things like that -- it is why people just do n't want to listen to CNN anymore .
You could ask a normal question .
The statements I made are I want to keep the country calm .
I do n't want panic in the country .
I could cause panic much better than even you .
It would make you look like a minor league player .
"  He went on , before telling Acosta , " Instead of asking a nasty , snarky question like that , you should ask a real question , and other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  About an hour later , CNN said that there were 502 coronavirus deaths reported Monday in the U .
, the most of any day since the crisis began .
Medical experts on the coronavirus task force say that the total deaths could range between 100,000-200,000 if " we do things together well , " as the White House 's coronavirus response coordinator , Dr .
Deborah Birx , told Today co-anchor Savannah Guthrie earlier in the day .
Guthrie was surprised that the six-figure death toll is the optimistic scenario .
In the otherwise upbeat atmosphere of the Rose Garden briefing , there was reference made to family members of those who have already died from the coronavirus -- gestures that are either lost or not mentioned at all in the rather chaotic atmospheres of the nightly briefings .
It came when Trump called to the lectern Seema Verna , administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid , and directed her to tell the press how " positive " it has been .
Verna did , but she started her remarks by saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lost loved ones due to the coronavirus .
