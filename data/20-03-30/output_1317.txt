Wash your hands and stay at home .
It 's surely not too much to ask of us at this critical moment , when so many thousands of lives are at stake here in Scotland and across the globe .
As this coronavirus pandemic ? shuts down life as we know it the unavoidable consequences and dire financial ramifications are only just beginning to hit home .
It 's crystal clear now Scottish football will not be immune .
Hearts have acted quickly to stem the bleeding by attempting to slash their wage bill by 50 per cent and although Ann Budge has been hammered for the brutal manner with which she has gone about it , the truth of the matter is more of our clubs , maybe even all of them , will be forced to take similar action before we 're close to kicking a ball around again .
It stands to reason football players can not expect to be paid in full ? indefinitely when there is no football for them to play .
Without matchday income there is no business model at all and , as existing cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim .
The noises of distress coming out of Aberdeen and Hibs over the last few days point to the general direction our game is now locked into .
Down south , and particularly in the scatter cash environment of the Championship , the picture is even more bleak .
During emergency talks last week it became clear a huge number of EFL clubs will be unable to cover April 's wage bill .
Up here the richest club in the country is carefully examining its next step .
Celtic may have around ? 30million sitting in the bank but with a wage bill nudging ? 60m they are also exposed to a cash burn like no other SPFL club .
It does n't take a mathematician to do the sums .
These monumental reserves would be wiped out by another six months of locked doors .
( Image : SNS Group )  Amid all this gathering carnage Dave King chose to take the government edict more literally than most .
On Friday , King effectively washed his hands of Rangers while declaring his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johannesburg mansion .
In more normal circumstances his resignation as chairman would n't have set alarm bells ringing .
After all , King did say at the Ibrox club 's AGM back in November his time at the helm was nearing an end and he would most probably be gone before the end of March .
In that respect he has been true to his word .
But the world has changed ? immeasurably over these last few weeks and it seems likely also a huge chunk of the fresh investment on which Rangers had been banking when King first announced his exit timetable will also have been put on pause .
Put it this way , over the last week Record Sport has twice reached out to potential new moneyman Stuart Gibson , attempting to ascertain if the COVID-19 crisis will have any impact on the timing of his investment or on the amount of cash he may be able or willing to pump in .
On both occasions a source close to Gibson 's business empire in the Far East declined to answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that right now " .

No one in their right mind would be ploughing millions into a football club which can not play football for the foreseeable future , not unless that person happened to be a philanthropic billionaire with wealth off the radar .
Gibson may well have given a commitment to follow through with his cash when the situation becomes more stable but there 's no way of knowing when that day might come .
That 's why King 's decision to head for the hills should provide Rangers supporters with serious pause for thought .
Understandably , these fans idolise King for all of his efforts to rescue their club from the mayhem that was unleashed upon it from the moment Craig Whyte 's pointy shoes first made it over the front door .
( Image : SNS Group )  The Rangers he leaves behind is unrecognisable in comparison to the basket case he took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run at what is arguably a moment of even greater concern , insisting rather flimsily that he ? can not continue to run the club from South Africa .
That just does n't cut it from a man who has been doing exactly that since the day he took control .
In fact King was social distancing himself from Rangers long before the rest of us even knew what it even meant .
Only when this crisis is over will his true legacy become clear .
It will be determined not by his previous deeds but by what happens next .
To that end , Rangers owe a huge debt of gratitude to those King has left holding the fort .
Until reinforcements arrive , men such as new interim chairman Douglas Park , deputy chairman John Bennett and other key investors Julian Wolhardt , George Letham , George Taylor and Barry Scott , will be left to dig deep in order to protect the club as well as safeguard their own investments .
King campaigned for office on a ticket of enormous promises , adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save his club .
Now that push has come to shove , those he leaves behind may have to shoulder that very burden .
