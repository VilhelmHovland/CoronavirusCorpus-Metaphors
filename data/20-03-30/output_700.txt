Renters and landlords in Michigan feel pain of coronavirus pandemic  Coronavirus put Anna and Bill Patterson out of work -- and behind on their rent .
They are worried about how they 'll care for their two daughters , who are now not in school because it 's closed , and how they 'd have a birthday party for the younger one , who on Sunday turned 10 .
To add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rivers Edge in Clinton Township , sent them a letter that Anna Patterson said felt somewhat threatening , saying that despite what they might have heard , they must continue to pay rent .
" We are in a situation that is stressful ! You know ? " Patterson told the Free Press .
" Then , we get this letter from them , and I 'm thinking , ' How dare them ? How dare them send this to people right when all this is going on .
' "  As the count of coronavirus cases grows daily -- 132 deaths and 5,486 cases as of Sunday -- Michiganders like the Pattersons are not just facing a public health crisis .
They are dealing with a financial one .
Nearly 130,000 workers in the state have filed for unemployment so far .
Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , and the Federal Housing Administration have barred evictions and foreclosures for 60 days and Congress passed a $2 .
relief and stimulus package , the largest ever in the nation 's history , to help .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of trying to make ends meet .
" Renters are particularly vulnerable to hardship , and the pandemic will increase that vulnerability , " the Urban Institute said in a policy report .
" Proactive , comprehensive action is needed quickly .
"  Landlords also are under stress  But it 's not just workers who are worried .
Businesses like Rivers Edge are concerned they wo n't afford the mortgage payments on the property they are renting .
Ron Weiss , the park 's owner , said he had no intention of intimidating the Pattersons or any of his tenants in the 500-home mobile park .
Weiss said he was merely trying to let tenants know that despite what they might have heard from other people or on TV , they still had to pay the rent , and he 'd work with them to do so .
" All we were doing was reaching out and saying , ' Look , we understand where you 're at .
Call us , we 'll help you any way we can .
' Period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been forgiven .
My mortgage is n't forgiving my payment .
"  In many ways , the struggles of both the Pattersons and Weiss highlight the tensions among public officials about how to keep people safe .
Social distancing , officials hope , is limiting the spread of the virus .
It 's also wrecking the economy .
Even some of the biggest landlords and lenders are trying to make accommodations , but also starting to signal problems .
Bedrock real estate , which is owned by Dan Gilbert and is downtown Detroit 's biggest landlord , said it would waive rent and parking fees during April and May , and some instances June , for some restaurant and retail tenants .
The next day , news outlets reported Gilbert 's Quicken Loans may be bracing for a cash crunch , warning that missed mortgage payments would require the company to come up with billions of dollars that it had n't planned on .
Virus pushing them over the edge  Anna Patterson , 46 , acknowledges that even before the stay-at-home order preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some financial hardship .
They already were on edge on not making ends meet .
Coronavirus is pushing them over it .

( Photo : Junfu Han , Detroit Free Press )  Patterson said her husband is a painting contractor and she works part-time as a cheerleading coach .
Neither job is needed under the stay-home order and therefore they have no income .
They also have no savings and no credit cards .
They also , in a panic , spent a bigger slice of their last paychecks -- about $300 -- on extra groceries just to be safe .
There was n't enough left for $518 rent , and there probably wo n't be enough next month .
Patterson also acknowledged she has been getting behind on rent each month for the past four months .
They 'd sign a promissory note , and before the next month 's rent was owed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the landlord eventually does try to evict them , Patterson said , it will be difficult to move or sell their double-wide mobile home , and she does n't know where their family would live , especially as the number of deaths from the coronavirus rises .
' Tenants are my livelihood '  Weiss said he does n't want to put anyone on the street , and it was n't his intention by sending the letter to his mobile home tenants to suggest that he would do that .
So far , he said , he has n't laid off any of his employees .
But , he also is n't sure how long he 'll be able to keep paying his mortgage if his tenants do n't pay him .
" Certainly , after three , four , five months , you have to pursue your legal remedies , " he said .
" Because they 're living there , and if they are not paying , using your water and sewer , you have to make a move legally .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitmer declaring that tenants and mobile homeowners must remain in their homes during the pandemic even if they are unable to stay current on their rent .
The order , which is in effect until April 17 , prevents any eviction-related proceedings until after the coronavirus emergency had passed .
" We have n't filed on anybody , " Weiss said , adding that he also is facing economic uncertainty .
" It does n't do me any good to throw somebody out .
Paying tenants are my livelihood .
"  The March 23 letter Rivers Edge sent Patterson began :  " We 'd like to take a moment to address the recent White House announcement regarding the suspension of evictions and foreclosures .
This announcement does not apply to multifamily housing and does not impact your current lease agreement .

We value your well-being as our resident and will do whatever we can to help .
"  Weiss said he sent tenants other notes since then and is letting his commercial mortgage holders know that he , too , soon may be facing some financial hardship .
" Everybody is on edge , " he said , referring to the financial situation Americans are now facing .
And then , on top of that , " you do n't know if you are going to get the virus -- or not .
