Religious leaders have the power to raise awareness and influence the behaviour and practices of the people , he added .
In his message the Governor says , " We all are aware that entire world is passing through an unprecedented time .
The pandemic COVID-19 is spreading its tentacles fast and wide throughout the world .
Entire India is under lockdown to contain its spread and outbreak .
Our state of Goa has also reported 3 positive cases of COVID-19 .
At this challenging time , I seek the support of Religious/Spiritual institutions and their leaders in dealing with the contagion .
Tackling this challenge requires mobilization of all stakeholders especially the religious and spiritual institutions to respond .
Governor Malik further stated that " I believe that the faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil societies .
They have to play a proactive role in addressing COVID-19 pandemic .
I am of the firm belief that in the time of uncertainty , religious leader 's ability to motivate the people and guide them to sail through the crisis would prove to be a great help to the society .
Religious leaders have the power to raise awareness and influence the behaviour and practices of the people .
Therefore I earnestly urge Religious/Spiritual institutions and their leaders to reach out to the people via social media and other online platforms and create awareness about hygiene practices , social distancing measures and various dos/don'ts for containing the spread of the corona virus diseases .
Religious leaders/spiritual Gurus have tremendous power to educate the people on COVID-19 .
They must appeal to the people to follow the government guidelines and directions with regard to COVID-19 in letter and spirit .
The Governor further stated that , " At this time when the entire county is under lockdown to break the chain of transmission of corona virus , the worst affected are migrants workers , daily wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beggars and poor elder people who live alone .
This testing time casts a duty on the religious institutions to feed the needy by running community kitchens .
These organisation , institution can also help in making arrangements for shelter to the stranded migrants and daily wage workers .
Emergency relief material should be provided to the needy persons .
Personal care material such as hand wash , hand sanitizers and masks should be distributed to them .
These organisations can also chip in by providing attendant and nursing care to the elderly people who are living alone during this lockdown period .
My appeal to you is to show kindness and compassion and help these less fortunate people in whatever way you can .
The only way to fight this pandemic is coming together and by collective action we can defeat COVID-19 .
Your contribution will help the State in a big way , the Governor concludes .
