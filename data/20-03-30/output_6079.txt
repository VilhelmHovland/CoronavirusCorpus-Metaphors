HAG ? T ? A , Guam -- A local community group seeks volunteers to make Personal Protective Equipment to be donated to Guam 's health care professionals , first responders , and others at high risk of contracting Covid-19 .
The group , PPE for Guam , particularly seeks volunteers with sewing experience , or any volunteer with a 3D printer .
In collaboration with Guam Memorial Hospital , Guam Regional Medical City , the Office of Civil Defense , local 3D-printing firm Gudwood , and the University of Guam , PPE for Guam recently developed do-it-yourself plans for sewn face masks and 3D-printed face shields that can be made at home , and which are preferred by local medical professionals .
These DIY PPE will be utilized should traditional PPE run out .
According to an article published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine , hospitals nationwide are already reporting a worrisome shortage of PPE , including masks and face shields .
The consequences can be dire :  In Italy , health care workers experienced high rates of infection and death partly because of inadequate access to PPE .
And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need far more respirators and surgical masks than are currently available .
" The local response has been inspiring , " said Allison Rutter , a local engineer and co-founder of the group .
" In two weeks , we 've developed multiple prototypes , tested them in local hospitals , and finalized preferred designs .
Now we 're looking to expand with more volunteers , " she added .
PPE for Guam 's designs are based on open-source solutions that were developed for the coronavirus pandemic and have already been implemented in other hospitals .
" With worldwide shortages of lifesaving protective gear , it is critical to be proactive , but it is also critical to produce reliable , high-quality safety equipment .
PPE for Guam has done a great job partnering health care professionals , engineers , and scientists to help guide this effort , and I encourage everyone to contribute in whatever way you can to their efforts to keep our community safe , " said Dr .
Dave Weingarten , chairman of the Department of Surgery , Guam Memorial Hospital .
PPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense to donate PPE to healthcare workers , first responders , and others at high risk of contracting Covid-19 .
" We truly appreciate the initiative and hard work from the volunteers at PPE for Guam in helping us fill critical PPE shortages experienced throughout the island and the nation .
Currently our priority of PPE fill is medical health professionals and first responders .
With this donation , we can start equipping support personnel who have been in the fight since day one and fulfilling outstanding requests for resources .
The effort here truly embodies a whole of the community approach to emergencies , " said Charles Esteves , administrator , Office of Civil Defense .
" We need to prepare for things getting much worse , " said Cyrus Luhr , co-founder of PPE for Guam .
The CDC recommends the use of emergency , homemade PPE as a last resort when traditional , commercial PPE is unavailable .
" If Guam experiences the same shortage of PPE that other places around the country are witnessing , the protective gear that volunteers make now may literally save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guam will also be contributing its expertise and 3D printers to the cause .
" It is great to see how our community is coming together through collaborations like this , " said UOG president Thomas Krise .
" Just last week , we were discussing how we can use our 3D printers to help provide much needed personal protective equipment to our frontline health care personnel .
And now we have another way that UOG is able to help in the response efforts .
