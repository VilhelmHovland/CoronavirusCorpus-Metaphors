" We know as jobs disappear rent payments do not .
that 's why we are taking action , " San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said at a press conference two weeks ago .
Now , a new website is designed to assist tenants and landlords in San Diego amid the city 's recently enacted eviction moratorium for those suffering economic hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic , the city announced Monday .
The site , created by the San Diego Housing Commission , provides information regarding the requirements for tenants to qualify for rent relief , which includes supplying landlords with proof of a substantial loss of income or proof tenants have incurred medical bills related to COVID-19 .
In turn , landlords can not evict someone for not paying rent due on or after March 12 .
However , it will not relieve a tenant of the requirement to pay rent or restrict a landlord from recovering rent at a future time .
Tenants have six months from March 25 , the day the moratorium ordinance was enacted by the San Diego City Council , to make any unpaid rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Diego will last until May 31 .
" Step one was putting the moratorium in place , " City Council President Georgette Gomez said .
" Step two is making sure residents and small businesses know what they need to do to be protected by it .
"  But just days before that dreaded rent payment Wednesday , California housing rights attorney Elena Popp said many people have n't read the fine print - the part of the ordinance that requires tenants to take action on or before rent is due .
" Renters are completely confused by these mish-mosh of laws , measures , policies .
Tenants in San Diego probably do not realize that right now they have two days to send a letter to their landlord saying ' I can not pay my rent for these COVID-19 related reasons , ' " said Popp .
