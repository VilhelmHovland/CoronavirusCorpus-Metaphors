" A cause greater than myself "  PH Health Workers and their struggle against COVID-19  They call it a war against an unseen and unpredictable enemy : the new coronavirus .
What is not invisible are Filipino health workers in the frontlines during this global pandemic -- exhausted , frustrated , terrified and dying .
Even so , they remain dedicated to saving lives .
These are their stories .
By Jeff Canoy , Raphael Bosano and Mike Navallo ABS-CBN News  The emergency-room doctor  It usually takes three cups of coffee , white mocha Americano -- piping hot with two pumps of syrup -- before she can start her work day .
These days , however , caffeine is of no use to Catherine .
Days ca n't begin when they do n't really end .
Since March 16 , she has had trouble remembering dates .
Work has n't stopped -- save for a few hours of stolen shut-eye in empty rooms .
Days and hours have bled into each other .
" I do n't even know anymore .
That 's how long I 've been living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke on the condition of anonymity , is an emergency physician in one of the biggest private hospitals in Metro Manila .
Since the new coronavirus reached the Philippines , the hospital 's emergency room ( ER ) has been filled to the rafters .
Doors have swung almost non-stop , gurneys roll in all directions , and nurses ' stations are swamped with patients suspected to have been infected by the virus .
" Our hospital is full .
And we can not turn down patients .
Ambulances come , they just dump patients or they just leave patients here at our ER , " she explains .
During her last shift alone , there were 11 critical patients rushed to the ER .
Five of them were intubated because of respiratory distress -- one of the potentially fatal symptoms of COVID-19 or the coronavirus disease .
The patients are n't going anywhere .
ERs are n't meant to be intensive care units ( ICU ) or even recovery rooms .
But the lack of available space in the hospital has forced the ER to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own .
"  " The fear now is that the ER is inundated with cases na kami na ' yong magiging ICU .
Na hindi trained ang tao .
I am not even trained in ICU care .
So we 're scared for that point na kami ang magha-handle ng everyone admitted and non-admitted .
"  The ER has been split into two sections : non-COVID cases and another one for those with respiratory cases .
The split meant even more work for the already limited manpower in the ER while resources continue to dwindle .
" You see , previously we can handle 500 patients in 24 hours .
But those patients , we were able to discharge , we were able to admit to the ICU or to the room .
Ngayon wala ng room .
Nandoon na lang sila sa ER .
Naiipon nang naiipon .
"  Exhaustion has taken on a new meaning for Catherine and her team .
Yet the long hours and the stress of managing a crowded emergency room are nothing compared to the fear of exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fear becomes more tangible as days go by .
On March 21 , three doctors from other hospitals in the metro were confirmed to have died from the coronavirus disease .
While Catherine is concerned about her own safety , she also worries about the rest of her team -- nurses , medical technicians and administrative clerks .
And then there are the security guards who are the first to welcome incoming patients and cleaners who keep the hospital , well , hospitable .
Because while the virus is dangerous , what could kill health workers are the lies patients tell them .
Some patients have deceived Catherine and her team , refusing to disclose medical and travel history at a time when the simple truth can be the best protection for both patient and health care worker .
" A lot of the patients lie and this has been happening since a long time ago .
Kahit na wala ' yong COVID , nagsisinungaling na talaga and I do n't know why .
Sometimes , I think it is the culture .
There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the time of coronavirus , there are just bad days and even worse days with no end in sight .
Groundhog days full of circles and loops and never a period for relief .
" We 're very much in despair .
Sometimes , we 'd just start crying but then let 's work again .
Everyday we pray that this stops soon .
We do n't know what to do anymore .
Kasi parang palala na siya nang palala , " she says .
For Catherine , there are moments when she just wants to quit and leave .
Yet the sight of her team -- working relentlessly in spite of the danger -- makes her stay .
" I have to show them that I 'm one with them because if they see that I 'm not coming anymore , they are not going to come also .
I can not abandon them .
Kami-kami na lang ' yung magtutulungan .
"  Catherine longs for a now distant past when she would have three cups of coffee before work begins .
Nowadays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Wide-awake but it still feels like a nightmare .
" I think all of us are scared pero you have to put that aside kasi if we are all scared , we ca n't do our job and we know na kailangan pa rin kami .
Because at the end of the day , iniisip namin , paano kung kamag-anak ko itong pasyente ? Sinong mag-aalaga kung aalis kami sa frontlines .
If not us , then who ? "  The Nurse  Every March 13 for the past 8 years , Emily and her family would gather in their home in Nueva Ecija to celebrate her late father 's birthday -- a simple gathering of loved ones over noodles , sweets and a birthday cake .
It 's a promise she made by her father 's bedside before she lost him to a heart attack in 2011 .
A promise she has kept since -- except this year .
Ever since the coronavirus disease pandemic broke out a few weeks ago , she made a deliberate decision to stay away .
Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals in Metro Manila , where more than a dozen patients have tested positive for the contagious disease .
( She has requested to conceal her real name and the hospital where she works .
)  Her work exposes her every day to the risk of contracting the virus .
And the thought that she could carry it with her when she goes home is simply too much to bear .
Soon after the Department of Health confirmed her hospital 's first positive COVID-19 case , the staff who handled the patient went into self-quarantine .
Those who felt they had symptoms -- cough , colds , backpain , diarrhea -- had themselves checked at the emergency room and admitted to the hospital .
They were tested and all of them were cleared .
A few weeks later , things returned to normal -- or at least , what is considered normal during these times .
Her concern grew upon learning that Metro Manila has been placed under community quarantine with the ensuing mad rush of passengers heading home to their provinces before the government suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Her concern is not unwarranted .
She says some hospitals in her province turn away patients with fever , cough and colds without even assessing them , referring them instead to larger tertiary hospitals a few kilometers away who can offer specialized medical services .
No medicine has been approved , so far , for the disease and a vaccine is still in the works .
And there 's no telling when the COVID-19 crisis in the Philippines will reach its peak and how much longer it 'll stay .
It 's a brutal time for nurses across the country .
Not that it was n't before .
For all the work they do and the hazards they face , nurses in the country only earn around P20,000 monthly on average -- even lower for some private hospitals in the provinces .
In the United States , the average monthly salary of a nurse is equivalent to P200,000 .
The COVID-19 crisis may have added more hours but the pay has n't changed .
It has n't stopped them , however .
Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so they can get to work .
Even without public transportation or their own private vehicles , nurses find a way back into their scrubs .
For all her resolve to stay and work , Emily acknowledges there are moments when she prays that she ca n't help but shed a tear for both her colleagues and patients .
Emily longs for the day when all of this will be over , when she could go home whenever she wants to and enjoy her mother 's halabos na alimasag .
A serving of steamed crabs , a taste of home and a smack of normalcy .
She took care of her father when he was bed-ridden , a little more than a year before he died .
She wants to be there too , for the rest of the family .
But for now , the only way to keep them safe is to stay away .
The nephrologist  Look , up in the sky ! It 's a bird ! It 's a plane ! It 's Superman !  Dr .
Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Growing up in the 80s , he went on vicarious adventures through afternoon animation with the DC superhero : solving crime , defeating the bad guys and saving lives .
A hero in times of crisis .
Someone you can depend on .
That was his childhood fascination .
These days , Frederick is living the dream .
Most recently , many have actually called him a hero .
He is one of thousands of frontline medical workers battling a nefarious new villain : the coronavirus .
Yet Frederick will be the first to admit that he 's no Superman .
He has no special powers , unless his expertise as a kidney specialist counts .
For him , it 's just about doing his job and making good on his word -- even as fear hangs heavily in the air .
Yet the kid in Frederick still finds a certain sense of anticipation when his daily " costume " comes on : respirator masks , gloves , surgical gowns and eye gear .
His colleagues are all wearing the same personal protective equipment or PPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says .
They would often take the time to take a photo of the team -- in hero poses -- to document how strange these times are .
It does n't help that some patients either lie or refuse to disclose important , live-saving information .
In one case , Frederick was called in to check on an elderly patient who had respiratory distress .
He had his suspicion that the case was COVID-related , yet the patient was n't upfront about his travel history .
A few days later , test results proved that the patient was indeed infected by coronavirus .
Frederick considers himself and his team " lucky " when it comes to having enough supply of PPE .
Not all hospitals in the metro have that " luxury " -- a strange description for something that should be a basic requirement .
On social media , health workers have posted photos of creative ways they have dealt with the lack of equipment .
Instead of masks , some are wearing face shields meant for industrial work .
Others have plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes .
There are some with black trash bags on instead of surgical gowns .
Frederick knows how severely limited PPEs are in hospitals these days , which is why he maximizes each chance he gets to suit up .
At a time when optimism is scarce , the strength to dig deep is a feat of its own .
Maybe that 's his superpower .
The chief  Francisco Duque III is n't from the military , but he carries himself like a soldier .
He lives for rules and follows a routine so rigid that for others , it comes off as almost robotic .
No one sees the 63-year-old health secretary slouch .
His posture is always on point -- chest out , shoulders straight , mechanical and calculated movements .
Without fail , at exactly five o'clock in the morning on weekdays , Duque is already in his uniform : a short-sleeved office barong .
He has very specific preferences .
Visit his office in Manila and you 'll be greeted with a warning in big bold letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a thing for pungent scents .
Duque would rather have a dim room .
He does n't like bright lights .
But recent weeks have forced the secretary out of his comfort zone .
His world has completely been upended by the coronavirus pandemic .
He 's no longer in his barong .
Instead , a plain shirt and walking shorts .
He 's out of the office .
Far from his desk with the neatly piled documents and the sign at his door .
After a colleague at the health department tested positive for the coronavirus , the good doctor was forced to stay home for quarantine .
In the past few weeks , Duque has been seen and heard all over the media ; first confirming that the dreaded new coronavirus has indeed made its way to the Philippines .
And then assuring the public that they are working hard to prevent it from spreading further .
But just as the public was already anticipating the numbers to surge , several weeks passed when the Department of Health , brimming with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they encouraged the public to undergo self-quarantine especially if they have been outside the country .
The new coronavirus does not respect borders .
It does not recognize social status .
Duque 's closest encounter with the virus was a foot away , during a meeting attended by one of the department 's directors .
And the first high-ranking health official to test positive for COVID-19 .
It never crossed his mind that he would need to place himself under the same safety procedure .
But as health chief , he knows he ca n't show weakness .
He 's not allowed to show fear .
" Of course , there was a bit of concern because I am a person with medical problems like asthma and hypertension .
But that 's about it .
I just thought I needed to do what I needed to do , which was to seek the advice of my team at the DOH , " he says .
There is nothing easy about being placed under quarantine .
Many Filipinos know this all too well by now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's difficult because you have to isolate yourself .
You isolate yourself from your family members .
They have to be strict observers of physical distancing .
It 's so difficult .
But I have to practice what I preach .
We have to walk the talk so to speak .
I get to see my wife , pero naka-mask kami pareho .
Mayroong distancing , " he says .
At a time when the entire country is fighting a deadly virus , a public servant 's last thoughts should really be about himself .
Four days into quarantine and with small bouts of cough , Duque says that learning of the dire conditions of his " soldiers " at the frontlines is a bitter pill to swallow .
Social media has erupted with clamors to aid tired and ailing healthcare workers .
Many of them face their own battles .
But they choose to do what they do .
Amid the scorching heat , they endure walks that stretch kilometers .
They carry the pressure to keep their hospitals up and running , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hold .
At home , in his bedroom , Duque continues to monitor the worsening situation .
" There is a lot I need to orchestrate .
The arrival of the test kits , the Bureau of Customs releases these immediately because of the FDA Food and Drug Administration .
Clearance is here .
It even comes to a point that I have to personally ensure that the cold chain of these enzymes are delivered from the RITM Research Institute for Tropical Medicine to the different laboratories , " he says .
Like a general to his lieutenants , Duque is determined to guide them towards victory .
His only problem : no one ever anticipated the virus to be this infectious .
As the days progress , his soldiers become more and more ill-equipped in the medical battlefield .
" Who does n't want to provide a complete set of PPEs ? We are trying our best to really get us many PPEs as we could possibly get .
But all the manufacturing companies did not expect this , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in by April 3 .
At hindi pa nga ' yon isang bagsakan .
Every 15 days they will deliver precisely because of the very limited supply in the global supply chain .
"  " You have very many poignant stories about doctors , healthcare workers who put their lives on the line in the service of their fellow men .
In doing so , they have been infected and some have lost their lives , " he says .
Reports are sent to Duque 's home office every day .
The challenge of an enhanced community quarantine .
Testing capabilities .
The controversies surrounding it .
More infections .
Deaths .
The reports never stop .
The numbers only grow .
But while fatalities remain faceless , the pain becomes too much to bear when you learn that one 's death happened in the course of performing a sworn duty .
" I have been told of a fellow , a doctor , has died .
Siya ' yong only 34 years old .
I really can not put into words my sympathy .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  And contrary to how he carries himself in high-level meetings , in the confines of his abode , he finally admits one thing : he is tired .
" I pray .
And I always wish that sooner rather than later , this whole thing will end so that the suffering of the world is stopped .
This is a global phenomenon , you know .
Nobody anticipated this .
No one can ever anticipate something of this magnitude would even happen , " he says .
" I tell myself that I need to be strong for the nation .
I need to be strong for our people .
I take a deep breath every now and then .
"  At 10 in the evening of every day , before he sleeps , Duque looks back on the day that 's passed .
If there 's anything that leaves him in awe , it 's not the numbers which grow exponentially each day ; it 's the healthcare workers .
" Alam ko mahirap ' yung kanilang dinadaanan .
Alam ko malaki ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn to serve .
They are living heroes .
Sterling .
Exemplars of a dedicated and committed public service that they continue to manifest even in the most difficult and trying times , " he says .
" We will acknowledge them in due time for the heroic deeds .
"  The general wants victory in this war .
When that will happen , he ca n't say just yet .
The fallen  March 21 .
It was Annie 's " rest day " .
A rare one in a time of unrest .
Whenever she 's off duty from her hospital work in the province , Annie ( who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity ) mostly spends her time tinkering with her phone .
A day that was supposed to be no different .
She read up on the COVID-19 crisis that has gripped the whole world .
Scrolling on social media timelines , browsing news articles and clicking on memes her friends have posted .
Then , all of a sudden , she stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backdrop .
Then another one .
One after the other .
They parted ways after med school .
But their friendship was never lost .
Annie and PH200 would still cross paths in medical conventions , and even quiz bees .
They would keep exchanging messages even as simple as to say hello .
Notifications of " Hi ! Kumusta na ? " would often pop up on her screen .
In 2018 , they reunited during their pre-fellowship in one of the government specialty hospitals in Quezon City .
For two weeks , they were almost inseparable and bonded over their shared dream of becoming cardiologists .
" We have the same journey .
In the future , sabi namin sa isa't isa , we 'll both be cardiologists .
We 'll help the people , " she says .
PH200 was one who never gave up easily .
Coming from a middle-class family , he supported his own education and earned his medical degree from scholarships .
He was always at the top of his class .
While they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Annie and PH200 remained in touch .
As incoming juniors , they were just one step closer to their dreams .
Then , the virus happened and those dreams were dashed .
Annie is graduating from her fellowship next year .
Alone .
The death of a close friend is gut-wrenching enough .
But a death from COVID-19 is even more unbearable .
There are n't any bodies to say goodbye to .
Those who die from the disease are cremated immediately to kill the virus that can still potentially infect others .
For Annie , all she can hold onto is the image of her friend : kind-hearted , calm and approachable .
Her gentle giant .
" Kanina , I saw the pictures posted by my batchmates na parang nu'ng nakita ko siya , it seems as if he 's not yet gone , " she says .
PH200 's journey may have been cut short .
Annie says she is extremely blessed to have been part of it .
As many health workers continue to risk their lives to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PH200 .
Annie , a frontliner herself , was praying PH200 would be the " poster boy " of a successful battle against COVID-19 .
" Iniisip namin na sana makayanan niya .
Lahat kami nagkakasakit but usually nakakayanan naman namin .
So we were all expecting he would recover .
Kaming mga kaibigan niya , mga kaklase niya are thinking he has to recover kasi if he does , knowing na critical na siya , there will be hope .
Ibig sabihin malalagpasan ng mga taong may sakit ang COVID , " she says .
" Siguro even when this pandemic ends , we would just have to be more careful , lalo na sa mga airborne and droplet infections .
You will see sa state ng kahit sino sa amin , we 're very vulnerable .
It could happen to anyone of us .
"  March 22 .
Annie received news of another death of a healthcare worker .
As the days drag on , those like Annie are tempted to turn their backs and walk away .
But how can they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice in the name of public service ?  Forging bravely on at the frontlines will surely be excruciating in the coming months .
But for Annie , it 's a burden she must carry .
The cleaner  There was hardly enough time for Marissa to prepare her 11-year-old son how to survive on his own .
It was the eve before the lockdown .
In a matter of hours , Luzon -- an island that 's home to almost half of the Philippines ' population of 109 million people -- will grind to a halt as the government ramps up efforts to stop the rapid spread of the coronavirus .
With residents confined to their own homes , businesses closed , and mass public transportation suspended , the hospital Marissa works for advised them to stay in the hospital rather than risk walking out on the streets every day .
That meant that she only had a few hours to grab some clothes and talk to her son .
As difficult as it was , Marissa had little choice but to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family .
Marissa took comfort at the thought she could rely on her son .
She was supposed to take him to the province so relatives could take care of him while she worked .
She had already sent her daughter there earlier .
But her son wanted to stay in Manila for his graduation scheduled at the end of the month .
But then the lockdown happened .
No one enters , no one leaves the nation 's capital region .
And with large gatherings banned , there 's no graduation .
No march on stage so parents can beam with pride and see the fruits of their children 's hard work .
Marissa 's work as a cleaner -- or housekeeper as they are called in her hospital -- puts her at the frontline against a virus that nobody fully understands just yet .
In her case , she is assigned to the area where persons suspected of having contracted the virus are brought to be examined and assessed by the doctors .
Patients do n't stay long though , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high volume of people coming in and out translates to as many times she would have to change the bedsheets , scrub the floor and disinfect all surfaces .
