The U .
government ramped up its response to COVID-19 Monday , asking citizens to cut all unnecessary contact with other people , after a British research team warned its earlier strategy would lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths .
But those researchers also gave a troubling warning for countries around the world implementing lockdown measures : in order to be effective , they would need to last 12 to 18 months .
On Monday evening , Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced what many saw as an abrupt shift in his government 's strategy for combating the new coronavirus .
Where before authorities told Brits to continue living more or less as normal and to self-isolate for a week if they displayed symptoms , the entire population is now asked to stop seeing friends and family , avoid public spaces like pubs and restaurants , and self-isolate for 14 days if anyone in their home has a cough or a fever .
A member of the White House task force also cited modeling by British researchers , apparently the Imperial report , as the U .
announced a strengthening of its own social distancing rules on Monday .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed in Italy , France and Spain , Johnson 's announcement brought the U .
closer in line with the international coronavirus response after a week in which the country seemed to be opting for a unique strategy .
On Friday , the government 's chief scientific adviser said that by not immediately introducing restrictions on travel and socializing , the virus would be allowed to circulate among healthier members of the population ; its impact would be reduced by isolating those with symptoms , allowing the British population to develop some " herd immunity .
" That sparked a backlash from some immunologists and epidemiologists , who argued the strategy would have " severe " consequences .

Those concerns were born out in new modeling on different social distancing approaches in both the U .
and the U .
, published Monday by London 's Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team , which advises the British government .
In both countries , the scientists found that the kinds of limited social distancing that the U .
had been implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care systems ' maximum capacities " many times over .
" In the U .
, roughly 250,000 people would die from the virus .
In the U .
, the figure would be between 1 .
and 1 .
million .
The report concludes that a " suppression " approach , which includes strict social distancing for everyone and quarantining for households with victims of the virus , " is the only viable strategy at the current time .
" That 's the approach that China and a growing crowd of European countries are already taking .

It " will need to be maintained -- at least intermittently -- for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population , or until a vaccine becomes available .
In the case of COVID-19 , it will be at least 12-18 months before a vaccine is available .

Experts say governments are only now beginning to acknowledge the length of time needed for lockdown measures to work .
" This has been very unspoken about in countries like Italy for example , " says Elisabetta Gropelli , a virologist and lecturer in global health at St .
George 's University of London .
" Once you start isolation , how do you decide when to stop ? Once you go in , when can you come out ? "  So far , many of the social distancing measures that countries have announced are slated for an initial period of several weeks .
In Italy , schools and universities will be closed and travel without a special permit will be banned until April 3 .
In the Netherlands , schools , restaurants and gyms are all closed until April 6 .
The president of the European Union is proposing a 30-day ban on non-essential travel into the bloc .
It is highly likely that at least some of these measures will be extended .
" People should be thinking of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes , it may be longer , " the U .
's chief medical officer said of his country 's new restrictions .
In China , where the coronavirus began in late December , strict quarantine measures across cities have allowed the country to dramatically reduce the spread , with the number of new daily cases falling from over 3,000 in February to just 16 on Monday .
But health officials fear that once most people begin to leave their homes and start mixing as normal , the virus will quickly begin to spread again .
The Imperial report warns that if " intensive " strategies aimed at suppression are not maintained in the U .
and the U .
, " transmission will rapidly rebound , potentially producing an epidemic comparable in scale to what would have been seen had no interventions been adopted .
" The report 's authors say that social distancing measures could be relaxed for short periods of time but would need to be reintroduced " if or when case numbers rebound .
"  Nevertheless , there 's reason to hope that the measures wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The report says that suppression strategies could evolve over time if the virus can be controlled .
For example , if a country manages to reduce the spread of the virus and the caseload with lockdown measures , it could set up sophisticated contact tracing and quarantine measures , like those currently being used in South Korea , where more than 270,000 people have been tested .
South Korea , which in early March had the worst outbreak outside of China , has managed to slow the rate of new infections without introducing lockdown-style measures .
Instead , the country carried out testing on a massive scale and aggressively traced patients ' contacts by tracking their movements through their credit card transactions and cell phone use -- as well as widespread surveillance cameras -- enabling them to isolate those who were at risk .
A transparent public information campaign also helped people to stay away from high risk neighborhoods and take other action to protect themselves .
Aris Katzourakis , a Professor of Evolution and Genomics at the University of Oxford , says that aggressive social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U .
and other countries to eventually implement high-tech tracking and surveillance measures .
First , though , he says countries would need to slow the spread of the virus , reducing the basic reproductive number of the pandemic -- the number of people that each person who has the virus will infect -- from its current estimated average of between 2 and 2 .
down to just 1 .
" Once you get things under control , with a lot of targeted surveillance , there are ways of locally relaxing restrictions and returning to some level of activity , " Katzourakis says .
" But it will never be the same until there is a cure , or a vaccine .
' Returning to normal ' simply is n't something we should expect to see for a very , very long time .
