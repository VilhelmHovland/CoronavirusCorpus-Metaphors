A decision to limit access to medication while the country is in lockdown is being welcomed by the Pharmacy Council .
On Thursday , director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield announced that pharmacists were required to limit the dispensation of all funded pharmaceuticals to one month 's supply , or three months ' supply for oral contraceptives .
