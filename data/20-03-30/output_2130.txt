The Cost of Ventilators Just Skyrocketed -- And New York Needs Thousands More  New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo says the price of ventilators has soared from less than $20,000 to more than $50,000 .
The price of ventilators has skyrocketed from less than $20,000 to more than $50,000 , New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo said Monday , thanks to states and the federal government 's furious competition to secure as many of the life-saving devices as possible .
Cuomo spoke from the sprawling Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan , which has been transformed into a field hospital as the scope of the coronavirus pandemic grows .
New York state , the epicenter of the U .
outbreak , now has more than 66,000 coronavirus cases , the governor said .
Cuomo said last week that New York state has roughly 12,000 ventilators , but will likely need as many as 40,000 at the projected height of the pandemic .
But since no state will remain untouched by the virus , both states and the federal government are now jockeying for ventilators .
And that 's pushing prices up .
" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities looking to buy the same exact materials basically from the same place , which is China , ironically enough , " Cuomo said .
" The ventilators are now over $50,000 , if you can find them , " he added .
" The ventilators did n't change that much in two weeks .
The prices went up because literally we are driving the prices up .
But we need to give our front line , our health care professionals , the supplies they need .
And we need to do it now .
"  As of Monday early afternoon , more than 1,200 people have now died of COVID-19 -- up from 965 on Sunday .
Nearly 10,000 are currently hospitalized .
The USNS Comfort , a Navy hospital ship , also sailed into New York Harbor Monday .
Like Javits , the ship will be responsible for handling patients who do not have COVID-19 but can no longer find treatment in any of New York 's traditional hospitals , which have been overwhelmed by the onslaught of the coronavirus .
