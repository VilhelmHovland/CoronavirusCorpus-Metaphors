J&amp;J and Abbott announce potential coronavirus vaccine and rapid test  Two US healthcare companies have brought hope in the race to fight coronavirus , with Johnson &amp; Johnson announcing a potential vaccine that could be available early next year and Abbott Laboratories launching a rapid test .
Johnson &amp; Johnson said it had discovered a potential vaccine candidate and was teaming up with the US government to invest $1bn in its development , expecting to start testing in humans by September .
Shares in the world 's largest healthcare company rose 5 .
per cent to $130 .
Abbott is launching a test that can take as little as five minutes and can be run on a portable machine the size of a toaster .
Shares in Abbott jumped 8 .
per cent to $81 .
US politicians have worried that pharmaceutical companies could profit off the crisis while making vaccines and drugs unaffordable for many .
But J&amp;J promised on Monday that the vaccine would be sold on a " not-for-profit " basis during the pandemic .
Alex Gorsky , chairman and chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson said the company feels a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , using its scientific expertise , scale and financial strength .
" The world is facing an urgent public health crisis and we are committed to doing our part to make a Covid-19 vaccine available and affordable globally as quickly as possible , " he said .
Troubles with tests have been blamed for a sluggish response to the outbreak in many countries .
Abbott 's new diagnostic test for Covid-19 could cut the wait for results down to as little as five minutes for a positive result and 13 minutes for a negative one .
The test runs on the company 's portable platform , which is the most widely available point-of-care molecular testing device in the US .
The test will start to be distributed to healthcare providers , such as doctor 's offices , urgent care clinics and emergency departments , this week .
J&amp;J has been hunting for a vaccine candidate for Covid-19 since January .
If the early trials go well , the company said the vaccine could be available by early 2021 to be used under an emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Robert B .
Ford , president of Abbott , said the device would help clinicians test " outside of the traditional walls of a hospital in outbreak hotspots " .
As well as the expansion of its partnership with the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , known as Barda , on research and development , J&amp;J is investing to rapidly scale its manufacturing capabilities , preparing to produce a billion doses by the end of 2021 .
But while J&amp;J has landed on a vaccine candidate far more quickly than usual , it is still behind Boston-based biotech Moderna .
Moderna 's candidate was ready more than a month ago and entered human testing in March , six months earlier than J&amp;J plans for its potential vaccine .
The announcements came as three top scientific institutions received new funding to embark on trials to test whether existing drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can be used to prevent coronavirus infections , in the first investments made by the Covid-19 therapeutics accelerator , funded by the Wellcome Trust , the Gates Foundation and Mastercard .
