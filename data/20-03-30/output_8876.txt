Simmons is a game-changer on defense , but a tackle might be the safe bet  The Giants and GM Dave Gettleman really are sitting pretty at No .
4 overall in the 2020 NFL Draft .
They do n't need to draft a quarterback after doing so last year at No .
And with a few more holes to fill , any top prospect will be an immediate help next season and more to come after that .
But what truly is the right pick here ?  Of course , Gettleman could easily trade down and still get a solid prospect while collecting draft capital .
Some believe that he should focus on that in the first place .
In this scenario , though , let 's go with what experts believe he 'd do at No .
4 , and that is an offensive tackle .
Blake Martinez making the best of his unique introduction to the Giants  Martinez has only interacted with his new coaches virtually  New Giants inside linebacker Blake Martinez would obviously love to be in East Rutherford , signing the new $30 .
million contract he agreed to with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the introductions to the front office and coaches , Martinez had to do everything virtually -- just like his introduction to the New York media on Monday .
Martinez joined a conference call to explain that he had to talk to new head coach Joe Judge and a familiar face in defensive coordinator Patrick Graham over the phone .
This is the first time Martinez has ever done anything like this being that it is his first time being a free agent and joining a new team after four years in Green Bay .

" We 're doing everything possible to get through this , " Manning told the New York Post 's Steve Serby in a Q&amp;A .
" We 're taking the right steps , and obviously , this is an uncertain time .
But , I think this country , and the Northeast and New Jersey and New York , are resilient and we 're tough and we kind of find a way to fight through things .

CB James Bradberry : Giants ' came out of nowhere and made an offer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blue  By Alex Smith Mar 27 4:44PM  Share :  Through the first wave of free agency , Giants general manager Dave Gettleman demonstrated he was willing to spend to improve Big Blue 's defense .
The biggest addition to the group is cornerback James Bradberry , who signed a lthree-year , $45 million deal with nearly $32 million of that money guaranteed .
Bradberry spoke via a conference call on Friday afternoon , making his first public comments since being signed as the key addition to the Giants ' secondary .
The former Panther said he was a bit surprised when the Giants ' offer came in , but he 's ready to be a leader in a very young Giants DB room .

" I just did not imagine him leaving , them letting him go and him going somewhere else , just from my experience .
But for him to have had all the success , do everything he 'd done in New England and did it with one organization , I guess you just kind of wonder what was the reasoning ? I do n't know if he felt unappreciated , or just wanted to try something different , but was surprised that this went down .
"  But while Brady is gone from New England and the team currently has only quarterbacks who profile as backups on its roster , Manning does n't think Bill Belichick and the Pats ' reign of Kings of the AFC East is necessarily over .
Dave Gettleman stunned the NFL back on April 20 , 2016 when he did what many thought was unthinkable .
He had an All-Pro cornerback , generally considered one of the best in the NFL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowl 50 .
And he had him locked up for the next season with the franchise tag .
Then , he pulled that tag right out from under Josh Norman 's feet .
Gettleman 's decision to rescind the franchise tag that day was bold , bizarre , and almost universally criticized .
But from Gettleman 's view , as the Carolina Panthers general manager , it was a responsible and necessary thing to do .
Defense was a high priority , with numerous holes filled  Here 's a player-by-player report card for the Giants ' free agent signings so far  CB James Bradberry ( three years , $45 million , $31 .
million guaranteed )  The Giants needed big-time help at this spot after dumping Janoris Jenkins in December , and they got arguably the second-best corner on the market at a somewhat reasonable price .
Bradberry is big ( 6-foot-1 , 212 pounds ) , fast ( 4 .
40-yard dash ) , and he 'll be a big help for an otherwise young secondary that includes last year 's first-rounder DeAndre Baker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " big " money , it had to be either at corner or pass-rusher , and once most of the top pass-rushers were tagged , they wisely got aggressive here .
According to a report from NFL Network 's Mike Garafolo , former Big Blue receiver Cody Latimer has agreed to a deal with the Washington Redskins .
Latimer , 27 , spent the last two seasons with the Giants , totaling 35 catches for 490 yards and three touchdowns .
He also returned 29 kicks for the Giants over those two seasons , averaging 23 .

Giants three-round 2020 NFL Mock Draft : Dave Gettleman targets one position with his top picks  Sources and scouts give clarity on Gettleman 's desires in the draft  The Giants have 10 draft picks , thanks to the three compensatory picks they earned , but only three of those will come in the first two days of the 2020 NFL Draft .
For a team with many needs still to fill , it puts a premium on those selections in the first three rounds .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still hard to know exactly what the Giants will do and how the draft will shake out .
But here 's an early projection , based on the team 's needs , what sources have said about players they might like , and what scouts have said about the value of certain players in the draft .
How the current RB market could impact Saquon Barkley 's next Giants deal  Look what happened to Derrick Henry and Todd Gurley  It 's always fun to watch how the free agent market materializes over time , but that 's from an outside perspective .
As a player , it 's a little more nerve-racking .
Some players are still out there on the market , and at this moment , they 're likely watching their expected price tag drop with most players already joining new teams .
That includes DE Jadeveon Clowney , who is n't expected at this point to hit his $22-23 million , but he 'll remain patient .
Giants sign XFL DB Dravon Askew-Henry to two-year deal  Askew-Henry played for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with NFL teams , and the Giants took advantage of that by signing DB Dravon Askew-Henry to a two-year deal , per NFL Network 's Ian Rapoport .
Askew-Henry played for the New York Guardians , so he already knows what it 's like to play at MetLife Stadium .
And clearly he did enough for the Giants to believe he can crack the 53-man roster next season .
The former West Virginia Mountaineer is the cousin of legendary CB Darrelle Revis , and Rapoport added that he should compete for the nickel cornerback role that Corey Ballentine is currently slated for .
Quarterbacks have always been the key to whether the Giants will be able to trade down in the first round of the NFL Draft , and whether any offers will even be tempting .
Teams without a franchise quarterback can get desperate .
That 's why quarterbacks always make the prices go way up .
This year , there are three generally considered to be at the top of the class , but only one team ahead of the Giants -- the Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one .
And with the quarterback-needy Miami Dolphins positioned right behind the Giants at No .

Giants sign free agent RB Dion Lewis to one-year deal  Lewis is a versatile back that reunites with Joe Judge  Giants head coach Joe Judge reunites with another familiar face in RB Dion Lewis , who signed a one-year deal to join Big Blue , SNY 's Ralph Vacchiano confirmed on Monday .
The Giants were predicted to be done spending considering they had about $15 .
million in cap room left , per Over The Cap .
But Lewis was out on the market after the Titans released him , and Judge took the chance to add a versatile running back behind Saquon Barkley .
Lewis has been backing up Derrick Henry for the past two seasons , totaling 726 yards over that span .
But getting just 54 rushing attempts and 25 receptions in 16 games last season , Lewis was n't a necessity to bring back for Tennessee .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing him to a one-year year deal , SNY 's Ralph Vacchiano confirmed on Monday .
Coleman was slated to be a solid depth receiver for the Giants last season , but he tore his ACL before it began .
He made a good impression in the return game with Big Blue in 2018 , where he also had five receptions for 71 yards in his eight games played .
The 25-year-old is a former first-round pick by the Browns back in 2016 , but he has yet to live up to that status .
He 's had trouble with drops and learning his assignments , but New York liked what they saw two seasons ago enough to bring him back under new head coach Joe Judge .
' I feel comfortable with that playbook after doing it for two years already '  When reports surfaced that veteran tackle Cam Fleming signed a one-year deal with the Giants in free agency , it simply made sense .
The Giants needed a new right tackle with Mike Remmers gone , Fleming knows three coaches on staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gettleman .
So Fleming joined Big Blue , a rival of his last team in the Dallas Cowboys , at $4 million for next season .
And the 27-year-old is now slated to take over that right tackle role -- a starting job he 's been looking for since he broke into the league with the Patriots back in 2014 .
The Giants could still use a safety , center and others  In some ways , Dave Gettleman went for quantity over quality during his free-agent shopping spree last week .
For the most part , instead of getting the most expensive players on the market , he spread his money out so he could fill some of the Giants ' many needs .
And he certainly did .
He filled a big hole at cornerback , two at linebacker , and added a right tackle , all while also finding a backup quarterback , a special teams ace , and a blocking tight end .
He also re-signed his kicker , the Giants ' best special teamer , and -- though not everyone loves this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full year out of Leonard Williams after his controversial trade .
In the process , Gettleman has used almost all of the Giants ' $72 .
million in cap space .
The exact number is hard to figure until the details of all the contracts are known , but he seems to have only about $7 million left based on the contracts and contract numbers SNY has obtained .
He 'll actually need to create some more space with either cuts or contract restructures to sign the Giants ' draft picks and keep enough money as an in-season reserve .

Losing Remmers should not come as much of a shock for Giants fans , as it was likely even before the start of free agency that Remmers would be calling somewhere else home in 2020 .
After the Giants signed Cam Fleming earlier this week , the possibility of Remmers coming back became minuscule .

" Tennessee is a first-class program and will continue to rise under Coach Pruitt 's and Coach Fulmer 's leadership , " Fitzgerald wrote .
" I will be returning to the NFL and joining the New York Giants .

Why would the Giants be looking in the quarterbacks market with Daniel Jones aboard ? Well , every starting quarterback needs a good backup , people .
The Giants did pick up the 2020 option for journeyman Alex Tanney , who has a $950,000 salary this season .
However , it 's non-guaranteed , meaning GM Dave Gettleman could easily cut him if he finds a better backup to put in place .
Breaking down how Dave Gettleman already spent most of his room  When it comes to NFL free agency , $72 million sure ai n't what it used to be .
All it took was 36 hours , a handful of players , and one moderate splash into the free-agent pool , and the Giants managed to use up just about all of their available space under the $198 .
million salary cap .
They began with $72 .
million in room , according to OverTheCap .
And based on contract figures provided to SNY by multiple NFL sources , the Giants have used approximately $62 .
million so far .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
And considering GM Dave Gettleman had spoken of leaving a $20 million " cushion " for draft picks , mid-season replacements and possibly in-season contract extensions , it means the Giants ' foray into free agency is basically done .
In an expected move , the Giants decided not to exercise the 2020 club option for veteran S Antoine Bethea , SNY 's Ralph Vacchiano confirmed on Wednesday .
The Giants have until 4 p .
when the new league year officially kicks off to do so .
By declining the option , the Giants are adding $2 .
million to their cap space , which is sitting at just under $17 million right now after all the signings .
Bethea had a solid season with 110 tackles , one interception , six passes defended and two fumble recoveries .
However , at age 36 next season and being someone former defensive coordinator James Bettcher wanted after playing with the Cardinals , the Giants are moving in a different direction .
Giants GM Dave Gettleman playing it smart with his free agent signings  All signees have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Dave Gettleman has n't done a cannonball into the free-agent pool .
He has n't thrown around the real big , headline-grabbing money ( yet ) .
He has n't badly overspent to fill a need .
What he 's done , in fact , is the opposite of how the Giants approached free agency in 2016 , the last time they had tons of cap room to buy new players .
He 's spent sensibly , found bargains , and has n't weighed the team down with long , expensive contracts .
Giants bring back special teamer Cody Core on two-year deal  Core is very valuable on special teams and as WR depth  Giants new head coach Joe Judge knows valuable special teamers when he sees one , so it 's no surprise the Giants have agreed to bring back WR Cody Core for the next two seasons , SNY 's Ralph Vacchiano confirmed .

He played in all 16 games , but in a limited role that saw just one sack and 23 tackles come his way .
But in a larger role in 2018 ( seven starts in 16 games ) , Fackrell tallied 10 .

Former Packers linebacker Blake Martinez has agreed to a three-year , $30 million contract with the Giants , and confirmed that when he retweeted NFL Network 's Mike Garofalo .
SNY 's Ralph Vacchiano has the details being $19 million guaranteed with $22 .

It will be $14 million this season .

All other teams would be allowed to begin on April 20 .
Instead , the league will " continue to follow the guidance of medical and public helth professionals , " and at the moment the best option is to keep players and personnel away from each other and continue to reassess the situation as the pandemic changes .

It sounds like that may be about to change .
The Giants have made it known they are very serious about upgrading at linebacker , and they 're willing to spend ( to a point ) to do it , multiple NFL sources told SNY on Monday .
They had expressed some level of interest in many of the top linebackers on the free agent market -- particularly the inside linebackers .
And they were shopping around outside linebackers , too .

After franchise tags have been handed out to players like Shaq Barrett and Arik Armstead as well as Yannick Ngakoue currently in a sign-and-trade situation with the Jaguars , Clowney is the top pass-rusher on the market .
And he 'll be paid like it , with SNY 's Ralph Vacchiano hearing from a source that he is going to look for a contract worth $22-23 milion per year .
With most of the country on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic , the NFL plans to proceed with the draft from April 23-25 in Las Vegas .
But things will not go on the way they normally do .
The league announced Monday that the draft will be televised but that all public NFL Draft events in Las Vegas have been canceled .

Aldrick Rosas took a step back last year , following his first Pro Bowl season in 2018 .

The cost of that is approximately $3 .
