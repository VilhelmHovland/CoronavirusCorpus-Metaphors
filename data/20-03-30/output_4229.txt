Something scared me more than the virus last week .
It was the language used by a few ANC politicians , no matter how conditionally phrased .
Like ' skop , skiet and donder ' and other gentle reminders of what additional force and violence can be brought to bear on citizens now stripped of their incomes .
Language used by Police Minister Bheki Cele and Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula .
And now they were about to shut down an entire country and its economy , after a few days of planning ? With its labyrinthine and ill-understood complexities , interconnections and interdependencies ? Cluster-f , I said to myself .
This is going to be a cluster-f .
And then I said it out loud .
Unsurprisingly , I was roundly booed by those who had heard .
This government , I suspect , is going to find out the limitations of its power , and paucity of its proclamations , and the attendant opprobrium at the ballot boxes .
If you are a single mother in a shack ( or even a one-room cinderblock home ) with four hungry kids , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or police force in the world is going to make you .
Hungry kids trump national disasters .
The clampdown on lockdown is strict .
But what happens when you run out of groceries or need to make an urgent trip to the pharmacy ? The rules say in that case , you 're allowed to leave the house , but the experience of a Mitchells Plain resident shows you might just end up in jail .

" I 'm sure there 's lots of under-trained and over-zealous law enforcement officials who have n't been adequately prepared for this , " said Andrew Boraine , CEO of the Western Cape Economic Development Partnership .
Honorary Master  I think it 's nice not to be the one in charge making decisions , you just sit there and wait for the decision makers to act then take your time finding all the flaws in the decisions .
It 's a nice position to be in because it 's a win win , whatever the government does you will always find something to criticize , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was such a bad idea , if they do n't and people die in their numbers you 'll be there again , blaming the government for not doing anything to protect its people .
It would be nice to hear what alternatives daily maverick has , because all they 've done so far is complain about the language used by Cele and find flaws with the government strategy .

Thread derail : The job of the government is to govern .
The role of the media is to hold them accountable .
Try reading the article :  But on the ground , perhaps a dollop of empathy and civility and flexibility and humility from the ministers and their thousands of enforcers .
" What are you doing on the street ma'am ? Can I help ? Your children are hungry ? Let me escort you and the little ones to the store , the clinic .
Please stay this far from the person in front of you in the queue .
Please try to stay indoors when you can .
Please wash your hands often , and your children 's .
Please stay safe .
Here is a number to call if you need to get out of your home for an emergency , they will advise , help and most of all , listen .
"  With the arrogant and terrifying bluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine this , here , ever ?  Honorary Master  I think it 's nice not to be the one in charge making decisions , you just sit there and wait for the decision makers to act then take your time finding all the flaws in the decisions .

It must be nice to be in charge making decisions in this country .
You just sit there and make decisions without due consideration , and when flaws in the decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no income ) you just dream up solutions ( like relief funds ) with no real plan ( or hope ) for implementation .
And , when it all inevitably fails , you can always blame Apartheid , or unforseen circumstances , and rest assured that you already have the apparatus for a police state in place .
Seriously though .
A lock down can not work in SA without it being brutally and callously enforced .
The government is a reflection of society as a whole .
If we are honest South Africa has long since parted with being a country of good people .
Anger , violence , paranoia , and power at any cost reign supreme .
I personal note if I may .
I used to be the good samaritan helping out where I can even if it cost me time and money .
Now ? If I was still there and a woman flags me down next to the road that looks grievously injured , I would drive right past .
My first thought would be , " someone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop " .
If you told my younger self that I would do this he would not believe it .
But the taint of this country seeps into your being and makes you less than you were .
And perhaps the most frightening is it happens gradually that most do not even realize what they have become .
SA is a broken rainbow nation ruled over by corrupt , power-hungry tyrants .
At this point , anything decent being done comes to me as a surprise rather than an expectation .

The president and the national command centre ( hows that for a nicely militarised phrase ? ) went straight from zero to putting the boot in .
The lessons and methods of apartheid were well learnt and are being vigorously applied by the exact victims of that brutal and callous system .
