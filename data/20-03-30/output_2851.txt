A Wawa doctor has taken to social media expressing concerns that a nearby gold mine continues to operate despite the COVID-19 pandemic .
Mike Cotterill penned the letter Thursday night on Facebook following a March 23 press release by Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd .
, that stated the Eagle River site continues to operate with a reduced workforce .
The company press release stated that as of March 12 , Wesdome had been monitoring body temperatures and requesting a health survey of all personnel wishing to enter the Eagle River Complex .
As well rigorous cleaning and disinfecting had been employed and a social distancing protocol is in place and schedules staggered to reduce the number of people in common areas .
Wesdome president and CEO Duncan Middlemiss said , " Our vigilance will go a long way to keeping everyone safe .
"  In his letter , Cotterill addressed his concerns to Middlemiss saying he did not agree the measures would keep everyone safe and that he had been unable to reach him by telephone .
Cotterill said the coronavirus pandemic , which is now affecting Canada , is still spreading rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three days .
" At this rate , there will be 200,000 -- 250,000 cases here by Easter , " he said , adding that the only countries that have had success in stopping the spread have done so by extreme social distancing .
" Most Canadians are doing their best to stop the disease from running rampant , " Cotterill wrote .
" They are staying home .
Many who ca n't afford it have given up their paycheques .
Students are out of school .
Patients have postponed necessary medical appointments .
Non essential businesses have been closed .
Health care workers are going to work and then worrying they might infect their families .
" Yet you have decided to keep your mine open , " said Cotterill , describing the site as where miners work and live in close quarters and then return home after a week or two to be with their families across Ontario and Quebec .
Adding that some miners take the 1 .
ride to work from Wawa with 12 in a van , Cotterill said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread the virus .
"  Noting that the Lady Dunn Health Centre in Wawa is the closest to Eagle River Mine , Cotterill said the decision to keep the mine operating says : " It is more important to pull gold out of the ground than to keep our workers and their families safe ; No matter how many of our workers , their families , and their contacts get sick , the health care system will be able to take care of them .
If cancer patients , heart patients , or expectant mothers have their care compromised because of the strain on the health care system , that 's OK ; and We do n't need to worry about the health of our frontline healthcare workers .
"  Calls and emails to Middlemiss were not immediately returned to the Sault Star Friday .
Cotterill urged the mine to reconsider its decision .
" I would urge you to follow the lead of another mine in the area which has shut down , and given its workers paid leave .
"  Earlier this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dubreuilville , announced it would be temporarily suspending operations for 14 days .
Another area gold mine , Harte Gold , continues to operate in White River .
