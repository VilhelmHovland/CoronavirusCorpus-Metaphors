Sammy Gyamfi on President Akufo-Addo 's partial lockdown directive  Folks , I am glad that President Akufo-Addo finally hearkened to the advice of the Ghana Medical Association , the TUC , and other Ghanaians to partially lockdown the country in the wake of the escalation of recorded cases of the Novel Coronavirus pandemic in Ghana .
Sadly , we 're already recording community infections of coronavirus disease in the country .
Although the partial lockdown is laudable , the manner in which it was communicated by the President in his recent address to the nation , leaves much to be desired .
I say so for the following reasons :  1 .
The President 's failure to disallow or restrict inter-regional movements , specifically , movements from regions affected by the announced lockdown ( epicentres ) to regions not affected by the lockdown , undermines the very purpose of the partial lockdown .
This is likely to lead to more community spread of the coronavirus infection .
In the last 48 hours , there has been mass exodus of people from the epicenters of the virus ; to other regions due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record cases of the virus .
But the mass movement of people in buses to these areas can lead to the spread of the deadly Coronavirus .
I believe that the President could have been guided by the example of Italy which has been ravaged by COVID-19 to know that , announcing a lockdown that allows inter-regional movement before its effective date is a recipe for further spread of the disease .
The scope of some of the exemptions granted by the President are too broad and more likely to be observed in breach .
A classic situation is the President 's directive to public transport operators ( specifically trotros and taxis ) to limit the number of passengers they carry in order to encourage social distancing .
The President 's directive falls short of clarity .
How on earth does government expect commercial transport operators to abide by a non-existent threshold of passengers at a time when many are cashing in on the fear and panic situation in the country ?  I think it would have served a better purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had announced a specific percentage cut down on the number of passengers that public or commercial vehicles should allow at this crucial time .
Also , this should have come with an incentive , in a form of a drastic reduction in fuel prices to cushion the drivers , GPRTU and car owners .
After all , the world market price of crude oil has dropped significantly in the last three ( 3 ) months .
Aside these issues , it is important to note , that the serious challenges confronting the country 's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic have still not been addressed by government .
For example :  1 .
There was no information on the status of the 100 million USD which the President claims to have made available to enhance our COVID-19 response plan .
The point has to be made , that the newly established COVID-19 Fund and the announced stimulus package for the private sector though laudable , can not be a substitute for the promised $100 million USD .
The country urgently needs a clearly dedicated amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic .
The urgent need for government to embark on mass testing has still not been addressed .
Also , one can safely argue that from the nature of some of the cases that have been recorded in our country , voluntary testing is critically needed at this time to prevent the unintended transmission of the virus .
Government 's inability to provide enough test kits for mass and voluntary testing leaves the greater public in danger .
But for JackMa and Alibaba who donated test kits to Ghana last week , Ghana would have run out of test kits by now .
The big question is , where are the 50 , 000 test kits that the Akufo-Addo government imported so late in the day ?  3 .
Government has still not addressed the problem of lack of PPEs for our front-line health workers .
The chorus of lack of PPEs has been loud and unanimous among health workers in the country in the last few weeks .
The recent incident at the Ridge Hospital involving the father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliamentary aspirant ) which left several workers terrified speaks volumes of the need for adequate protection for our frontline health workers who in most cases have no guaranteed safeguards .
The President must urgently address this to avoid our gallant health workers putting their lives in harm 's way as has been witnessed in Italy and other countries .
The problem of lack of transparency on lateral cases has still not been addressed by government .
Given the fact that Ghana has moved from vertical infections ( imported cases from abroad ) to the point of community infections , it is imperative that government provides accurate information on especially , community acquired cases so as to help community members and the general public keep safe .
Unfortunately , government is not abiding by their own 6-hour update of information on the COVID-19 website .
Additionally , the problem of poor surveillance of our borders has not been addressed .
The announced border closure is not working effectively .
People are still coming into the country through unapproved entry points along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) cases recorded in Tamale involving Guinean Nationals is a classic example of this fact .
Surveillance of our land borders is very weak and must be strengthened by our security agencies immediately .
Finally , I must stress that the announced stimulus package for the private sector must not end up as one of Akufo-Addo 's failed promises .
Let 's hope that it is released and disbursed on time as promised .
We must equally pray , that the distribution is not done on partisan and nepotistic basis as has been the trend under this government .
Also it is my prayer , that government immediately addresses the acute water shortage that Ghanaians in several parts of Accra are experiencing so they can have access to potable water in this period of lockdown .
Last but not least let me reiterate the call for government to reduce fuel prices drastically in order to cushion drivers , GPRTU and car owners as government forces them to limit the number of passengers .
