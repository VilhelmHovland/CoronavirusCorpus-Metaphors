Coronavirus - A clarion call for introspection ! ! !  By Sheikh Altaf Hussain .
Dated : 3/30/2020 12:04:44 AM  Man the supreme creature on tearth has travelled beyond this planet and is now expecting life on Mars .
His technological know how reduced the entire world into a ' global village ' .
At the time when he was competing with winds &amp; waves and aiming stars in his kitty a tiny invisible virus ' COVID 19 ' struck him .
Within no time he got trapped into a biggest human crisis on earth .
The fast moving world came to a halt .
The currency got devalued , trade paralysed and the global economy hit the lowest .
In short , this virus brought down curtains on all human activities across the globe .
The only weapon to fight this tiny virus is ' lockdown , social distancing &amp; maintaining hygiene ' At this juncture when the threat to survival is looming large over us a question struck to my mind : Why this catastrophe ? To know the answer I looked back to the history of mankind and inked this write up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth there were huge resources .
The gigantic snow clad hills , thick forests , chirping birds , animals , plains and calm oceans were at their best .
But with the advent of man these resources start depleting &amp; the creatures got squeezed .
The mother Earth begged us to look at the colossal loss caused to the Nature but we were lost in complete busy-ness &amp; took everything for granted .
Alas ! ! ! Again when I looked back to the human beings I noticed endless problems within this race .
The man firstly divided his own fellow beings into caste and sub-castes .
Then he divided his earth by creating boundaries .
The division multiplied &amp; multiplied .
Last but not the least he engineered politics which I only mean ' poly tricks ' .
All these vertical &amp; horizontal divisions led to the the division of humanity .
The rich became richer &amp; the poor the poorer .
The mighty states became so weak in establishing peace but strong enough in fomenting wars only to establish their might .
The walls of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splinters of human blood &amp; flesh .
Our homes &amp; hearths are at peril .
In short , the man has become the man eater ! ! ! Here I 'm remined of a famous line written in Lusaka Zoo in Zambia .
It reads " The most dangerous animal " .
Inside the cage there is no animal but a mirror where ' you see yourself .
' At the time when injustice , inequality and immorality is at its peak the Creator of this world sent down a small virus to put a lull on all human activities &amp; to balance the nature .
virus engulfed thousands of lives across the world forcing the the world to go for a global lockdown .
The mighty man is now confined within his four walls and forced to draw a lakshman rekha not to go out .
Our mis-deeds attracted the displeasure of God so much that He closed his holy places for us .
The places which used to be harbinger of hope for us in despair .
Even the religious congregations have been called off .
The doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people stopped attending funerals and cremating their loved ones till their bodies decomposed like rants .
This has never happened in history of mankind ! ! ! What I noticed further is really a matter of concern for everyone .
This tiny virus gave space to the nature to heal up .
It dropped air &amp; water pollution .
The smog disappeared &amp; sky got cleaner .
The trees start waving with greeny leaves &amp; th ? honking noise of chirping birds is returning home .
The hissing bees &amp; butterflies start hovering over flower beds .
Above all this tiny virus made us to ponder &amp; introspect .
We started dusting our holy books and recite ' touba touba ! ' .
No hindu muslim tu tu mein , no debate on any TV channel and no hussel bustle around .
In short , it was a sigh of relief in grief ! Friends ! This is time to recount our misdeeds and put colours to the word ' homosapiens ' - which means ' wise man ' ' .
Let 's fight COVID 19 by conquering hearts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate .
Let 's love mankind as a whole &amp; protect Nature .
Let 's bow our heads before Almighty God in gratitude for His innumerable blessings unto us .
Let 's recount the colossal loss caused by mam to mam and the Nature .
It is time to return to our holy scriptures and spread the message of peace and amity to all .
No doubt everything is pre-written but I believe with prayer it can can be re-written .
Let 's ponder &amp; realize where we went wrong ? Let 's revamp &amp; revalue our lives , strive for equality &amp; justice .
Let 's unite and understand ' WE ARE ALL CONNECTED ' .
Last but not the least let 's rebuild this world again from the very beginning otherwise one virus from the heaven is sufficient to finish us to the core .
I conclude with a famous couplet of urdu gazal sung by Jagjit Singh : Ya darti ke zakhmu pe marham rakh deYa mera dil pathar kr de ya Allah ! * ( The author is an Advocate &amp; Chairman Global PEACE Organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
