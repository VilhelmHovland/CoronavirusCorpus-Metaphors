Thank you for the outpouring of support for the hospital staff and providers .
Your thoughtfulness and kindness are very appreciated during this very challenging time in our state , our country and the world .
The staff and providers have enjoyed the drinks , food , cookies and appreciate your prayers .
We fully support Governor Kelly 's executive order for a statewide stay-at-home order .
Governor shared during the press conference that we could top over 900 cases next week .
The order means stay at home unless you are going to get food , household necessities , medical care or other essential services .
The reason that stay at home is so important in our county and our state is that it will not take much to overwhelm the health care system in Kansas , as we are seeing in New York .
There are estimates predicting as high as 40% of the population will have the Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) .
20% have needed to be hospitalized and 10% will need to be on a ventilator for life saving treatment .
Our county has 25 beds including 1 ICU bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
If we apply the same statistics mentioned above to our Brown County population of almost 10,000 , that would mean about 4,000 people would have the virus .
If 20% would need to be hospitalized that would mean 800 people need a hospital bed .
And 10% would need to be on a ventilator that would mean 80 people .
You can see how important it is to stay at home and stop the spread and flatten the curve .
Despite the strong skills and dedication of our staff , our community hospital does not have the resources to meet these needs .
We face even more of a challenge if our staff are the ones with the coronavirus .
Our regional centers will have the same impact and more depending on the regional populations we serve .
I am sure you have seen the challenges that are facing New York and other large metropolitan areas .
Hiawatha Community Hospital Leadership team has activated our incident command to improve our operations during this national emergency .
We are on calls with someone every day whether it is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Regional Preparedness , regional tertiary centers and county health departments .
We are also holding 2 internal huddles a day and we have a COVID Dashboard to monitor activity and supplies .
All public communication will come from the CEO 's Office .
We have followed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( CMS ) recommendation to stop elective surgery .
One of the reasons that this recommendation was implemented was to decrease the use of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) so that we can save our supplies for where it 's most needed .
We support this recommendation despite the fact that surgery is an important source for revenue for our hospital and every hospital in the country .
We implemented CALL BEFORE YOU GO protocol for patients experiencing symptoms to prevent people from showing up to the hospital for clinic , hospital outpatient procedure and emergency department without being screened .
We want to assess your symptoms to hopefully avoid spread to other patients and our health care workers .
We initiated a COVID Line that all callers who are calling in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed to the line that is staffed with a nurse who will collect information and review symptoms and travel history .
Most of the callers have been directed to home quarantine and call back if symptoms get worse .
If the nurse reviews the information with a provider , the patient may  be called back for a drive screening , if warranted .
We do encourage patients to come alone .
Staff wearing PPE will come out to the patients car to provide care , verify information , and collect nasal samples .
We run several tests -- the first one is a rapid flu test , if negative we run a test for other viruses .
If the follow up test is negative , then we send the sample to KDHE or a reference lab for COVID testing .
We ask the patient to continue the home quarantine .
As of March 29th , we have had well over 100 callers on our COVID Line .
21 patients have been through our drive up collection service .
We have also sent through a couple of tests for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples for analysis , 13 have been negative and 9 are pending results .
The Reference Lab is taking 4-5 days to return the results .
For the state , there have been 261 positive out of 3,671 tests , or about seven percent positive .
29 of the 105 counties have at least one positive with a majority of the positive cases in Johnson and Wyandotte Counties .
We are continuing to monitor our volume in the area and we have developed our organization response when there are positive cases in Brown County .
We are focusing on staff training for use of PPE and orientation to different departments as we seeing changes in volumes for most departments .
