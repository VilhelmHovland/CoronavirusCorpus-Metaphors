" I 've got a very simple message today -- stay at home , " Andrews said at a press conference this morning .
" This is life and death .
"  Prime Minister Scott Morrison introduced the new measures -- which include a two-person limit at all public gatherings and the closure of outdoor gyms , playgrounds and skate parks -- at a press conference on Sunday evening .
" You should only be going out to shop for things that you actually need , " Morrison said , before classing essential outings into five categories : food and essential supplies shopping ; receiving medical care ; exercising ; attending work ( for those who ca n't work remotely ) ; and leaving the house for compassionate reasons .
The two-person limit does n't apply to those living together , and excludes workplaces and schools .
It does apply to outdoor group-exercise classes and boot camps , and to people visiting your home .
" If you 're having friends over for dinner , or friends over for drinks , that are not members of your household , then you are breaking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police will not hesitate to take action against you .
That 's how serious this is .
"  He added that anyone found to be breaching the restrictions faces on-the-spot fines of more than $1600 .
Those who do leave their homes for essential reasons must follow social distancing guidelines , which include maintaining a distance of 1 .
metres from others at all times and avoiding physical greetings .
Playgrounds , outdoor gyms and skate parks will be closed starting today .
Shopping centres , schools and essential businesses can remain open at this stage .
A six-month moratorium on rental evictions has also been announced for those under financial stress .
Perhaps most critically , Morrison stressed that " the strong advice " is for the public to stay home unless absolutely necessary .
" These arrangements should also apply to those with chronic illness , over 60 , and Indigenous persons over the age of 50 , " he said .
" Anyone who does n't need to be out of their home should be in the home .
This is radical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also took part in last night 's press conference .
" The vast majority of Australians have done the right thing in the last week .
We 've seen huge evidence of that .
But we 've also seen some very silly behaviour of people who have n't complied with that , particularly outdoors .
