The boyband performed the track at the iHeart Living Room Concert last night  This is the wholesome Monday morning content we all need .
Backstreet Boys ' ' I Want it That Way ' is one of the most iconic pop songs of the 1990s - so much so that it 's been parodied many times before , including by Blink-182 in their own video for ' All the Small Things ' .
If you were n't already aware , the boyband/manband are still a thing - and along with the rest of the world , they 're self-isolating and social distancing .
Still , that did n't stop them from taking part in the iHeart Living Room Concert , which was hosted by Elton John and took place in the US last night .
All five members performed the song separately from their own homes , nailing the harmonies and showing off their fancy pads in the process .
