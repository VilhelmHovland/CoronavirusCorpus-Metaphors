Clare Musicians Home From Chile Thanks to Fans Generosity  THERE was huge relief on Monday last ( March 23 ) for a group of Clare musicians who braved major travel disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic to make their way back to Shannon Airport from South America .
The nerve-wracking journey of Los Paddys took them more than 11,000 kilometres from Chile , and was fraught with uncertainty because of the international travel chaos .
With vast sections of international airspace shut down and ongoing severe flight disruption , the six Clare members of the outfit came close to finding themselves stranded on the other side of the world .
The musicians had been on a tour of Chile and Argentina for St Patrick 's Day , and when their original travel plans were thrown into disarray , they had to fundraise online to make alternative arrangements .
Paddy Mulcahy , Head Programmer for Los Paddys , told The Champion the response , which raised more than ? 7,000 , had been incredible and essential in getting them home .
" Our outward journey and the end of the tour was meant to be through Argentina , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were flying directly from Chile to Europe also had their flights cut , to it was an uncertain and frightening situation for a while .
We made a Go Fund Me page to raise money for new flights , which was generously supported by our friends , family and fans of the band .
" The links between the Banner County and South America have been explored by Paddy Mulcahy since he pioneered an ethnographic project on the topic in 2012 .
Entitled ' Los Paddys de Las Pampas ' , it gave rise to the hugely popular fusion outfit , whose career highs to-date include performing for President Michael D Higgins .
Their 2020 tour of South America saw them perform at the very first St Patrick 's Day parade in Santiago in Chile , which went ahead as scheduled , before the full scale of the Coronavirus pandemic became apparent .
Celebrations soon turned to anxiety as a lock-down took hold in response to the virus .
" Our tour was cancelled half-way through with the onset of a lock-down , " Paddy explained .
" We put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The return journey took the crew from Santiago to Toronto , Toronto to London and then to Shannon where they were warmly welcomed home -- from a safe distance -- by airport staff , family , friends and fans , before going into self- isolation .
Despite the uncertainly the group faced in getting out of Chile , Paddy said the group were well looked after and were taking many positives from their journey :  " We have been treated amazingly by the people of Chile .
We played some amazing concerts and have had beautiful experiences .
