There is now evidence that COVID-19 is spreading in the community in Grey-Bruce , as expected by health officials .
The Grey-Bruce Health Unit daily situation report March 29 said two new cases were reported in the past 24 hours , including a new presumptive positive case that provides " evidence of community transmission .
"  This case , pending confirmation of test results , is a woman in her 70s in Grey-Bruce , reported in the past 24 hours .
Until now , all cases have been travel-related .
The second new case involved a man in his 40s with a travel history who tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 24 hours , bringing the total Grey-Bruce cases to 10 .
The health unit report said one person has recovered .
There are still no cases reported in long-term care ; 12 negative test results received in the past 24 hours ( as of March 29 ) ; and there had been 305 negative test results to date for COVID-19 .
The Ontario government issued a new order March 28 , limiting organized public gatherings to five people -- down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and childcare centres for health-care workers and first responders , can have up to 50 people per centre .
Up to 10 people may attend funerals .
Arra noted community transmission is now established elsewhere in Ontario and the country , as opposed to the initial cases of infections from travel or direct contact with an infected traveller .
Two early COVID-19 deaths in a Barrie hospital indicate the disease had been spreading in that community for weeks prior , Arra said .
The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit said one death , on March 21 , involved a man who was being treated for COVID-19 , who was in close contact with another man with COVID-19 , who died March 11 .
Working back from the point of death to the period of symptoms and incubation , transmission for those cases happened in mid-February , Arra said .
" So if there is transmission in Simcoe Muskoka mid-February , odds are there is local transmission here , " he said Saturday .
" In all cases , whether there is right now or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be local transmission , " Arra said .
" This bug , COVID-19 , is behaving in a way in its spread similar to the annual flu -- in the spread , I 'm not talking about mortality -- mortality is probably a step up from the flu , " he said .
Most who get infected experience mild symptoms and recover within two weeks .
But a portion of people , including seniors , will be hit harder and so efforts to limit the spread are intended to avoid overwhelming hospitals , whose officials say they 're planning for the worst and hoping for the best .
As of 6 p .
March 29 , Ontario had 1,326 confirmed positive cases , 21 deaths , eight people have recovered and 7,203 cases are under investigation , the  Arra said people recognize you ca n't contain the annual flu either but you can reduce community spread by following the health directives and orders .
These include staying two metres from people outside of your immediate family , hand-washing and avoiding touching your face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who are sick , and following all orders from public health and the provincial and federal governments .
Ontario 's March 17 state of emergency closed non-essential workplaces , recreational programs , libraries , publicly funded schools , private schools , daycares , provincial parks , churches and other faith settings , as well as bars and restaurants , except those that may only offer takeout or delivery .
Essential services , such as grocery stores , convenience stores , pharmacies , public transit , manufacturing facilities , and supply chain companies remain open and operational .
