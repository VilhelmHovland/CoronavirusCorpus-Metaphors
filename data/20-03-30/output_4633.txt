Cristiano Ronaldo criticised over quarantine response  Grealish is n't the only football star to court controversy while supposedly in quarantine , with Cristiano Ronaldo also under fire .
The Juventus star was criticised by the club 's former president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli over his actions in the coronavirus pandemic , with the five-time Ballon d'Or winner considered to have ' complicated ' matters .
The Portuguese star was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in Italy shut down , with the Juve squad placed in quarantine once it was revealed that Daniele Rugani had tested positive for Covid-19 .
Ronaldo had been freed by then to return to his homeland after seeing his mother suffer a stroke - Maria Dolores has since been released from hospital - and is continuing her recovery in a private medical facility , with her son allowed to turn his attention elsewhere .
Cristiano Ronaldo has been criticised for flying back to Portugal amid the coronavirus pandemic .
Pic : Getty  But Gigli claims the 35-year-old is now more concerned with " taking pictures by the pool " and has set an unfortunate precedent that is making it difficult for other sports stars to be contained .
The likes of Gonzalo Huguain , Miralem Pjanic and Douglas Costa have been released from the Juve camp to join their respective families around the world .
" He said he was going to Portugal because of his mother , but now he only appears to be taking pictures by the pool .
" When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others wanted to leave but it should n't have been like this .
" They all should have been quarantined .
"  Juventus in difficult spot due to virus  Gigli admits that Juventus have been forced into a corner when it comes to letting senior stars flee Italy .
He feels that the reigning Serie A champions will now find it difficult to get back up to speed once a return to competitive action is given a green light .
Those outside of Turin have been given individual training regimes , but they will be short of sharpness when returning to the Allianz Stadium and have to prove that they are not carriers of the coronavirus .
Gigli added : " Criticising now is easy , but from the outside I do n't know why players wanted to leave Italy .
" When they return it 'll be more difficult to get back in shape because they 'll have to stay in quarantine for 14 days .
