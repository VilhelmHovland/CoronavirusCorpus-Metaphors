After months of minimizing the threat to the United States , President Donald Trump jumped feet-first into the coronavirus fight this week with vows of quick fixes to the testing problem , claims about potential cures , and efforts to rope in agencies that had inexplicably been excluded , like FEMA .
The show of action played well in the White House briefing room and with the public , but has had a different impact behind the scenes .
Health-agency officials and outside advisers to the administration , speaking on the condition of anonymity , described a chaotic situation in which leaders rushed to address presidential requests that sometimes seem to come on a whim while losing focus on longer-term challenges .
Advertisement  Trump 's drive to announce unfinished initiatives created a " need to make good on half-baked promises , " said one senior official -- who , like other Americans , learned about some initiatives only when the president announced them at the White House podium .
For instance , no one in the White House had devised a national strategy for obtaining and distributing the necessary supplies in the likely months-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with knowledge of the planning efforts .
Those supply-planning efforts are only now underway .
" How is there not a national supply strategy yet ? " asked one official involved in the effort , warning that the infamous shortage of coronavirus tests is set to be replicated with other shortages across the health system .
" Hospitals are going to run out of basic commodities .
"  The U .
health system already has been plagued by shortages of test-kit chemicals , swabs and personal protective equipment for health workers , problems that are set to worsen as coronavirus case numbers rise and demand spikes .
A government effort to obtain replacement test swabs required the U .
military this week to airlift the specialized swabs from a factory located in coronavirus-stricken Italy .
Meanwhile , leaders in coronavirus hotspots like Seattle and New York City have effectively abandoned efforts to conduct broad testing on residents , instead urging them to stay home given the shortages -- an acknowledgment that efforts to contain coronavirus have failed and they need to prioritize limited supplies .
Local officials also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies to be creative to supply the crucial gear our healthcare workers need .
NY will pay a premium and offer funding , " New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo tweeted on Friday .
" If you have any of these unused supplies , please email email protected .
"  A sympathetic HHS staffer compared Cuomo 's plea to an Internet auction .
" We 're facing a pandemic and the governor has to basically turn to eBay " for supplies , the staffer said .
Trump has worked to tamp down concerns about insufficient tests and supplies , saying that the flurry of federal , state and local efforts will be sufficient .
" If California can get a mask sooner than we can get it for them , through all of the things we 're able to do , we 'll end up with a big over-supply , " the president said at a press conference on Saturday .
" At some point this is going away .
"  Spokespeople for the Trump administration defended its planning and coordination for the coronavirus outbreak .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare for responding to the outbreak and will continue to coordinate closely with private suppliers and our federal partners to ensure that resources are going where they 're needed , " an HHS spokesperson said .
The White House said that Trump 's leadership had sparked an " unprecedented collaboration " of government and private industry to curb the virus ' spread and ramp up the response .
" The president has no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people and he is working around the clock to ensure we emerge from this crisis healthy , safe , and strong , " said spokesperson Judd Deere .
Inside the Trump administration , officials are continuing to sort out which teams are responsible for elements of coronavirus response , part of an ever-shifting patchwork of alliances and strategy , while working to manage the president 's unpredictable requests .
Five officials said that Trump had grown appropriately concerned about the coronavirus outbreak after weeks of ignoring or playing down the threat , but that the administration is now rushing to solve issues that could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nation 's emergency stockpile .
Officials also are sniping over whether to institute even more aggressive actions to prevent coronavirus transmission .
Health officials are calling for stricter measures that would keep more Americans at home , for longer , but policy officials warn that the resulting economic damage could cause other , long-lasting harms .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency this week took over responsibilities that had rested with the Health and Human Services department , the latest attempt to get a handle on the worsening outbreak .
" FEMA is now leading federal operations for #COVID19 on behalf of the White House , " administrator Pete Gaynor tweeted on Thursday night , as some projects like drive-through test sites shifted from the health department .
The agency is also taking on a larger role handling supply and distribution issues , Gaynor and other officials said at Saturday 's briefing .
" The tendency is to think of FEMA as a disaster management agency , " said Craig Fugate , who ran FEMA during the Obama administration and said he had no knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually an all-hazards agency .
and FEMA could add structure , planning , location to the coronavirus response , " with its regional offices and staff with crisis-management experience .
Some officials and outside advisers have questioned why FEMA had not been given more authority earlier in the response given the agency 's operational expertise in responding to disasters .
Two individuals said that HHS Secretary Alex Azar had focused on protecting his leadership role , which has shrunk as Vice President Mike Pence took over the broader response and deputies whom Azar had originally sidelined -- like Medicare chief Seema Verma and Surgeon General Jerome Adams -- have emerged as key figures in White House strategy .
But a person familiar with HHS strategy said that Azar had pushed " weeks ago " for FEMA to be involved .
The hold-up was instead linked to the federal response 's rotating leadership -- as Pence abruptly took over for Azar at the end of February -- and administration worries that states would be further confused over who was in charge .
" Secretary Azar and HHS have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach and in particular the important role FEMA is playing in coordinating the federal government 's response to COVID-19 , " an HHS spokesperson said .
Meanwhile , a SWAT team of government officials and outside technocrats , backed by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner , spent the week working around-the-clock to deliver the drive-through testing sites that Trump publicly promised , POLITICO first reported .
But the focus on drive-through testing also creates a new problem -- draining limited supplies and other resources that could be used for high-priority patients in hospitals .
" It 's all short-term thinking right now , " said one official involved in the response .
" They 're desperate to expand testing -- which is a good idea -- but I do n't know whether the president , the vice president and others at the top understand the trade-offs , " added an adviser to the effort .
" It feels like each of these problems is a mini-crisis being run by a mini-team in the government .
"  Trump 's own involvement has caused additional headaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that an " exciting FDA announcement " was on the way -- particularly because Food and Drug Administration officials had yet to greenlight new drugs that Trump sought to fight the virus , The Wall Street Journal reported .
While Trump did hold a Thursday press conference with FDA Commissioner Steve Hahn and other officials , the event largely rehashed existing policies and work that had already been announced .
Trump on Friday also repeatedly made claims about an unproven coronavirus treatment , prompting infectious-disease scientist Anthony Fauci to try and walk back the claims from the White House podium .
Meanwhile , the president has repeatedly touted unfinished projects , like announcing on March 13 a Google website that he said would help coordinate testing .
But the actual site , which rolled out a week later , is instead a collection of information and links .
Trump on Friday also claimed that General Motors has " openly stated " it would produce medical supplies .
But GM has not publicly committed to producing more supplies , although the company is working with ventilator specialist Ventec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed out on Friday after Trump 's remarks .
" All options are on the table on how GM can help Ventec build more ventilators , " a GM spokesperson said .
The chaotic response also has trickled down to individual hospitals , clinics and doctors , which have struggled to get answers on supply chains and fought to protect their equipment .
Bill Cassidy 's office reached out to the White House on Wednesday after learning that University Medical Center in Louisiana was informed that a new lab-testing machine , due to arrive on Monday , had instead been requisitioned by government officials for a " higher priority " coronavirus situation .
" We thought the machine was a high priority in Louisiana given the fast rate that things were spreading , " said a spokesperson for Cassidy 's office , noting that the state has become a hotspot for coronavirus transmission .
The White House later assured Cassidy 's office that the machine would go to Louisiana next week , as originally intended .
Meanwhile , the Trump administration has spent weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly build up national reserves .
" Every single governor across the country is looking for the exact same thing , " FEMA 's Gaynor said at Saturday 's White House press briefing , responding to questions about shortages .
Some experts said the president would be better served by developing a national strategy to allocate limited resources to the neediest areas while obtaining new ones , say experts , noting that dozens of individual components in the health system are at risk of being quickly diminished in the initial crush of cases -- from the intricate chemicals needed for tests to the basic supplies that could 've been rapidly produced months ago .
" We 're seeing a run on swabs , " said a former official , arguing that the Trump administration should have anticipated the worldwide demand for the specialized , low-cost swabs needed to do the testing .
" How on Earth did we let this happen ? "  Tom Inglesby , director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security , listed off the supply shortages that already are plaguing hospitals .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diagnostic kits , they do n't have swabs for the kits , they do n't have the N95 masks , they 're running out of gowns and gloves , " said Inglesby , who 's called on the White House to overhaul its approach and assign specialists , such as the Pentagon 's Defense Logistics Agency , to solve the supply-chain problems .
" I do n't think we should see these as spot shortages that will soon be resolved with significant effort , " Inglesby added .
" We will be using large amounts of these supplies for a long time .
COVID will be with us for a long time -- we need a long-term solution .
"  Meanwhile , Trump on Saturday was asked about " the plan " to contain coronavirus as the nation enters day 6 of the White House 's 15-day campaign to slow the virus ' spread , and specifically whether additional measures needed to be taken .
The president declined to detail next steps , saying only that leaders would know more next week .
