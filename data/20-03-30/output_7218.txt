Howes : Detroit 's ' arsenal of health ' surges to battle coronavirus  Nearly 80 years after Detroit 's automakers and the United Auto Workers retooled their plants to make planes , tanks and trucks to help the allies win World War II , their successors are refitting components plants and ramping to assemble nearly 20,000 ventilators a month needed to treat patients battling COVID-19 .
General Motors Co .
and Ford Motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise to partner with medical device makers to dramatically increase production ventilators .
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV is producing masks at a plant in China .
Southfield-based Lear Corp .
is manufacturing 25,000 protective facemasks per day in a North Carolina plant .
And they geared up to do it themselves , long before President Donald Trump bowed last Friday to mounting pressure from mayors and governors demanding that he use the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to compel manufacturers to build badly needed medical supplies .
Not that you 'd know that judging by the latest spin from the White House .
A day after the president excoriated GM and its CEO , Mary Barra , for " wasting time " in supply contract talks it was n't even having ( its partner , Ventec Life Systems was ) , and after issuing GM the first order under the DPA , the president was back to making nice about the Detroit automaker .
The whole episode was outrageous , misguided and unsupported by the facts -- the president 's Twitter rant about " Mary B .
, @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio plant it no longer owns , his potshots from the White House press room , a DPA order commanding GM do what it 's already doing at its Kokomo Operations facility in Indiana .
Barra 's advice to the troops , according to a source familiar with the situation : We 're doing the right thing .
Stay focused .
Keep going .
And the truth will out , proving once again that what you do matters a whole lot more than what you say .
GM and Ventec Life Systems are partnering to convert GM 's Kokomo manufacturing facility for the production of Ventec ventilators .
( Photo : GM )  Then Monday , Ford and GE Healthcare detailed plans to assemble 50,000 ventilators within 100 days of launching production April 20 in the Blue Oval 's Rawsonville Components Plant in Ypsilanti , thanks to 500 UAW volunteers who would work three shifts and be paid their base union scale .
" The Ford/GE Healthcare team is moving in ' Trump time ' to speed urgently needed ventilators to the front lines of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president 's DPA coordinator , Peter Navarro , said in a statement .
" We salute that effort and look forward to the first ventilators rolling off the Michigan  assembly line in record time -- and we 'll be there to salute that milestone .
"  Oh , I 'm sure they 'll be there for the victory lap .
Except for this little inconvenient fact : Automotive Detroit 's medical-equipment surge is a testament to the leadership of folks like GM 's Barra and Ford 's Jim Hackett and Lear 's Ray Scott , and all the engineering and manufacturing folks who 've done in a week and half what would normally take a year and a half .
Guys like GM 's Larry Foltran , a layout engineer for GM 's " Project V " partnership with Ventec .
In a post on Facebook time stamped 1:12 a .
Saturday , he wrote about leaving GM 's Tech Center in Warren late at night and hearing about " how our President feels the company is n't working fast enough .
"  Foltran talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks from Ventec , " working out every detail to produce a device completely unfamiliar to us .
What we have accomplished in five days is incredible .
The level of motivation and drive I 've encountered is beyond anything I 've ever encountered .

"  The auto surge to fight COVID-19 also is enabled by the 30 Ford employees who piled into vehicles and drove 14 hours to Aberdeen , South Dakota , where they advised their counterparts at 3M Co .
how to up production of purified air respirators developed with seat-cooling fans for F-150 pickups and batteries from cordless drills .
Welcome to American innovation under pressure , an unleashing of speed , collaboration and technical expertise leveraging the scale of large manufacturers .
They 're obliterating timelines and breaking down barriers to rush to production badly needed ventilators , masks , face shields and other personal protective equipment .
This is American business at its best , Detroit 's automotive ecosystem at its finest .
And it arrived here of its own accord , not because some White House czar purporting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent the administration is leading at all in mobilizing American industry , it appears to be leading from behind .
None of this should be surprising given a ) the reactive impulse of the present administration and b ) the character of the men and women leading Detroit 's automotive powerhouse .
People who lived through the ignominy of bailouts , bankruptcy and restructuring ; people who grasp the technical and manufacturing might they still wield , capability that has a bias for outperforming when crisis arrives .
They 're people who 're willing to act .
