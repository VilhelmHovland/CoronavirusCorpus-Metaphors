High school seniors cope with isolation , class trip and sports cancellations  Shelby Deibler , 18 , of Burlington Township , a senior at Moorestown Friends School , looks over the new hiking boots she was going to wear on the Grand Canyon school trip , Thursday , March 26 , 2020 .
( Photo : NANCY ROKOS / PHOTOJOURNALIST )  After a long day of completing class work from home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laurel home with his sisters -- it 's one of few sports nowadays that would follow good social distancing practices .
There 's not much else for the Lenape High School senior and tennis player to do .
His gym , like all others statewide , is closed , and spring sports and all other school events have been canceled at least through spring break while schools are closed to curb the spread of coronavirus -- a disappointment for Aidan , who said Lenape was a favorite to win the championship .
" For the first few days , when I first heard we were going online and the days were shortened , I was happy about that , " Aidan said .
" But after the first two days , I was bored out of my mind .
No one can go out and everything 's closed .

Thousands of high school seniors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rites of spring around this time of year , just before they graduate high school -- overnight class trips , honor society inductions , the last season of spring sports , proms and of course , walking down the aisle to receive their diplomas with their classmates with their proud families and friends cheering them on .
For some students , it 's also a crucial time for making college decisions and attending admitted students ' events , as well as taking advanced placement ( AP ) exams that could count for college credits .
" That 's one of the things I 'm most disappointed about , " said George Moussa , a senior at Bordentown Regional High School , who 's still trying to decide where to go to college .
" I 've gotten into some schools but I ca n't visit .
I do n't know how I 'm going to make my college decision without visiting .
"  With schools closed for a while , there 's a sense of uncertainty around major milestones now , leaving students and their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lost if coronavirus continues to keep schools closed beyond April .
" I 'm optimistic they can find some way to make it work , " said Aidan , who worries that a senior trip to Disney World might not be a possibility anymore .
" Same with prom .
Maybe they could postpone it .

The Mount Laurel senior said she has " extra free time to do what I truly do love " and spends afternoons either babysitting neighborhood kids whose parents ca n't work from home , or focusing on hobbies like baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class .
" The last week we were in school , I 'd hoped we would be off for two weeks , " Turgeon said .
" But as it started to get more serious , and the school said we 'd be out until April 20 , I realized how much I 'm missing .
"  She said she 's missing school traditions like the senior class game of assassins and a 10-day film challenge , as well as a competition with her chapter of Future Business Leaders of America .
" I 'm an extrovert , so all of this happening is driving me crazy , " Gabrielle said with a laugh .
Gabrielle , who works with Lenape 's TV station , said she 's working on a surprise for her fellow students to replace a " senior shoutouts " tradition in case in-person classes are canceled beyond April 20 .
While most school districts anticipate a tentative reopening April 20 , including all of Burlington County , plans could change .
Phil Murphy said he would ultimately make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more weeks .
In Haddonfield , the schools are closed indefinitely pending a state decision to end school closures and the stay-at-home order .
Tennis team player Victoria Hirst of Haddonfield High School said she is " a little scared and worried " about the coronavirus and believes Haddonfield students are observing social distancing by not meeting in groups .
She had not been out of the house in more than a week .
" It is a little frustrating that this has happened in your senior year and you have to study from home , but at least with technology , we can do it and not have to come back to school in the summer , " she said .
Students say they understand decisions to cancel and postpone events are necessary , given the current situation , but it still stings .
" It may seem selfish because so many others are going through so much right now .
We never thought the virus would get so out of control , " said Hannah Scott , a student at Cherry Hill East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college in the fall .
" It 's a lot to go through , and you ca n't see your friends .
"  The only time she has been out of the house lately is to support local restaurants by picking up take-out .
While she 's home , she and her friends in the gay-straight alliance club she leads are communicating on Zoom .
This week , they would 've been on their senior trip .
" My other concern is how long this will last , " Scott said .
" The prom at Lincoln Financial Field and graduation are farther off in June , so there is still hope ( they will be held ) .
"  When not doing school work she uses FaceTime and texting to connect with friends but not every spare minute .
" It 's nice to be home with my family and watch a movie or play board games and be positive , ' she explained .
She said she and her classmates did not know the status of their class trip scheduled for April 3 as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to go , but I would not want to put us or our teacher chaperones in more jeopardy , " she added .
Cherry Hill schools spokeswoman Barbara Wilson said the district is looking into rescheduling the Disney trips for both East and West high schools .
" As I am typing this , the proms and graduations have not been canceled .
Please understand this status could change very quickly .
( and ) we will continue to notify our community immediately if changes occur .
"  Cherry Hill High School West senior Madison " Maddie " Desjardins at one of her recent swim meets .
( Photo : Photo provided )  Senior Madison Desjardins of Cherry Hill West High School said she she has been looking forward to the class trip " forever " and would be terribly disappointed if it were cancelled .
She is not cooped up in the house every day because three times a week she still reports to her job at Honeygrow at the Ellisburg Shopping Center , Route 70 and Kings Highway .
Often she prepares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up their food , but they ca n't stay in there , " said Madison , whose mom Sheri is also at home because she works in administration for the now closed Cherry Hill schools .
The effect of school closures is four-fold in the 10-member Mackiewicz household in Cinnaminson .
The family has three girls and a boy who are quadruplets and all college-bound seniors -- Zachary , Katharyn , Kelsey and Kaeleigh .
Zachary already is missing the start of the varsity baseball season , during which he would have been the catcher , though he does not plan to play in college .
He and his sisters should have left Wednesday for five days at Disney World , a trip the school district is trying to postpone , as are some other schools , like Bordentown and Lenape , where students had similar trips scheduled this month or in April .
The Mackiewiczs ' mother , Colleen , a home-based travel agent , said she has learned Disney may not open until April 5 , but its website still says " closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been to Disney many times as family , but this time we would be with our friends and be on your own and that would make it more special , " said Zachary , who has been playing Call of Duty and other games on Xbox .
Quadruplets , from left , Kelsey , Katharyn , Kaeleigh &amp; Zachary Mackiewicz , all seniors at Cinnaminson High School , are confined in their home this week because of the COVID-19 related school closures in New Jersey .
( Photo : Photo provided )  Sister Katharyn would rather be in school because she says it motivates her more .
" And we 're finally to the point where we 're done school but may not even be able to walk across the stage with the class at graduation on June 18 .
We do n't know .
"  Future events like prom -- another senior rite of passage -- are also up in the air for seniors .
Mazie Mulford , from Woodstown High School , had already bought a gown for her prom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boutique in Cherry Hill , which has been closed as a nonessential business under the state 's emergency declaration to prevent virus spread .
Mulford was last there for a fitting March 14 and planned to pick up the gown April 9 .
" It 's my dream dress and I do n't even know if I will ever be able to wear it because we do n't know yet if the prom will be held , on May 28 , " said Mulford , who is spending four to five hours a day on her school work via Google .
" We would be stuck with an expensive gown that we can not wear anywhere else .
"  In place of a pep rally scheduled to take place in her high school last week to kick off spring sports , a virtual spirit week was held via Instagram for students and teachers to post photos or videos with a different theme each day .
One daily theme was Mindfulness .
" They are posting things like family walks , yoga or painting .
The idea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mulford said .
" The whole situation is certainly not ideal , but I am trying to make the best of it .
"  Millville High School senior Brianna Miller 's class was fortunate enough to have gone on its class trip to Disney the first week of March , but she and fellow classmate Elly Taylor are worried their May 1 prom at The Grove at Centerton in Pittsgrove will not be held .
A month ago Taylor bought what she calls her Cinderella dress , still inside the closed Tesi Bridal in Northfield and awaiting a final fitting .
" I 'm upset because I love it so much .
There is a lot of money in it -- $400 -- and I may never get to wear it to the prom , " she fretted .
What also has been called is Miller 's exchange trip with several other students to to Heidelberg , Germany , after graduation to visit German students their families hosted during the school year .
The $200 personal down payment she made toward the trip cost has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
For dinner every night each member of Miller 's family prepares a meal with a different theme .
" One night I made Chinese -- sweet and sour chicken , cream cheese wonton and fried rice -- and tonight my brother is making tacos , " she said Friday .
Jessica Martin , a senior at Bordentown Regional High School , served on her class executive board and helped plan her May 29 senior prom .
" We put a lot of planning into that , people have already asked each other , girls got their dresses , " Martin said .
" It 's looking like we might not have it .
"  But while missing once-in-a-lifetime experiences like class trips to Disney World , prom and graduation would be sad , some teenagers miss quality time with friends and daily routines the most .
" Mundane things are what I miss more than scheduled events , " said Shelby Deibler , a senior at Moorestown Friends School from Burlington Township .
" It 's been weird , honestly .
You feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I had my morning routine of stopping at Wawa on the way .
I wake up and open my laptop now .
"  In the last months of senior year , students would normally be making memories with friends before they head in different directions .
That quality time is mainly taking place through other platforms like FaceTime , Snapchat , text messaging , multi-player video games or starting shows on Netflix at the same time .
Though she 's worried about missing AP testing , college admissions events and an internship at the end of the school year , Shelby said this situation has brought her closer with her peers .
She ca n't just chat with classmates in the hallway now , so she finds herself making a conscious effort to be more open , reach out and share news such as college acceptances and rejections with them .
Shelby said she has n't lost her support network .
She just has to reinvent it .
However , she still misses daily life and in-person interactions at school .
" I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would possibly be my last Friday in my English teacher 's classroom , or hearing an anecdote from my math teacher , " Shelby said .
" I was n't prepared .
