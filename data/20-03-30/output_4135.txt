Azaguie-Ahoua , Ivory Coast - " Good day , this message is about the coronavirus .
It is a very dangerous disease , " warns a voice relayed by loudspeakers around Azaguie-Ahoua , a small town in southeastern Ivory Coast .
" Let 's keep our distance -- one metre apart , " the voice says , speaking first in the local Abe language and then in French .
The voice belongs to Gustave Aguie Ahouasso , a " griot " -- a traditional storyteller -- whose duties include preserving oral history and serving the king of Azaguie , Nanan Ako Ako Omer .
It is the chief himself who has ordered the anti-coronavirus messages to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community of 10,000 souls .
" The system replaces the street criers of old , " said Ahouasso .
The coronavirus announcement -- and the chief 's command -- give the advice special impact .
" The chiefs here have found a great way to communicate via the loudspeakers .
It avoids contact ( through public gatherings ) .
The message gets across .
We follow instructions " , says Genevieve Akoua Kouassi , a primary-school teacher out shopping at the market .
WARNINGS  Recent royal communications have above all aimed at making townspeople aware of the health messages about coronavirus , with twists to suit rural African life .
One warning , for instance , is not to eat wild animals -- bushmeat -- that could be a potential source of disease .
" We listen to the messages from the loudspeakers .
Today , they repeatedly told us that everyone must be back in their home after 7:00-8:00 pm , " said Francia Nadege Apo , a hairdresser whose salon consists of two stools at the side of the street .

On Sunday , Ivory Coast announced its first death of coronavirus , out of 165 detected cases .
A 9 pm-5 am curfew , announced on March 23 by President Alassane Ouattara , has been enforced along with a ban on movement in and out of the economic capital Abidjan and closure of bars , schools and restaurants .
ROYAL ROLE  Ivory Coast has retained hundreds of kings and traditional chiefs , even though the former French colony became a republic six decades ago this year .
These local rulers operate in parallel with the country 's political government , in a system that predates colonial rule .
The word of these traditional rulers weighs heavily -- not only in numerous local decisions but sometimes at the national level .
In 2016 , a new constitution created the National Chamber of Kings and Traditional Chiefs to give official recognition to their place in society along with a consultative role .
Six hundred kilometres ( about 350 miles ) to the north of Azaguie , the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed neighbourhood leaders from around the community of more than 3,000 habitants .
Gbini is a poor village near the border with Mali .
It has no electricity and thus no loudspeakers .
Public meetings take place despite the risk of the virus .
BAN ON GOLD MINING  " I ask you to wash your hands with soap or with ( hydroalcoholic ) sanitiser , which is a product sold in pharmacies , " said the chief , wearing a long , pale green robe .
He patiently spoke in Senoufo , the local language , then repeated his words in Malinke for the benefit of Malians in the village .
" Go and tell people that they must avoid gatherings .
We have to close the canteens , the bars where there are often prostitutes .
Prayers in mosques and churches are suspended .
We need to pray at home .
"  But the toughest tidings were yet to come for people who make a living from " dadaba " , a name for artisanal gold mining .
" As of today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Young people erupted in protest , arguing that they could not live without the money , but the chief was firm .
" Those who do not respect this decision will have to leave the village .
"  ' SPIT ON YOUR HANDS '  In Azaguie , the king also wrestled with rumbles of discontent .
" We work to get the word out to avoid the virus coming here .
But we need help .
The simplest things are hard , " he said .
" They say ' Wash your hands ' .
We have no sanitiser , but we have no ( running ) water either .
How do you wash your hands without water ? Should we spit on our hands ? "  One of those serving the king , Maurice Boua Akoucha , said food was a huge concern .
" People speak of confinement , of staying at home .
But there are no accompanying measures .
What will kill more than the virus is hunger .
If this lasts , what do we eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Africa is not Europe or China , which have resources .
And even there , there have been many deaths , " Akoucha warned .
