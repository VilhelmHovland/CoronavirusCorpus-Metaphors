a lot that will emerge from this , on both a macro and micro level and teams will be written about the sociological impact One strand I 've been thinking about is this ; in the weeks before schools and businesses closed there was a sudden drop off in A&amp;E attendance , plus a massive drop in patients on trollies .
One of the primary reasons cited was because there was a huge dip in referrals from Doctors .
There are other reasons as too many people use hospitals for issues that are in reality non issues .
My thoughts are that many referrals are done because of fear ( not laziness ) because doctors are scared of legal action by patients and are passing the point of blame to hospitals .
But why are they doing this ? Because we , as a society , have allowed the legal and insurance industry to impact how society runs to such a level that society can no longer run properly .
This needs to be addressed .
This is not a uniquely Irish issue .
This is not just a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reevaluate ourselves , which is more important , a healthy health service or the legal and insurance industries to the detriment of all that is good in society .

on in the world ' , ' make a go of yourself ' , ' get ahead of the game ' , become a ' success ' etc are the slogans of our culture , being pushed by media , politicians , colleges and incessant advertising .
Those who enrich themselves are put forward as role models and given space in the public arena to put forward their essentially selfish philosophy .
Until we change the record and promote the social values of caring and sharing , nothing will change .
This covid calamity is also an opportunity for those who value community over self , society of selfishness to change things for the better by showing that helping others and working together is better for all than looking to ' get ahead ' .

suitably qualified people under legal social contract to advise and govern , would ensure transparency with the use of the Internet , TV and Radio .
Devolving decision-making to our citizens creates collectivism and solidarity thus safeguarding justice and civil rights for all .
