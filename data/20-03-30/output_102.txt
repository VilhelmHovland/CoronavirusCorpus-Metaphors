A vast reimagining of the economy with self sufficiency at its heart will replace globalised free market dogma as an economic philosophy .
A UBI replacing all benefits with fully funded public services designed to help and not punish will be required with enormous investment into a self sufficient economic Tino rangatiratanga .
The realisation that we need economic sovereignty to empower a functioning State that has the resources to protect us from external shocks in a world being defined by external shocks can have powerful consequences politically , culturally and economically .
Capitalist monopolies in energy , transport and finance have to be brought into public ownership and control .

The Left have an opportunity in front of them to reshape the neoliberal structure , the question is do we have the courage and intellect to be able to do it ? Ever since Labour betrayed us in the 1980s , the Left have refused to reengage with the free market debate because they are fearful of the vicious idealogical war it inspired , this crisis demands those fears are pushed aside for serious reconsideration .
Increasingly having independent opinion in a mainstream media environment which mostly echo one another has become more important than ever , so if you value having an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donate here .

Let 's all put it out there .
It 's the workers who are on the front line of this virus keeping us all fed and cared for if we get ill .
Not the rich who have decamped to their bunkers or holiday homes .
* Capitalist monopolies in energy , transport and finance have to be brought into public ownership and control .
They should be subject to democratic plans drawn up by the whole community .
Workers should have much stronger decision making powers within them .
" Winter energy payments " are a terrible indictment of the deregulation of the energy sector .
And let 's not forget Air NZ -- do n't you just love their present model of " privatize the profits , socialize the losses " ?  * All economic sectors to be made take steps needed to decarbonise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net emissions by 2030 .
Shunt this one down the priorities list .
Achieving zero emissions here wo n't make a blind bit of difference to the planet while the US , China and India continue to pump vast quantities of carbon into the atmosphere .
* Free and frequent public transport on electric buses and/or trains in all main cities .
Subsidized public transport YES would be feasible .
But with the low density of most NZs cities , the cost of " free and frequent " public transport would be astronomical .
* Health care and education for life should be free and universally accessible .
Again , have you any idea of the cost of universal free health care for life ? Heavily subsidized universal healthcare YES might be feasible .
As for education , YES the scandal of school " donations " must end .
University education should be free , but with rigorous academic entry requirements -- the present funding model requires universities to enroll many students who should n't be there , leading to compromised academic standards .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart rethink .
A problem with taxation on wealth is of course that wealthy people with clever lawyers will look for creative ways to hide their assets , reducing the tax-take and increasing administrative and enforcement costs .
I wonder if it might help if we gave companies and wealthy individuals some say in how their tax dollars were spent -- maybe invite them to choose from an array of options including local schools , hospitals etc .
And I 'm certainly NOT thinking of this as a PR exercise for the wealthy and companies -- rather , a matter of private satisfaction for them .
Unrealistic ? I really do n't know .
* Public housing at fixed and affordable rents should be a right of all not just the desperately poor .
Public housing a right for all ? At fixed rents ? Seriously , comrade ? Let 's move on to the next one .
* All workers should have a right to a job and the workweek reduced with no loss of pay to make that possible .
How can a government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless everyone works for the state ? You might consider moving to Vietnam or North Korea , comrade .
* Local communes should be supported for control and delivery of as many functions of the centralised state as possible -- including housing , education , health care .
* Local communes to support cooperative forms of production of food , solar and wind energy , electric transport , and media .
Why not ? While it 's hard to imagine a lot of angloceltic Kiwis signing up for life on a commune , the marae model is already there as a base .
@ N ? Do you mean that as a negative ? If so ? What 's wrong with Cuba ? The riche bankster pimping yanks went there and shat all over the Cubans so the Cubans kicked their arses out ? What 's wrong with that ? Go the Cubans I say .
Are you wearing a Che Guevara T shirt or are you wearing a donald trump T shirt ?  Neither of those t-shirts is particularly appealing .
But you do realise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no new cars ( or parts ) , no new computers , no new TV 's , no readily affordable clothes/shoes , no pharmaceuticals , no mobile phones ( actually that would be a big plus ) etc .
We 're effectively exchanging all those things listed above that they produce in surplus for the things we produce in surplus .
In our case , that would be the primary sector .
And to do that in a manner to lift everyone 's standard of living , we need our primary export market to be a V8 that fires on ALL cylinders , not a broken two-stroke motor that only occasionally starts .
Martyn 's prescription is going to turn us into a slightly more modern version of Cuba ( which is perfectly fine for some course , but I doubt the average NZer is eager for it ) .

I do n't know .
Taxation probably also needs a smart rethink .
A problem with taxation on wealth is of course that wealthy people with clever lawyers will look for creative ways to hide their assets , reducing the tax-take and increasing administrative and enforcement costs .

I jumped up and ran outside and looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more completely and totally with your Post @ MB .
In fact ? If you go back through some of my comments you will see a similar sentiment throughout .
Forget wall st .
Forgetaboutit .
We , as a country are unique and they are irrelevant .
We must cut the banksters off from our $6 billion and arrest and take into custody roger douglas pending his trial .
Then our SIS/GCSB/SAS must hunt down his known associates then freeze their assets and hold them in custody too .
That , is the first thing we must do .
Fuck with letting the little prick/s away with anything .
Then ? Every single thing you suggest above .
Farmers ? I 'd suggest you sharpen your plowshares because here comes demand ! You 'll no longer be hindered by crushing debts swindled onto you by fat freaks in suits spreading Blue Herpies .
You 'll no longer have to watch as your money 's drained off and away to some foreign fucker .
While some of you might despair at us seemingly hurtling to a terrible demise , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' Them 's ' .
They 'll not go quietly .
With what Dr Doom has recently ' predicted ' .
The US has reacted too slow and too late to steer this virus off .
A recession for the US is a definite and a depression is likely .
The bounce in the US stock market is just that and the US Treasury does nt have anymore fire power left because buyers of US Bonds are few and far between , meaning , they wo n't be able to guarantee their bonds and the Feds money printing habit and this is why the Billionaires are nt playing the game like they use to .
They too are cashing in , gold is on a slide , bitcoin tanked , pump &amp; dump(ed) .
The ' Rain Man ' Ray Dalio ; market makers are saying if he ca n't make it rain , nobody can .
The EU is impotent and China is going to have to create a supply problem to stave off domestic inflation .
Putting a leash on trade growth/expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash the oil price and keep it below $30USD/brl to kill off US Fracking/Shale Oil .
NZ being a wart on the arse end of the big blue bubble has got a good credit score but thats no good when nobody is lending ?  The 2600 billionaires have sucked up the worlds liquidity and done a runner ! Corporate parasitic companies are dead in the water , buried in debt .
Mike Hosking is a tinfoil hat for the neoliberal apologist .
Mr Hosking underlies the systemic problems in neoliberalism , he 's dramatic and headline grabbing but it 's important to understand the underlying systemic problems that was exposed by Winston choosing Labour over National .
It 's low key racism and a kind of rendering parts of the economy into subdominant secondary positions which is also sexist , but it 's very old .
The neoliberal social and work view is out of date .
For one , the limitation on the economy and politicos was that you had to convert people for an economy where sales just is n't there any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do stuff people need and that takes a lot of mingling .
Flattening the curve does n't just mean level 4 restriction for 4 weeks and then take our foot off , it means redoubling efforts into public health initiatives to keep infection rates down , as much as practicable .
Nowadays , New Zealand face energy challenges , medical challenges , immigration and tourism can no longer be relied on .
The government is trying to pump billions into the economy but there 's no where to spend it besides into a grocery duopoly between Foodstuff and I forget the other one .
The neoliberal response is also very old , it is rooted in long lasting religion and culture we all know this .
Neoliberalism promised prosperity , unity fraternity , democracy and in this corona crises it has failed to deliver .
The crucial problem that needs to be addressed is the distribution of wealth between employer and employee .
Clearly Mike Hosking 's has huge psychological problems with employees getting a fair shake and he has horrible ideas of how to practice his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and problems in the media .
But it 's neoliberalism that put him there with his vast problems .
What do I mean well first of all the employer can deprive the employee of PPE , penalty rates for working through a public health crises and now they can simply with hold pay because essential services have to continue or people will die .
This situation is made to order for Mike Hoskings neoliberal apologies , business over the people and employers over employees .
That 's an extraordinary power to have over people , the power over who eats , lives and who dies all in the hands of the neoliberal apologist , no longer .
