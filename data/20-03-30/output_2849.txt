Protecting Your Relationship in the Shadow of Coronavirus  3 keys may make all the difference in your relationship right now .
The coronavirus raises new challenges for our most cherished relationships .
There are three keys that my colleagues and I have stressed in our work to help couples .
i They are simple to remember and potent .
They may help you now .
Do your part .
Decide , do n't slide .
Make it safe to connect .
These three keys could frame a public health campaign but my focus here is on a relationship health campaign , the relationship you have with your spouse , mate , or partner .
These ideas will also apply to any relationship that matters dearly to you .
Do your part .
COVID-19 has introduced massive uncertainties and stress into our lives .
So many things feel out of control because they are .
As ever , we do best when we focus on what we can do in our relationship over what we think our partner should do .
You can influence your partner but you can only control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
To be sure , there are times when one partner needs to confront , challenge , or nudge the other about their behavior .
That can also be doing your part , but in day-to-day moments , we do best to focus on what we can do to make a difference .
What things can you do to strengthen and protect your relationship during this time ?  Decide , do n't slide .
There are two applications of this key , one about transitions and one about moments .
Transitions : People often slide through potentially life-altering relationship transitions .
To understand how much this can matter , consider two fundamental aspects of commitment : dedication and constraint .
Dedication is about the " want to .
" It encompasses the desire for a future together , the will to sacrifice for one another , and having an identity of being a couple ( in addition to being individuals ) .
In contrast , constraints reflect the mix of things that would be either costs and losses of leaving or poor alternatives .
Constraints can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship .
If you have a great marriage , you have a lot of constraints .
If you have a damaging , dangerous , awful marriage , you likely also have a lot of constraints .
Constraints can be chosen or not , and that makes all the difference in understanding commitment .
Commitment is making a choice to give up other choices .
It is choosing to be constrained because you believe in the path you are choosing .
Deciding .
In contrast , sliding often increases constraints but they are not chosen as much as experienced , as inertia grows and nudges one forward on a path not clearly chosen .
When a transition can deeply impact what follows , it 's worth deciding and not sliding .
COVID-19 presents a massive transitional moment , maybe unrivaled since World War II .
At home , routines are disrupted , and roles that had worked great for years may not work well now .
With disruption , it 's time ( and opportunity ) for discussions and decisions .
You do not need to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth talking about the things where not sharing can lead to consequential sliding .
You do n't want to lose options without making a choice .
Here are a few ideas .
Who does this , who does that , in this present time ?  How does working remotely affect you as a couple ?  If one of you is still working outside the home , how does that affect you both or the family ? Is there added risk and concern ? How can you work together coping with that ?  What does positive time together look like now ?  Money , income , debt -- are there things better to have decided than let slide ?  If you think about it a bit , you will know what should be on your list .
Realize that decisions can be re-decided as things change .
That 's a strength , not a weakness .
And , slides can be converted to decisions you both share .
Moments : " Decide , do n't slide " also pertains to moments where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something go , or even do something to show you care .
Many are on edge and worried .
Fuses are short .
One says X , the other hears Y , and off you go into an argument or , almost worse , a missed opportunity to connect .
In these moments , sliding is the easy but costly path .
My colleagues and I teach couples to take time outs to protect their relationship from things going awry .
I do n't mean " go-sit-in-the-corner " social distancing .
I mean the type of time out a team calls when they need to stop their ragged play and reset their game -- as a team .
One person can use this concept to stop a slide to the bad side : " I 'm not at my best right now but I know we should talk about this .
Can we a little break and come back to this in a bit ? " That can work , especially if the " come back " part happens .
It works all the better if both partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal for when taking a time out is the smart play -- like using the words " time out " in a constructive way .
" I would like it if we took a time out on this for a little bit .
"  One member of the team should not keep dribbling when the other is trying to get a time out called .
There are so many other moments where a decision will beat a slide .
Do n't try to " decide " about everything , but look for the moments and at the issues where deciding beats sliding .
Make it safe to connect .
Types of safety can describe the foundations of good relationships .
Physical safety is freedom from fear , physical harm , and control .
If you feel unsafe in your relationship , there are people at the National Domestic Violence Hotline who would want to help ( US number : 1-800-799-7233 ) .
Emotional safety is being able to talk and share , to feel accepted ; it 's having and giving support and acknowledgment .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest relationship .
It 's also easily damaged .
Change , worry , and exhaustion create the perfect conditions for nasty comments , criticism , cold distance , or avoidance -- all things that damage emotional safety .
Escalation , where little arguments grow to big conflicts , is a hallmark of a couple not being able to maintain emotional safety .
My colleagues and I have written for decades about various patterns that represent " communication danger signs , " while similar patterns were more creatively named the " four horsemen of the apocalypse " by John Gottman .
That is pretty fine language for our times .
I 'm a little envious .
You make it safe to connect by doing your part to make it so you both feel heard , loved , accepted , and secure .
That means communicating well , reigning in the harsh words , listening , and showing care .
Here are just a few more ideas :  Do you struggle to communicate well under normal circumstances ? Learn to do that better .
There are many ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning on YouTube .
Cut your partner and your children some slack .
React less .
Listen more .
More margin , less edge .
Get good at some form of time out .
Hug more ( observing proper social distancing , where appropriate ) .
This is an unusually direct suggestion that some of you may find useful , and I freely announce my conflict of interest in making it .
If you have a little extra time , and you want to learn some strategies for strengthening your relationship right now , we have an online version of our program for couples at lovetakeslearning .
It 's not expensive .
It 's an option .
One among many .
Consider this the moment in your life where you have the opportunity to raise your game as a couple and a family .
Three keys .
You might need only one to get through the gate .

I note this as a conflict of interest statement .
