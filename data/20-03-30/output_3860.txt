Limerick Bishop : Ireland will ' up its game ' in coronavirus fight  BISHOP of Limerick Brendan Leahy said as a general public , Ireland will " up its game " to limit the impact of coronavirus here .
Speaking after the weekly Mass in St John 's Cathedeal this Sunday , Bishop Leahy said that the new measures introduced by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Friday night there is a need to " go to another level " ro protect the vulnerable .
He said Limerick people need to all they can to ensure health services , especially Intensive Care Units can cope with what 's ahead .
Everyone , he said , must buy into this , he said , and he was encouraged by the response of the public yesterday and today .
" It has been " , he said , " a clear sign that we are willing to dig deeper to help avoid the horror being experienced in other nations , including close to home in Italy and Spain .
"  But , he stressed , we can not let our guard down in this at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We got the sad news yesterday that 14 people have lost their lives .
Today there will most likely be more and we pray for them and their families at this very sad time , " the Bishop added .
He said the lockdown , and the response to it , has been " a collective statement of intent that we are willing to do what it takes .
"  " If we look to Italy and the horrific scenes there and scenes also coming out of Spain , it 's easy to visualise just how bad the outcome will be if do n't dig deep now .
The words of one priest last night interviewed on CNN hit deep and hard .
He said ' the sick were all alone as they lay dying .
They were people who died without anyone to hear or see them , without the possibility to talk to their loved ones , no one to comfort them , " he said .
Ireland does n't want to be a country like that , he said , " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the mark .
"  He added his voice to the calls for peop ; le to remain home except for absolutely essential reasons .
" Wash your hands when you have to go out and do it on return .
Keep your physical disrance when those essential trips out have to be made , " Bishop Leahy added .
Those in need of assistance such as daily provisions , prescriptions , information are asked to call a helpline - 1800 832 005 -- while people who want to volunteer are asked to email volunteer@limerick .
Bishop Leahy also had a special word for healthcare workers across the system and spoke of his own special thoughts for those working in the nationwide network of nursing homes and , particularly , their residents and patients .
" With so many elderly and sick residents living in these homes , we have to pray that they be spared the worst effects of the virus .
Let 's pray that the wonderful efforts of their health carers protect as many of them as possible and that those same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in our prayers , our thoughts and daily applause .
We pray too that they are safe , " he concluded .
