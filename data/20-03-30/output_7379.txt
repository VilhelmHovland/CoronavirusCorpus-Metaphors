Health workers have expressed alarm at lack of access to personal protective equipment ( PPE ) including masks , gowns and hand sanitiser .
Industry group Manufacturing New Zealand said the idea was to boost production to keep health workers safe from Covid-19 .
At the same time , McGuinness Institute thinktank has set up a website with a register , to help in case the national pandemic supplies of PPE were not enough .
Manufacturing New Zealand executive director Catherine Beard said : " The government was keen to get better visibility of what manufacturing capability we have in New Zealand to produce PPE , so we 've provided this clear list .
" Some of them will be already manufacturing in this PPE area , but some will be doing other things but can tweak their manufacturing .
"  If you have symptoms of the coronavirus , call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 ( +64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs ) or call your GP - do n't show up at a medical centre  Seventy businesses were on the register and more would be added daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register gave businesses more chance to link up with each other to make masks , gowns or even ventilators , and gave the government and health workers a better idea of who could do what , Beard said .
