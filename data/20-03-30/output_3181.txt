Doug Ford Warns Of Medical Supply Shortage If COVID-19 Cases Surge  Ontario has more than 1,700 cases of the novel coronavirus .
TORONTO -- Ontario reported 351 new COVID-19 cases and 10 new deaths Monday , as Premier Doug Ford warned that the province could soon face a shortage of critical medical supplies .
Officials are " working every contact we have " to secure more equipment such as masks and gloves for front-line workers , Ford said , but the more time Ontario gets to prepare , the more lives will be saved .
" It will take time for local production to ramp up and for new supplies to reach us , " Ford said .
" The reality is if there 's a massive surge of people coming into our hospitals in the next two weeks , our supply lines will be seriously challenged .
"  About 10 per cent of people in the province who have tested positive for COVID-19 so far have been hospitalized , provincial figures show .
There are 100 people in intensive care units right now who are confirmed to have COVID-19 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical officer of health Dr .

The new total of cases in the province is now at 1,706 -- including 431 resolved cases and 33 deaths .
Yaffe said information on the 10 new deaths is incomplete at the moment , but the regions that have seen more deaths include Haliburton , Lambton , Haldimand Norfolk and Huron Perth .
She could n't say if the Haliburton death was related to a nursing home outbreak in the region .
Seven deaths at one nursing home  Seven of the province 's deaths occurred in one nursing home in Bobcaygeon , which the Haliburton , Kawartha , Pine Ridge District Health Unit believes is the largest outbreak in the province .
At least 24 staff members are infected , with another 10 awaiting test results .

Long-Term Care Minister Merrilee Fullerton said she is looking at more intense screening for long-term care homes and more advanced ways to isolate people infected at those facilities .
Ontario 's chief medical officer of health strongly recommended Monday that everyone in the province -- especially people over 70 and with compromised immune systems -- stay home except for essential reasons .
" The lives of many Ontarians , especially our community 's most vulnerable citizens , ( are ) in your hands and will depend on your actions over the coming days and weeks , " Dr .

As of Monday the number stood at 5,651 .
The number of resolved cases had been stuck at eight for many days , but health officials had said to expect a large jump once the data caught up to a new definition for resolved .
