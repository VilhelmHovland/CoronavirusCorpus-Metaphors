We 've survived week two of social distancing , and homeschooling , but I still feel like I 'm mostly stumbling around coming to terms with our new reality .
We do n't know a thing about homeschooling our five boys who range in age from three to twenty-three but we 're doing our best ( although can we really call what we 're doing " homeschooling " since our kids still have teachers doing the hard work of creating and grading their work ? )  This feels like the right time to pause to praise teachers everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them for granted .
As I 've scrolled social media and spent hours on the phone with friends , it 's become clear that some moms feel like they 're crushing it right now and other moms feel like they 're being crushed .
I know moms who are savoring this season and I know moms who are barely surviving .
To be honest , where I land depends on the hour of the day ( and , well , the number of hysterical memes that have been texted to me ) but more often than not , I have found myself having to fight to find the good .
But as we 've learned new rhythms and put new systems in place to survive parenting in this pandemic , I 've begun to wonder , " What if we want to do more than just survive this ? What if I can actually parent well in this pandemic ? What would it look like to take small steps toward finding the good and practicing gratitude each day ? What if we used this time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and serve others more ? What if we lowered the bar of impossible standards and really learned what it means to give ourselves grace ? "  For one , my boys are bonding and becoming more than brothers .
They are becoming better friends ( though this has been not without its usual blow-ups ! ) Just keeping it real ! There have been other answered prayers , but even If their evolving friendship was the lone benefit , it would be enough .
Among the most hilarious posts I 've seen about how parents are fighting to survive , I 've also read posts that break my heart .
We parents sometimes forget our kids have ears , and eyes , and feelings , and we post words that suggest we 'd rather die than be trapped in our homes with our children because we have far more important things to be doing , or because they are simply intolerable .
I get it .
This is hard , and I 've done my fair share of entrusting my frustrations to friends in private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is the next level .
I 've had to " take a moment " more times than I can count .
But let 's not forget our kids are listening - and learning - about what we value and where our hope comes from .
Meanwhile , we have our own real worries and big fears to manage .
You know what I 'm talking about .
You still have bills to pay and jobs to do -- or you 've lost your job .
There are also neighbors to care for and parents to look after .
What has been profoundly helpful for me is remembering that God remains sovereign over it all .
He is n't freaking out and He has n't checked out .
My husband still has a company to run and I still have a book deadline to meet .
So while I may not know your unique pressures in this pandemic , I know we both carry the responsibility of framing our pressures in a healthy way so our children have a strong sense of stability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own anxiety will have a meaningful impact on how our kids manage theirs .
What has been profoundly helpful for me is remembering that God remains sovereign over it all .
He is n't freaking out and He has n't checked out .
He is still wholly good and in control .
He is not to blame for our suffering , but He will bring good from it , and He will bring hearts back to Himself through it .
We read this promise in 2 Chronicles 7:14 : " For if my people who are called by my name humble themselves , and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways , then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land .
"  There is grace for us .
We will say things we wish we could take back .
Yes , we will do this because we will feel like we 're falling apart .
And we will make mistakes .
And we will have regrets .
And this wo n't mean we 're bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are ! ) and it wo n't mean we do n't love our children with all we are ( because we wholeheartedly do ! ) .
It just means we 're human and we need the supernatural strength of God like never before !  Also , we do n't have to be all the things .
We actually ca n't .
Our role in this season is n't to be our child 's Savior .
Our role to be their imperfect parent .
And even on the days when we feel like we 're doing a terrible job , I bet we 're doing better than we think .
If our children know they are loved by us , and more importantly by God , we are doing a good job .
We are doing enough .
Everything we need to meet the demands of this new season are given to us by God .
He will manifest His strength in our weakness .
He will stand by us and uphold us through the power of His Spirit within us .
" Our God of hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the power of the Holy Spirit we may abound in hope .
" ( Romans 15:13 )  As we navigate the unknowns , and we feel pushed past our limits , and we look in the mirror only to find our face worn and weary with the day 's demands , let 's turn to God 's Word and read the relief God promises and find the strength God provides .
Who God is , which is sovereign , and what He gives us , which is grace , is enough to carry us through this .
When we 're exhausted and overwhelmed He wants us to rely on Him to be all that we need .
Parenting is actually meant to -- designed to -- deepen our dependence on Him so that our children can witness what is only possible through the power of God .
So can all the mamas and papas agree to a whole lot of grace in the days ahead ? Grace for ourselves and grace for our kids .
Giving ourselves grace might mean our kids will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets will overflow .
Our refrigerators will be bare .
Our tempers will flare .
But somewhere in there let 's remember we can say sorry , we can be met by new mercy every morning , and we can still love extravagantly because love covers a multitude of mistakes .
We do n't have to be perfect for our kids , we just have to point them to the One who still is .
We are free from the pressure to pull this off perfectly , and in letting go of the unrealistic expectations we put on ourselves , we just might find ourselves enjoying what we 've stopped trying to control .
