COVID-19 : NCDC takes over treatment of Benue index case  The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) has taken over the treatment of the Index case of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) in Benue State .
Deputy Governor Benson Abounu disclosed this while briefing newsmen following the controversy that has trailed the index case , identified as Mrs Susan Okpe , regarding whether she had actually tested positive for the virus .
Abounu , who is Chairman of the State Action Committee on COVID-19 , revealed that the state government in conjunction with the NCDC had decided to take the victim 's blood sample for another test .
Social media has been awash with stories of how Mrs Okpe had debunked claims that she had tested positive for the virus , claiming she was being unjustly detained at an isolation centre .
She further raised the alarm that she was unjustly pronounced positive for COVID-19 even when she was not shown the result of her blood sample by the state government .
However , reacting swiftly to the claims on Monday evening , the Benue deputy governor said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom for her mother 's burial and had reported to the hospital on Tuesday .
" When the MD saw a young doctor taking her vital signs and overheard that she had just returned from the UK , he asked that she should not be discharged .
He then reported to the state government .
It was discovered that she had a fever and temperature higher than normal with a persistent cough .
" I was briefed on Wednesday and by Thursday her sample was taken and sent to Abuja alongside that of a 21-year-old patient which came negative while Okpe 's came positive .
" When her result came , the committee moved to the hospital and asked that she be transferred to a treatment centre and between 2 pm to 7 pm she refused .
Then I went to the hospital and pleaded with her to be moved to the BSUTH and she finally agreed at about 9 pm .
" She eventually agreed after I spoke with two of her brothers .
Doctors visited her at the isolation centre yesterday and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building she 's staying is a new building and the bed she 's sleeping on is brand new .
She 's unwell and our duty is to counsel her .
We understand why she 's agitated .
" She 's on her way to recovery as her temperature has been normal and she 's not been coughing for the past three days .
Her samples would be taken again and sent to Abuja for test and if it comes negative , she will be released into self-isolation , and when a second test is conducted and she 's negative she can then be released to go , " Abounu explained .
He went on to dispel insinuations that her identity was revealed to stigmatise her , stressing that her name was mentioned because it was an emergency situation and it was necessary to mention her name and save lives .
The deputy governor urged those who have been in contact with the index case , especially members of the planning committee for her mother 's burial , as well as her younger sister who was with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended to her , to self-isolate for 14 days or report to the state COVID-19 committee if they showed any symptoms .
Also speaking on the controversy , NCDC representative Prof Stephen Abah said that the committee had been working with the state team .
" I 've been to the treatment centre and can confirm that they are following the protocol to the latter .
We already have an index case in Benue and NCDC is interested in the case , " he said .
