MONTGOMERY , Ala .
( WSFA ) - The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging a state health ordered issued Friday that forces dental , medical and surgical procedures to be postponed amid the coronavirus pandemic .
The lawsuit was filed Monday on behalf of Dr .
Yashica Robinson and three independent abortion clinics : the Alabama Women 's Center , Reproductive Health Services and West Alabama Women 's Center .
The order , which is in effect until April 17 at 5 p .
, includes exceptions for treatment of an " emergency medical condition " or to " avoid serious harm from an underlying condition .
"  The plaintiffs feel the language in the order permits pre-viability abortions .
However , according to the lawsuit , Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has n't provided guidance on how the health order should be interpreted .
" However , as of Sunday afternoon , the Attorney General refused to provide any further guidance as to how it is interpreting the scope of the Order other than to make plain that in its view some -- and perhaps most -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear , however , that violation of the March 27 Order carries criminal penalties , " the lawsuit states .
Marshall released a statement Monday saying the order applies to all healthcare facilities , and it will be " enforced uniformly against all violators .
"  " At a time when all Americans are making significant sacrifices to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus , it is remarkable that one class of providers demands to be treated differently than all others , " Marshall said .
" Abortion clinics want an exemption , yet they are by no means exempt from the known risks of spreading the virus in crowded waiting rooms , depleting scarce personal protective equipment that should be reserved for those treating the virus , and transferring patients with complications to already overburdened hospitals .
