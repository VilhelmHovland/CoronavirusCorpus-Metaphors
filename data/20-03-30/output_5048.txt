Few people know where the chickens are kept their locations are undisclosed as a matter of national security .
Each day , hundreds of thousands of their eggs are trucked to facilities , where they are protected by guards and multimillion-dollar , government-funded security systems .
But these eggs are n't for breakfast ; they 're the source of your common flu shot .
For the past 80 years , much of the world has relied on chicken eggs for the production of influenza vaccines .
About 174 .
million doses of the flu vaccine were distributed across the US this flu season through the end of February , of which an estimated 82% were egg-based , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
With each egg producing one vaccine , that means the US might have used 140 million eggs this flu season alone .
To prepare for annual flu seasons , as well as possible pandemics , the US government has invested tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the past 15 years to ensure there are enough eggs for vaccines .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus , which has infected more than 423,000 people globally and killed more than 19,000 since the virus emerged last December , according to Johns Hopkins University .
There is no vaccine yet for the virus ; and because it 's different than the influenza virus , traditional methods like using eggs wo n't work .
As scientists race to find a cure , the huge US stockpile of eggs wo n't be of any help .
The rise of the egg-based vaccine  Scientists started exploring the use of eggs in vaccine production in the 1930s .
Researchers in England conducted the first trials on their armed forces in 1937 , and the year after the US found it could protect its military with the flu shot .
A working egg-based vaccine was ready for the US public by the 1940s .
Here 's how it works today : The US CDC and other labs partner with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to choose certain virus strains to send to private vaccine manufacturers .
The flu can mutate and strains can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flu season .
The selected virus is injected into a fertilized hen 's eggs , where it incubates and replicates for a few days -- just as it would do inside a human host .
Scientists then harvest fluid containing the virus from the egg .
They inactivate the virus so it can no longer cause disease , and purify it , leaving scientists with the virus antigen .
The antigen is the crucial element -- it 's a substance released by the virus that triggers your immune system to respond .
That 's how the vaccine prepares your immune system for a real infection .
The entire process , from the arrival of the egg to the publicly available vaccine , takes at least six months , according to the CDC .
The government gets its vaccines from a handful of manufacturing companies , which source their eggs from numerous farms in secret locations .
The farms ' locations are " proprietary information , " said a spokesperson from Sanofi Pasteur , the biggest flu vaccine manufacturer in the US , citing " security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) spent $42 million on a three-year contract with one company to ensure a year-round supply of high-quality eggs , according to a 2017 report from the US Government Accountability Office ( GOA ) .
That 's just one company from one time period ; the HHS began contracting a handful of manufacturers and egg farms in 2005 , meaning there are likely many more contracts worth tens of millions of dollars .
And these eggs are precious : if the supply chain is compromised , it could mean a nationwide shortage of crucial flu vaccines .
So , obviously , the eggs have bodyguards .
Part of that $42 million contract required that the vaccine manufacturer had " both a physical security program and a biosecurity program to provide protection against man-made and natural threats , " according to the GOA report .
That might seem like a lot of money to spend on eggs , but each year the flu costs the US about $10 .
billion in hospitalizations and treatments , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful for flu vaccines -- they could potentially be used to develop vaccines for other illnesses , said Leo Poon , head of public health laboratory sciences at Hong Kong University ( HKU ) .
It just depends on the illness , as some virus strains ca n't incubate inside eggs .
Why the egg method wo n't work for a coronavirus vaccine  As the coronavirus pandemic spreads , scientists and governments around the world are racing to develop a vaccine -- but eggs wo n't be the answer , said John Nicholls , a Hong Kong University clinical professor of pathology .
Due to having different receptors and other characteristics , the novel coronavirus is n't able to replicate inside eggs the way flu viruses can , Nicholls said .
Even beyond the immediate problem of the coronavirus , US officials have been pushing for non-egg alternatives in recent years .
US President Donald Trump signed an executive order last September requiring health agencies to expand the use of alternative production methods .
One reason officials are looking elsewhere is the six-month production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness spread globally during that time , but the virus injected into the egg could mutate and make the vaccine less effective , said Poon .
Another issue is that the supply is vulnerable to deadly avian flus .
" If there 's a pandemic of H5N1 ( avian influenza ) , it can kill chickens substantially and there will be a huge drop in egg supply , and you will have a problem getting enough eggs to make the vaccines , " Poon said .
The GOA report warned that it takes about 12 to 18 months to establish an egg supply large enough for either seasonal or pandemic influenza .
But in the case of a fast-spreading pandemic like this , authorities simply ca n't wait that long -- and there are n't that many chickens and eggs immediately available .
More than 20 potential coronavirus vaccines using a range of non-egg technologies are now in development , according to the WHO .
Some of these are mRNA vaccines , which direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper functioning of the body 's cells .
Others use recombinant DNA technology , which produces an exact genetic match to proteins of the virus , and can then rapidly produce large amounts of antigen .
Even companies that traditionally make egg-based flu vaccines are jumping into the mix ; Sanofi Pasteur said in February it was working on a non-egg coronavirus vaccine .
Health officials warn it will take at least a year before any coronavirus vaccine is proven effective and gets necessary approvals for widespread distribution .
Typically , clinical trials are broken into two phases .
Phase 1 , involving a few dozen people , would last about three months .
Phase 2 , involving hundreds of people , would last another six to eight months .
At least one Phase 1 coronavirus vaccine trial has now begun ; the US study gave a dose to the first participant on March 17 .
Over six weeks , each participant will receive two injections about a month apart in varying doses , to try to establish that the vaccine is safe and induces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still a lot we do n't know about the coronavirus , said Poon -- so the wide range of technologies being used to develop vaccines gives us a better shot at finding one that works .
" That 's why I say I appreciate diversity , " he said .
" You never know which one is going to work -- it 's dangerous to put all the eggs in one basket .
