Navigating the media chessboard amidst COVID-19  One of the fundamental things to understand about COVID-19 is that nobody in the world has a crystal ball that can accurately explain and predict the impact of the virus .
Governments , weak and strong , have been left scratching their heads as their healthcare systems buckle under the pressure .
As the total number of global cases approaches the one million mark , the machinery that regulates global economies has halted .
For Pakistan , difficult decisions were made to lock down certain parts of the country , with a focus on ensuring the mitigation of impact for particularly vulnerable groups , including daily wage workers .
The question slowly shifted from " what if " to " what now ? " To even a casual observer , it is unclear if the lockdown will end after the stipulated dates provided by various provincial governments .
Each day after another follows a clear " we 'll cross the bridge when we get to it " ethos .
Acknowledging Pakistanis ' finite attention span towards a series of players in the media industry that are tasked with generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalistic responsibility .
Just a few days ago , while purchasing some medicine , a man walked into the pharmacy and asked for chloroquine , mentioning how television channels were referring it to as a remedy for the virus .
The pharmacist , of a reasonably large pharmacy , let him know that the otherwise readily available drug was out of stock as people had panic purchased large stocks of it .
Two days later , American health and safety watchdogs warned against the usage of chloroquine , despite President Donald Trump tweeting about it as a magical fix-all drug .
So , in the middle of this entire fiasco , Prime Minister Imran Khan decides to invite senior journalists for a transparent session about steps the government is taking to combat the spread of COVID-19 .
Senior journalists , who likely have had relationships with multiple federal governments by this time , decided to ask complex economic questions and about the arrest of Mir Shakil .
Much like a classroom , they forced the role of the office of the prime minister to become that of a primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be described as sarcastic , condescending , and thinly veiled insults .
It was impressive to watch the prime minister remain calm during this all-out assault against his cabinet , the conversation leading to a direct question ,  To the journalism fraternity , their concerns and , perhaps even the delivery , may have been considered necessary .
Nobody 's feelings were ( hopefully ) hurt on television , yet it damages the nation and fails to inform the masses who are all looking on for facts , figures , precautionary measures , and what the government is doing to ensure their safety .
During routine issues any country faces , it is natural that every national stakeholder shall strive to maximise their political , social , and commercial capital .
This pandemic , especially for a struggling developing country , should not be an opportunity for partisan , divisive , or needlessly sensational rhetoric .
Pakistan has had its fair share of journalistic failures , a good example being a reporter telling Qamar Zaman Kaira about the untimely demise of his son during a live press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television networks continue to invite artists to dispense medical advice , religious clerics to encourage religious congregations ( something that has been discouraged in spirit by the government ) , and criminally dangerous analyses around the vast field of epidemiology .
COVID-19 , like any other virus , is faceless and without a targeted agenda , despite what many tinfoil conspiracy theorists would like to believe .
No country is fully prepared to deal with this pandemic , often relying on poorly extrapolated statistics based on raw data , which is not fully representative of the situation .
For Pakistan , no light can be seen from the end of the tunnel just yet , but with every misstep that the media takes , the nation moves further away from that light .
The prime minister , despite the failings of his government , has tried to console his people with messages .
Botched media jobs dilute the aforementioned messages and foment panic , which is why the media must play a role the nation needs , not one it arguably deserves .
