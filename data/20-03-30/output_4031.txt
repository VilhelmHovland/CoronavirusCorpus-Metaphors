" How do they expect us to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scrap season if it ca n't be finished by end of June- Kane  LONDON , United Kingdom , Mar 29 -- England captain Harry Kane said on Sunday the Premier League season should be cancelled if it can not be completed by the end of June because of the coronavirus pandemic .
The English top-flight is currently suspended until at least April 30 due to the COVID-19 outbreak , with a likely further delay to be announced soon .
There is no clear idea about when or if football will be able to resume , but Euro 2020 has been cancelled , which opens a window to bring domestic seasons to a conclusion in the summer .
But Tottenham striker Kane does not want Premier League chiefs to let the current campaign go past June or even the start of what would be the 2020-21 season in August , as has been suggested in some quarters .
" I know the Premier League will do everything they can to finish the season , and that they are looking at every option possible , " Kane said in an Instagram Live conversation with former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , we do need to try to finish the season .
But there needs to be a point where enough is enough .
" Playing into July or August and pushing next season back I do n't see too much benefit in that .
But obviously I do n't know too much about behind the scenes and financially .
" Probably the limit for me is the end of June .
If the season 's not completed by the end of June we need to look at the options and just look forward to next season .
"  Premier League matches could potentially be staged behind closed doors in a bid to complete this campaign once the current lockdown in Britain is over .
Kane does not think dragging out the season will help anyone though , especially if it delays the next term .
" The further this season is pushed on , it would have such a big knock-on effect for next season , with the Euros in 2021 , and even World Cup 2022 .
But that 's just my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary at the moment .
I know there still have to be plans in place , and I 'm sure everyone is trying to do that .
" All that is out of my hands though , there 's nothing I can do personally , so from my point of view we 've just got to wait and see what happens .
Hopefully this clears up as soon as possible , and we can try to get back to normal .
