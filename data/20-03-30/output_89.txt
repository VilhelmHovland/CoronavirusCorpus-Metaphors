Professor Yifan Chen working with microwave imaging that could detect COVID-19  University of Waikato Professor Dr Yifan Chen has been awarded a prestigious Engineering New Zealand Fellows Award .
Dr Yifan Chen is an internationally recognised academic leader , with a demonstrated history of working in renowned universities in China , New Zealand , the United Kingdom , Singapore and the United States .
He pioneered the emerging field of computational nanobiosensing , which involves smart tumour targeting using nanorobots .
These nanorobots perform ' agile ' searches for tumours by learning from the biological environment .
He has also made a significant contribution to the technological , clinical and commercialisation advancement in the area of microwave medical imaging and sensing .
This award recognises highly experienced professionals who have made a huge impact on engineering in New Zealand , and have inspired others within the profession .
" It is a great honour to receive this award , and have my contributions recognised by the leading engineering body in New Zealand , " says Professor Chen .
Professor Chen was the founding Head of the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is considered one of the best young universities in the world .
He built the department from scratch to 160 professional staff , and led the development of joint PhD programmes with top-tier universities around the world .
" Since joining the University of Waikato in 2017 , in my role as Associate Dean External Engagement for the Health , Engineering , Computing and Science Division , I have fostered external linkages with top universities and institutes , particularly in China , " says Professor Chen .
He has developed a wide range of electromagnetic medical examination technologies for low-cost healthcare , including microwave breast imaging , microwave stroke detection , and microwave cognitive impairment detection in collaboration with medical instrument companies and universities in the UK and China .
In particular , Professor Chen worked with ET Medical in Shenzhen , China to develop Asia 's first clinically relevant , commercial microwave radar breast scanners .
These are currently being trialled in China , with the trial being the first of its kind focusing on Asian women who usually have denser breasts than European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Chen has also been elected as a Fellow of the Institute of Engineering and Technology ( FIET ) due to his innovation in the area of wireless technologies in medical diagnostics , therapy and information transmission .
He is one of the youngest engineers to achieve this , as less than 50 engineers have achieved this status before the age of 40 .
He is also well-published , and has over 250 publications in the areas of computational nanobiosensing , molecular communications for nanobiomedicine , and electromagnetic medical imaging and sensing .
Professor Chen is engaged in several ongoing research projects , including one funded by the Ministry of Business , Innovation and Employment ( MBIE ) for $6m , looking at developing hand-held high-resolution medical imaging in conjunction with Lincoln Agritech , the University of Auckland and the Universit ? Nice Sophia Antipolis .
" As well as that project , I 'm also looking into a portable low-cost microwave brain scanner for stroke detection and recovery monitoring , and I am writing a book on ' Computational Nanobiosensing ' for Cambridge University Press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the market , " says Professor Chen .
Professor Chen was due to receive his award at a special Engineering New Zealand dinner at the end of March , however this has been postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak .
A new date will be provided later this year .
