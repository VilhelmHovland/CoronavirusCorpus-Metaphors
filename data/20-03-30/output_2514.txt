People can not be lockdown in hunger for a long time .
You are not the only government that gave such an order but governments all over the world are providing relief assistance to the people .

Both the Democrats and the Republicans in the Congress have buried their political differences and they are now working together .
This is what governance is all about .
I appeal to our governments to do likewise .
This will make us to trust them more as they are managing our commonwealth .
