The St .
Ann 's Academy grads turned engineering students ( Bates at the University of Waterloo , Seo at the University of Toronto ) self-isolated for two weeks upon returning in early March .
That 's when they brainstormed ideas on how to help .
" Things started to develop a little quicker out east , so when school was cancelled we came back here .
As soon as we got back , we knew that things would start to get bad here eventually , " Bates noted .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer platform .
"  The group is called Helpful Neighbor and they help people in need who ca n't or do n't want to leave their home during the pandemic .
In the last three weeks , Bates and Seo have built up a list of people in need , mainly seniors .
Bates started with his own grandma , who got the word out to her friends .
" She did n't want to go out , so I decided , ' Well , I 'll go get groceries and pick up her prescriptions , ' " Bates said .
" It kind of started there and she spread the word to her friends .
Then we reached out on Facebook to more of our community .
We 've been in several neighbourhood group chats .
We 've reached out to some friends at TRU , who have connections in the media .
"  To date , the group has been simply picking up people 's groceries and prescriptions .
But Bates says as the pandemic deepens , they have plans to expand their volunteerism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some simple activities , we can always coordinate help in that way , too , " he said .
In a short time , the two have people from all over the city sending emails either needing help or wanting to volunteer .
" As word-of-mouth spreads and people start to gain trust and hear about what we 're doing a little more , I think our group will grow a lot larger , " said Bates .
A dozen of Bates and Seo 's former high school classmates from St .
Ann 's have already stepped up and committed to helping .
They 're all just doing their parts to help their hometown .
" We had such an amazing childhood here , and coming back and realizing we 're in the position , in this case , where we are quite a bit less at risk than most people , " he said .
" So we saw that as an opportunity to give back to our community a little bit .
