In this post , we will discuss a very basic approach to scrape a news article on the web page and summarize it , along with a few more key information .
We will also explore how we can save this scraped and summarized result into a text file .

It is expected that you have basic knowledge of web scraping and natural language processing ( NLP ) .
For more information , you may refer to the following articles :  The task discussed above is implemented in Python .
Following is a step-by-step approach for this implementation .
For scraping and downloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to be installed .
You may use ' pip install newspaper ' in command prompt or ' conda install newspaper ' for installing in anaconda .
Once installed , import the required libraries .

nltk .
( 'punkt ' )  3 .

#prints the title of the articleprint ( " n " ) print ( " Article Text : " ) print(article .
#prints the entire text of the articleprint ( " n " ) print ( " Article Summary : " ) print(article .
#prints the summary of the articleprint ( " n " ) print ( " Article Keywords : " ) print(article .
#prints the keywords of the article  7 .
