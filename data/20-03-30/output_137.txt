Well placed now to break Covid chains  Here we are , in lockdown .
Have to say it did n't look all that different coming into the office this morning .
Horticulture work was getting under way on the Flats .
Our food has to keep being produced , of course , as does our wine many will be relieved to know , during this the industry 's most crucial time of the year .
The workers all have to keep two metres apart from each other and the businesses involved need to have Covid-19 hygiene standards in place , and reinforce health protection measures .
There was still a reasonable amount of traffic on the roads .
Hopefully that was all essential workers or people doing essential travel , but no doubt it will take some friendly and then stern warnings and fines to get the lockdown messages through to everyone .
In town , quite a few people were walking neighbourhood streets .
Probably a bit of sticky-beaking on this our first morning of the new stay-at-home norm under a national pandemic emergency , but we are encouraged to get out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keeping two metres of distance from anyone else .
A couple of people were lingering on street corners .
Anyone doing that is likely to be told to head home by a patrolling officer .
The Gisborne CBD was pretty much dead this morning .
Here at The Herald there are four of us in a newsroom that normally has up to 18 .
All our reporters bar one are working from their homes , as are most of our sub-editors and a proof-reader .
Downstairs it is also minimal staffing , with distancing and hygiene measures in place ; the team who handle the paper are wearing gloves .
Gloves are going out to our runners , who are being told not to hand-deliver any papers .
OK , to all of you at home : well done everyone .
We will all have varying levels of preparation for this lockdown , but can rest assured that essential services are continuing .
Supermarkets , pharmacies , health services , fuel stations and most dairies and food stores remain open , so when you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait , with spacing , to be allowed in ; and get used to being served from behind perspex glass when you do need to make purchases .
What we are all facing in this country will become clearer over the coming week as the now 1pm release of new Covid-19 cases are announced .
The number to watch is the suspected community transmissions .
We 're all doing this to keep that number down , and protect our most vulnerable .
