per cent  BREAKING : The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates to a historic low of 0 .
per cent in a bid to help ease pressure on the economy amid the coronavirus crisis .
The rare out-of-cycle meeting for the Reserve Bank saw rates drop by a quarter of a per cent on Thursday as part of the emergency measures .
It comes as the big banks negotiate a multi-billion rescue package for small businesses that could see taxpayers underwrite loans for companies on the brink of collapse .
Prime Minister Scott Morrison will this week announce the details of his second stimulus package , which is expected to focus on providing a safety net for small businesses and workers .

He said we were living in " extraordinary times " and were facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to wreak havoc on the local and global economy .
In response to this unprecedented crisis , the central bank has devised a package with several elements -- including cutting the cash rate to 0 .
per cent , setting a target for the yield on three-year government bonds , supplying credit to business and an adjustment in interest rates on accounts financial institutions hold with the RBA .
" Over recent decades , the Reserve Bank practice has been to target the cash rate , which forms the anchor point for the risk-free yield structure , " Mr Lowe explained .
" We 're now extending and complementing this by also targeting a risk-free interest rate further out along the yield curve .
" In particular , we 're targeting the yield on three-year Australian Government securities and we have set this target at around 0 .
per cent .
It 's the same as the cash rate .
"  Philip Lowe has fronted the media to explain the RBA 's game plan for tackling the crisis .

It is designed to lower funding costs for the entire banking system so that the cost of credit to households and businesses is low , and also to encourage lenders to support credit to businesses , especially small and medium-sized businesses .
" This is a priority issue for us .
Many small businesses are going to find coming months very difficult as their sales dry up and they support their staff .
Assisting small businesses through this period will help us build that bridge to the other side when the recovery does take place .
If Australia has lost lots of otherwise viable businesses through this period , making that recovery will be harder , " Mr Lowe said .
Under this new facility , authorised deposit-taking institutions will have access to at least $90 billion in funding .
And the fourth element is an adjustment to the interest rate on " exchange cement balances " .
" We operate a corridor system under the cash rate .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the RBA overnight in exchange settlement accounts earn an interest rate 25 basis points below the cash rate , " he said .
" On the other side of the corridor , in the event that a bank needed to borrow from the RBA overnight it would be charged an interest rates 25 basis points above the cash rate .
Under this arrangement , and with the cash rate now at 25 basis points , the interest rate on exchange settlement balances would have been at zero .
" We 've decided to increase this interest rate to 10 basis points .
"  Mr Lowe described these measures as the key that will help us " build a bridge " and eventually bounce back from the current disaster .
He said he expected the official cash rate to remain at its historic low level for an " extended period of time " and that the board was bracing for a " major hit to the economy " and incomes .
He said there would be " significant job losses " and that the scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses to keep workers on " .
" It 's also important to repeat that we are expecting a recovery once the virus is contained .
The timing and strength of that recovery will depend upon how successful we are as a nation in building that bridge to the other side , " Mr Lowe said .
