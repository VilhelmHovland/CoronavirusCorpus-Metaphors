A message from NHS workers  " I 've never been so proud to do the job I 'm doing , but I 've also never been so scared "  Right now , the United Kingdom is in the grip of the greatest threat to life its seen since World War II .
The outbreak of COVID-19 has killed more than a thousand people , and is projected to take the lives of many more .
No group of people are facing the brunt of the outbreak more than those working in our National Health Service .
Day and night , doctors , nurses , paramedics and hospital cleaners are working tirelessly to treat the ill and ensure those treating the ill can do so in the cleanest possible conditions .
Despite their best efforts , they have been hamstrung by a lack of personal protective equipment , as well as a lack of clear messaging from government , which has led to the public sometimes not knowing whether to take the outbreak seriously or , at times , simply flagrantly disobeying guidelines .
