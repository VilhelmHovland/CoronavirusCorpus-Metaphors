VR Education believes enforced home working will be game changer for virtual reality  VRE had over 1,000 ' logged in at the event through virtual reality  The future of conferences ?  Homeworking is one of the things that has changed dramatically in the past month of the coronavirus pandemic .
How do you organise or attend a conference from your own study and when there is a travel ban , for example .
One answer is to host a conference in virtual reality and if you have the technology to hand , like Ireland 's VR Education PLC ( LON:VRE ) , this period of enforced homeworking is set to be a company maker .
Dave Whelan , chief executive and founder of VRE , says his phones have been ringing off the hook since coronavirus restrictions were imposed , with the company employing additional business development staff to handle the extra workload .
Two weeks ago , it ran a virtual conference for Taiwanese electronics group HTC .
The Hyve conference is normally an event with physical attendees , but as it was due to be held in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Whelan says it had over 1,000 ' logged in at the event through its virtual reality platform Engage .
Speakers and attendees from Europe and the US were able to interact naturally with visitors from China while over 1 .
watched the live streaming of the conference .
Since then , it has been inundated with queries from event organisers through the world .
" Because of the virus , organisers are really assessing how they have done business in the past and asking can we do this online in future , " he says .
Whelan adds that a key advantage of its Engage VR platform is that it has a very low bandwidth requirement for conversations inside the platform .
" We do n't transmit video .
What we transmit is positional data , which is a large text file , and MP3 audio .
For people , who can not run a Skype meeting or video conference because of bandwidth constraints , Engage will work perfectly well , he adds .
Whelan believes the last couple of weeks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to now has promised much but struggled to deliver .
VR headsets have fallen in price so you do n't need a computer while a 5G connection works extremely well .
Anyone who has used Zoom and Skype for meetings knows they can get very busy , very quickly with people talking over each other .
Using VR , enables a meeting-style connection at home .
Engage uses 3D spatial audio , he explains , so if you are in a group of 50 people in a virtual room and there is a presentation going on at the front , you can still lean over to the person next to you and whisper as if you were sitting next to them .
You can also draw on the virtual whiteboard or make a presentation , he adds .
Headsets are around US$400 each and can connect directly to W-Fi , while each ' virtual seat ' on the enterprise version of the Engage platform costs US$300 .
Originally , Engage was set up as an educational tool and here too business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockdowns and that has translated into big rises in the usage of VRE 's software .
A new game Space Shuttle Commander is due to come out shortly on best selling headset Oculus , but Whelan says Engage is also being used a social medium to help people keep in touch in the current situation .
Going forward , the prospects look bright .
Following the success of the Hyve conference , HTC wants to be become a reseller of VRE 's software in China and combine it with its own hardware .
Discussions are underway with other large conglomerates including telecoms companies and hardware businesses .
" Trading is going really well , " says Whelan , adding the last few weeks have been transformative .
" Now one saw this coming .
We thought 5G was going to be the push for VR technology , but with the virus causing a lot of people to reassess how they work and communicate , now is the time that this technology is going to flourish .
