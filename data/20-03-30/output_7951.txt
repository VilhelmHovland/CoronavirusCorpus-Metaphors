Last week 's alleged double homicide in Ewa Beach is a harrowing reminder that while staying at and working from home may help fend off a pandemic , it can lead to perilous situations for domestic violence survivors .
" We are quite concerned at the DVAC for a pretty serious escalation in domestic violence , " stated Kreidman .
Kreidman tells KITV4 DVAC has contacted each one of its clients over the past week to cover safety plans .
" That may mean having a code word , an emoji , a symbol they communicate to a family member or friend .
Finding the duplicate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be giving the children instructions on what to do in case of an incident , " she explained .
Kreidman tells KITV4 99 of DVAC 's clients have already reported having to enact their safety plans .
" That is a cue to us that the danger is doing what we were afraid it would do , " she added .
Kreidman is urging the public to check up with any family , friends or neighbors who might be at risk .
