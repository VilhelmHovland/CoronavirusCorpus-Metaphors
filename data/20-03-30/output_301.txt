Breaking News Emails  WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is pushing the U .
Security Council to call attention to the Chinese origins of the coronavirus , four diplomats posted to the United Nations told NBC News , triggering a stalemate as the global body seeks to cobble together a response to the pandemic .
Talks among U .
Security Council nations over a joint declaration or resolution on the coronavirus have stalled over U .
insistence that it explicitly state that the virus originated in Wuhan , China , as well as exactly when it started there .
China 's diplomats are enraged according to the diplomats , even as they seek to put their own language into the statement praising China 's efforts to contain the virus .
The dispute at the United Nations comes amid growing finger-pointing between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus .
President Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed China for its spread , accusing Beijing of concealing early knowledge of the virus .
But after reports of a rise in racism and attacks against Asian Americans emerged , Trump tweeted this week that it was " NOT their fault " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese virus .
"  " Everyone knows it came out of China , " Trump said Tuesday .
" But I decided we should n't make any more of a big deal out of it .
"  Still , his administration has continued working to brand it as a Chinese-created crisis , with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo again Wednesday referring to " the Wuhan virus " and " this crisis that began in Wuhan , China .
" He also did not dispute a German news report that he 'd pressed G-7 leaders to include language about the " Wuhan virus " in a joint statement .
At the Security Council , the administration 's push to name China as the source of the virus started in recent weeks when Estonia , a rotating member of the council , began drafting a declaration for the council to issue .
Although the U .
has a separate public health body -- the World Health Organization -- the Security Council has sought to warn how ongoing global conflicts could exacerbate the crisis and undermine the response .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed a version demanding a " general and immediate cessation of hostilities in all countries , " including a 30-day humanitarian pause in conflicts , to allow coronavirus-related supplies to flow , according to a text reviewed by NBC News .
But the U .
, in various drafts and edits circulated among the countries , sought to insert references to " the outbreak of the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) in Wuhan , Hubei province in the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) in November 2019 .
" The PRC is China 's formal name .
Another U .
draft encouraged the U .
to build on lessons learned in the past , " especially from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS-CoV ) coronavirus outbreak originating in Guangdong Province in the PRC in 2011 .
"  Those demands have hit a wall with China , a veto-wielding member of the Security Council , whose diplomats accused the U .
of " irresponsible practices " in a blistering email to other nations ' diplomats this week obtained by NBC News .
" We are astonished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for politicizing the outbreak and blaming China , which we strongly oppose , " China 's mission to the U .
wrote .
" The groundless accusations and malicious fabrication from the U .
aim at shirking its own responsibilities , which severely poisoned the atmosphere of global cooperation in containing the outbreak .
"  A U .
diplomat with knowledge of the discussion said the National Security Council had directed the U .
mission to the United Nations to advocate for the language , with support from Pompeo .
The U .
mission did n't respond to a request for comment .
But a senior Trump administration official said a key element of Trump 's effort to address coronavirus is to convene global experts " to better understand the coronavirus .
"  " Our goal is to gather the data , information and samples needed to understand the evolutionary origins of the virus so we can effectively combat the pandemic and prepare for future outbreaks , " the official said .
Complicating efforts has been Russia 's insistence that ambassadors show up in person at the Security Council to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and not to congregate in groups , diplomats from three Security Council nations said .
For more than a week , as other countries on the council directed nearly all their staff to work from home , Russia 's diplomats were still showing up at their mission in New York , the diplomats said .
Meanwhile , they argued that virtual meetings were untenable , citing technical issues with the videoconferencing equipment .
Russia 's mission to the U .
did n't respond to a request for comment .
But on Tuesday , the Russians dropped their insistence on in-person meetings , several diplomats said .
The shift came the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin , wearing a full protective suit and a respirator as he visited a hospital , was told by Moscow 's mayor that Russia has significantly more coronavirus patients than its official tally shows .

" You see it .
You see it on social media , " Pompeo said Wednesday , accusing Beijing of an " intentional disinformation campaign " even as he insisted that now was n't the time to point fingers .
" You see it in remarks from senior people inside the Chinese Communist Party talking about whether this was a -- U .
brought to China .
This is crazy talk .
"  In discussions about a Security Council declaration or resolution , Chinese diplomats have had their own wish list , two diplomats familiar with the talks said : references to the success of China 's extensive efforts to control the crisis once the virus was identified .
After enforcing a strict lockdown in Hubei province , the center of the crisis in China , authorities have started easing restrictions as the number of new cases has fallen to nearly zero .
A diplomat involved in the Security Council talks said other nations were encouraging a compromise in which China and the United States would drop their insistence on language that would be inevitably problematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
