Downing Street is working with social-media companies to counter fake news and misinformation on coronavirus , as well as take down fraud and phishing campaigns looking to exploit the outbreak .
The misinformation ' rapid-response unit ' -- based across the Department for Digital , Culture , Media and Sport ( DCMS ) , Cabinet Office and Number 10 -- looks to take down false narratives around coronavirus cures , as well as online scams looking to take advantage of people looking for information on COVID-19 .
Working alongside disinformation specialists from academia , the unit is looking to combat fake news with direct rebuttals to posts on social media and working with the social networks to remove harmful or misleading content .
The government says it 's currently dealing with up to 70 incidents a week , often based around false stories and misleading claims on coronavirus .
" Holding your breath for ten seconds is not a test for coronavirus and gargling water for 15 seconds is not a cure -- this is the kind of false advice we have seen coming from sources claiming to be medical experts , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why government communicators are working in tandem with health bodies to promote official medical advice , rebut false narratives and clamp down on criminals seeking to exploit public concern during this pandemic .
"  The government also says it will be pushing social-media companies for further action to prevent the spread of falsehoods and rumours around coronavirus .
Alongside efforts to warn the general public about coronavirus misinformation and fraud , the government is also stepping up efforts to work with international partners to counter the efforts of what 's described as " certain states " that " routinely use disinformation as a policy tool " .
In addition to misinformation campaigns , coronavirus has also resulted in cyber criminals and hackers trying to take advantage of the pandemic for their own malicious ends by using the issue as a lure for phishing campaigns and other cyberattacks , as detailed by the National Cyber Security Centre ( NCSC ) .
