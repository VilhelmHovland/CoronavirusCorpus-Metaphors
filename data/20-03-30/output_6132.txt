German cathedral dusts off relics of St Corona , patron of epidemics  AACHEN , Germany ( Reuters ) - Germany 's Aachen Cathedral has dug out the relics of little-known Saint Corona , patron saint of resisting epidemics , from its treasure chamber and is polishing up her elaborate shrine to go on show once the coronavirus pandemic has passed .
The pandemic , confirmed to have infected nearly half a million people worldwide , including more than 30,000 in Germany , has boosted public interest in the Christian martyr , believed to have been killed by the Romans around 1,800 years ago .
The cathedral had planned even before the coronavirus outbreak to display St Corona 's shrine this summer as part of an exhibition on gold craftsmanship .
It is not clear when people will now be able to view the shrine due to tough restrictions on gatherings imposed to help combat the spread of the virus .
But experts are painstakingly cleaning the gold , bronze and ivory shrine , which has been hidden from public view for the last 25 years , in preparation for when it can go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit earlier than planned and now we expect more interest due to the virus , " said Aachen Cathedral spokeswoman Daniela Loevenich .
Corona is believed to have been only about 16 years old when the Romans killed her , probably in Syria , for professing the Christian faith .
The girl suffered a particularly excruciating death , according to legend .
She was tied to two bent palm trees and then torn apart as the trunks were released .
" That is a very gruesome story and led to her becoming the patron of lumberjacks , " said Brigitte Falk , head of Aachen Cathedral Treasure Chamber , adding that it was pure chance that she also became a patron saint for resisting epidemics .
Corona 's relics , brought to Aachen by King Otto III in 997 , were kept in a tomb underneath a slab in the cathedral - which can still be seen - until 1911-12 when they were placed in the shrine , which is 93 centimetres tall and weighs 98 kilograms .
The Roman Catholic cathedral at Aachen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of Europe 's oldest .
Charlemagne was buried there in 814 and it was used for the coronation of German kings and queens .
While the cathedral stresses that Corona is patron saint of resisting all epidemics , not just this specific virus , the virus is so called because under a microscope , it looks like a globe with little globules , resembling a crown , said Falk .
In Latin corona means crown or garland .
" Like many other saints , Saint Corona may be a source of hope in these difficult times , " said Falk .
