Actions  GREEN BAY ( WGBA ) -- The Riverside Ballroom says the springtime is their busiest time of year .
They hold as many as three events a day .
However , all events in April and May have been cancelled because of COVID-19 .

This makes it inconvenient for weddings - the most popular gathering they hold .

That is no longer an option .
" It was upsetting not knowing when our special day will be now , " Burmingham said .

Instead the will be rescheduled to a different date .
" It is like an airfare ticket , " Tedford said .
" The refund is just a reschedule .
"  Tedford had to layoff all his staff members .
The problem with rescheduling is how to fit the 100 canceled events in and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat will be over .
" We are working to find these dates for people , " Tedford said .
The soon to be newlyweds said they do n't mind waiting , especially if it means keeping their loved ones safe .
