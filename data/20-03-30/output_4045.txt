Fake News : Lecturer claims 5G accelerates spread of Coronavirus  There are fears that 5G wifi networks could be acting as an " accelerator " for the coronavirus pandemic .
A new conspiracy theory claims that the symptoms of the virus -- high fever , coughing and shortness of breath -- is the human body responding to exposure to 5G .
Tanja Rebel , an anti-5G activist and philosophy lecturer at the Isle of Wight College , said : " Many studies show that Electro-Magnetic Radiation ( EMR ) suppresses the immune system and that it helps viruses and bacteria thrive .
"  " So EMR and in particular 5G could act as an accelerator for the disease .
We do not know for sure , but common sense and the precautionary principle decree that we urgently need a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until we can show that it is safe .
"  The theory has been met with skepticism by experts , with the UK 's independent fact-checking charity , Full Fact , saying : " This is incorrect , the new coronavirus is a virus and there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  According to a report on the BBC , the UK government is keen to crackdown the spread of fake news .
These claims from Rebel are not verifiable as it does not specifically show any proven linkages to coronavirus pandemic , and therefore could create panic as the world faces-off against the Coronavirus pandemic .
