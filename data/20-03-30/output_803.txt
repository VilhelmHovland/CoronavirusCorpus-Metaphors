The couple trades off when they make their work phone calls -- especially when their youngest is not napping .
Chris Davidson has managed his two home-based businesses for the past eight years : IMPACT Advisory Group , a sales and management consulting business , and Growth4Life , a direct sales business .

"  He had often used Zoom , the remote conferencing service , but now relies entirely on it in this age of social distancing .
" If you do n't have a partner you need to plan each day ahead of time .
And if you have a partner you have to be completely on the same page , " Chris Davidson said , touting his wife 's planning prowess .
" She has been phenomenal in helping us keep our own schedules straight .
