In every Hollywood disaster movie , New York somehow finds itself at the centre of it all .
It is a peril of being the most recognisable city in the world that it always seems to bear the brunt of the alien invasions , environmental collapse and the deadly storms .
This time is no different .
Over the past week , this city has become the new epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic .
New York now accounts for roughly a quarter of the 100,000 infections in the whole United States .
More than 450 people have now died of the virus here , as of Saturday .

Ambulance drivers carrying the patients were wearing only rudimentary face masks , rather than the full protective equipment needed for dealing with infected people .
Medical staff , already overwhelmed , are themselves contracting the virus .

We 've had people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who works in the emergency department .

But it 's true that your greatest weakness is also your greatest strength .
And our closeness is what makes us who we are .
That is what New York is .
"  New York governor Andrew Cuomo  New York is experiencing what previous epicentres have already gone through -- Wuhan in China , Lombardy in Italy and Seattle , Washington .
But the strict quarantine measures that have been put in place across the world seem particularly jarring in New York , the city that never sleeps .
Manhattan 's iconic avenues are empty of people and cars .
The bright lights of Times Square bounce off the bare pavements .
" I 've had one customer today , " said Mohammad Noor , who runs a hot dog stand on the edge of the square .
" Everyone is scared .
They are at home .

Their presence disguises the true scale of the crisis .
In a grim milestone that demonstrated just how badly the city has been affected , New York received more emergency calls on Wednesday than it did on the day of its greatest trauma , September 11 , 2001 .
More than 6,000 people dialled 911 , according to emergency worker unions .
It was not for nothing that the New York Daily News declared the city the " Ground Zero " of the coronavirus on its front page earlier this week .

( Richard Hall / The Independent )  The scale of the crisis has left many contemplating how it came to happen here , and how one of the richest states in the country was so unprepared .
New York governor Andrew Cuomo , who has attracted praise for his handling of the crisis , posited that it was the city 's unique openness that made it vulnerable .
" Answer one is because we welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the virus was here much earlier than it was in any other state because those people come here first .
That 's the first answer , " he said on Wednesday .
" The second is because we are close , because we live close to one another , because we 're close to one another on the street , because we live in close communities , because we 're close to one another on the bus , " he added .
" Our closeness makes us vulnerable .
But it 's true that your greatest weakness is also your greatest strength .
And our closeness is what makes us who we are .
That is what New York is .
"  New York is the most densely populated city in the US , with some 27,000 residents per square mile .
It dwarves the closest city of San Francisco , which has 18,000 .
That is true of other global cities , however , which have n't seen the same explosion of cases .
Another reason for New York 's high rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests being carried out .
Following a slow start , during which time people with symptoms struggled to get tested , New York is now testing more aggressively than any other state -- some 700 tests per 100,000 people .
Ted Steinberg , a historian of natural disasters in America and a Brooklyn native , agreed with Mr Cuomo that the city 's closeness can be a blessing and a curse when disaster strikes .
" The city 's vibrant street life , the pounding excitement that people feel as they come up the stairs of Penn Station onto Seventh Avenue -- these are the result of packing millions of people into one small spot on the planet , " he said .
" Density has positive social impacts and potentially positive ecological ones .
But density also exacts a price when coastal storms make evacuation difficult if not impossible , and in cases like the current one in which closeness is looking every day more and more like the kiss of death , " said professor Steinberg , who teaches history at Case Western Reserve University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and state of New York is now serving as a test case for America 's response to the crisis , both political and practical .
Governor Cuomo 's press briefings have become essential viewing not just for New Yorkers , but for the rest of the country -- places which may soon find themselves facing the same issues .
The problem for New York , much like elsewhere , has been capacity -- having enough beds and medical equipment to deal with the surge of patients flooding the hospitals .
Much of Mr Cuomo 's daily televised appeals have focused on bridging the gap between the number of hospital beds needed for the coming apex of the crisis , from the 53,000 it has now to an estimated 140,000 .
More crucially , he added , New York will also need an additional 30,000 ventilators to deal with the coming increase in severe hospitalisations .
That peak is expected to arrive roughly three weeks from now .
But these shortfalls can not be met by the state alone .
Washington passed a $2 trillion stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the economy , but governors across the US have criticised the government for being too slow to help states deal with shortages of medical equipment .
Mr Cuomo has repeatedly assailed the Trump administration for not providing help quickly enough , sparking a public row with president Donald Trump that has seen the pair trade blows in their respective press conferences .
" The president said it 's a war .
then act like it , " Mr Cuomo said on Tuesday .
" They 're doing the supplies ? Here 's my question : Where are they ? "  " You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die , " he said , warning of the high numbers of deaths that would follow if ventilators were not found .
The president has refused to take responsibility for shortfalls across the country , and has instead pushed blame back on state governors .
On Thursday evening , he cast doubt on Mr Cuomo 's requirements to deal with the crisis .
" I do n't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have two ventilators .
And now all of a sudden they 're saying , ' Can we order 30,000 ventilators ? ' " said during an appearance on Hannity .
The public battle between the two continued on into this weekend , as Mr Trump said on Saturday that he was considering a quarantine of New York .
" We 're thinking about certain things .
Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it 's a hotspot .
We might not have to do it , but there 's a possibility that sometime today we 'll do a quarantine , short-term , two weeks on New York .
Probably New Jersey , certain parts of Connecticut , " he told reporters .
That came as news to Mr Cuomo , who said he doubted it would have the desired effect .
" I do n't even know what that means .
I do n't know how that could be legally enforceable .
And from a medical point view , I do n't know what you would be accomplishing , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Democratic leaders of New York has highlighted a troubling aspect of the federal government 's response to the crisis : the politicisation of federal aid .
Mr Trump has gone so far as to suggest that life-saving supplies would be contingent on how governors across the country treat him .
" I think we 're doing very well , " he told Fox News of the White House 's coordination with governors .
" But , you know , it 's a two-way street .
They have to treat us well , also .
They ca n't say , ' Oh gee , we should get this , we should get that .
' "  He has also attacked two other Democratic governors , in Michigan and Washington state , after they criticised the federal response to the pandemic .
Mr Trump initially played down the threat of the coronavirus , but slowly came around as US cases skyrocketed .
The virus was initially worse in coastal blue states , but according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight , cases are now rising fast in states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was in that spirit that Mr Cuomo issued a warning to the rest of the country this week .
" What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California and Washington state and Illinois .
We 're just getting there first , " he said .
