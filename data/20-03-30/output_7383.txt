For DOT-Regulated Employers :  As a DOT-regulated employer , you must comply with applicable DOT training and testing requirements .

You should make a reasonable effort to locate the necessary resources .
As a best practice at this time , employers should consider mobile collection services for required testing if the fixed-site collection facilities are not available .
If you are unable to conduct DOT drug or alcohol training or testing due to COVID-19-related supply shortages , facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other impediments , you are to continue to comply with existing applicable DOT Agency requirements to document why a test was not completed .

Additionally , DOT is aware that some employees have expressed concern about potential public-health risks associated with the collection and testing process in the current environment .
Employers should review the applicable DOT Agency requirements for testing to determine whether flexibilities allow for collection and testing at a later date .

DOT asks employers to verify with the clinic or collection site that it has taken the necessary precautions to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID-19 .
Employers should revisit back-up plans to ensure the plans are current and effective for the current outbreak conditions .
For example , these plans should include availability of collectors and collection sites and BAT , and alternate/back-up MRO , as these may have changed as a result of the national emergency .
Employers should also have regular communications with service agents regarding the service agent 's availability and capability to support your DOT drug-and-alcohol testing program .
If you have COVID-19-related concerns about testing , you should discuss them with your employer .
