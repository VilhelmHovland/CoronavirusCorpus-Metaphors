How dairy firms are adapting to the ever-changing demands of the coronavirus crisis  Faced with the challenge of getting food on tables , dairy firms across the country have been battling to meet shopper 's demands since the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK .
While many have also been faced with staff shortages , others have been trying to adapt to the rapidly-changing Government guidelines .
And while the export market has almost completely fallen away for some industries , it 's very much still a priority for north-east food firm Mackie 's of Scotland .
Karin Hayhow , marketing director of the ice cream firm based in Westertown , Rothienorman , said : " April/May is the time of year when our biggest orders for Asia go out just before their summer .
We have a couple of big orders that we 're trying to get made and shipped as soon as we can .
" Asia is one of our biggest international markets .
The UK is by far our biggest market and export would be about 10% of our business .
Most of our products go to countries around Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are happening and changing all the time .
Shipping seems to be continuing and we 're unaware of there being any problems at borders .
Some of our UK customers do ship on our products around Europe , too .
"  Keeping staff safe and following Government guidelines religiously is something Karin says the firm has implemented many new practices on .
She added : " The inter-relations between different farms and food companies is something the government will want to keep going for as long as possible .
" As time goes on we just have to ensure we are taking good care of members of staff if they 're unable to come in , and were taking a lot of care when it comes to protecting staff who are still working on-site .
" All of our office employees are working from home and whoever else can is doing so .
It 's a flawless team working at the farm just now , they 're working at distance and keeping to themselves as well as working with as many additional safety routines as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being as flexible as possible so we 're just taking each day as it goes .
" We 're almost operating at full capacity as well and we 're just working to ensure the main and most popular lines are still being met .
They are our priority , too .
"  Working on a smaller scale , Aberdeenshire yoghurt producer Rora Dairy near Peterhead is also taking extra precautions to protect staff , recruiting on-site family members to chip in instead .
Bruce and Jane Mackie at their dairy farm in Rora , Longside .
Owner Jane Mackie , said : " Two members of my staff were nervous about lockdown so they 're not working at the moment -- I do n't want anyone working who does n't feel content , but we are operating and because we 're supplying two big supermarkets , we continue on .
" There 's less of a team now .
We 're doing it more in-house and working as a family rather than have outside people .
If we do , there 's just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I have one member of the team who is in self-isolation so she does n't see anyone but us and just goes to and from work .
" We 're still delivering to supermarkets like Sainsbury 's and Morrisons where there 's big depots and we get our temperatures checked and wash our hands .
For the local deliveries I 'm delivering to independent stores , I do n't come into contact with anyone .
We 're not very customer facing .
"  But it 's the supply chain Jane has concerns over , with less and less people going to work due to the recent lockdown and only essential staff being able to go to work .
She said : " I am concerned going forward that the supply chain will be weaker .
It 's going to be difficult if people do n't go to work to get everything done .
For example , some of the bigger companies who I deal with to get equipment , the equipment might be able to be delivered but the engineers ca n't come on site to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not necessarily thinking about .
But I guess that 's only really for more long term things .
Today we are carrying on as we are .
" I think if I was n't in major retail I 'd be a bit quiet .
My timing has been lucky but I 'm really feeling for my peers .
" We 're not doing any direct sales online but we supply other people doing it .
We also supply to both Williamson and Cress who are distributors who deliver to farm shops and delis across the country so they 're really trying to help everyone , too .
" The yoghurt has been consistently busy for retail , but food for the service industry has just gone .
I 'm really worrying about the cafes and hotels just now but retail is holding up .
I think that is where it 's going to stay .
It was really crazy for a couple of weeks but its calming down now as everyone 's in lockdown so it 's steadying .
