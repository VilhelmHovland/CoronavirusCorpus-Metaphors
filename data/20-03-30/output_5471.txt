Sweden under fire for ' relaxed ' coronavirus approach -- here 's the science behind it  A growing number of Swedish doctors and scientists are raising alarm over the Swedish government 's approach to COVID-19 .
Unlike its Nordic neighbours , Sweden has adopted a relatively relaxed strategy , seemingly assuming that overreaction is more harmful than under-reaction .
Although the government has now banned gatherings of more than 50 people , this excludes places like schools , restaurants and gyms which remain open .
That 's despite the fact that 3,046 people have tested positive .
Although Norway has the most confirmed cases ( 3,066 ) in Scandinavia , COVID-19 fatalities in Sweden are highest by far ( 92 ) , compared with Norway ( 15 ) and Denmark ( 41 ) .
People now are taking sides , with some arguing that publicly criticising the authorities only serves to undermine public trust at a time when this is so badly needed .
Others are convinced that Sweden is hurtling toward a disaster of biblical proportions and that the direction of travel must change .
The truth is that of all these opinions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
No one knows for sure what lies ahead .
In epidemics , prediction models help guide the choice of interventions , assess likely social and economic impacts , and estimate hospital surge capacity requirements .
All prediction models require input data , ideally derived from past experience in comparable scenarios .
And we know the quality of such input data is poor .
Most current COVID-19 prediction models use data gathered from the COVID-19 epidemics in China and Italy and from past outbreaks of other infectious diseases such as Ebola , influenza and other coronaviruses ( Sars and Mers ) .
But demographics and patterns of social interactions differ from country to country .
Sweden has a small population and only one real metropolitan area .
Ideally , we 'd need data from Sweden on the community spread of COVID-19 , but this requires screening programmes that do not currently exist .
The little reliable data on COVID-19 in Sweden concerns hospital admissions and fatalities .
This latter can be used to get a " poor man 's estimate " of community transmission , providing approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-week lag between diagnosis and death , this a very blunt instrument with which to guide decision making .
In Sweden , the public health authorities have released simulations to guide " surge requirements " .
This is the extent to which hospitals will need to boost their capacity to deal with the high number of very ill COVID-19 patients that are likely to need specialist care in the coming weeks .
From these simulations , it is clear that the Swedish government anticipates far fewer hospitalisations per 100,000 of the population than predicted in other countries , including Norway , Denmark and the UK .
The corresponding number of deaths in Sweden predicted using the UK simulations are much higher than the Swedish government 's simulations suggest .
The reason appears to be that Swedish authorities believe there are many infected people without symptoms and that , of those who come to clinical attention , only one in five will require hospitalisation .
At this point , it is hard to know how many people are asymptomatic as there is no structured screening in Sweden and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recovered from it .
But substantially underestimating hospital surge requirements would nevertheless be devastating .
Uneven spread  Like in many other countries , the spread of COVID-19 is quite uneven in Sweden .
Most cases have been diagnosed and treated in the greater Stockholm area , and lately also in the northern county of J ? mtland -- a popular destination for skiers .
On the other hand , some other geographical areas are relatively spared , at least for the moment .
In the third largest Swedish city , Malm ? , still only a few cases have been hospitalised at the time of writing .
There are several arguments supporting the current official Swedish strategy .
These include the need to keep schools open in order to allow parents who work in key jobs in health care , transportation and food supply lines to remain at work .
Despite other infectious diseases spreading rapidly among children , COVID-19 complications are relatively rare in children .
A long-term lockdown is also likely to have major economic implications that in the future may harm healthcare due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more deaths and suffering than the COVID-19 pandemic will bring in the near term .
Herd immunity  The best estimates of the COVID-19 case-fatality ratio ( CFR ) -- the proportion of those infected who die -- is currently 0 .
By comparison , the 1918-1919 Spanish flu had a 3% CFR in some parts of northern Sweden .
A century ago , Sweden was recovering from the first world war , even though the country stayed neutral .
Internal transportation and communication systems were less developed than in many other countries at the time , which helped slow the spread of the epidemic .
In the short term , this was perceived to be a good thing , but because herd immunity -- whereby enough people have been infected to become immune to the virus -- had not been initially achieved , there were at least two additional epidemics of the Spanish flu virus within a year .
The second wave of infections had a higher mortality rate than the first wave .
Learning the lesson from this , many people in Sweden are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish flu , COVID-19 is less severe , with many infected people believed to be asymptomatic .
While this contributes to a more rapid spread , it also means that the threshold for " herd immunity " is about 60% .
This may be quickly achieved in countries that do not have intensive mitigation or suppression strategies .
This may also lower the risk of further waves of the epidemic .
So when we probe the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in the future , there will likely be a lot of focus on the success or failure of Sweden 's relatively relaxed initial approach .
This would take into account not just the loss of lives from the pandemic , but also longer term social and economic negative consequences and the deaths they may cause .
Ultimately , given the uneven and relatively modest spread of the virus in Sweden at the moment , its initial strategy may not turn out to be reckless .
But going forward , Sweden is likely to have to impose stricter restrictions depending on how the virus spreads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under severe strain .
