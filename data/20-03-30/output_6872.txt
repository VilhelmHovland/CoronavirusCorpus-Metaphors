Nick Garrett is taking the shutdown during the coronavirus pandemic in stride .
The Riverside Military Academy head football coach is teaching his students online and staying in contact with his football team .
He 's using video conferencing to just check in with the football team .
" We had our first complete week last week , " he said .
" It 's really been exciting for not only the cadets but for us .
We 're having to learn and add more tools to our toolbox to be better teachers and advocates for our students .
"  Spring football is set for mid-April and if school is still out , there will be no practice .
Garrett knows that 's a big possibility given the current situation with the spread of COVID-19 .
" There 's no way to replace that face to face interaction , " he said .
" We 're using the remind app and will try to attempt a zoom meeting soon because that 's what the college coaches are doing .
So , we 're going to try to utilize some of those platforms .
Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to our kids to work on .
