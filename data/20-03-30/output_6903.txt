Main menu  Campus Mail expands delivery options during COVID-19  In this time of social distancing , University of Oregon Campus Mail Services has expanded its mail delivery and pickup options to limit the number of employees on campus .
If accessible , mail will continue to be picked up and dropped off at each department 's regular location .
By request , mail delivery can be consolidated between multiple departments or offices .
Departments can collaborate with others to set up a shared delivery location or a single person who can open , scan and electronically send out the mail to each department .
Departments may request to schedule a self-pickup from the Campus Mail office , where mail is being held for departments that are closed and inaccessible .
Outgoing mail and packages for UPS and FedEx can also be dropped off at the office , while practicing appropriate social distancing .
Employees can contact individual carriers and shippers to arrange for alternate or off-campus deliveries through UPS or FedEx .
The mail delivery schedule will be reviewed each week and adjusted as needed .
