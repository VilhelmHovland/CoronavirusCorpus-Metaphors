Auburn City Council launching program to help local businesses during COVID-19 pandemic  AUBURN , Ala .
( WTVM ) - Auburn City Council is launching a new program to help local businesses during the coronavirus pandemic .
According to city leaders , this new interest subsidy program aims to help businesses while waiting on federal aid or while trying to survive during the pandemic .
Small businesses can get a loan through eight participating lenders .
If approved by council , the city will provide up to $25,000 per loan to help pay for the interest on that loan .
" It 's just a little something and maybe it 's the bridge for these small businesses to get the larger amounts of money from the federal government , " said Auburn Mayor Ron Anders .
" Through forgiving this interest , it 's going to cost the city $400,000 to $500,00 , but we can potentially inject a $4 million back into our economy .
But most important , we can be a part of a business being able to maintain themselves , continue to be open , and maintain their employees .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money is going toward working capital and their working expenses .
These businesses must be located in Auburn .
