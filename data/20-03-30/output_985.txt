School is over for the rest of the year , at least in the traditional sense .
Arizona Gov .
Doug Ducey and Kathy Hoffman , the state superintendent of public instruction , announced Monday that due to the continued spread of the coronavirus , there was no reasonable way to have schools reopen safely this spring .
Despite the campus closures , schools are expected to continue offering remote learning opportunities in compliance with plans approved earlier this month by state lawmakers , Hoffman said .
School districts have been carrying out that mandate through online instruction and providing paper packets to students as needed .
But Hoffman conceded that this will not make up for actually having the state 's 1 .
million public school students in classrooms .
Hoffman also said the state Board of Education will meet Tuesday to figure out exactly what happens next .
That includes everything from the A through F grades given to schools to graduation and promotion requirements .
What it also will include , she said , is how students document what they have learned remotely .
Hoffman said , though , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to learn , citing in particular the shortage of laptop computers and even remote " hot spots " -- devices to link computers to the internet -- for students to be able to connect online .
In some ways , the decision to keep school doors shut is not a surprise .
In fact , Rep .
Michelle Udall , R-Mesa , crafted legislation in anticipation .
That measure suspends state laws that require there be a certain number of school days and instructional hours .
It also canceled the annual statewide achievement tests .
Tucson 's largest school district , TUSD , was already planning for a long-term closure , said Superintendent Gabriel Trujillo .
" We would have opted to be closed for the year , " he said .
" We have a community that is terrified .
We have a workforce that is terrified .
And it 's the right thing to do under these circumstances to keep the district in a state of closure .
"  Most significantly , the legislation requires public schools to offer education services in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Schools then could continue paying employees to work from home or perform alternative assignments through the end of the school year .
At a press briefing Monday , Hoffman said some school districts are being creative .
She said teachers in the Agua Fria Union High School District in western Maricopa County are conducting lessons using a program called Google Classroom , holding online office hours and developing online lesson plans .
The Marana Unified School District launched its " Learning at Home " program on Monday after distributing Chromebooks to students and families who requested one .
" As we transition from the classroom to home , we do so with the commitment to stay connected and to ensure that the needs of our students and families are met to the best of our ability , " said Marana Schools Superintendent Doug Wilson in a statement .
And Hoffman said more than 545 schools throughout the state are preparing free breakfast and lunch that can be delivered .
" But there are major gaps in access to the technology that students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said .
" Many families simply do not have the resources , causing a high demand for devices including laptops and hot spots .
"  " It 's much larger than I could have imagined , " she said of the gaps in technology .
" It 's probably over 100,000 students , at a minimum , who do n't have the technology at home .
"  And fixing it with money is n't a simple solution .
" Laptops and hot spots are on back order because the entire country has been shifting to telecommuting , " Hoffman said .
And she said she has made pleas to Arizona business leaders , as well as colleges and universities , for extra laptops .
" So this is a very serious issue , " she said .
" This crisis will worsen many of the inequities that have long existed across our system and that have for years widened the achievement gap between under-resourced communities and their more advantaged counterparts .
"  At a meeting on March 27 , the TUSD governing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploy Chromebooks , complete with internet access , to nearly 18,000 families who lack the resources to participate in online instructions , Trujillo said .
" It is a monumental challenge that 's never been attempted on this kind of a scale anywhere in Southern Arizona , " he said .
" We have 18,000 families that are cut off from any kind of education opportunities right now , and it 's all hands on deck to change that as quickly as we can .
"  After surveying families , TUSD estimated it needed to distribute 23,500 devices to students and 650 to teachers , of which the district already has 10,000 .
The district plans to distribute Chromebooks over the next four to five weeks , with teachers and high school seniors having priority .
While students without access wait for devices , they will receive student workbooks and regular check-ins from teachers .
" It 's a race against this digital divide , " Trujillo said .
Hoffman also said there also are separate issues of serving students with disabilities who , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online learning even if they had the equipment .
Hoffman said the immediate focus has been on working on online learning for the balance of this school year as well as the question of high school graduation , the issue the Board of Education will take up Tuesday .
But she acknowledged there 's also the issue of the academic credentials of students in other grades and whether they will be prepared to enter the next grade when schools reopen in the fall .
" We 've been convening groups of superintendents and charter leaders to talk about that , to talk about what does this look like , " she said .

Matt Rourke  In South Carolina school buses are being fitted with wifi routers to help children connect to learning portals .
WINNSBORO , S .
( AP ) -- Students struggling to get online in a rural South Carolina county received a boost last week with the arrival of six buses equipped with Wi-Fi , some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the coronavirus outbreak .
With routers mounted inside , the buses broadcast enough bandwidth in an area the size of a small parking lot for parents to drive up and children to access the internet from inside their cars .
One of the buses set up outside the apartment complex of Lacheyle Moore , who had been limiting her own usage to leave enough data on her cellphone plan for her daughter 's schoolwork .
" I have to put extra data on my phone to make sure her work gets done , so she can get graded for it , " said Moore , who works as a cashier and shifted her schedule to help instruct her two children .
The pandemic that launched a massive , unplanned experiment with distance learning has created extraordinary hurdles for schoolchildren left behind by the digital divide .
School districts and governments are now racing to give the millions of U .
students without home internet a chance of keeping up .
Nationwide , nearly 3 million students make do without home internet because of the high costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students are more likely to be students of color , from low-income families or in households with lower parental education levels .
The nation 's largest school districts , including Los Angeles and New York , are spending millions of dollars to provide devices and internet connections for students .
Smaller districts are finding ways to boost wireless internet in school parking lots and distribute hot spots .
Still , others are sticking with paper assignments and books because the digital equity issues are too much to overcome .
" What we 're seeing is a widening of the achievement gap , so that children who are in well-funded districts were able to immediately pivot to online learning strategies , because the infrastructure was already in place , " said Maura McInerney , legal director of the Education Law Center , which advocates for disadvantaged students .
" In sharp contrast , underfunded districts , who did not have these resources and their children do not have access to Chromebooks , for example , are scrambling to address the educational needs of students .
"  In Fairfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadband internet access , according to an Associated Press analysis of census data .
Nationwide , an estimated 18% of U .
students do not have home access to broadband internet .
" Lots of mothers and fathers are really not equipped to be home school parents , " said J .
Green , the school superintendent .
Across South Carolina , hundreds of buses were requested by school districts in a program targeting low-income and rural areas , state education spokesman Ryan Brown said .
The state was ready to equip thousands of buses , but Brown said that service providers ' offers of low-cost and even free service plans has lessened the demand .
So deep are the equity challenges for the Philadelphia School District that it initially prohibited online instruction during the shutdown .
Only about half the district 's high school students have a laptop or tablet and home internet service .
As schools now appear likely to be closed for longer than anticipated , the district plans to buy 50,000 Chromebooks and begin online instruction by mid-April .
Comcast , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10-a-month " Internet Essentials " plan for low-income families and offered two months of free service to new customers .
" We have the $10 internet ( plan ) .
It 's not for doing lessons , cause it 's really slow .
If we needed to do the Google classroom , we would need , I think , the regular internet , which I ca n't afford , " parent Cecelia Thompson , 54 , said earlier this month .
Thompson , who can not work because of health issues , lives with her 21-year-old son , a district student with severe autism who attends Martin Luther King High School .
She believes they would also need a Chromebook and perhaps a printer , so her son , who has a full-time support person , can do worksheets .
For now , they rely on her cellphone and a 10-year-old tablet .
Some districts also are hoping for some help from the federal government .
Mike Looney , the superintendent of Fulton County schools in Georgia , said parents should take advantage of offers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Federal Communications Commission to redeploy money used to subsidize school internet connections to instead pay to supply students with devices and internet at home -- an idea that has been endorsed also by many U .
senators .
In central Ohio , Hilliard City Schools sent students home with school-issued iPads they can use to download , complete and then upload assignments .
The iPads allow them to do much of their work offline , according to district Superintendent John Marschhausen , though they 'll need to connect to submit completed work and download new assignments .
The district 's two dozen schools are extending their Wi-Fi into their parking lots so families can complete downloads from their vehicles .
The superintendent said he thinks it will be a smooth transition for most , but he worries about a radical shift for the younger students who typically spend less than half an hour on their devices in the classroom .
" We 're going to have to do a lot of adapting and adjusting and a lot of learning along with our families if this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .
In Columbus , Mississippi , Wi-Fi equipment installed on nine buses to allow children to do homework on the way to and from school was transferred to school and community buildings after officials discovered routers would only run for two hours after buses were shut off .
But Superintendent Cherie Labat said the district is giving out paper lesson packets at schools where meals are being picked up , as well as books that students can take home for independent reading .
With 100% of students in the predominantly African American district eligible for free or reduced price lunches , Labat said she ca n't assume students have resources at home .
