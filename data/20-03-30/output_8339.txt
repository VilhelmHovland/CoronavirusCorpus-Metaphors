The economic damage from the coronavirus crisis would depend not just on how high unemployment goes in the next month or two , but how long it stays there .
The U .
economy has suffered a body blow with no modern precedent .
Unemployment , just 3 .
in February , could top 10% in coming months , higher than its peak in the 2008-09 recession .
Some see it surpassing 20% soon , levels unseen since the Great Depression .
But it is n't a foregone conclusion that this must wreak as much damage as the great recession , much less the depression .
That would depend not just on how high unemployment goes in the next month or two , but how long it stays there .
That , in turn , depends on two things : how long it takes health officials to stop the novel coronavirus pandemic , and whether businesses and workers , with the aid of government , can stay afloat in the meantime .
This is n't like other recessions , in which businesses and consumers are unwilling to spend .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural disaster such as a hurricane that closes an entire affected region .
Businesses and employees typically treat a natural disaster as transitory and pick up afterward where they left off .
The difference is that this one is shutting down most of the country , potentially for months .
The longer it drags on the more businesses will fail and the more temporary layoffs become permanent , with knock-on effects on spending and employment that become difficult to reverse .
While we do n't know much about the economic effects of pandemics , we know a lot about the effects of natural disasters .
The week after Hurricane Harvey 's landfall in 2017 , the typical Houston business 's incoming cash plummeted 63% relative to a year earlier , and 31% had no cash coming in at all .
That is according to a study the JPMorgan Chase Institute , the bank 's in-house think tank , conducted of thousands of anonymized accounts .
The week after Hurricane Irma hit Florida two weeks later , the typical Miami business 's income sunk 82% , and 41% had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also significantly shrank , preserving somewhat their cash balances .
And within a week , cash inflows returned to normal in both cities .
A surge in temporary layoffs , particularly in Houston , did n't translate into a significant or sustained drop in employment .

While the bank did n't study Hurricane Katrina , that storm 's severity in 2005 and the slow pace of rebuilding left lasting economic scars .
Employment in the New Orleans area immediately plunged 30% .
Two years later only half that drop had been recovered and , according to one study , a third of businesses had failed to reopen .
The priority now is to avoid New Orleans ' post-Katrina fate .
That requires enabling businesses , as best as possible , to hang on until the pandemic emergency is over .
Lauren Knox , who owns a hair salon in Huntsville , Ala .
, right , hopes government assistance will help her salon survive while it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauren Knox  Lauren Knox has owned a hair salon in Huntsville , Ala .
, since 1989 .
In 2011 , she was forced to close for 10 days when tornadoes tore across the southern U .
She still remembers dividing up the cash the salon had on hand to help tide over her employees through the disaster .
It helped prepare her for the pandemic , to an extent .
On March 3 , she had her employees sign a plan of action for the pandemic , in which she said : " Like any other disruption in our lives , like a tornado , etc .
, we ride it out together .
" A week ago to protect their and their customers ' health , she closed her salon and told her seven support staff , seven commissioned stylists , and 11 stylists who rent a salon chair from her , to stay home .
None , so far , have been laid off .
Her hope is that when the pandemic passes , she can reopen and bring all those staff back .
But she has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all operating expenses , still has fixed monthly expenses of rent , utilities and insurance of around $7,200 .

That loss of purchasing power compounds the recession , driving unemployment even higher .
Research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that in the past recession unemployment rose less in countries where employers thought the downturn was seen as transitory .
That was especially notable in Germany , which encourages employers to reduce each worker 's hours rather than cut workers altogether .
The U .
has traditionally resisted subsidizing employers to keep workers , preferring instead to subsidize the unemployed as they search for a new job .
The $2-trillion-plus economic rescue package enacted last week breaks that tradition .
It includes money for unemployment benefits , but earmarks more to discourage business from sacking workers .
It includes $350 billion in Small Business Administration loans and $500 billion in direct loans and seed money for even more credit from the Federal Reserve , all of it conditional on minimizing layoffs .

While social distancing appears to have slowed the rise in cases and deaths in early hot spots like Italy and Washington state , many other regions are still early in their outbreaks .
The virus could return months later , forcing another round of social distancing .
If so , last week 's package may not be enough .
