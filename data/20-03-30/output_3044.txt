" We do n't want your salutes , " says Dr Hamid Mehmood , consultant anesthesiologist at the Dow University of Health Sciences .
" What we desperately need right now are the PPEs ( personal protective equipment ) .
"  " Walking out of my home at 7:30 in the morning , leaving the kids asleep , I ask myself every day -- ' Do I really have to walk in that isolation ward of patients with Covid-19 ? Am I safe .
the worst thought is am I bringing that virus to my home , to my kids , wife , and parents ? What if I become a carrier ? ' " .
The anesthesiologist adds : " My only survival in these desperate times is via the PPE because I can not distance myself from my patients .
My arsenal , scarce though , is my trustworthy PPE .
"  Helping Covid-19 patients in increasingly harrowing circumstances , Dr Mehmood says if healthcare workers get sick , then there is n't going to be anyone to treat the patients .
Ensuring a smooth supply of the very basic PPEs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre 's executive director Dr Seemi Jamali in her battle with this virus .
" We have PPEs for now , but we will require a lot more , " she says .
Dr Shobha Luxmi , who heads the isolation ward at the DUHS , says she has enough PPEs " at least for now " , but what her hospital needs immediately and urgently are sanitisers .
At the moment , they are rationing on PPEs and diluting sanitisers to make them last longer .
The ration has extended to the N95 masks as well .
" Our N95 masks are our lifesavers , but in short supply .
We use them very carefully and after each use put them in brown bags marked with our names to be re-used , till these wilt away , " says Dr Muneeba Ahsan Sayeed , infectious diseases physician at the DUHS .
" And can you please tell your readers , these masks are not for them , so do not cause shortage for us ? " she asks , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn by healthcare workers so they can protect themselves while treating contagious patients .

At the Indus Hospital ( IH ) , they have found a solution to make their PPEs last longer as well as to double their protection .
" We wear another disposable gown on top of the one that comes with the PPE , " says Dr Fivzia Farooq Herekar , consultant internist and infectious disease specialist at the IH .
At the DUHS , they wear another pair of lower quality gloves over their latex ones and shed it after seeing a patient .
Doctors getting sick , hospitals short-staffed  Already , it has been reported that six doctors , some very senior ones , in Karachi have contracted the virus .
" I think if doctors and paramedical staff elsewhere in the country are protesting and are hesitant to report to work , if not provided proper PPE , then it 's justified , " points out Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the situation is going to get worse , " anticipates Dr Mehmood .
" We just do n't have enough manpower even if we have the PPEs for them .
Our janitorial staff , even our nurses are too scared to go near a Covid-19 patient for fear of catching the virus , " he says .
Most hospitals , including private ones , had always been short of ancillary staff .
" Some patients on ventilators who can not move at all , need to be turned every couple of hours , some need to get their soiled pampers changed , or a patient 's room needs clearing and cleaning , which involves moving his/her stuff .
"  At a minimum , Dr Mehmood says , a hospital taking care of 10 elderly patients infected with Covid-19 ( and some on ventilators ) needs 35 people for the duration of 24 hours -- with each doing a six hour shift .
" These include ward boys , sweepers , porters , phlebotomists , radiographers , on-floor duty doctors , nursing incharge , shift incharge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds , " counts the anesthetist .
With Pakistan sitting on a ticking " time bomb " of Covid-19 patients , Dr Mehmood anticipates the virus will hit the elderly whose health condition is already compromised , especially those who are diabetic and those who are suffering from hypertension .
" We will need assistance for taking them to the washroom , help them with eating , you know little chores that do not require any special medical skill , " he says .
So what they will need , soon , says Dr Mehmood , is a brigade of young , energetic educated people who can , once provided a crash course in biosafety , quickly understand instructions on how to wear the PPE properly and store and doff it off carefully as well to avoid contamination .
Willing to volunteer , but not without proper SOPs  Twenty-five-year-old Mohammad Ismail , who founded a virtual group of science students , called Scientists Against Covid-19 Pakistan ( SACP-19 ) , and which today has over 3,500 young and eager Pakistanis from across the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even we would prefer that the most trained/most experienced people from among us go first as they are more likely to be careful compared to an eager undergrad who could make mistakes in their excitement .
"  Ismail adds that the only reason SACP-19 has not connected its young volunteers to the authorities so far has been the lack of availability of proper PPEs .
The SACP-19 is working to arm its members with a set of standard operating procedures ( SOPs ) in the Covid-19 context to ask of local authorities and hospitals as to whether these are being followed , before the group forwards its list of available volunteers .
The SOPs also require the availability of " isolated accommodation as it is not advisable for these volunteers to go back home for at least three weeks , " points out Ismail .
What it 's like to wear the PPE and the N95 mask  Not quite a hazmat suit , the basic personal protective equipment that healthcare workers in Pakistan are asking for includes a coverall made of an impermeable material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( both N95 and the three-layered surgical mask ) .
It takes about 10 minutes to get into scrubs , wash up and wear the PPE .
" Do not rush to wear the PPE as it needs to be donned on properly , " advises Dr Herekar .
But it is not the most comfortable of equipment everyone agrees and " adhering to the PPE protocols is quite a challenge " says Dr Sayeed .
" You sweat profusely , " she says , adding that one can not remain in it for more than four to six hours .
That is probably because DUHS is not air conditioned .
However , most doctors prefer and feel safer to not be in an air-conditioned isolation room which may not have a negative pressure when a hepa filter is used , increasing manifold the chances of catching an infection .
" The infection is air-borne and without a hepa filter that controls the spread of particulate matter through ducts , those inside the wards can catch the disease , " says Dr Mehmood .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drink , eat , go to the washroom , " once you 've donned it .
But the IH has a room next to the isolation ward where doctors can go sip some water if they need to .
An N95 mask .
-- Reuters  But more than the coverall , it is the N95 mask that is terrifying .
" Breathing in and out takes a huge effort and your communication is impaired , and you need to speak louder to be heard , " says Dr Sayeed .
" It saps my energy .
"  " It needs getting acclimatised to , " agrees Dr Herekar , adding : " For those not used to it , or wearing it for the first time , it can cause dizziness .
"  " And what a relief it is when you doff it , " she says , adding that " it does take both a physical and mental strain on you " .
