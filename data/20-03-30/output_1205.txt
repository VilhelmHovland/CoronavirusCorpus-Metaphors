Parking charges suspended until further notice  Council-run car parks and on-street parking bays in Calderdale are now free to use , as part of Calderdale Council 's ongoing response to the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak .
The Council has suspended its parking charges across the borough until further notice , with priority given to key workers ( external link ) such as people working in health and social care .
This is to enable them to continue their work to support the COVID-19 response , without having to worry about paying for parking .
" At this extremely challenging time , we continue to do everything we can to help local people stay safe and well .
Our advice is always to stay at home and away from other people unless it 's absolutely essential .
But in the case of key workers , their work is critical to the COVID-19 response , and they are out there on the frontline day in , day out , going the extra mile to help protect us .
We are truly grateful for their amazing efforts and hope that our decision to suspend parking charges goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Throughout the parking charges suspension period , Council teams will be out and about across Calderdale , making sure people do not abuse the relaxation of parking charges or any of the usual parking rules to protect people 's safety .
People must never park dangerously or inconsiderately -- for example , do not park on double yellow lines , near junctions , across dropped kerbs or in ways that obstruct the free flow of traffic , particularly for emergency vehicles , delivery vehicles and waste and recycling collection vehicles .
Parking time limits are in place in areas where there is most demand , so people are asked to respect these to ensure that everyone who needs a parking space can get one easily .
People must also respect resident parking permit areas .
Calderdale Council continues to work on all aspects of the response to COVID-19 .
