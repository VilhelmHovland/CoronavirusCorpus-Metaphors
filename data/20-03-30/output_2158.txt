Social Sharing  Doug Ford 's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic draws praise from friends and foes  Doug Ford has been turning heads since it became clear that Canada would not be spared the spread of the novel coronavirus .
But many of those heads , once likely to be thrown back in dismay , are now bestowing nods of approval .
Social Sharing  Premier 's public appearances during COVID-19 crisis have been free from political attacks  No aspect of Canadian life has been left untouched by the COVID-19 pandemic , including politics , and pundits agree the premier of Ontario is one of those most transformed by the outbreak .
Doug Ford , a divisive player on the regional stage long before becoming an equally polarizing national figure , has been turning heads since it became clear that Canada would not be spared the spread of the novel coronavirus .
But many of those heads , once likely to be thrown back in dismay , are now bestowing nods of approval .
Gone is the pugnacious partisanship and populist rhetoric that opponents once used to compare Ford to U .
President Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread plaudits for their calm , collegial tone as well as their comparatively progressive content .
Such an approach , political observers say , differs not only from that demonstrated by like-minded politicians south of the border but from his own past conduct .
" I 'm a Liberal , but I 'll give Doug Ford a lot of credit -- he 's handling this really well , " said Dan Moulton , vice-president at Crestview Strategy and former senior staff member in the previous Liberal government .
" He 's being transparent , responsive , engaging .
Ontarians are really seeing him in action .
"  Praise from the centre or left of the spectrum has been rare through Ford 's unorthodox and colourful political career .
During his time as Toronto city councillor , Ford drew heavily on his experience running the family label-making business and his well-honed populist instincts to carve out a reputation for staunch conservatism and straight talk .
Those traits remained on full display when he became premier in June 2018 and throughout a tumultuous first year in office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host of core policies and promises .
Slashed the size of city council  He arbitrarily slashed the size of Toronto city council half-way through a municipal election campaign , then threatened to invoke the rarely used notwithstanding clause to overturn a court decision that found his actions unconstitutional .
The case will now be heard by the Supreme Court of Canada .
He led a coalition of provincial premiers who took the federal government to court over its carbon tax and rarely missed an opportunity to level partisan broadsides at real or perceived political foes .

( Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press )  All that changed earlier this month , and Ford 's near-daily public appearances during the COVID-19 crisis have been free from political attacks .
In an interview with The Canadian Press , Ford said unprecedented times called for a fresh approach .
" We put differences aside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of his current , friendly relationship with federal and municipal officials .
Ford 's reference to the will of the people is more familiar to political analysts , as is the clear communication style that 's characterized most of his speeches since the pandemic took hold and prompted him to be among the first provincial leaders to declare a state of emergency .
Political communications consultant Tim Abray said clear messaging has long been one of Ford 's political strengths , noting that aspect of his performance to date has not come as a surprise .
More striking , he said , has been Ford 's willingness to give equal prominence to credible scientists and public health officials , ensuring reliable information is readily available in one of the provinces hardest hit by the outbreak .
Moulton agreed , crediting Ford for showcasing some of his strongest cabinet performers during a slew of multibillion-dollar spending announcements made to safeguard the province during the pandemic .
Populist appeal remains  Some trademark measures remain , such as significant corporate tax breaks , and Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassioned rant against a high-end store selling disinfectant wipes for $30 .
But the new announcements have also included measures that depart radically from his government 's usual agenda , such as boosting income for some poor residents and jettisoning the party 's oft-stated goal of balancing the province 's books .
Ford has called front-line workers the unsung heroes of Ontario 's state of emergency .
( Evan Mitsui/CBC )  The approach has not gone unnoticed , even drawing praise from traditional political adversaries well outside of Ontario .
" While I ca n't say I have historically been a fan of ( at ) fordnation , I have to say he is doing an incredible job on the COVID-19 file , " wrote B .
Green party Leader Andrew Weaver on Twitter .
" He has shown strong , decisive and compassionate leadership at a critical moment in Ontario 's history .
"  Such praise marks a reversal for Ford , whose popularity had plummeted to new lows in the months preceding the outbreak .
" The main thing that has been driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during normal times , of the ability to listen to non-aligned voices , " Abray said , noting Ford has previously demonstrated an ability to adjust his position in the face of new information .
" What I think he 's done is he 's stepped up and is behaving more like Doug Ford the person rather than Doug Ford the partisan Tory .
"  Ford , for his part , said the experience of steering Ontario through the pandemic has produced lessons that will be applied once the crisis passes .
" There are so many things that we can agree on , " he said " There 's so much opportunity for governments to get a lot more done if we all work together .
