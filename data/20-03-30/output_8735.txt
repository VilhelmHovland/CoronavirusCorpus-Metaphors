ARLINGTON , Va .
( FOX 5 DC ) - According to the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority , total sales at ABC stores in the Commonwealth are up 59 percent year-to-year , which has some doctors concerned about increased drinking during a pandemic becoming a trigger for addicts or those in recovery .
ABC officials say the year-to-year increase is based on sales from state stores between March 15 and March 21 .
The region seeing the largest sales increase was Northern Virginia .
But the demand for alcohol is not unique to Virginia .
Stores in Maryland have seen long lines and the District has allowed to-go sales of alcohol for restaurants and bars also selling food .
" It 's been like Thanksgiving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been .
Unbelievable numbers , " said Suzanne Lewis , owner of Ballenger Beer &amp; Spirits in Frederick , Maryland .

Charles Samenow , an associate professor of psychiatry at George Washington University , says increased drinking and the isolation people are experiencing during the coronavirus pandemic could become a trigger .

Not only from the disease but then seeing some of the main ways people are coping through these online happy hours and drinking , it really puts a risk for relapse , " said Dr .

Samenow says most medical professionals would not discourage moderate and responsible drinking , but a red flag that increased drinking is becoming a problem in family or friends is when it seems drinking is controlling that person 's life .
