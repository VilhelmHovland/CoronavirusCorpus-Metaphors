Sheila Shapiro might have had underlying health issues , but she did not think that it was her time to go  So when you hear about the number of deaths from coronavirus on the news , or study the graphs of infections and fatalities , know that Sheila , loved as a mother , a wife and a friend , is one of that number .
But like everyone else claimed by this deadly virus , she is so much more than a statistic .
Sheila dealt with her death in the way she dealt with her life - uncomplainingly , stoically , and with a quiet strength , never resorting to self-pity , even when she had plenty of cause .

She was married to the same man , a former rabbi , for 54 years , and was from a generation who had never felt a sense of entitlement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big C that claimed her ; it was the other C , the one we had never heard about until the turn of the year .
The coronavirus statistics hide so many harrowing tales of people dying alone , unable to say goodbye , but at least Sheila was able to have her family around her , and had taken the precaution of phoning up those she loved a few days previously , when she knew the writing was on the wall , to say a dignified farewell .

Let 's see how that goes , but I shall forever be grateful to her for that intervention .
There are so many ways in which our way of life has changed over these past weeks of self-isolation and social distancing , but our way of death has changed , too .
Sheila was Jewish , and that faith 's way of marking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Shiva ( the Hebrew word for " seven " ) is part of the process of mourning a person according to Talmudic law , and is considered the third stage of grief , after despair and lamentation .
For seven days , relatives and friends gather at the house of the principal mourner for a short service each evening , but mainly to offer their physical support and words of comfort to the immediate family .
" I wish you long life " is the traditional greeting to someone who has suffered loss .
And as these are Jewish people , there is food provided .
At the end of this seven-day period , the mourners are meant to feel more at peace with life and death .
But coronavirus , while making death more likely , has also got in the way of its observance .
Funerals can not be attended by large groups , a proper wake would be entirely illegal and a shiva is a no-no .
All over the country , people are attending virtual funerals , usually thanks to Zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that I , together with around 100 people , " attended " Sheila 's shiva .
It was a rather surreal experience , seeing all these unfamiliar faces bound together by mourning , and hearing lots of voices all at the same time saying " Can you hear me ? "  But it was also extremely moving , the strange , unprecedented and terrible circumstances in which we find ourselves only adding to the gravity of the occasion .
The virtual came across as very real indeed .
The rabbi was able to use the " mute all " button - which may be considered a valuable tool when most Jewish families get together - and the service was , in its own way , beautiful , respectful and touching .
The widower , Norman , was moved to say that he " could feel the warmth coming through the air " .
It made me marvel about the technology that made this possible , but mainly about how it elevated the human spirit .
