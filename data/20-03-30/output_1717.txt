Leeds comedian and panto star Billy Pearce has recorded a video message to lift the spirits of people in his community during the current coronavirus lockdown .
The 69-year-old performer , who lives in Tingley , south Leeds , filmed himself cracking jokes and urging people to stay safe in the video which he sent to local volunteer group WF3 Kindness .
The group was set up in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and covers the Tingley , Ardsley and Thorpe areas of the city , aiming to bring together relatives , neighbours and friends who need support while in isolation .
Founder Dan Frank said he made contact with the comedy legend to spread the word about their efforts .
