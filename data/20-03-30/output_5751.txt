CHICAGO -- Bill Purdue waterproofs basements for a living , but he has spent the past few days in his buddy 's Washington , Indiana , auto trim and upholstery shop cutting rectangles of cotton fabric that his friend sews into face masks .
Fashion designer Briana Danyele left Italy last month to return to her mother 's Greer , South Carolina , home , where she has turned the living room into a mini sewing factory , making masks that she embroiders with the words , " We Got This ! "  They 're among scores of people answering pleas from hospitals , doctors and nurses so desperate for personal protective equipment amid the viral pandemic that they 've turned to the public , saying do-it-yourself face masks are better than nothing .
And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals and the economy teeters , sewing masks makes them feel less helpless .
" Whatever it takes to get the job done , that 's what I want to do , " said Purdue , 57 , whose daughter works at the women 's hospital in Evansville , Indiana .
He and his friend Mike Rice responded to a Facebook post last week from Deaconess Health System in Evansville asking the public for help .
The efforts mirror those in other countries , including Spain , where mask-making volunteers include a group of nuns and members of the Spanish Air Force .

Deaconess spokeswoman Pam Hight said the hospital system realized it could face a shortage if local infections skyrocket like they have elsewhere .

" We had people who wanted to ship them to us from all over the United States and we started saying , ' Please , please use them in your communities , ' " she said .
" It makes your heart warm ; people are so good .
"  She said Deaconess expects to collect thousands of masks this week at an off-hospital site and sanitize them before distributing them to nurses and doctors or sending them to local nursing homes and homeless shelters .

And if hospitals run out , the CDC said , scarfs or bandanas could be used " as a last resort , " though some health officials warned cloth masks might not work .
Mary Dale Peterson , president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists and chief operating officer at a Corpus Christi , Texas , children 's hospital , said she declined volunteers ' offers to make masks .
She said construction and manufacturing industries instead should donate or sell the high-grade masks they have to hospitals .

Businesses also are stepping up .
Crafts chain Joann Stores is making all of its 800-plus stores available for up to 10 people at each location to sew masks and hospital gowns , offering sewing machines and supplies , spokeswoman Amanda Hayes said .
Hayes said the number of people allowed in the stores adheres to CDC guidelines , the sewing stations will be six feet apart and staff will continuously sanitize the work areas and materials .
The company also has special kits for customers who want to make masks at home .
" We 're enabling people to feel like they are contributing at a time when we do n't have control , " Hayes said .

Danyele , the South Carolina fashion designer , said she made about 200 masks bound for a local nursing home and hospitals in Florida , Georgia , Indiana and Illinois .
" If I 'm one person creating 200 masks , imagine what we all could do , " said Danyele , 24 .
