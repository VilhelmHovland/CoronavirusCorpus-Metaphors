In the third week of February , as the COVID-19 epidemic was still flaring in China , I arrived in Kolkata , India .
I woke up to a sweltering morning -- the black kites outside my hotel room were circling upward , lifted by the warming currents of air -- and I went to visit a shrine to the goddess Shitala .
Her name means " the cool one " ; as the myth has it , she arose from the cold ashes of a sacrificial fire .
The heat that she is supposed to diffuse is not just the fury of summer that hits the city in mid-June but also the inner heat of inflammation .
She is meant to protect children from smallpox , heal the pain of those who contract it , and dampen the fury of a pox epidemic .
The shrine was a small structure within a temple a few blocks from Kolkata Medical College .
Inside , there was a figurine of the goddess , sitting on a donkey and carrying her jar of cooling liquid -- the way she has been depicted for a millennium .
The temple was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .
That would date it to around the time when accounts first appeared of a mysterious sect of Brahmans wandering up and down the Gangetic plain to popularize the practice of tika , an early effort at inoculation .
This involved taking matter from a smallpox patient 's pustule -- a snake pit of live virus -- and applying it to the pricked skin of an uninfected person , then covering the spot with a linen rag .
The Indian practitioners of tika had likely learned it from Arabic physicians , who had learned it from the Chinese .
As early as 1100 , medical healers in China had realized that those who survived smallpox did not catch the illness again ( survivors of the disease were enlisted to take care of new victims ) , and inferred that the exposure of the body to an illness protected it from future instances of that illness .
Chinese doctors would grind smallpox scabs into a powder and insufflate it into a child 's nostril with a long silver pipe .
Vaccination with live virus was a tightrope walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too great , the child would succumb to a full-fledged version of the disease -- a disaster that occurred perhaps one in a hundred times .
If all went well , the child would have a mild experience of the disease , and be immunized for life .
By the seventeen-hundreds , the practice had spread throughout the Arab world .
In the seventeen-sixties , women in Sudan practiced tishteree el jidderee ( " buying the pox " ) : one mother haggling with another over how many of a sick child 's ripe pustules she would buy for her own son or daughter .
It was an exquisitely measured art : the most astute traditional healers recognized the lesions that were likely to yield just enough viral material , but not too much .
The European name for the disease , variola , comes from the Latin for " spotted " or " pimpled .
" The process of immunizing against the pox was called " variolation .
"  Lady Mary Wortley Montagu , the wife of the British Ambassador to Constantinople , had herself been stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin pitted with scars .
Later , in the Turkish countryside , she witnessed the practice of variolation , and wrote to her friends in wonder , describing the work of one specialist : " The old woman comes with a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox , and asks what vein you please to have opened , " whereupon she " puts into the vein as much matter as can lie upon the head of her needle .
" Patients retired to bed for a couple of days with a fever , and , Lady Montagu noted , emerged remarkably unscathed .
" They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces , which never mark ; and in eight days ' time they are as well as before their illness .
" She reported that thousands safely underwent the operation every year , and that the disease had largely been contained in the region .
" You may believe I am well satisfied of the safety of this experiment , " she added , " since I intend to try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the pox .
In the centuries since Lady Montagu marvelled at the efficacy of inoculation , we 've made unimaginable discoveries in the biology and epidemiology of infectious disease , and yet the COVID-19 pandemic poses no shortage of puzzles .
Why did it spread like wildfire in Italy , thousands of miles from its initial epicenter , in Wuhan , while India appears so far to have largely been spared ? What animal species transmitted the original infection to humans ?  But three questions deserve particular attention , because their answers could change the way we isolate , treat , and manage patients .
First , what can we learn about the " dose-response curve " for the initial infection -- that is , can we quantify the increase in the risk of infection as people are exposed to higher doses of the virus ? Second , is there a relationship between that initial " dose " of virus and the severity of the disease -- that is , does more exposure result in graver illness ? And , third , are there quantitative measures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peak of your body 's viral load , the patterns of its rise and fall ) that predict the severity of their illness and how infectious they are to others ? So far , in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic , we have been measuring the spread of the virus across people .
As the pace of the pandemic escalates , we also need to start measuring the virus within people .
Most epidemiologists , given the paucity of data , have been forced to model the spread of the new coronavirus as if it were a binary phenomenon : individuals are either exposed or unexposed , infected or uninfected , symptomatic patients or asymptomatic carriers .
Recently , the Washington Post published a particularly striking online simulation , in which people in a city were depicted as dots moving freely in space -- uninfected ones in gray , infected ones in red ( then shifting to pink , as immunity was acquired ) .
Each time a red dot touched a gray dot , the infection was transmitted .
With no intervention , the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social distancing and isolation kept the dots from knocking into one another , and slowed the spread of red across the screen .
This was a bird's-eye view of a virus radiating through a population , seen as an " on-off " phenomenon .
The doctor and medical researcher in me -- as a graduate student , I was trained in viral immunology -- wanted to know what was going on within the dots .
How much virus was in that red dot ? How fast was it replicating in this dot ? How was the exposure -- the " touch time " -- related to the chance of transmission ? How long did a red dot remain red -- that is , how did an individual 's infectiousness change over time ? And what was the severity of disease in each case ?  What we 've learned about other viruses -- including the ones that cause AIDS , SARS , and smallpox -- suggests a more complex view of the disease , its rate of progression , and strategies for containment .
In the nineteen-nineties , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's blood , a distinct pattern emerged .
After an infection , the virus count in the blood would rise to a zenith , known as " peak viremia , " and patients with the highest peak viremia typically became sicker sooner ; they were least able to resist the virus .
Even more predictive than the peak viral load was the so-called set point -- the level at which someone 's virus count settled after its initial peak .
It represented a dynamic equilibrium that was reached between the virus and its human host .
People with a high set point tended to progress more rapidly to AIDS ; people with a low set point frequently proved to be " slow progressors .
" The viral load -- a continuum , not a binary value -- helped predict the nature , course , and transmissibility of the disease .
To be sure , every virus has its own personality , and H .
has traits that make viral load especially revealing : it causes a chronic infection , and one that specifically targets cells of the immune system .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Advertisement  And , immunologically , that 's not surprising .
If your system is able to combat viral replication with some efficiency -- owing to your age , your genetics , and other indices of immune competence -- you 'll have a lower set point .
Could a lower initial exposure , as with children treated with tika , also lead to a lower set point ? Faced with a smaller challenge , the immune system could have a greater chance of controlling the pathogen .
In contrast , if you 're inundated with multiple high-dose exposures , the swiftly replicating invader could gain ground that the immune system might be hard-pressed to reconquer .
An ingenious study on the relationship between the intensity of viral exposure and infectivity in human beings comes from a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington , in Seattle .
In 2018 , an epidemiologist and statistician named Bryan Mayer joined a group of physicians and biologists who were researching a problem that seemed , on its face , almost impossible to tackle .
Mayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise : he uses words carefully , and speaks in long , slow sentences .
" Even as a graduate student , I was interested in the idea of a dose of a virus or a pathogen , " he told me .
" But the problem is that the initial dose is often impossible to capture , because you only know a person is infected after he or she has been infected .
" Most infectious diseases can only be viewed in a rearview mirror : by the time a patient becomes a patient , that critical moment of transmission has already passed .
But the researchers found an unusual resource : a cohort of new mothers and their children in Kampala , Uganda .
A few years earlier , a pediatrician named Soren Gantt and a team of doctors examined these women , and asked them to provide oral swabs for a year .
Then they measured how much the women shed a virus called HHV-6 , which is usually spread through oral secretions to an infant after birth , and which causes fever and a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount of virus-shedding -- the " dose " of exposure -- affected the likelihood of a newborn infant becoming infected .
Gantt , Mayer , and their colleagues had devised a way to eavesdrop on the dynamics of the transmission of a human viral infection from the very start .
" Our data confirmed that there 's a dose-response relationship in viral transmissions for HHV-6 , " Mayer told me .
" The more virus you shed , the more likely you are to infect others .
" He 'd managed to turn around the rearview mirror of epidemiology .
There 's another aspect of transmission and disease , however : the host immune response .
Viral attack and the immune system 's defense are two opposing forces , constantly at odds .
The Russian immunologist Ilya Metchnikoff , working in the early nineteen-hundreds , described the phenomenon as " the struggle " -- or Kampf , in German editions of his work .
Metchnikoff imagined an ongoing battle between microbe and immunity .
The Kampf was a matter of ground gained or lost .
What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host factors -- genetics , prior exposure , baseline immune competence -- were limiting the microbial invasion ? And then : was the initial equilibrium tipped toward the virus , or toward the host ?  That raises the second question -- does a larger viral " dose " result in more severe disease ? It 's impossible to erase from one 's memory the image of Li Wenliang , the thirty-three-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist who sounded the alarm on the first COVID-19 cases , in his final illness ; a photograph shows him crimson-faced , sweating , and struggling to breathe in a face mask , shortly before his death .
Then there 's the unexpected death of Xia Sisi , a twenty-nine-year-old doctor from Union Jiangbei Hospital of Wuhan , who had a two-year-old child and , the Timesreported , loved Sichuan hot pot .
Another Chinese health-care worker , a twenty-nine-year-old nurse in Wuhan , fell so critically ill that she started hallucinating ; later , she would describe herself as " walking on the edge of death .
"  Could the striking severity of their disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flu-like illness -- be correlated with the amount of virus to which they were initially exposed ? At least two E .
doctors in the United States , both on the front lines of the pandemic , have also fallen critically ill ; one of them , in Washington State , is only in his forties .
To go by available data from Wuhan and Italy , health-care workers do n't necessarily have a higher fatality rate , but do they suffer , disproportionately , from the most severe forms of the disease ? " We know the high mortality in older people , " Peter Hotez , an infectious-disease specialist and vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine , told CNN .
" But , for reasons that we do n't understand , front-line health-care workers are at great risk for serious illness despite their younger age .
"  Some suggestive research has been done with other viruses .
In animal models of influenza , it 's possible to precisely quantify exposure intensity , and mice who were given higher doses of certain influenza viruses developed a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlation between dose and disease severity varied widely from one strain of the flu to the next .
( Curiously , in one study a higher initial load of respiratory syncytial virus , which can cause pneumonia , especially in young children , correlated negatively with severe disease -- although another study suggests that the correlation is positive with toddlers , the most affected patient population .
)  What sparse evidence we have about coronaviruses suggests that they may follow the pattern seen in influenza .
In a 2004 study of the coronavirus that causes SARS , a cousin of the one that causes COVID-19 , a team from Hong Kong found that a higher initial load of virus -- measured in the nasopharynx , the cavity in the deep part of your throat above your palate -- was correlated with a more severe respiratory illness .
Nearly all the SARS patients who came in initially with a low or undetectable level of virus in the nasopharynx were found at a two-month follow-up to be still alive .
Those with the highest level had a twenty- to forty-per-cent mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's age , underlying conditions , and the like .
Research into another acute viral illness , Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever , reached a similar conclusion : the more virus you had at the start , the more likely you were to die .
Perhaps the strongest association between the intensity of exposure and the intensity of subsequent disease is seen in measles research .
" I want to emphasize that measles and COVID-19 are different diseases caused by very different viruses with different behaviors , " Rik de Swart , a virologist at Erasmus University , in Rotterdam , cautioned when we spoke , " but in measles there are several clear indications that the severity of illness relates to the dose of exposure .
And it makes immunological sense , because the interaction between the virus and the immune system is a race in time .
It 's a race between the virus finding enough target cells to replicate and the antiviral response aiming to eliminate the virus .
If you give the virus a head start with a large dose , you get higher viremia , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Advertisement  He described a study from 1994 in which researchers gave monkeys different doses of the measles virus and found that higher infection doses were associated with earlier peaks in viremia .
In human beings , de Swart added , the best evidence comes from studies in sub-Saharan Africa .
" If you acquire measles through household contacts , where the density and dose of exposure is the highest -- you might be sharing a bed with an infected child -- then you typically have a higher risk of developing more severe illness , " he said .
" If a child contracts the disease through playground or casual contact , the disease is usually less severe .
"  I discussed this aspect of infection with the Harvard virologist and immunologist Dan Barouch , whose lab is among those that are working toward a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 .
He told me that ongoing studies with macaques are investigating the relationship between the initial dose of the SARS-CoV-2 viral inoculum and the amount of virus in lung secretions at a later time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If we extended this logic to humans , we would expect a similar relationship , " he said .
" And , logically , the larger amount of virus should trigger more severe disease by prompting a brisker inflammatory response .
But that is still speculative .
The relationship between initial viral dose and severity remains to be seen .
"  To answer the third question -- whether we can track a COVID-19 patient 's viral load in a way that helps us predict the course of the disease -- we 'll need more quantitative research into SARS-CoV-2 counts within patients .
One unpublished German study has measured viral loads on oral swabs taken of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals .
Initially , it was reported that patients who experienced no symptoms had slightly higher loads than those who fell ill .
The results were curious .
But at the time only seven patients had been studied .
Sandra Ciesek , the director of the Institute of Medical Virology , in Frankfurt , who was running the study , told me that no significant differences between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sampled .
" In swabs , we do n't know of a correlation , " she informed me .
The problem with measuring viral loads in a swab is that it is " affected by preanalytic factors , such as the way in which the swab is taken , " she added .
Oral swabs are notoriously affected by small variations in how they 're done .
" But a correlation with severe disease may well be true for the viral load in blood .
" Joshua Schiffer , a clinical virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Center , and a co-author of the HHV-6 study , reports that more stringent nasal-swabbing methods for a range of respiratory viruses have yielded consistent , reliable viral-load counts , and that these loads have generally tracked well with disease symptoms and progression .
In a paper published online by The Lancet Infectious Diseases in March , researchers at the University of Hong Kong and Nanchang University reported that viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs from a group of patients with severe COVID-19 were sixty times higher , on average , than the loads among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the virus continues to cyclone across the world , we will begin to find quantitative answers to these questions of how exposure intensity and subsequent viral loads relate to the clinical course of COVID-19 .
We will supplement the bird's-eye view with the worm's-eye view .
How will these insights change the way we manage patients , hospitals , and populations ?  Start with the relationship between exposure intensity and infection .
Think , for a moment , of how we monitor those who work with radiation .
Using radiation dosimetry , we quantify someone 's total exposure , and we set limits on it .
We already know how critical it is for doctors and nurses to limit exposure to the coronavirus by using protective equipment ( masks , gloves , gowns ) .
But for health-care workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic , especially in places where protective equipment is scarce , we might also keep track of total exposure , and put in place viral-dosimetry controls , so that one individual can avoid repeated interactions with some set of highly contagious patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , in turn , affect patient care .
If we could identify pre-symptomatic patients who were likely exposed to the highest doses of viruses -- someone cohabitating or socializing with multiple sick family members ( as with the close-knit Fusco family of Freehold , New Jersey , which has had four deaths ) , or a nurse exposed to a set of patients shedding large amounts of the virus -- we might predict a more severe experience of the disease , and give them priority when it came to limited medical resources , so that they could be treated faster , earlier , or more intensively .
And , finally , the care of COVID-19 patients could change if we began to track virus counts .
These parameters could be gauged using fairly inexpensive and easily available laboratory methods .
Imagine a two-step process : first , identifying infected patients , and then quantifying viral loads in nasal or respiratory secretions , particularly in patients who are likely to require the highest level of treatment .
Correlating virus counts and therapeutic measures with outcomes might result in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quantitative approach applies to clinical studies as well .
Clinical drug trials are typically more informative when run on subjects who are n't yet critical ; once the subjects have reached that stage , any therapy might be too little , too late .
And if the disease course in such patients is followed using viral-load metrics , rather than by tracking symptoms alone , the effect of a drug in different trials can be compared more easily and accurately .
We will also want to be able to identify people who have recovered from infection , have become immune to SARS-CoV-2 , and are no longer contagious .
Such people must meet two criteria : they must have a measured absence of viral shedding , and they must have signs of persistent immunity in their blood ( something readily determined by an antibody test ) .
As the Chinese discovered with smallpox in the twelfth century , such individuals -- especially those who are health-care workers -- are of particular value to medicine : barring any decay in immunity , they can generally tend to the sickest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in oncology .
Measurement and enumeration are the mainstays of medicine for people in my field : the size of a tumor , the number of metastases , the exact shrinkage of a malignant mass after chemotherapy .
We talk about " risk stratification " ( categorizing patients according to health status ) and the " stratification of response " ( categorizing patients according to their response to treatment ) .
I am able to spend half an hour or more with every patient to describe risk , explain how a remission is measured , and carefully devise a clinical plan .
A pandemic , by contrast , goes hand in hand with panic .
Chaos reigns .
Italian doctors are hanging I .
drips on makeshift poles for patients lying on makeshift cots in makeshift wards .
Measurement -- viral-load testing -- can seem like an improbable indulgence under such circumstances .
But this crisis will require that we stratify and assess risk , and deploy dwindling resources in the most effective manner .

" It is the science of aggregation , the science of the many .
Yet it works most effectively when it moves in step with medicine , the science of the one .
On the morning I visited the Shitala shrine in Kolkata , the goddess of bygone population-decimating epidemics was also serving as the personal goddess of a mother who had brought a child with a weeklong fever .
To win the Kampf against COVID-19 , it 's essential to trace the course of the virus as it moves through populations .
But it 's equally essential to measure its course within a single patient .
The one becomes the many .
