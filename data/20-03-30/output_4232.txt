Online Delivery in the time of COVID-19  Member  Are ANY of the online delivery services of the major retailers working ?  Pick n Pay : Garbage service last time , I had no idea they did n't " pre-pack " or " pre-reserve " your order .
Admittedly if I had known this I would never have used their online order service because the guy called me to say of the 18 different items , they could only get 6 .
On top of that , they charge you the full order amount and refund you 7 days later - which in our case was a substantial amount of money to have floating around in the Ether .
Oh yeah , and only delivery slots are on like the 15th of April .
Checkers Sixty60 : App keeps saying its full , just a notice that they 're at capacity , see you tomorrow - well it IS tomorrow so what now ?

Only recently looked into this , because corona , yay ! but my experience has been similar  PnP : if you choose " Click &amp; Collect " instead of delivery that will have more slots available , but you still have to go in store and they messed up my order big time , the fact that they do not pre-pack could work in your favour as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock arrives by the time your delivery comes up .
Got a delivery coming 2 April , will see how it goes , have n't been charged " full amounts " though ? ! ? So far the charge is only done once the order is packed , and it is minus the items that were out of stock  Sixty60 : very small coverage area , the entire western seaboard is not covered so I ca n't even try  Expert Member  Only recently looked into this , because corona , yay ! but my experience has been similar  PnP : if you choose " Click &amp; Collect " instead of delivery that will have more slots available , but you still have to go in store and they messed up my order big time , the fact that they do not pre-pack could work in your favour as well as against you though , maybe something currently out of stock arrives by the time your delivery comes up .
