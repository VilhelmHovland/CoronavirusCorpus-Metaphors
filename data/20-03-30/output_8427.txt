In Case You Missed It :  If you 've been exposed to the coronavirus  If you 've been exposed , are sick , or are caring for someone with COVID-19  Published : March , 2020  As the new coronavirus spreads across the globe , the chances that you will be exposed and get sick continue to increase .
If you 've been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or begin to experience symptoms of the disease , you may be asked to self-quarantine or self-isolate .
What does that entail , and what can you do to prepare yourself for an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you start to be contagious ? And what can you do to prevent others in your household from getting sick ?  What are the symptoms of COVID-19 ?  Some people infected with the virus have no symptoms .
When the virus does cause symptoms , common ones include dry cough , fatigue , low-grade fever , body aches , nasal congestion , and sore throat .
However , COVID-19 can occasionally cause more severe symptoms like high fever , severe cough , and shortness of breath , which often indicates pneumonia .
What should I do if I think I or my child may have a COVID-19 infection ?  First call your doctor or pediatrician for advice .
If you do not have a doctor and you are concerned that you or your child may have COVID-19 , contact your local board of health .
They can direct you to the best place for evaluation and treatment in your area .
It 's best to not seek medical care in an emergency department unless you have symptoms of severe illness .
Severe symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , confusion , or feeling you might pass out .
Call the emergency department ahead of time to let the staff know that you are coming , so they can be prepared for your arrival .
How do I know if I have COVID-19 or the regular flu ?  COVID-19 often causes symptoms similar to those a person with a bad cold or the flu would experience .
And like the flu , the symptoms can progress and become life-threatening .
Your doctor is more likely to suspect coronavirus if :  you have respiratory symptoms  and  you have been exposed to someone suspected of having COVID-19 , or  there has been community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in your area .
How is someone tested for COVID-19 ?  A specialized test must be done to confirm that a person has been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 .
Most often a clinician takes a swab of your nose ( or both your nose and throat ) .
New methods of testing that can be done on site will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tests can provide results in as little as 15 -- 45 minutes .
Meanwhile , most tests will still be delivered to labs that have been approved to perform the test .
Some people are starting to have a blood test to look for antibodies to the COVID-19 virus .
Because the blood test for antibodies does n't become positive until after an infected person improves , it is not useful as a diagnostic test at this time .
Scientists are using this blood antibody test to identify potential plasma donors .
The antibodies can be purified from the plasma and may help some very sick people get better .
How reliable is the test for COVID-19 ?  Tests are becoming more widely available and are being processed in commercial labs and academic centers across the country .
In the US , the most common test for the COVID-19 virus looks for viral RNA in a sample taken with a swab from a person 's nose or throat .
Currently , you can expect the test results within three to four days .
The turnaround time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing ramps up .
If a test result comes back positive , it is almost certain that the person is infected .
A negative test result is less definite .
An infected person could get a so-called " false negative " test result if the swab missed the virus , for example , or because of an inadequacy of the test itself .
We also do n't yet know at what point during the course of illness a test becomes positive .
If you experience COVID-like symptoms and get a negative test result , there is no reason to repeat the test unless your symptoms get worse .
If your symptoms do worsen , call your doctor or local or state healthcare department for guidance on further testing .
You should also self-isolate at home .
Wear a mask if you have one when interacting with members of your household .
And practice social distancing .
How soon after I 'm infected with the new coronavirus will I start to be contagious ?  The time from exposure to symptom onset ( known as the incubation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure .
We do n't know the extent to which people who are not yet experiencing symptoms can infect others , but it 's possible that people may be contagious for several days before they become symptomatic .
For how long after I am infected will I continue to be contagious ? At what point in my illness will I be most contagious ?  People are thought to be most contagious early in the course of their illness , when they are beginning to experience symptoms .
The most recent research suggests that people may continue to shed the virus and be potentially contagious for up to eight days after they are feeling better .
If I get sick with COVID-19 , how long until I will feel better ?  It depends on how sick you get .
Those with mild cases appear to recover within one to two weeks .
With severe cases , recovery can take six weeks or more .
According to the most recent estimates , about 1% of infected persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I start to feel better will be it be safe for me to go back out in public again ?  We do n't know for certain .
Based on the most recent research , people may continue to shed the virus and be potentially contagious for up to eight days after they are feeling better .
But these results need to be verified .
Until then , even after eight days of complete resolution of your symptoms , you should still take all precautions if you do need to go out in public , including wearing a mask , minimizing touching surfaces and keeping at least 6 feet of distance away from other people .
What 's the difference between self-isolation and self-quarantine , and who should consider them ?  Self-isolation is voluntary isolation at home by those who have or are likely to have COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms of the disease ( in contrast to those who are severely ill and may be isolated in a hospital ) .
The purpose of self-isolation is to prevent spread of infection from an infected person to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to isolate should be based on physician recommendation .
If you have tested positive for COVID-19 , you should self-isolate .
You should strongly consider self-isolation if you  have been tested for COVID-19 and are awaiting test results  have been exposed to the new coronavirus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 ( fever , cough , difficulty breathing ) , whether or not you have been tested .
You may also consider self-isolation if you have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 ( fever , cough , difficulty breathing ) but have not had known exposure to the new coronavirus and have not been tested for the virus that causes COVID-19 .
In this case , it may be reasonable to isolate yourself until your symptoms fully resolve , or until you are able to be tested for COVID-19 and your test comes back negative .
Self-quarantine for 14 days by anyone with a household member who has been infected , whether or not they themselves are infected , is the current recommendation of the White House task force .
Otherwise , voluntary quarantine at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 virus but are not experiencing symptoms associated with COVID-19 ( fever , cough , difficulty breathing ) .
The purpose of self-quarantine ( as with self-isolation ) is to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 .
When possible , the decision to quarantine should be based on physician recommendation .
Self-quarantine is reasonable if you are not experiencing symptoms , but have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus .
What does it really mean to self-isolate or self-quarantine ? What should or should n't I do ?  If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you may be infected with the COVID-19 virus , it is important not to spread the infection to others while you recover .
While home-isolation or home-quarantine may sound like a staycation , you should be prepared for a long period during which you might feel disconnected from others and anxious about your health and the health of your loved ones .
Staying in touch with others by phone or online can be helpful to maintain social connections , ask for help , and update others on your condition .
