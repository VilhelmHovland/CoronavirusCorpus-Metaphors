Coronavirus restaurant restrictions take bite out of kosher eateries  Bridge Turkish &amp; Mediterranean Grill in Highland Park when it first opened in 2019 .
NJJN File Photo  Hal Robinson , owner of Rye Deli in Springfield , is usually hustling to make sure he keeps up with his steady roster of catering clients .
Orders can include sandwiches for school lunches , chicken marsala for a synagogue fund-raiser , or trays of food for a family sitting shiva .
Now he 's simply looking to keep his eatery running .
In across the state , chairs are stacked on tables or removed entirely as social separation prohibits dining in .
This drastic change hits kosher businesses especially hard as there 's a mark-up in the cost of products and additional fees for kosher supervision .
Even with the uptick in take-out and delivery options , kosher restaurants -- many of whom rely on catering -- are suffering .
" I am just hoping we get through this , " Robinson , who opened his deli , which is under the supervision of the Vaad Harabonim of MetroWest , in October 2016 , told NJJN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be back to normal , but who knows when ? " he said .
" We 're just trying to hang in right now .
"  Robinson , whose business is faring better than eight others NJJN contacted , said he 's hoping Congress ' stimulus package will help small business owners .
" We could , like all others in our business , really use some help at this point , " he said .
The bills , which passed in the Senate , and were expected to be approved in the House March 27 , include $350 billion for forgivable loans of up to $10 million to small businesses .
" I would certainly welcome some help from the government , but I would prefer not to go into a lot of debt over it , " said Michael Kornblum , owner of Sushiana in Highland Park .
Kornblum opened his sushi restaurant in 2012 and is under the supervision of Vaad Harabonim of Raritan Valley .
He told NJJN his business , which is now limited to takeout , has dropped 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
As with his fellow restaurateurs , he 's had to cut both hours and staff , but he 's trying to be creative in his marketing , such as expanding their social media efforts to promote the restaurant 's specials .
" We have put all our specials on our Facebook page and are featuring some items , like our Bento Box , all day instead of just part of the day , " he said .
" I just hope we can get back to normal soon .
"  Last week Jerusalem Restaurant in Livingston announced its closure until after the Passover holiday .
" I have made the food for 15 years here , and I can tell , without dine-in customers , we probably are doing about 35 percent of our usual business , " said chef Jacob Rosenboim .
" We are usually very busy the two weeks before Pesach , but we 're not .
"  Jerusalem , a dairy restaurant , serves pizza , Mediterranean foods , sushi , fish , and more .
" With what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers and our staff , are uneasy , " said Rosenboim , who spent last Tuesday cleaning the restaurant and storing food in freezers .
( Jerusalem Restaurant in Elizabeth , under different ownership than the Livingston location , remains open until Passover .
)  These times are also challenging for Sam Eriske , who opened Bridge Turkish &amp; Mediterranean Grill in Highland Park early in 2015 .
He said his facility , which came under the supervision of the Vaad Harabbonim of Raritan Valley in 2019 , was doing quite well until the Covid-19 pandemic and the social separation procedures that came with it .
" Our business dropped 90 percent , " Eriske told NJJN .
" We have done a little takeout , but we 're not even meeting our expenses , which are $2,000 a day .
We are trying to keep going , but it 's not easy .
"  Eriske 's menu , which includes a variety of kabobs and grilled meats , normally attracts a consistent group of in-house diners .
" We ca n't do that with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not easy .
We really could use some help like the government is talking about .
Currently , we are continuing , but losing $2,000 a day for a month in this situation is $600,000 .
"  Giddy 's Pizzeria and Restaurant , owned by partners Gideon Fentin and Lawrence Margolin , is in its sixth year of operation in East Brunswick .
It is also under the supervision of the Vaad Harabbonim of Raritan Valley , and Covid-19 has put a crimp in this eatery 's business as well .
" We 've had a major drop like everyone else , " Fentin told NJJN .
" Every restaurant is affected , but kosher restaurants even more because they rely so much on catering .
We lost our catering revenue and a lot of our school lunch business .
Some of the families are still ordering , but it 's a lot less .
"  Fentin and his staff , including manager Dani Davis , have come up with a novel fund-raiser to generate community goodwill : They 're accepting monetary donations to provide food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover the cost of ingredients for the fresh meals they deliver to Saint Peter 's University Hospital and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital , " and those healthcare professionals know they are getting food , " said Fentin .
" It 's a win-win .
