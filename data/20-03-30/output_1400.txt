The coronavirus pandemic has cast a shadow over the global art market , putting art events and tradings on halt , while the crisis is expected to accelerate the shift to an online operating model in the event-driven industry .
Global art transactions had shrunk even before the epidemic .
The total art market sales in 2019 slid by 5 percent from a year ago to US$64 .
billion ( HK$500 billion ) , the first drop in three years , dragged by Sino-US trade tensions and slower economic growth , according to the Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report .
Museums and galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group gathering .
Major auction house Christie 's has closed all offices in Europe and the United States .
In Hong Kong , Sotheby 's rescheduled its spring auctions last month to July and transferred a part of activities to New York .
The financial market rout has also forced investors to reallocate their assets , with some of them trading their art collections at discounts for liquidity to meet margin calls , Bloomberg reported citing collectors and art loan lenders .
Art Basel Hong Kong became the first major event to launch online viewing rooms amid a subdued market , after canceling its physical version .
The fair attracted 88,000 attendees last year , a record 10 percent growth over a year before .
The digital-only edition recorded over 250,000 visitings this year as it was free of charge , data from the art fair shows .
Among the artworks exhibited on the first VIP day this year , a US$2 .
million painting by Marlene Dumas at David Zwirner Gallery was sold .
But half of the 30 galleries did not book sales that day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares with a first-day average VIP sales volume of five artworks and a total sales value of over US$30 million last year .
" While nothing can replace the experience of seeing art in person , we hope that this initiative can bring some support and visibility to all the galleries and their artists affected by the cancelation of our March show , " said Adeline Ooi , Asia director of Art Basel .
Most of the other big events are expected to face a similar outcome , says Adrian Zuercher , head of Asia Pacific asset allocation at the chief investment office of UBS Global Wealth Management .
He notes that the art market was not too much impacted during the first two months this year , as major markets outside China had hardly talked about the virus and operated as normal , but the pandemic started to take a global toll beginning this month .
The art market may remain partially shut down over the next one or two months , he forecasts , but there may be a significant pickup from the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recovery term of the macroeconomy after the virus situation stabilizes .
Although some people may hold back with some of their spendings , collectors ' interest has not changed and they are looking at online markets , waiting a little bit longer for their next purchases , he says .
" A lot of millennials started to shift their focus and bought art already online , and that probably will grow , " he adds .
The UBS Investor Watch and Arts Economics HNW Survey , which interviewed 1,300 high net worth collectors , shows that nearly half of the respondents used online platforms to purchase art either often , or always , and 36 percent of them have spent over US$50,000 for individual work .
Particularly , millennial collectors , who spent six times more than baby boomers and led art market sales last year , were the most regular users of the online channel , with only 8 percent having never bought online , according to the report .
Zuercher points out that this may even be a more sustainable impact from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few years as well .
" But , on the other hand , I also do n't think that art fairs will go away because art is also a social event and social happening .
So you probably need both channels .
"  Meanwhile , it makes artworks even more interesting for some investors in a zero interest rate world , Zuercher says .
With less opportunity to generate interests , people will buy financial assets of course , but they may be considering artworks as a store of wealth , he says .
In terms of the Hong Kong market , the HNW survey shows millennials made up 40 percent of collectors in the city , while auctions are their most preferred sales channel , followed by art fairs and dealers .
Zuercher notes that despite impacts from the political disruption last year and the technical recession , the art market tends to be less sensitive to domestic problems .
" People are not changing their habits or interest in art investment because of that , " he adds .
