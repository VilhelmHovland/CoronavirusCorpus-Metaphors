( ICIR )  UNICEF in a statement in Birnin Kebbi by its Communication , Advocacy and Partnership Specialist , Malam Rabiu Musa , said that malnutrition , air pollution and lack of access to vaccines and antibiotics were among the drivers of preventable deaths from pneumonia , which killed a child every three minutes in the country .
" Pneumonia is caused by bacteria , viruses or fungi , and leaves children fighting for breath as their lungs fill with pus and fluid .
" The disease is the leading killer of children in Nigeria , causing 19 percent of under-five deaths , which can be prevented with vaccines , and easily treated with low-cost antibiotics .

The organisation described the expected two million deaths as " disturbing " , being the highest trend over any country in the world and representing more than 20 per cent of childhood deaths from pneumonia globally .
According to UNICEF , boosting efforts to fight pneumonia could avert over two million child deaths from pneumonia and other major diseases in Nigeria .
" An estimated 809,000 of these deaths would be averted by significantly scaling up services to prevent and treat pneumonia .
" Researchers also found that boosting pneumonia services will create an additional ' ripple effect ' , preventing 1 .
million extra child deaths from other major childhood diseases at the same time .
" Interventions like improving nutrition , increasing vaccine coverage or boosting breastfeeding rates are key measures that reduce the risk of children dying from pneumonia .
