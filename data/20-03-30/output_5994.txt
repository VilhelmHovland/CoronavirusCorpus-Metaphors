FOCUS : RBI goes to FX offshore to keep rupee safe at home  Friday , Mar 27  By Mimansa Verma  MUMBAI -- Even as the economic repercussions of the coronavirus contagion has rattled currency markets across the globe , the Indian rupee 's decline to a record low this month was mostly triggered by speculative bets in unregulated offshore markets .
Today , the Reserve Bank of India called time on the opaque offshore non-deliverable forwards market and allowed domestic Indian banks to participate .
This was unimaginable just a few years ago when the stock answer from RBI on being asked about offshore foreign exchange markets was that they did not exist .
But , RBI has been gradually opening up its mind to the fact that this market is growing in prominence from impacting pre-opening levels , to opening trades to eventually admitting that its size is now much bigger than the domestic market .
There have been various steps taken by the RBI to get some of these flows into the onshore market but the speculators preferred the opacity of the offshore market .
That is until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market seriously and make its presence felt .
As the trades over the past few weeks have shown , it is time the RBI took Thorat committee 's view seriously and made a serious effort to tame this opaque market .
In the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies , released along with the bi-monthly monetary policy statement today , the RBI allowed banks , which operate International Financial Services Centre Banking Units , or IFSC banking units , to participate in the offshore non-deliverable rupee derivative market , with effect from Jun 1 .
The statement first noted the rapid growth of the NDF markets in recent times , and also that Indian banks are not yet permitted to trade there , although " the benefits of their participation in the NDF market have been widely recognised " .
the time is apposite to remove segmentation between the onshore and offshore markets and improve efficiency of price discovery , " RBI said .
It is important to note that this is a reform and developmental measure , which was the only such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory relaxations announced today , indicating that the RBI thought it crucial to move ahead on this issue , despite the market prioritising its relief measures .
On Monday , a day before the rupee fell to its record low of 76 .
a dollar , the rupee in the non-deliverable forwards market had weakened to 77 .
a dollar level .
At a time when trade volumes in currency market have dried up due to lower attendance by traders in banks ' dealing rooms , the depreciation in the rupee has been sharper than it would have been otherwise .
The rupee has lost 3 .
against the greenback this month so far , and 5 .
in the offshore market at the same time , a faster pace of depreciation in the non-deliverable forwards market .
The linkage between the dollar/rupee exchange rate in both the markets is so strong that the rupee has derived opening cues from the rates in the offshore market on multiple occasions , especially when market players have found themselves out of clear signals from global markets amid global uncertainties .
Time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the offshore market has led to clear-cut trading opportunity , thereby aggravating trades onshore .
Given the less stringent documentation , and easier access to the dollar/rupee market in offshore market , foreign players tend to hedge their currency exposure without an underlying asset on their books .
Needless to say , trades in the offshore market are more lucrative .
" Rupee is a currency which is traded everywhere .
It may not be completely convertible currency , but it is a reasonably international currency .
So there is a market , not necessarily only for speculation .
There is a lot of hedging activity that takes place in the NDF market .
" Ashish Parthasarthy , head of treasury at HDFC Bank , said .
" There are differences in the prices of two markets .
To that extent , there will be an arbitrage and then arbitrage flows will also impact the value of the rupee .
The moment , you allow everybody to participate in both markets , at least arbitrage flows could slowly dry out , " Parthasarthy added .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also enable a better price discovery for customers offshore , market players believe .
Another important takeaway from this move is that the RBI now gets a route to intervene in the dollar/rupee offshore market as well , and curb undue volatility in the exchange rate as they have been reiterating about their intervention strategy in the currency market .
On Mar 12 , Cogencis exclusively reported that RBI is prepared to enter the non-deliverable forwards market , and there has been some speculation that central bank intervened in the NDF markets through Bank of International Settlements .
The central bank has been on its toes throughout the month , cushioning sharp losses in the rupee through its interventions in the spot as well as derivatives market .
In March , the RBI sold $17 .
bln , reducing its arsenal of foreign exchange reserves to $469 .
bln that they have been stocking up since late September .
Market players believe it is easier for the central bank to intervene in the non-deliverable forwards market to prevent rupee 's steep fall .
An intervention in the offshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onshore market , given that a non-deliverable forward is settled by the difference on the notional amount between the agreed-upon rate and the prevailing spot rate at the time of settlement .
" It opens up a channel for the RBI to start intervening in the NDF through domestic banks .
From both perspectives , price discovery becomes much better for the rupee and more anchored to fundamentals than before , " B .
Prasanna , group head of global markets at ICICI Bank said .
" There will , of course , be a natural move towards onshore-offshore convergence , though balance sheet considerations etc .
could keep it limited and not many banks would keep a lot of onshore-offshore split hedges .
"  This measure may not rule headlines tomorrow as the focus will be on the steps taken by the RBI to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic fallout .
But , over the next few months , the presence of Indian banks in these offshore markets , and the silent hand of the RBI through some of these banks , will start playing in a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behave .
RBI may have slipped this measure in , among many other steps , but it is a reform whose time may well have come .
