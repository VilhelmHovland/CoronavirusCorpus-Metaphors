De Blasio told NY1 that these three levels of government would create " thousands " of non-ICU hospitals rooms by , " in some cases , leasing entire hotels " that are " ideally " near existing hospitals .
" We can take a hotel floor plan -- I talked this through right here at City Hall with the Army Corps of Engineers leadership on Friday night -- and they showed me the floor plans of how you turn a hotel into an instant hospital , " de Blasio said .
" You create a nurse 's station around where the elevators are .
I mean they have really simple things they do to flip a switch basically and turn a hotel into a hospital .
And we 're going to be doing that to the tune of thousands and thousands of rooms .
"  The mayor did not say how much the plan will cost or when it would be completed .
