COVID-19 : People 's attitude determine duration of MCO  KUALA LUMPUR ( March 30 ) : The rate of public compliance to the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) is now at 97 per cent , not the full percentage that the government wants to achieve to break the chain of COVID-19 infections .
There are still people who insist on hanging out in coffee shops and other public places , even violating the traffic rules imposed during the MCO .
The most common reason given is that they are going out to buy food .
But is it really necessary to go out four times a day to forage for food ?  Tomorrow is the 14th day the MCO has been imposed , and there are two more weeks for Malaysians to improve their compliance rate .
And the way for them to do this is by disciplining themselves to ' stay at home ' , and venturing out only when it is absolutely necessary .
Tomorrow too , the MCO is expected to go into the second stage , with sterner action taken against those who violate it , and hopefully it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Senior Minister ( Security Cluster ) Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob recently .

Besides the MCO , this is a serious effort by the government to eradicate COVID-19 , where as of noon yesterday , 150 new cases were recorded , bringing the total number of positive cases in the country to 2,470 , with 34 deaths .
The disinfecting process has already been carried out by various state governments , with focus on high-risk areas .
Among the first ones to conduct the operations was Kuala Lumpur City Hall which launched a massive exercise in the city last Saturday , starting with Seri Petaling which was a red zone area .
