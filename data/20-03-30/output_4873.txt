Leaving The House In NSW Without An Excuse Could Land You A Six-Month Prison Term  SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY  Thanks for signing up !  Bloody hell .
Anyone in NSW who roams around outside " without reasonable excuse " could find themselves on the pointy end of a six-month prison sentence , an $11,000 fine , or both , thanks to a strict new directive intended to stop people mingling amid the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak .
Notably , it looks like heading to your partner 's place is temporarily off the cards .
The Order " directs that a person must not , without reasonable excuse , leave the person 's place of residence , " adding that " A person must not participate in a gathering in a public place of more than 2 persons .
"  There are a few exceptions .
You can get groceries and household supplies .
You can travel to your place of employment or education , if you ca n't feasibly work or study from home .
You can pick your kids up from school or childcare .
You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carry out legal obligations , move house , and even donate blood .
You can exercise outside , as long as you 're with no more than one other person or members of your household , exclusively .
It 's fine to attend public services like Centrelink , domestic violence support services , and mental health services .
Plus , you can attend weddings and funerals -- if they fit the previously established five- and ten-attendee limits , that is .
Family members who live between households wo n't be kept apart , either : there are " continuing existing arrangements for access to , and contact between , parents and children or siblings .
"  If you 're a " priest , minister of religion or member of a religious order , " you can travel to and from your place of worship and provide pastoral assistance to another person .
Still , all public gatherings that are not " essential for work or education " are banned , and hopping in the car after a 2am ' U up ? ' message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside .
Whether this leads to an uptick in sneaky supermarket or blood donation " dates " is yet to be seen .
In addition to the aforementioned penalties , repeat offenders can be fined $5500 for each day offending continues .
It 's even harsher for companies , as " Corporations that fail to comply with a direction are liable to a fine of $55,000 and $27,500 each day the offence continues .
"  It 's a major development , and a sign of the how NSW Police Commissioner Michael Fuller , who is now leading the state 's non-medical response to the crisis , intends to clamp down on the outbreak .
I just signed new restrictions on leaving residences .
Public Health ( Covid19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement ) Order 2020 .
Message- STAY HOME unless you need to go out for essential reasons such as work , study , obtaining food , medical supplies etc ? @NSWHealth ? **26;1335;TOOLONG .
