Helping to staff the community COVID-189 testing sites and assisting general practices to set up and manage virtual patient consulting are two focus areas for Health Hawke 's Bay , the region 's Primary Health Organisation .
More than a third of the organisation 's staff , including eight registered nurses and about the same number of support staff , had stepped away from their everyday work and into the clinical setting to man some of the community-based assessment centres ( CBACs ) .
" We need to support our general practice staff , who are managing the sites on a roster system , as much as we can , " said Health Hawke 's Bay chief executive Wayne Woolrich .
It is also essential that general practices are assisted to set up and manage the technology that allows doctors to carry out patient consultations on-line , said Mr Woolrich .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ministry of Health are recommending that where possible this method of patient consultation is preferred if the consultation does not require a physical examination .
Mr Woolrich said his team was working hard to support frontline primary care teams working long hours in general practices and pharmacies while also being rostered on at the CBACs .
" Primary care workers were already very busy before the COVID-19 crisis came along and now they 're coping with increased demand and having to change the way they work , by moving to virtual consultations , in a matter of days .
"  The Health Hawke 's Bay team is providing the specialised software and support that enables virtual consultations , and linking general practices with on-line forums and information that will help them adjust to the platform .
Subhead : Virtual consultations -- what it means for patients  " Our local family general practices continue to be available to provide care for you , " says Hastings Health Centre GP and Health Hawke 's Bay medical director Dr Louise Haywood .
" What we really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor .
If you wait for three weeks to contact us about something relatively simple , it may not be simple by then .
"  At a practical level , the way to contact your doctor has not changed .
" Contact your doctor for an appointment as you normally would , " says Dr Haywood .
" You will be phoned by a doctor or nurse from your general practice , at which time a decision can be made on whether you need to go into the  surgery and if so , when ; or whether your issue can be handled by a phone conversation or via an internet consultation .
"  The system is designed to help with physical distancing during this time of COVID-19 , so that no more people than necessary are in a doctor 's surgery .
" This is technology that some general practices were already using , for things like talking to their rural patients .
So it is not new and we are very happy that it works well and all of the privacy and security protocols are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Employment experts predict boredom to come After the initial panic , New Zealand businesses have done what they do best ; adapted their offerings in the face of the life-changing Covid-19 outbreak .

Employment experts predict boredom to come  After the initial panic , New Zealand businesses have done what they do best ; adapted their offerings in the face of the life-changing Covid-19 outbreak .
But what will follow ?  Boredom , says two of New Zealand 's employment trend experts .
Jane Kennelly , Frog Recruitment Business Director predicts the three stages of adaptability will become apparent ( or will reveal themselves ) as the world navigates the most significant economic disruption it has seen in almost a century .
" For now , it 's about adapting .
Kiwi businesses are nimble and have responded creatively to the situation , " says Kennelly .
" Businesses have had to , and are , making some tough calls .
They are reshaping teams and adapting their workforce to match the current market .
One of our employers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temporary backup team to manage the volume of orders -- all within 24 hours .
Another , an IT business , has merged all their employees to form a ' monster IT help team ' to support Kiwis across the country .
"  Kennelly revealed that in the last week , Frog Recruitment 's communications with more than 2500 businesses nationally including government agencies showed that this first phase , or ' the hit ' , has seen many Kiwi businesses doing well , pointing clearly to the strength of their ' number 8 wire ' ingenuity .
" Millions of New Zealanders mobilised their home offices , education providers moved to online learning , and bricks and mortar businesses amped up their e-commerce offering .
"  Jane Davis , Director of The Flourishing Institute leads New Zealand businesses through workplace wellbeing programmes .
She agrees with Kennelly but says the second phase in the Covid-19 cycle may be complacency .
" As New Zealanders get used to being in their bubbles , boredom will be the issue that needs combatting .
A few industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- these are likely to be entertainment providers , streaming organisations , app development companies , online training and online services .
" Plugging people into programmes to keep them focussed on positive mental health is key in this phase with topics such as managing distractions , thriving through change and building healthy thinking patterns ideal for employees in their home bubble , " says Davis .
According to both Kennelly and Davis , the good news is that if business did n't have enough time to plan for the swift arrival of phase one -- they have time to act quickly for the second one .
" Digital transformation , already a trending pre-Covid-19 topic , is set to become a pillar to reinvent business models .
From gyms and dance studios going to online classes , to medical supply firms exploiting augmented reality to create new training programmes , to landscape design businesses offering video walk-through consultations when the landscaper ca n't be there in person .
"  When the third and last phase happens , a slow ' return to normal ' will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the extent that previously considered perks , such as working from home , flexible hours and four day working weeks , become the ' new normal ' .
" Kiwis have been given an opportunity to test and enjoy the advantages of working from home , remote working systems and flexible hours , " says Kennelly .
" Making the right moves now could evolve organisational models , increase productivity , add a competitive advantage to employers and allow business to come out of this extraordinary time as stronger , hardier , more productive and innovative .
