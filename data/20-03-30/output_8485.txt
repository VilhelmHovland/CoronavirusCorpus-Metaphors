According to the death map that is far from the truth .
Instead of me proving my point just clink on that link in the OP .
Two counties that abut each other have 165 deaths out of the 195 reported , as of two days ago .
Imo , it looks to me Wash .
had it pretty mild considering their 7 .
population .
I do n't want to point out that the king has no clothes , but the death curve on that website is not flattening at all .
I hope the interpretations are correct for the other info ( fewer positives and total cases ) but that could just be pending positive or not reported yet .
Agreed but the high number of deaths are still in those two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was making - the media had us believing the whole state was being devastated with deaths .
They 're not .

It 's obvious the democrats and media have n't seen anything about this virus that truly scares them .
It 's human nature for someone who has been shaken by something to have a change in demeanor and I do n't see that at all from them , it 's been the same partisan politics as usual .
I think they know this virus is not the danger it 's been hyped to be and are simply trying to take advantage of it as much as they can .
I ca n't prove that but it 's obvious there is some chicanery going on .
A Chorale of 121 folks ; sixty got together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty days later of the sixty , forty five were sick with corona like symptoms .
Of the 28 tested for Corona , ALL were positive , the others did n't get tested because they did n't feel it necessary or could n't get tests .
Of the 28 , eleven were hospitalized , and two of the more elderly ( 80 somethings ) died of the virus .
One presumed superspreader did that .
And nobody noticed anyone coughing or sneezing or even feeling a bit bad .
