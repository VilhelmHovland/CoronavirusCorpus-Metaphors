Financial markets and the rand could be volatile as the news of a ratings downgrade is absorbed .
The decision by Moody 's could not have come at a worse time , is the warning from Finance Minister Tito Mboweni .
South Africa , like many other countries , is seized with containing the outbreak of the coronavirus .
The sovereign downgrade will further add to the prevailing financial market stress and the government bond market is set to experience further capital outflows as fund managers with investment grade mandates will be forced to sell South African government bonds , says Bloomberg .
The interest rate for government , households and the broader economy is also expected to increase as a result , says the news service .
While some market participants argue that the impact of a sovereign downgrade has already been priced in , it is difficult to stipulate with certainty the extent , it notes .

The continent has never experienced a crisis of the scale and magnitude caused by the coronavirus pandemic , Songwe said .
While its impact is likely to be felt for 12 to 18 months -- with a loss of lives , jobs and businesses as economies grind to a halt -- the potential loss of health care providers and schooling would also weigh on the continent 's health and education sectors for years to come , she said .
Sasol is producing alcohols for hand sanitisers and disinfectants , and prioritising local supply to help contain the Covid-19 pandemic , reports Bloomberg .
