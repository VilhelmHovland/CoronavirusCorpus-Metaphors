LAFAYETTE -- The majority of students in Tippecanoe County have been on an extended spring break for the past two weeks , as teachers and administrators scramble to transition from a traditional classroom format to something completely new -- e-learning .
As all K-12 schools across the state will be closed through May 1 to help curb the spread of coronavirus , labeled COVID-19 , the three public school districts in Tippecanoe County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Lafayette Community School Corp .
-- are beginning this week to instruct thousands of students from inside their homes .
LSC will begin e-learning Tuesday , with TSC and West Lafayette beginning Wednesday .
At Wea Ridge Middle School , part of TSC , teachers are using different methods and programs to make sure students grasp the material even through the difficult circumstances .
Josh Cox , a sixth-grade math teacher , said he is using screencast programs to record himself , either through videos or just voice recordings , to teach his students new math .
He will walk through lecture notes , using a tablet pen to write and draw , solving equations and making diagrams as he normally would .
For students in his classroom who may be without internet , he is trying to make sure those children do n't fall far behind by creating learning packets that parents can pick up from the school 's office during designated times throughout the week .
But Cox recognizes it is n't the same for children that have internet access at home .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself the slogan " win the day .
"  " At the end of the day , you have to ask yourself : Did I win the day ? " Cox said .
" This obviously is n't the easiest style or method of learning , but we have to make the best of it .

High School , said she felt lucky that one of the major units in her class , which required student-led group projects , was over before spring break started .
Now , to continue to teach her students , she and other West Side teachers are utilizing Google Hangouts or Zoom to lead lessons .
" I 've always been on the dinosaur side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my caddy , " Forbes said .
However , she said she is determined to not let the new circumstances be a setback and lead her students best as she can to end the year on a strong note .
" If we have to use technology and transition to e-learning , that 's what we 'll do , " Forbes said .
" Teachers and students are in this together .
"  Other schools are working on a way for students to keep up their school spirit , even while they remain home and go to school in their pajamas .
Sunnyside Intermediate School is holding a " virtual spirit week " beginning Tuesday , when the students begin e-learning , with different themes and activities each day of the week .
For example , Tuesday 's theme is " Sock-It to COVID-19 , " where students ( and their families ) are encouraged to wear silly or mismatched socks and share pictures on social media with the hashtag #sunnyspirit .
" I do n't think anyone took a spring break , " Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talking and mulling for a while .
E-learning starts tomorrow , but people have been working on this ever since we thought it was a possibility .
"  Beck , who teaches multiple levels of physics , said one of the most difficult parts of working and teaching from home would be not seeing the kids in her classroom every day , watching how they respond to new lessons and concepts and being able to help them right away if they were stuck or having problems .
To create as much " normalcy " as possible , Beck is creating videos and demonstrations of her note taking to illustrate the material to her students .
" I ca n't wait to see how the kids respond to those , " Beck said .
" There 's my washing machine going in the background , the phone going off , the doorbell ringing .
but I hope me working through the tough problems will be helpful when I 'm going over a tough concept .
"  For students who may not have reliable internet access or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Jeff teachers like Melissa Colonis , have been working on alternative ways to accept student work .

Jeff is also setting up a time for students to go to the school to pick up any physical materials they may need , by setting up a time with the school over the phone or through email .
The transition to e-learning hopefully wo n't be too disruptive for Colonis ' students , as they had moved to a " flipped classroom " at the start of the year , meaning students learn new material at home and work on homework during scheduled class time .
Through that method , her students ' test scores have improved , Colonis said .
To make up for the in-person class time , Colonis is setting up opportunities for one-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask questions or go over problems they do n't understand .
" Having that face-to-face check in time is what they might need , to have that familiarity , " Colonis said .
" This is a scary time for all of us .
I miss their smiling faces and always care about their emotional well-being .
