Larry Brilliant says he does n't have a crystal ball .
But 14 years ago , Brilliant , the epidemiologist who helped eradicate smallpox , spoke to a TED audience and described what the next pandemic would look like .
At the time , it sounded almost too horrible to take seriously .
" A billion people would get sick , " he said .
" As many as 165 million people would die .
There would be a global recession and depression , and the cost to our economy of $1 to $3 trillion would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying , because so many more people would lose their jobs and their health care benefits , that the consequences are almost unthinkable .
"  Now the unthinkable is here , and Brilliant , the Chairman of the board of Ending Pandemics , is sharing expertise with those on the front lines .
We are a long way from 100 million deaths due to the novel coronavirus , but it has turned our world upside down .
Brilliant is trying not to say " I told you so " too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in talks and writings , but as the senior technical advisor for the pandemic horror film Contagion , now a top streaming selection for the homebound .
Besides working with the World Health Organization in the effort to end smallpox , Brilliant , who is now 75 , has fought flu , polio , and blindness ; once led Google 's nonprofit wing , Google .
; co-founded the conferencing system the Well ; and has traveled with the Grateful Dead .
We talked by phone on Tuesday .
At the time , President Donald Trump 's response to the crisis had started to change from " no worries at all " to finally taking more significant steps to stem the pandemic .
Brilliant lives in one of the six Bay Area counties where residents were ordered to shelter in place .
When we began the conversation , he 'd just gotten off the phone with someone he described as high government official , who asked Brilliant " How the fuck did we get here ? " I wanted to hear how we 'll get out of here .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I was in the room in 2006 when you gave that TED talk .
Your wish was " Help Me Stop Pandemics .
" You did n't get your wish , did you ?  Larry Brilliant : No , I did n't get that wish at all , although the systems that I asked for have certainly been created and are being used .
It 's very funny because we did a movie , Contagion --  We 're all watching that movie now .
People say Contagion is prescient .
We just saw the science .
The whole epidemiological community has been warning everybody for the past 10 or 15 years that it was n't a question of whether we were going to have a pandemic like this .
It was simply when .
It 's really hard to get people to listen .
I mean , Trump pushed out the admiral on the National Security Council , who was the only person at that level who 's responsible for pandemic defense .
With him went his entire downline of employees and staff and relationships .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the world .
I 've heard you talk about the significance that this is a " novel " virus .
It does n't mean a fictitious virus .
It 's not like a novel or a novella .
Too bad .
It means it 's new .
That there is no human being in the world that has immunity as a result of having had it before .
That means it 's capable of infecting 7 .
billion of our brothers and sisters .
Since it 's novel , we 're still learning about it .
Do you believe that if someone gets it and recovers , that person thereafter has immunity ?  So I do n't see anything in this virus , even though it 's novel , that contradicts that .
There are cases where people think that they 've gotten it again , but that 's more likely to be a test failure than it is an actual reinfection .
But there 's going to be tens of millions of us or hundreds of millions of us or more who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with large numbers like that , almost anything where you ask " Does this happen ? " can happen .
That does n't mean that it is of public health or epidemiological importance .
Is this the worst outbreak you 've ever seen ?  It 's the most dangerous pandemic in our lifetime .
We are being asked to do things , certainly , that never happened in my lifetime -- stay in the house , stay 6 feet away from other people , do n't go to group gatherings .
Are we getting the right advice ?  Well , as you reach me , I 'm pretending that I 'm in a meditation retreat , but I 'm actually being semi-quarantined in Marin County .
Yes , this is very good advice .
But did we get good advice from the president of the United States for the first 12 weeks ? No .
All we got were lies .
Saying it 's fake , by saying this is a Democratic hoax .
There are still people today who believe that , to their detriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most irresponsible act of an elected official that I 've ever witnessed in my lifetime .
But what you 're hearing now to self-isolate , close schools , cancel events is right .
Is it going to protect us completely ? Is it going to make the world safe forever ? No .
It 's a great thing because we want to spread out the disease over time .
Flatten the curve .
By slowing it down or flattening it , we 're not going to decrease the total number of cases , we 're going to postpone many cases , until we get a vaccine -- which we will , because there 's nothing in the virology that makes me frightened that we wo n't get a vaccine in 12 to 18 months .
Eventually , we will get to the epidemiologist gold ring .
Advertisement  What 's that ?  That means , A , a large enough quantity of us have caught the disease and become immune .
And B , we have a vaccine .
The combination of A plus B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 or 80 percent .
I hold out hope that we get an antiviral for Covid-19 that is curative , but in addition is prophylactic .
It 's certainly unproven and it 's certainly controversial , and certainly a lot of people are not going to agree with me .
But I offer as evidence two papers in 2005 , one in Nature and one in Science .
They both did mathematical modeling with influenza , to see whether saturation with just Tamiflu of an area around a case of influenza could stop the outbreak .
And in both cases , it worked .
I also offer as evidence the fact that at one point we thought HIV/AIDS was incurable and a death sentence .
Then , some wonderful scientists discovered antiviral drugs , and we 've learned that some of those drugs can be given prior to exposure and prevent the disease .
Because of the intense interest in getting Covid-19 conquered , we will put the scientific clout and money and resources behind finding antivirals that have prophylactic or preventive characteristics that can be used in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the house and go back to work ?  I have a very good retrospect-oscope , but what 's needed right now as a prospecto-scope .
If this were a tennis match , I would say advantage virus right now .
But there 's really good news from South Korea -- they had less than 100 cases today .
China had more cases imported than it had from continuous transmission from Wuhan today .
The Chinese model will be very hard for us to follow .
We 're not going to be locking people up in their apartments , boarding them up .
But the South Korea model is one that we could follow .
Unfortunately , it requires doing the proportionate number of tests that they did -- they did well over a quarter of a million tests .
In fact , by the time South Korea had done 200,000 tests , we had probably done less than 1,000 .
Now that we 've missed the opportunity for early testing , is it too late for testing to make a difference ?  Absolutely not .
Tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stochastic process random probability sample of the country to find out where the hell the virus really is .
Because we do n't know .
Maybe Mississippi is reporting no cases because it 's not looking .
How would they know ? Zimbabwe reports zero cases because they do n't have testing capability , not because they do n't have the virus .
We need something that looks like a home pregnancy test , that you can do at home .
If you were the president for one day , what would you say in the daily briefing ?  I would begin the press conference by saying " Ladies and gentlemen , let me introduce you to Ron Klain -- he was the Ebola czar under President Barack Obama , and now I 've called him back and made him Covid czar .
Everything will be centralized under one person who has the respect of both the public health community and the political community .
" We 're a divided country right now .
Right now , Tony Fauci head of the National Institute of Allergy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Are you scared ?  I 'm in the age group that has a one in seven mortality rate if I get it .
If you 're not worried , you 're not paying attention .
But I 'm not scared .
I firmly believe that the steps that we 're taking will extend the time that it takes for the virus to make the rounds .
I think that , in turn , will increase the likelihood that we will have a vaccine or we will have a prophylactic antiviral in time to cut off , reduce , or truncate the spread .
Everybody needs to remember : This is not a zombie apocalypse .
It 's not a mass extinction event .
Advertisement  Should we be wearing masks ?  The N95 mask itself is extremely wonderful .
The pores in the mask are three microns wide .
The virus is one micron wide .
Editor 's note : The mask pores are 0 .
microns wide ; the virus is 0 .
microns .
So you get people who say , well , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , huge football players who are rushing for lunch through a door at lunchtime -- they 're not going to get through .
In the latest data I saw , the mask provided 5x protection .
That 's really good .
But we have to keep the hospitals going and we have to keep the health professionals able to come to work and be safe .
So masks should go where they 're needed the most : in taking care of patients .
The world is not going to begin to look normal until three things have happened .
One , we figure out whether the distribution of this virus looks like an iceberg , which is one-seventh above the water , or a pyramid , where we see everything .
If we 're only seeing right now one-seventh of the actual disease because we 're not testing enough , and we 're just blind to it , then we 're in a world of hurt .
Two , we have a treatment that works , a vaccine or antiviral .
And three , maybe most important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular nurses , home health care providers , doctors , policemen , firemen , and teachers who have had the disease -- are immune , and we have tested them to know that they are not infectious any longer .
And we have a system that identifies them , either a concert wristband or a card with their photograph and some kind of a stamp on it .
Then we can be comfortable sending our children back to school , because we know the teacher is not infectious .
And instead of saying " No , you ca n't visit anybody in nursing home , " we have a group of people who are certified that they work with elderly and vulnerable people , and nurses who can go back into the hospitals and dentists who can open your mouth and look in your mouth and not be giving you the virus .
When those three things happen , that 's when normalcy will return .
Is there in any way a brighter side to this ?  Well , I 'm a scientist , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever look at something without asking the question of is n't there a higher power that in some way will help us to be the best version of ourselves that we could be ? I thought we would see the equivalent of empty streets in the civic arena , but the amount of civic engagement is greater than I 've ever seen .
But I 'm seeing young kids , millennials , who are volunteering to go take groceries to people who are homebound , elderly .
I 'm seeing an incredible influx of nurses , heroic nurses , who are coming and working many more hours than they worked before , doctors who fearlessly go into the hospital to work .
I 've never seen the kind of volunteerism I 'm seeing .
I do n't want to pretend that this is an exercise worth going through in order to get to that state .
This is a really unprecedented and difficult time that will test us .
When we do get through it , maybe like the Second World War , it will cause us to reexamine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country .
The virus is an equal opportunity infector .
And it 's probably the way we would be better if we saw ourselves that way , which is much more alike than different .
Update 3-24-20 10:45 PM : This story was updated to correct the size of the virus and the width of the pores in an N95 respirator mask .
