-- Gov .
Ron DeSantis announced Monday that he would be signing a " Safer at Home " executive order to ensure that residents in Miami-Dade , Broward , Palm Beach and Monroe counties are " operating under the same sheet of music " during the coronavirus pandemic .
DeSantis initially said he would be urging residents in those southeast Florida counties to stay home -- except for essential reasons -- until the " middle of May .
" But at a later press availability , he clarified that he meant until the middle of April .
The order is set to remain in effect until April 15 .
" We have all four counties united in a common purpose , " DeSantis said at his initial Monday news conference at Hard Rock Stadium attended by mayors of those four counties .
" People in South Florida know it 's not always easy to do .
"  DeSantis also said the state will reconfigure its rules to allow retired law enforcement and health workers to come back to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the outbreak .
He was joined at the Hard Rock Stadium news conference by Lt .
Jeanette Nu ? ez , Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez , Broward County Mayor Dale Holness , Palm Beach County Mayor David Kerner and Monroe County Mayor Heather Carruthers .
Gimenez said he felt there was no need for a state-wide curfew , but he said cities and municipalities within the county can enforce curfews if they choose to .
Gimenez said Miami-Dade County streets have been quiet and he did not want to burden law enforcement officers when they have enough on their plate at this time .
Bal Harbour and a dozen coastal communities , regular destinations for New Yorkers and other hot-spot states , are now mandating a two-week quarantine for any of those visitors , with reporting tools and criminal penalties layered on .
Hard Rock Stadium testing update  The Florida National Guard has set up a COVID-19 testing site in the parking lot of Hard Rock Stadium , which first opened to first responders on March 22 .
The location opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 tests have been administered at the site .
DeSantis ' news conference Monday was at that testing site , where a mistake had forced some people to be retested for COVID-19 .
" There were some tests that were done in a bacterial culture medium that should have been done in a viral cultural medium when this site opened up early on .
Everybody has received a call and many people have already come back and completed the retesting , " public information officer Mike Jachles said .
Some of those tests were rejected by the processing labs since COVID-19 is a viral disease .
We 're told there were more tests that came back inconclusive .
It 's unclear how many people were affected , but all patients should have been notified .
The testing kits were administered at this one site only on Sunday , Monday , and half of Tuesday before the problem was detected .
The Florida National Guard apparently received and used the wrong types of kits that were shipped in .
" We are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jachles said .
Despite that hiccup , things have moved rather smoothly since then at the testing site .
About 339 people were tested Sunday .
