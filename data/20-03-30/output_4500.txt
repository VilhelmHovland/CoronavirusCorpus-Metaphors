DE BEERS has cancelled its third sight for the 2020 financial year owing to travel restrictions placed on buyers as a result of COVID-19 .

It would " .
continue to seek innovative ways to meet sightholders ' rough diamond supply needs in the coming weeks , " it said .
The travel restrictions are " .
on the movement of people and product in Botswana , South Africa and India , which prohibit customers from traveling and prevent the shipment of goods to customers ' international operations , " Anglo said .
Cancelling the third sight for this year is hardly a surprise given the way governments have ratcheted up their efforts to contain the spread of the virus in the last week , including a decision by the South African government to embark on a 21-day near total shutdown from March 27 .

Early evidence that 2020 diamond sales were off to a poor start owing to travel interruptions was provided by GEM Diamonds which said on March 19 that it had replaced a tender for its large diamonds with a " flexible direct sale process " in mitigation of travel bans on buyers .
Last week Petra Diamonds brought forward the closure of its fifth sales tenders in South Africa and Antwerp three days earlier than the planned March 26 .
It also found " depressed and opportunistic " bidding for its goods , particularly in the larger size and higher quality , greater categories .

It said in a statement today that the emerald ( high quality ) and ruby ( mixed quality ) auctions originally scheduled for May and June 2020 respectively were " .
