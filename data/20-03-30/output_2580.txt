The JV Agreements will govern the building and operation of the first five facilities to be placed on production following the Aldersyde Facility in the agreed territories in Alberta and Nova Scotia ( " JV Facilities " ) .
Over the past nine months , CIELO has been implementing enhancements to the Aldersyde Facility .
These enhancements have resulted in plans to scale-up production of the JV Facilities to convert 8 tonnes of waste feedstock an hour into 4,000 liters per hour of renewable fuels , which is double the original plan .
The JV Facilities are intended to be engineered to operate 24 hours a day , 341 days per year .
Each one of the JV Facilities are currently projected to cost approximately CDN$50 Million to build , commission and place on production , which will be fully funded by the respective JV Companies .
Raphael Bohlmann , President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 virus has slowed us down from finalizing our JV agreements with CIELO , we are confident that we will have them in place prior to June 30 , 2020 .
In the meantime , during these trying times , we have made significant progress in advancing our JV initiatives with CIELO , as evidenced by our joint announcement of the pending purchase of 80 acres of land near Medicine Hat , Alberta .
Based on the recent design and process changes that CIELO has made over the past 9 months to their Aldersyde Facility , we fully support and embrace the guidance from CIELO 's management for us to secure four times the amount of land in each territory than originally contemplated .
This strategy will allow CIELO , when the time is right , to quickly scale-up each one of our JV Facilities , to convert up to 80 tonnes an hour of waste ( 654,720 tonnes/year ) - 24/7 - 341 days a year into about 40,000 liters/hour or 3 .
Million liters/year of high grade-renewable fuels .
Today 's low price for fuel at the pumps makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however CIELO 's fuels command a premium price per liter .
As a result of this we predict excellent margins as CIELO 's waste feedstock has a very low input cost .
We also believe that the current regulated mandated demand in Canada of over 650 Million liters a year of biodiesel and renewable diesel that has to be blended into conventional transportation diesel will be increased by both federal and provincial regulators .
The JV Facilities that we are working towards building with CIELO will help to reduce how much waste goes into landfills which are renowned as being one of the largest generators of Green House Gas ( " GHG " ) emissions .
" Bohlmann further commented " We are currently scouting out locations for the JV Facilities to be permitted and built in Grande Prairie , Lethbridge and Nova Scotia .
Based on there being virtually an unlimited amount of feedstock to support building these JV Facilities , we have never been more excited about what the future holds for our involvement with CIELO .
"  Don Allan , President &amp; CEO of CIELO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple different waste feedstocks into high-grade renewable fuels , a portion of which we have sold to an arms-length end-user .
The proceeds from this Offering will allow us to increase our production numbers on a continuous-flow basis and start generating monthly revenues .
This will in turn accelerate moving forward with building and commissioning the five JV Facilities .
