The spread of COVID-19 in the U .
is accelerating and mortality is increasing exponentially , putting the U .
on a potentially worse trajectory than Italy , according to an analysis by Morgan Stanley .
Biotechnology analyst Matthew Harrison said he expects President Donald Trump will have to extend the social distancing timeline again , past April 30 .
His new forecast for the U .
calls for a peak of approximately 570,000 cases in about 20 days .
That 's roughly triple the prior forecast of about 200,000 cases at the peak .
Read MarketWatch 's coronavirus update .
His worry is that while the first wave of infection growth could start slowing in late April , the U .
will be hit with a " second wave " of growth , emanating from the central regions .
" Importantly , this new forecast continues to assume more social distancing and a continued rapid increase in testing , " Harrison wrote in a note to clients .
" We would highlight that the biggest risk to this forecast is that while we have reasonable confidence the East and West coasts will reach peak cases in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibiting signs of new outbreaks .
"  He said there is also risk that the second wave delays the U .
peak , or causes " recontamination " of the coastal cities .
" Current U .
trends are concerning , suggesting a course potentially worse than Italy , " Harrison wrote in a note to clients .
" We highlight five dynamics to watch which we believe suggest the U .
is facing a broad and accelerating outbreak .
"  1 ) U .
cases are growing the fastest  " The U .
now has the largest number of cases among all countries , while the growth rate of U .
cases is now the highest among all countries we follow .
and is accelerating faster than Italy when adjusted for the start of the respective outbreaks .
"  2 ) U .
mortality is not slowing despite social distancing  " Mortality is increasing at an exponential rate in the U .
at a slightly lower slope than Italy prior to its lockdown .
While mortality will lag new cases , other countries have been able to slow from exponential growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than testing capacity  " Rates of testing positivity continue to trend higher across the U .
as testing rates lag other countries and cases are growing faster than tests , suggesting the U .
continues to lack enough testing capacity .
"  4 ) New ' hot spots ' are exhibiting growth above other regions  " Case rates for emerging U .
' hot spots ' are growing at rates faster than all countries or U .
states .
This suggests new U .
cases could continue to accelerate .
"  The new hot spots include Louisiana , Michigan and Illinois , as well as New York and Florida .
5 ) Social-distancing measures remain not as strict as other countries  " The U .
has more limited quarantine measures compared to Italy or China .
"  Italy is exhibiting stabilization , and is now likely to reach a peak about 15 days after China .
That represents a time to peak that is 2-times that of China and 3-times that of South Korea .
" With the U .
potentially trending worse than Italy , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly worse than Italy .
"  Data suggests faster spreading in the U .
, with the " reproduction number " of the U .
at 2 .
higher than Italy at 1 .
, while the doubling time of cases in the U .
of about 3 .
days is lower than Italy 's at 10 days , " pointing to a significantly faster elevation of case numbers in the U .
than Italy .
