DETROIT -- Grieving families plead with hospital staff to see the bodies of loved ones , to hold their hands , and say goodbye .
They can not .
The bodies -- still shedding the coronavirus -- are so dangerous that they are double-bagged .
The bags are wiped down with a bleach solution .
Even autopsies are suspended , said Dr .
Teena Chopra , a professor of infectious diseases at Wayne State University who is also in charge of infection control for the Detroit Medical Center 's eight hospitals .
Across metro Detroit , the epicenter of the coronavirus in Michigan , the pandemic has entered a new and terrifying phase .
On Monday , Detroit 's infection rate and death toll skyrocketed with 259 newly confirmed cases , pushing the city 's total past 1,800 , with 52 deaths .
Across the three metro counties of Wayne , Oakland and Macomb , there are more than 5,200 cases and 158 deaths .

Detroit area hospitals are nearing capacity as more Michigan residents are sickened with COVID-19 , forcing state and federal officials to identify new locations to launch temporary field hospitals that can absorb the overflow .
Preparing for the worst  A virus first detected in Michigan just three week ago is now spreading on an exponential curve .
Confirmed cases have nearly quadrupled in the past week to 6,498 , with 184 deaths .
But Detroit and its suburbs are bearing the brunt .
Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , warned Monday that the virus in Detroit could be about to " take off .

There are warnings that there are n't enough medical personnel to care for patients who will be admitted in the coming weeks .
There is n't enough protective equipment to keep hospital workers safe .
And there are n't enough ventilators to support the people who are going to need them .
Michigan is " living day to day " in a quest for additional resources , Whitmer told CNN Monday morning , one in a slew of broadcast interviews the governor is giving .
Michigan has 1,700 ventilators but officials said it may need another 5,000 to 10,000 .
The state has roughly 313,000 specialized N95 masks with another 1 million potentially on the way after spending $80 million on medical supplies to supplement shipments from the Strategic National Stockpile .
Still , hospitals are rationing masks and some workers hoard used ones in their lockers because they expect supplies to run out .

Even with this help , Khaldun , the state 's top doctor , said there is " no question " that Michigan does not have enough working medical personnel to meet the growing patient load .
Whitmer signed an executive order on Sunday loosening medical practice laws and begged medical students , retired physicians and others to enlist for duty .
' It 's like a war zone '  Beaumont Health , the state 's largest health system , was caring for at least 870 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections by Monday afternoon .
Another 211 patients in the hospitals were awaiting test results .

The mayor added that he believed many will soon return to duty after being tested .
Duggan announced large-scale efforts to protect police , firefighters and first responders from the virus and prevent wide-spread quarantines from causing staffing shortages .
In the next two days , the city will attempt to test hundreds of them , as well as city bus drivers , for the coronavirus at the site of the former State Fairgrounds .
Detroit also will soon be among a few cities granted access to five testing machines and 5,000 fast-testing kits from Abbott Laboratories , which just got FDA approval for tests that can provide results in 15 minutes , Duggan said .
" This is a game-changer .
" Duggan said , in helping the city finally begin to get a step ahead of the outbreak .

This is , after all , a city still recovering from the Great Recession and the city 's painful municipal bankruptcy in 2013 .
" It 's a scary moment in the history of our city , " said Keith Williams , chair of Michigan Democratic Black Caucus and a longtime Detroit-area political leader .
" It has taken over the imagination and the infrastructure of our community , and nobody was prepared for it .
"  Duggan sounded some hopeful notes .
Some new supplies were coming in , the field hospital was being constructed and , thanks to the state 's stay-at-home order , crime had gone down roughly 40 percent in the past week , he said .
Medical workers were also looking for positives among the grim numbers .
