The Beehive sold us its $12b infrastructure spend earlier this year , saying we 've never been able to borrow money at such competitive rates , at around 1 per cent interest over 10 years .
Well they 've now more than doubled that and of course there 's one big winner in all of this : the banks and big international corporates who want a safe park for their money through government bonds .
But before you get spooked about what will be a significant borrowing programme , think back nine years when Bill English was borrowing $380 million a week , running a Budget deficit of more than $15 billion , the highest in the country 's history .
John Key even publicly admitted the borrowing was " absolutely unaffordable " .
Much of it was in response to the Christchurch earthquakes which at least was a tangible problem to grapple with .
With coronavirus no-one knows where it 's going to end up and Treasury 's even telling the Beehive it could be worse than the global financial crisis - which given that the world 's now in a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance Minister Grant Robertson says his package is about fighting the virus , which is essentially containing it , or in other words preventing it from spreading within the wider community .
Crowd control is unlikely to prevent what would seem to be the inevitable , albeit delayed , spread .
By the time he had finished , the drum sounded more like a grating cymbal .
He ignored the fact that the vast majority of businesses in New Zealand have fewer than 20 people .
The third part of the package is aimed at positioning the country for recovery which will be played out in Robertson 's May Budget .
Well at least he hopes it 'll be played out there but in reality no-one really knows because it 's inevitable things are going to get worse before they get better .
