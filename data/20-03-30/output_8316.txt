Ken Ruinard / staff  A 90-year-old South Carolina man who recently moved to Starr to live with his family is the first person in Anderson County to die of complications connected to COVID-19 , the novel coronavirus , according to a relative and the coroner .
Robert Williams was a textile worker in his prime and retired from a mill in Greenwood , according to Larry Sutherland , his nephew by marriage .
Williams lived in Saluda until just a few weeks ago when he suffered a fall , Sutherland said .
After that , Sutherland 's family decided that Williams , who never married or had children , should move in with them .
Williams had lived in Starr for less than eight weeks when he fell ill , Sutherland said .
" We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an interview Monday evening .
" He had n't left the house in weeks before he went to the hospital .
"  Sutherland said Williams went to AnMed Health Medical Center on March 22 .
Sutherland said doctors ' initial diagnosis was that Williams had pneumonia .
He said medical professionals drew blood from Williams that day to test him for COVID-19 .
Sutherland said it was Friday evening when the family learned that Williams had tested positive for the virus .
Williams died shortly before noon Monday in the intensive care unit at AnMed Health , according to Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore .
Shore said Williams had underlying medical issues with his heart and lungs , and that COVID-19 was a contributing factor in his death .
" Our investigation shows that he had not traveled abroad , so we believe that he contracted the virus locally , " Shore said in an interview with the Independent Mail .
South Carolina 's public health agency confirmed the death late Monday afternoon in a prepared news release , but did not disclose Williams ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Control also announced Monday the death of an elderly person from Beaufort County due to the virus .
That brings the state 's COVID-19 death toll to 18 people .
According to the latest state-testing data available , DHEC is reporting 925 cases of COVID-19 in South Carolina , including 151 new cases announced Monday .
Anderson County has 31 cases now , according to state statistics .
Greenville County has 88 cases .
Sutherland said he and the rest of his family are quarantined at their home in Starr , but have not been tested for COVID-19 because of a shortage of testing materials .
Sutherland and his 22-year-old daughter are staying in one part of the home , he said .
His wife and her mother , who is in her 90s , are in another part of the home .
The four of them do not interact in the same space , he said .
" We all take our temperatures at least twice a day , and none of us have shown any fever or really any symptoms , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cough , but she usually does this time of year because of allergies .
"  Schools , manufacturing plants , parks and dine-in options at restaurants are among the things around the state and nation that have been shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic .
" We ca n't reiterate enough how important social distancing and staying home are at this critical time , " said Anderson County Administrator Rusty Burns .
" This is very serious .
If you do n't care enough about your own health to stay home , care enough about everybody else 's to stay home for them .
