31 March 2020  Kitchen benchtops and dining room tables around Australia have become workspaces as office workers have been advised to work from home in the face of the coronavirus pandemic .
Where the opportunity to work from home in your PJs might have once seemed like a treat , the rapid shift to working from home -- if that is even an option for you -- is challenging .
Suddenly , you may find yourself working in the same space as your family , bent over a laptop instead of sitting or standing at a dedicated workstation with ergonomic equipment .
The combination of long hours on a laptopon the kitchen table can be both physically and psychologically stressful over the long haul .
" It 's worth investing some time thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mental wellbeing , " said Jodi Oakman , who leads the Centre for Ergonomics and Human Factors at La Trobe University .
Here are some tips and hacks that may help you make your home workspace healthier , keeping in mind it may not be possible to set up the ideal workstation in the current crisis .
" Both for immunity but also to help protect against being sedentary at your makeshift desk which may or may not be as good as at work .
"  Workstation tips and hacks  Not everyone will be fortunate enough to have a proper desk , chair and computer screen in their home , but there are some ways you may be able to improve your makeshift office .
( These are general tips and may not work for everyone .
You should see if your employer has requirements such as a checklist you need to follow and , if you need specific advice , get in touch with a qualified health professional .
)  If you have a limited budget just having an external keyboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Oakman said .
" Having a separate peripherals gives you a lot more flexibility .
"  " Just get your keyboard and mouse and then you can build a sitting or standing station around it .
Once you 've got a separate keyboard and mouse you can raise the height of your laptop on a pile of books to get it to the right height .
Laptops often have small screens which can be an issue for some people , so a separate screen is also a good idea .
If you ca n't afford to buy one or there 's none left on the shelves , Dr Oakman suggested negotiating with your employer to borrow a screen .
Another option is to use a small TV screen if you have a spare or bump up the font size to make it easier to read .
If you 're planning to do most of your work sitting down Dr Oakman said having an adjustable chair -- even a cheap one -- is a good idea .
This can help make sure you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Alternatively , ask if you can borrow your chair from your employer , she suggested .
If that 's not possible , use the tallest chair you have -- but not a stool -- and put something on it so you 're sitting at the right height .
" And if you need to have a footstool , find something an old shoe box , books , whatever you 've got that fills in that gap between your feet and your floor .
"  You will also need a lumbar support but using a rolled-up towel should be the last resort , Dr Oakman said .
" Towels flatten out , they move around and they are hard to get right , so they 're really only good for the short term while you find something more sustainable .
"  Using a headset or earphones for calls will allow you to get up and walk around , and you can tune out background noises .
" Lots of people already have that with their phones but that can be quite useful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours online .
"  " If you do your calls standing up and your work sitting down it gives you that flexibility of movement .
"  Where to set up your workstation  If you have a choice of where to set up , lighting is important .
Preferably you need to orientate yourself so that you do n't get too much light on the screen , particularly if it is a laptop which can be harder to see .
" Do n't have direct light on your screen but have light coming in over your shoulder , have an overhead light , or use a task light or desk lamp .
"  If you prefer to have your screen in front of a window so you can stare into the distance keep in mind it may increase the screen contrast .
In this case use blinds to control the direction of the light .
Setting boundaries between work and home  Finally , THE most important aspect of working from home is to set boundaries .
" A lot of us like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that can be very difficult now because we 're all here at home coupled with the fact we 're not going out , " Dr Oakman said .
Working from home also means we can end up working much longer days .
Setting up a designated space can signal when you are and are n't working .
While some people may be fortunate enough to have an office , others will be negotiating space in shared rooms .
Dr Oakman said strategies such as moving the workstation to the end of the table , putting it away or covering it up at the end of the day can help to signal when you are and are n't working to others .
It also gives yourself permission to say ' I 've done enough ' for the day , she said .
