The group , which was set up in 2015 to provide welcome support to the over-60s , has established a fast-growing Facebook group to continue that provision during the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
With Government advice to stay at home , protect the NHS and save lives meaning Any Old Irons can not meet in person , Any Old Irons has moved its meetings online , inviting members to share their favourite Claret and Blue memories and take part in regular Hammers-themed quizzes and workouts to help older supporters remain fit and healthy , both mentally and physically .
On Saturday , the group held a ' Watch Party ' for the 1975 final -- an unforgettable afternoon that saw Alan Taylor 's two goals help Billy Bonds ' West Ham see off Bobby Moore 's Fulham at Wembley Stadium .
Watching the full 90 minutes conjured fond memories in the minds of Any Old Irons members .
