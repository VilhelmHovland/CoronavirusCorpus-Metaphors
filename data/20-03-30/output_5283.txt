Opinion  Home-school meets old-school in the time of COVID-19  By Gai Lloyd  March 29 , 2020 -- 9 .
After three hours of grappling with totally new technology to prepare my online lessons as a school teacher , I went out to the hairdresser .
My much-loved salon is normally a buzzing social place , full of intimate personal stories and gossip .
But this time it was a ghost place .
Just me and another very old lady , strategically placed at polar ends of the salon .
School teacher Gai Lloyd .
It was confronting but I was consoled because I had made it to this appointment for possibly my last haircut for some time , maybe forever .
After teaching in high school classrooms face-to-face for more than 40 years , retraining only a few minutes before retirement is n't fun .
The very worst of teaching online is you do n't look at a classroom of youthful faces .
Instead , you confront your own face .
Wrinkles and hair in all its appalling glory .
It 's terrifying really .
However , this haircut turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the salon .
She stood at the entrance and made her announcement to all four of us .
" Well , " she said , " I 'm here to tell you I now have completely changed my opinion of teachers .
I 'm up to day two of home-schooling and it 's horrendous !  Advertisement  " My son is eight .
Oh my god ! .
I had to say to him ; ' Stop that ! You 're not listening or doing anything I say .
Stay still ! If you do n't behave , I 'll put you in your school uniform tomorrow .
' It did n't make any difference ! Then he told me he was a spider and pranced around the room in spider formations .
"  Loading  The mother did an excellent re-enactment of his crawling spider .
" I honestly do n't know how teachers do their job , " she said .
" I thought my son was , sort of , reasonably well behaved until now .
"  I laughed and said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stopped suddenly , stared at me and asked , in what was definitely a reverent tone : " Are you a .
teacher ? "  " Yes , " I said .
" Hooray ! You get it ! " I 've never felt such pride in my life 's work .
Loading  " I am in TOTAL awe of what you do , " the mother said .
" I had no idea .
till yesterday .
"  After my haircut , I went to my once-bustling but now empty cafe and stayed the required 1 .
metres away from the lone other customer , who was seriously masked and dancing around to keep her 1 .
distance , too , while trying to get her coffee .
I was getting ready to call out for a hot flat white takeaway ( because I 'd heard that hot drinks can kill the virus - fake news , as it turns out ) when the mother of the eight-year-old boy appeared again -- 1 .
metres across from me .
" Oh my God , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coffee .
You 're a teacher ! " And she did ! .
