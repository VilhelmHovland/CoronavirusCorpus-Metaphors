In my local supermarket here in France flour was on sale today at a special discounted price of 44 centimes ( about 40 english pence ) per kilo .
Which shows that not everyone is trying to profit by the situation .
Appleton rum is six quid off on Ocado Zoom , so I think us poor benighted Brits are getting the better deal here .
" How to run a city like Amazon and other Fables " is a book offering scenarios for cities being managed by the big names of digital technology ( such as Google , Apple and Tesla ) , by social media and web giants ( such as Instagram , Twitter , Spotify and even Pornhub ) ,  The defination of a HCID is very specific , and relates to a disease that has a high mortally rate , differcult to detect , and those infected require treatment in one of two HCID centres .
Do you really want the tens or even hundreds of thousands of infected treated in two HCID treatment centres ?  The panel deciding classification is led by experts in the field , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons to criticise the government in its handling of covid-19 , this is not one of them .
The brothers have ended up donating their stock to charity and may even end up with some kind of charge against them .
So a total crapshoot for them but the point is this is a terrible example of why Amazon is becoming central and powerful .
author is just running with a populist theme rather than drilling down to the nitty gritty of Amazon business practice .
No the catalogue entry will stay alive continuously regardless of quantity offered .
will occasionally sweep badly catalogued items but if the book is correctly listed it will be there pretty much for ever .
The reason you see crazy prices for books is usually down to software algorithms from larger sellers , the sort who might sell a book for a penny or a cent but might make just enough on postage to make a small profit .
Their software will undercut another seller down to the limit they set but it is also often used to go the other direction so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might set a crazy price to go up to .
if a novice or a complete chancer sets a really high price for a book which they think is rare but probably is not , one of the big boys or girls will often end up listing against it but just undercut them by a few cents or pennies so creating a trend of mad pricing .
The original lister might get frustrated that their book is undercut and pull it leaving the other seller or sellers with marooned nut job prices until they finally if ever do a stock inventory .
and again of course some crazy buyer might actually go for one of these mad listings but most sensible people would do a bit of hunting first like on Abe etc .
course there are expensive books on Amazon which are genuinely rare , collectable or hard to find .
The comedy is listening to Tory party celebrating companies that creates insecure and low-paid jobs which make a piecemeal of workers rights .
A Sunday Times investigation has revealed ambulances were called out 606 times to 11 out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambulances called to Amazon ' fulfilment centres ' ( warehouses to you and I ) once every two days last year as workers collapsed , were injured in falls and suffered broken bones .
"  " The highest number of callouts was at Dunstable 's 1,800-strong warehouse had ambulances attend 95 times from 2016 to August this year .
The most common reason ambulances were called to Amazon warehouses , which are called ' fulfilment centres ' were for fainting , breathing and chest pain .
Between January 2016 and August 2019 there were 159 cases of chest pain , 85 for staff being found unconscious , 51 of the callouts were for breathing problems , 38 for trauma , 20 cases of reported falls and two electric shocks at seven warehouses .
"  " Union officials claimed more than 600 reports have been made from Amazon warehouses to the Health and Safety Executive ( HSE ) over the past four years .
"  The tragedy is that almost 14 million voters gave Johnson and the Tories a blanc cheque to allow rogue businesses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs , and millions more are addicted to cheap things without ever thinking at those who are involved in manufacturing and logistics .
We have a consumer driven society that celebrates off-limits greed .
That is the not something that one should find funny .
Read the Guardian article which is the UK not the USA .
The author clearly states ? 48 for shipping .
He does n't say where the item was located but as I said most of this kind of stuff available in the UK is from China .
You are completely wrong about shipping costs .
I do sell on Amazon and I know what I am talking about .
The seller decides the shipping cost depending on the item and what they think is reasonable .
It is only on books and media where Amazon dictate shipping cost .
Check your facts first , it is always wise .
As for the New York example , well he clearly balls 'd that one up did n't he and the fact remains asking a price is not the same as selling it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you will find , on close examination , that ' foragers ' are exclusively people of a certain class who have lots of money and time , not to mention other resources such as vehicles , to go pottering around looking for mushrooms , wild garlic etc .
I doubt very much the foragers of yore , desperately seeking edible items to survive , would have described the activity as popular .
You wo n't find much in the way of protein or carbohydrates by foraging .
Agricultural work was never a ' popular pastime ' ; it was , and is , grindingly hard work for very little pay .
For centuries it was the only way most people could survive , dependent on local landowners and their whims .
In the ' good old days ' when people only ate ' pure ' butter , and ' unadulterated ' bread that would largely be their diet , if they were lucky .
The reason factory based products became popular so quickly from the mid 19th Century onwards is because making them yourself in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who run a business in London called the A-Z grocery , it is run by Kenyan Hindu 's .
One wall is devoted to pickles and pastes .
Freezers are full of samosas and , shock horror , chapatis .
Their clientele is still largely Asian , but with a good proportion of ' white ' people .
But many of the women are now accountants , solicitors , barristers , doctors , nurses , all of whom have better things to do with their time than make sodding chapatis from scratch .
Let 's try a different approach .
First , the whole premise of this article is the overwhelming power of a giant company Amazon , not their separate business AWS , or their key interests to penetrate the food market both in the US and the UK .
The article is describing poor retail practices , which are happening on a background of a global pandemic .
Second , The Guardian has previously reported on Amazon 's intention ( announced in May last year ) to purchase a stake in food delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transaction was put on hold by the CMA ( Competition Markets Authority ) which said that said the deal could leave customers , restaurants and grocers facing higher prices and lower-quality services .
It 's not the first time when Amazon tried to enter the food delivery market in this country ( ie Amazon Restaurants , which was initially available to some Londoners as part of its Prime subscription service - in 2016 ) , operation which was closed in December 2018 as it was not profitable as initially estimated .
However , Amazon already has has a venture with Morrisons , available to some subscribers to its Prime service .
Third , which company is used by The Guardian is not the topic discussed in this article , as much yourself and AstutuirTe are trying to claim .
The author referring to the giant retailer Amazon as an organisation which is assuming the " role of regulator and benevolent dictator " and " its decision to stop accepting non-essential products from third-party sellers who use its warehouses essentially amounts to government-style market regulation .
"  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand the author says : " What we will then have to come to terms with is that Amazon is becoming part of the critical infrastructure of western states .
" On the other hand he seems quite unsure " how should Amazon be regulated .
"  Lastly , I completely agree with you : " we need anti trust measures like in the 1930s to break up some of these big players , " as well as suggest that tax authorities and regulators must take their role seriously and be proactive .
Companies which tend for government contracts should meet strict criteria .
That is not the case with Amazon , as well as many other big tech disruptors .
The chronically passive regulators and tax authorities in the UK have allowed companies like Amazon to become a " dictator " .
They have also turned a blind eye to rogue employment models , and looked only at the bright side of the story : creation of jobs , downplaying the fact that those jobs are overwhelmingly low-paid and insecure .
While the AWS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other players in the market , and frankly it wo n't take long until those at the top of our organisations will suddenly realise how much cloud is costing and pull some things back in house , unless their aim is to beautify their accounts by shifting the costs in different columns .
I do n't pay for the New York Times but as the header says the guy has been left with 17 thousand bottles of sanatizer so not a very succesful business .
should I believe what he says about anything ? The fact remains people ask a price which does not mean they sell it .
It 's the merger of corporations and state that has occurred under our nose , while being distracted by covid that 's really got me worried .
The federal reserve has literally brought up America , and most of the world in the last week 's .
Scary times ahead , even if covid went away tomorrow .
I suppose as a 71 year old I should take in my stride the frustrations of lockdown life .
I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
my supermarket has just taken a vital item off my home delivery order for next weekend and my pharmacy has messed up my repeat prescription , omitting another vital item .
So I 'll need to make two trips out that should have been unnecessary .
My supermarket is intending to introduce a priority delivery service .
It seems as if those on the government 's ' at risk ' register will be eligible , but age alone will not qualify you as a priority customer even if you , say , need to take tablets to keep your blood pressure at a safe level .
I know the supermarkets are dedicating their first hour of opening to the elderly/at risk , but this is a two-edged sword as it encourages the most vulnerable all to shop at the same time .
I do n't see how how quoting large chunks of the article gets us anywhere .
So what if Naughton misses the point as well ? Of course he does .
The Guardian is built on AWS too , as I 'm sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century turnpikes , the 19th century canals and railways , and 20th century airports airlines .
There are alternatives but for the time being AWS is important .
As I said , I 'm of the opinion that we need anti trust measures like in the 1930s to break up some of these big players .
But to say they are n't critical infrastructure is wrong .
They need to be split up precisely because they are .
This article is about Amazon the online retailer and not about AWS , which is a separate business entity .
Kindly please , read John Naughton 's article : he is talking about a greedy retailer , denouncing Amazon 's price-gouging practices ( ie from free delivery in a month time to asking ? 48/ delivery in one week for a ? 6 .
purchase of some hand-sanitiser gel ) and the lack of good practice regarding vetting third-party sellers listed on their platform .
Even the damn photo , shows a worker picking up some tat from a " fulfilment centre in Swansea " .
What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that you have not read the article .
who needs a government ? Its very expensive given that its easily 30 times value for money .
We could surely self-finance a hospital and a few community security guards for a lot less than a recless government of brexit zealots who put millions of lives at risk for the tory party 's old and frail grip on power .
But this article , if you read it all rather than skim , is about Amazon 's role as a retailer and profeteering in a moment of crisis - example instead of free delivery in a month , a marked up price of ? 48 in a week , as well as the kind of sellers that they vet .
" Two recent episodes illustrate that point nicely .
Waiting to check out at Aldi one day , I noticed that a box of hand sanitisers near the till was empty , and mentioned it to the cashier .
He said that they sold out every time they put up a new box .
Being a soap-and-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I logged onto amazon .
to see how matters stood online .
There were pages and pages of hand-sanitiser gel , though relatively few with the 60%+ of alcohol content recommended for the coronavirus .
But I found one for ? 6 .
with free delivery and so put it in my basket , only to discover that the " free " delivery would only get it to me a month hence .
On the other hand , I could get it in a week if I opted to pay .
Q : how much was delivery ? A : ? 48 .
The polite term for this is price-gouging .
"  There 's a nice photo shooing a work picking-up orders from an Amazon warehouse .
Clue : it 's not a rack with switches and routers , but goods .
The place : a " fulfilment centre in Swansea " .
You 've got that the wrong way around .
This article about Amazon the online retailer , not AWS .
This is the company that is paying bugger all in taxes , is making a piecemeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors of power and the special deals offered kindly by the MHRC , to make many retailers to go bust .
Food is critical , cloud business is not , let alone there are few other big players .
, please , do n't get me started on Netflix .
Just read about the subsidies they claim and how much they pay in taxes .
Well , Amazon being cast as a benevelont behemoth is depressing .
But then again we 're governed by total clowns .
They 're busy telling us to be very afraid , chastising us for not heeding their official advice .
Yet when you look at the gvt website what do you get ? :  " As of 19 March 2020 , COVID-19 is no longer considered to be a high consequence infectious diseases ( HCID ) in the UK .
"  Democracy only gives people the right to tick a ballot box based upon lies and broken promises , but it 's actually private donations that funds the political system and that is what truly influences government policies .
The good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of greed and power for a selective couple of few , and it 's been this way for decades  Yep , it truly does n't matter what is going on in your mind at any given moment , because only on the outside of you and in the present moment , here in the now is our only true reality .
A wiseman once referred this as the Kingdom of God .
I must be one sick puppy , to use Americanisms .
partner and I are quite enjoying this .
a different supermarket or local shop to walk to each day for exercise and buy enough to keep just 2 days ahead of need , for family of four adults .
traffic , cleaner air ( do we really need all that air traffic ? ) less people out and about .
could really take something from this .
A new workers revolution .
Why spend an hour and arf travelling and polluting the world when you can do same job from home .
know not everyone can do that so compensate them in a different way and you would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  AstutiorTe did not ask me if I have any clue about the bit of Amazon business which is AWS .
You 've got that the wrong way around .
AWS is the main thing .
If you were to say to me that amazon should be split up , I would n't disagree .
But AWS is the big important part .
The shop and the video streaming are merely one ( two ? ) of many clients of the former .
Other online shops are built on AWS .
Other video streaming services ( Netflix for example ) use AWS .
The Dalai Lama , when asked what surprised him most about humanity , he said :  " Man .
he sacrifices his health in order to make money .
he sacrifices money to recuperate his health .
then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present ; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future ; he lives as if he is never going to die , and then dies having never really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions because of the PAYE payers , the VAT payers and contributors to all the other unavoidable taxes that fall disproportionately on those with least assets .
They pay for the police , the courts and law makers , the infrastructure including roads , along with the education of the people who will need to be both employees and customers for society to function .
The contract is : that with the right to conduct business within a state comes the obligation to pay proportionately for the upkeep of that state .
If those who shift their assets and tax over borders to avoid tax wo n't contribute , then there is no obligation on the state to defend their property rights .
The medieval concept was of " outlaws " , fair game for anybody to take whatever they need or persecute as they see fit .
Read the NYT article .
The items were sold within the US and the sellers admitted they were raking it in .
If you sell on Amazon , there is a fixed fee for shipping that the company decides .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions .
I would take a high interest / low capital amount housing market over the current low interest huge capital amount one any day .
Much easier to pull the deposit together and the high interest rates mean an actual return on savings .
Most young people are trapped paying extortionate rents and could afford the mortgage payments but do n't have a bank of mum and dad to access the deposit capital .
By the time you 've saved a few grand the market has increased .
Then once you have the mortgage you can make overpayments which actually have an effect on the monthly amount and can clear it much faster .
Finally , ultra low interest rates only have one direction to move in .
You had it better in many , many ways .
