The Commonwealth government warned Friday that anyone who does not comply with the mandatory 14-day quarantine requirement for arriving travelers will be arrested and imprisoned or fined $500 .
This measure will be enforced by local law enforcement , in coordination with the Commonwealth Health Care Corp .
and the COVID-19 Task Force .
" Violators of this important protective measure will receive a maximum of no more than a year imprisonment and/or no more than a $500 fine , as provided under law , " said a statement Friday from the Office of the Governor .
This mandatory 14-day quarantine is being enforced given the importance of protecting the CNMI 's small island community , the statement added .
All individuals entering the CNMI have been ordered to quarantine at a designated site for 14 days , starting last Monday , March 23 , 2020 , pursuant to Gov .
Ralph DLG Torres ' Second Amended Executive Order 2020-04 , Directive 8 ,  Incoming travelers will also be enrolled into the Text Illness Monitoring system , which alerts Commonwealth Health Center staff when enrollees report symptoms .
Why quarantine ? Quarantine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 may not become apparent until 14 days after a person is infected .
This is also known as the " incubation period " of the disease .
Travelers coming into the CNMI from COVID-19 affected areas such as Guam , Hawaii , Korea , China , Japan , and the Philippines may have been exposed to the disease .
For the protection of the public , these individuals are quarantined and closely monitored for the full incubation period to prevent the spread of the disease .
What about health clearance ? Individuals who present a health certificate certifying that they tested negative for COVID-19 in the previous 72 hours may be considered for exemption from quarantine , but this certificate must be reviewed at the quarantine site .
Only health certificates , issued by a recognized health agency , indicating that the individual was tested negative for COVID-19 will be honored .
For example , travelers from Guam must present a health certificate indicating a negative test for COVID-19 issued by the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services within 72 hours of travel .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All individuals , even those requesting exemption , must go to the quarantine site after arriving on Saipan .
What is quarantine ? Quarantine is when the movement of an individual , or a group of individuals , is limited after possible exposure to a communicable disease , for a time period equal to the longest incubation period of the disease .
This is done to prevent transmission of a disease to others .
In the case of COVID-19 , this is especially important if an individual is coughing or sneezing .
Tiny droplets of fluid from a cough or sneeze can land on surfaces touched by others , and get into healthy people 's eyes , nose , and mouth , which will make them sick .
I 'm scheduled to fly into Saipan soon .

From there , persons under orders to quarantine will be checked into the hotel and given details on their stay .
Because the purpose of strict quarantine is to reduce the risk of disease transmission , people under orders to quarantine can not see family or friends in person during their quarantine ; however , each room is equipped with internet and telephone service , and people under orders to quarantine are encouraged to communicate with family and friends often .
Interaction with loved ones is protective of physical and mental health .

I am a healthcare worker ; do I have to be quarantined ? All new and returning healthcare workers will be assessed according to the Commonwealth Health Care Corp .
Healthcare Worker COVID-19 Screening Protocol .
This protocol is initiated at the quarantine facility .
Due to the severity of COVID-19 , CHCC needs all HCWs to be available for the community .
Coupled with our continuous shortage of health workers , CHCC , with consultation from regional experts , developed this protocol to allow for the medical clearance of HCWs .
HCWs who present a certificate from a recognized health agency indicating a negative COVID-19 test in the last 72 hours of travel and are asymptomatic will be allowed by the CHCC medical team to exit the quarantine location .
Asymptomatic HCWs without a valid certificate will be enrolled into a strict daily monitoring plan by the CHCC health team and also allowed to exit .
Any symptomatic HCWs will be ordered into quarantine .
