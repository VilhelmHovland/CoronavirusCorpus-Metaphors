However , there 's a family in Sangli that is at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak .

The collector said a ' containment zone ' has been created in one-km radius of the area where the family lives in Islampur and 325 of their ' non-close contacts ' have been home quarantined to further check the spread of infection .
" There is no community transfer as exposure to the virus has taken place only among known contacts .
