On March 31 ( this upcoming Tuesday , if you have n't glanced at a calendar for a bit ) , the chain will hand out one free beef taco per customer .
And to minimize contact , you can only pick yours up in the drive-thru .
Customers will receive the Nacho Cheese-flavored Doritos Locos Tacos ( no substitutions ) .
Think of it as a reward to us all for successful social distancing .
If Taco Bell is n't your speed , there are plenty of other chains handing out free food to customers during the pandemic : Burger King will provide two free kids ' meals with the purchase of an adult entree when ordering through the chain 's app .
And every Monday , Krispy Kreme will give out a free dozen doughnuts to health care workers treating patients with the coronavirus .
Scattered showers will be possible on Tuesday , but are expected to be very light .
Dry and warmer weather returns for the middle of the work week , but projections are bringing another chance for showers into our forecast this weekend .
