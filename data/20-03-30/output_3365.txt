Grealish and Co acting like twerps shows the end of the world as we know it is not quite so nigh  Comment  Dave Kidd  30 Mar 2020 , 21:34  Updated : 31 Mar 2020 , 2:23  Dave Kidd  Invalid Date ,  4  THE only wonder was that a sports-starved bookmaker had not offered odds on it .
On the identity of the first Premier League footballer to prang an expensive car after attending a house party during the coronavirus lockdown .

but his idiocy presented us with a reassuring sense of normalityCredit : AFP or licensors  Jack Grealish had apparently matured since taking over as Aston Villa captain -- yet his previous form might still have seen him listed among the favourites .
Grealish , 24 , would this month have been included in Gareth Southgate 's senior England squad for the first time but for the health crisis .
Now , after smashing his ? 80,000 Range Rover into three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans to stay indoors -- it will be some way back for the midfielder .
And Villa will be furious that a player almost certain to be sold this year has probably knocked ? 10million off his market value by proving that a leopard never can change its spots .
It was disgraceful hypocrisy from Grealish , yes .
But there was also a reassuring sense of normality about it .
Footballers acting like twerps .
Suddenly , the end of the world as we know it does not seem quite so nigh .
4  After all , Stoke 's IRA fan James McClean had already been on Instagram , dressed in a balaclava , apparently home-schooling his children with a history lesson -- a neat piece of self-parody quite possibly , but not exactly a great example of comic timing .
Fun-loving former Newcastle winger Nobby Solano -- currently assistant boss of Peru -- had been arrested for attending a house party in his homeland , hopefully with his trademark trumpet .
And if footballers acting with self- entitlement was n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Britain 's WBO world super-middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders released a disgraceful online video showing men how to punch their female partners if tempers flared during the lockdown .
It was an act so mindless it resulted in his license being suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control , with even his own promoter Eddie Hearn describing it as ' appalling ' .
Although Hearn did add that Saunders is ' a really good kid , with a really good heart ' -- proving that boxing promoters will continue to spout nonsense even under the threat of Armageddon .

Of course , sports people are not the only ones making pillocks of themselves on the internet during this crisis .
The level of pious hand-wringing on Twitter -- always high -- has reached previously unimagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other ' good citizens ' grass up their neighbours for going out twice a day -- all apparently gleeful at the idea of living under a police state .
But Grealish probably takes the Nobel prize for two-facedness by attending a party so soon after demanding his social media followers do as he says rather than as he does .
There have been plenty of good deeds done in the football industry during these past couple of weeks .
The altruism of Roman Abramovich , Gary Neville , Pep Guardiola , Jose Mourinho and many more has been rightly well-documented .
But the idea of footballers and other sports people as ' role models ' has always been flawed .
4  Wanting a footballer to parent your kids is never a good look .
And now the Government is having to treat us all like children , self-important messages from footballers are less welcome than ever .
If , as planned , the remainder of the Premier League is played behind closed doors during the summer months , we 're likely to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Especially with news that squads could be placed under tournament-style isolation in hotels and banned from going home to lower the risk of infection .
British footballers have never been good at such claustrophobic living .
Fabio Capello was into social distancing long before it became fashionable , with England 's remote base at Rustenburg during the 2010 South Africa World Cup roundly hated by his players .
Going back to the early 1960s , the great Jimmy Greaves has some amusing anecdotes of escaping via hotel windows while supposedly locked down with the AC Milan squad for several days a week .
