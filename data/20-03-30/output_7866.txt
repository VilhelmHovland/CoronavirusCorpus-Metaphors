The number of couples filing for divorce in China is reportedly way up after long periods of COVID 19-related confinement .
The British Parliament was just warned to expect a spike in U .
divorces too , blamed on coronavirus quarantines .
" My friends certainly have sent me memes of wow , the divorce rate is going to go up , " attorney Rick Jones , of Golberg Jones in Seattle , said Monday .
However , Jones , who specializes in family law , told KIRO-TV he 's not seeing an uptick in divorce filings related to statewide stay-at-home orders .
" Even in families that work well together , there are roles to play , and those roles include one or both of the parents getting up and going to work , or the child being in school , " Jones said during an interview from his office .
" So to all of a sudden have these roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly stretched emotionally is definitely a stressor .
' Jones expects marriages may fracture weeks and months from now because the coronavirus crisis is causing many couples to experience job loss .
" Financial stress is always one of the big stressors that lead to divorce , " he said .
" Trying to figure out how you can support an entire family , a spouse , and however many children you have , and that creates a level of stress .
" Even though Jones ' practice has not seen an increase in divorce filings so far , his office has received a large number of coronavirus-related calls in recent weeks , including questions about " Is my parenting plan still enforceable ? Can she or can he withhold the children ? Can we even by agreement deviate from this parenting plan , for all the right reasons , if in fact someone has tested positive ? " Jones explained .
Psychology Today published ways to help prevent divorce for families working and staying at home .
Jones echoes one of those : be kind .
" You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say tough it out .
Understand that you 're stretched .
Everyone is .
So be kind to each other .
"  People across the country have had to cancel trips because of the coronavirus and getting a refund or credit for a cancellation at a vacation rental can be tricky .
Sue Brumm and her family had been planning a trip to Phoenix which was supposed to take place last week .
They booked the trip on Vrbo in November but had to change plans about a week before leaving because of the pandemic .
' Hour by hour things were changing and cities were closing down , " Brumm said .
Brumm had already paid more than $2,000 in full and tried to get help from the property owner about a refund or a credit .
Brumm said she has n't been able to get any answers .
" This is not OK , " Brumm said .
" We 're out $2,000 .
" WFTV contacted Vrbo to find out what options there are for people like Brumm .
A spokesperson for the company said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips canceled because of the coronavirus .
As for the money paid to the property owner , Vrbo said the owner is either supposed to give the customer a credit for full value or they are supposed to give the customer at least a 50% refund .
But here 's the catch : The enforcement of the policy is limited .
A homeowner who does not follow those rules will only lose out on the benefit of additional visibility when travelers do online searches .
" Partners who do not abide by these standards ( offering a 100% credit/refund of at least 50% ) will be disadvantaged vis- ? -vis those who act within our policy , " the policy states on the website .
Vrbo said it 's looking into Brumm 's case ' I understand their side , " Brumm said .
" They 're running a business .
But what is going on is not something that 's under anybody 's control or could have been foreseen .
