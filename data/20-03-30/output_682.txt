Editor 's note : This travel story was written before the COVID-19 pandemic and appears in the April/May 2020 issue of Spaces magazine .
My hashtags were #balibirthday , #balibound and #bucketlistbali .
Friends and family knew where I was going in early December with my husband to celebrate a milestone birthday and I tagged my photos on social media with the hashtags for them to follow along .
As you can guess , a visit to the Indonesian island of Bali was a dream come true .
Bali seems so exotic and foreign and has been at the top of my list of places to visit for years .
Using a combination of airline miles , hotel points , hosted stays , off-peak dates and internet research , we were able to afford 10 days in the tropical location for about the same price as a similar weeklong trip to London .
But the secret is out on this paradise location with affordable dining and lodging .
The crush of tourists has caused some prominent travel publications to recommend skipping Bali .
While we went on the off-season , the heavy traffic and number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching T-shirts or other gear ) was significant .
Peak travel time can only be worse .
Still tourism is Bali 's top industry and supports a nation of workers who take pride in showing off their beautiful sites .
If you 're flying into Bali , you will likely pick Denpasar as your arrival point .
It is Indonesia 's second busiest airport behind Jakarta and very accessible .
As I write this , I must acknowledge the risk of COVID-19 and its impacts to international travel .
Our trip took us from MSP airport to Denpasar through Seoul , South Korea with a long layover that allowed us to get a hotel room , shop and explore the city .
Delta has since suspended travel to Seoul so this itinerary may not be available .
However you get there , your trip to Bali may be a dream vacation .
Here are some tips and highlights to make your own #bucketlistbali a reality .

DENPASAR  This area is home to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its beaches and all the activities that those resorts offer .
to see : Do n't miss a sunset visit to Uluwatu Temple on the southern tip of Bali .
If you time it right , you can sit in the outdoor arena on the cliffside grounds and see a sacred " kecak " or fire dance .
What to do : Bali is known for its many affordable spa treatments so I indulged in a massage and pedicure at our resort , Anantara Uluwatu .
My husband went golfing and was one of the only people on the course ( in the middle of the day , it was hot .
) There are a number of unique ways to explore the area as well , including Urban Adventures ' cocktail safari , renting a motorbike to zip around on , and , of course , enjoying the beaches .

Where to stay : We stayed at the splendid Anantara Uluwatu for three nights , two of them hosted .
The gorgeous rooms each had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean , with spectacular sunset views .
Other amenities include an expansive breakfast buffet , two-tiered infinity pool and glass-encased wedding chapel .
While the resort is about an hour from the airport , they offered to pick us up and had motorbikes for rent on site to explore the area .
You can also hire a driver .
I do n't recommend renting a car ; let someone else deal with the traffic headaches .
We also used some travel points and stayed at the The Stones hotel , a Marriott property , in the heart of Denpasar on the tail-end of our trip .
It was much closer to the airport for an easy exit but in a very touristy and busy area of Bali .
UBUD  While the Denpasar region is Bali 's beachfront , Ubud is the jungle area in the heart of the island .
Even though it is only about 35 miles from Uluwatu to Ubud , it took us 2 hours to travel there on some harrowing roads .
to see : Do n't miss the Bali Monkey Forest for a fascinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOT feed the animals .
We watched in horror as one American family had to alert workers that a monkey had ripped off the zippered phone case hanging around the mother 's neck and made off with the phone and all the money and credit cards inside .
The monkey calmly started tearing open the case on the rocks across the canyon as we all tried to distract it and drop the case .

We also hired a driver one day for a visit to the Tegalalang Rice Terrace and the Elephant Cave Temple .
Sticking with the animal theme , stop by Goa Gajah if you can .
Known affectionately as the Bat Cave , you 'll marvel at the thousands of bats hanging inside the mouth of this temple  What to do : Bali is one of the top five destinations in the world for yoga , so of course I had to practice as much as I could .
I enjoyed an exquisite private session one morning at our resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a number of public and private yoga studios as well as retreats across the island , do some research to find exactly what you are looking for .
I also practiced yoga at a free session at the Anantara Uluwautu resort along the beach .

Where to stay : We stayed three hosted nights at The Mansion , a wonderful , traditional , and expansive resort just outside Ubud 's main area .
With six different pools , a number of open-air yoga studios , several wedding chapels and elaborate gardens , the resort is the perfect combination of luxury and traditional d ? cor .
It felt truly Balinese over some of the other more Western hotels and provided Instagram-worthy images every few feet .
The staff is friendly and willing to try their English skills with you and an efficient shuttle into the heart of Ubud offers a chance to explore the area beyond the resort .

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tiny area is known for one thing : scuba diving .
We hired a driver to take us the 52 miles from Ubud to Talumben ( more than 3 hours on the road ) and spent a few days diving along the coast in the shadow of Mount Agung , Bali 's still-active volcano .
to see/do : You 'll only make the trip to this tiny location if you 're scuba diving but you 'll make the drive to see the submerged U .
Liberty off the coast .
Whether you 're an experienced diver or just getting certified , the warm waters and coral reefs are amazing .
It was another #balibuckelist experience .
