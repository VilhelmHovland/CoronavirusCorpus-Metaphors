Covid-19 : Number of patients being treated in hospital jumps almost 50%  Covid-19 : Number of patients being treated in hospital jumps almost 50%  There has been almost a 50% rise in just a few days in the number of people being treated for coronavirus in England 's hospitals , according to new figures .
Sir Simon Stevens , chief executive of NHS England , said on Friday that more than 6,200 patients were in hospital with Covid-19 .
But on Monday , he said this figure had jumped to more than 9,000 .
England 's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the NHS was seeing around an additional 1,000 patients a day and described this daily rise as " stable " .
He told reporters at the daily press briefing : " I do expect that number to continue .
I expect people coming every day to be about that , it may go up a little bit .
" And in two or three weeks you would expect that to stabilise and to start to go down a bit .
"  It comes as 1,408 people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive for Covid-19 , as of 5pm on Sunday .
This is up 180 from 1,228 the day before .
Earlier the head of the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) said around one in four NHS doctors are off work sick or in isolation .
Public Health England ( PHE ) also announced that almost 11,000 coronavirus tests a day can now be carried out .
The Government had set a target of carrying out 10,000 tests a day by Sunday but PHE figures show 9,114 had been carried out as of 9am on Saturday and 8,278 had been carried out by the same time on Sunday .
( PA Graphics )  PHE said fluctuation in the number of tests reported each day is to be expected but testing numbers are increasing overall .
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) will this week release figures on deaths involving Covid-19 in the wider community , such as care homes .
The ONS will look at deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate , including in combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer detail on how many community deaths involve coronavirus , rather than just looking at deaths in hospitals .
Sir Patrick said these ONS figures would provide " extra numbers " but they would not be " large .
"  ( PA Graphics )  Speaking on a visit to the new NHS Nightingale Hospital on the ExCeL site in east London , Sir Simon said that the number of patients will increase , but extra capacity is being made available .
He said : " Today , there are over 9,000 positive coronavirus patients in hospitals across England and we know that number is only going to increase .
" That 's why what you see here is a mass mobilisation , taking place right across the country , but also at these new Nightingale hospitals .
" We have got available intensive care and available hospital beds but we are also bringing online additional capacity such as these Nightingale hospitals as we need them .
"  Earlier , Professor Andrew Goddard , president of the RCP , told the PA news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , either with coronavirus or because a family member or housemate is ill .
" At the moment , we think it 's more doctors self-isolating with family members , though there are some off sick themselves , " he said .
( PA Graphics )  " This is really impacting a lot in emergency departments and London is in a much worse position than elsewhere at the moment , but it will come to other places .
Birmingham is also struggling .
"  Asked about the pressure on intensive care units , Prof Goddard told PA : " Some hospitals are really at the limit .
" Within London it 's very , very difficult at the moment , you ca n't underestimate how difficult it is .
"  He said it was unclear whether the 25% off work would be a " rolling number " or whether it could ease as testing of NHS staff increases and people come out of isolation .
" Of course the worry is we will lose more people to Covid-related illness , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nursing ( RCN ) said on Sunday that around one in five nurses had taken time off work to self-isolate .
( PA Graphics )  Meanwhile , Professor Neil Ferguson , from Imperial College London and author of a report which warned of mass deaths if the UK did not introduce strict controls , said there were signs the rate of hospital admissions was slowing .
While the numbers are still going up , the rate of growth is slowing , he suggested .
It comes as Dominic Cummings , the Prime Minister 's chief adviser , became the latest in Westminster to self-isolate after developing symptoms .
He joins Boris Johnson , Health Secretary Matt Hancock and England 's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty , who are all in self-isolation due to Covid-19 .
Prof Ferguson said social distancing measures brought in by the Government appeared to be having an effect on the numbers .
" In the UK we can see some early signs of slowing in some indicators -- less so deaths because deaths are lagged by a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme .
" But if we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions , that does appear to be slowing down a bit now .
" It has not yet plateaued , so still the numbers can be increasing each day but the rate of that increase has slowed .
"  Dominic Cummings is self-isolating ( Matt Dunham/PA )  Prof Ferguson said the epidemic was spreading at different rates in different parts of the country , but across the UK perhaps 2% or 3% of the population had been infected .
Based on the estimated UK population of 66 million , this would mean between 1 .
and two million people have or have had the illness .

Earlier on Monday , University College London ( UCL ) announced that a breathing aid that can help keep Covid-19 patients out of intensive care has been developed by mechanical engineers , medics and the Mercedes Formula One team .
The device , known as continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , has been used extensively in hospitals in Italy and China to help coronavirus patients and bridges the gap between an oxygen mask and the need for full ventilation .
Downing Street said the NHS had been given the go-ahead to order as many of the machines as it needs after trials were successful .
