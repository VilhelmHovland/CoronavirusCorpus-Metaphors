Taking a different approach to salaries on account of Covid-19 , Cognizant plans to pay about two-thirds of its employees an additional 25% of their base salary in their April salary , as a ' sign of gratitude ' for their efforts in continuing to work during the Covid-19 pandemic .
The policy , which the company will review on a monthly basis , will benefit over two-thirds of its Indian workforce .
The company had 203,700 employees across 13 locations in India as on December 31 , 2019 .
The additional payout for employees in India and the Philippines will be up to the Associate designation .

We support these and other efforts by governments across the world to ' flatten the curve ' and contain the spread of COVID-19 .
Despite this turbulence , which affects both you and your families , you have risen to the challenge of serving our clients with empathy , initiative , integrity , and courage -- all while supporting and uplifting one another .
I am deeply grateful to all of you for your daily acts of heroic leadership .
"  Humphries added that while the pandemic would likely dampen industry demand , the requirements for fulfillment remained critical .
The company has allowed work-from-home ( WFH ) for a majority of its offshore teams by provisioning new laptops and encrypting desktops and moving them to the employees ' homes , as well as by enabling the use of BYOD ( Bring Your Own Device ) , providing additional bandwidth connectivity and air cards -- all with the appropriate client permissions and security protocols , he revealed .

In a time , when job losses and pay cuts are becoming the norm , this move by Cognizant will go a long way in assuring its employees .
