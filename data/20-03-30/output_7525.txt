BURLINGTON , Vt .
( WCAX ) While cooped up during the coronavirus pandemic , it can be a challenge to maintain a healthy body and mind , but experts have some recommendations to keep you feeling good .
Normally , this time of year is when people with Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) or depression start to feel relief from their symptoms , but University of Vermont Psychological Science Professor Kelly Rohan says those same people might be experiencing more anxiety over coronavirus concerns than others .
Overall , she says these are the five main focuses : keeping a schedule , continuing your hobbies , limiting exposure to news , getting outside and practicing positive thinking .
Rohan suggests both those who suffer from the symptoms and even those who usually do n't , be proactive about having a routine -- like going to bed and waking up at a consistent time and taking a shower and getting dressed on days you 'd normally work .
She also encourages regularly walking outside and limiting news consumption to about a half-hour a day .
Rohan says perhaps the most important adjustment is actively turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Anybody who 's outside your social network who 's not in your household , we have to get creative about how we stay connected with those people , " Rohan said .
" The telephone , video conferencing , that 's the world that we live in right now .
Are we missing that sense of intimacy , physical contact ? Yes absolutely , but why are we doing this ? It 's to keep each other safe and for the greater good .
"  Rohan says isolation can weigh on the mind , so she says these tips can especially help those working from home .
" Maintaining a sense of normalcy as much as possible is super important to our mental health right now .
Follow a schedule , maintain a routine , get up , shower , get dressed , eat your meals and snacks when you usually do , " Rohan said .
Jackson Thibault is working remotely from his Colchester home , and his employer recently extended the date when he can return to the office indefinitely .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can do this .
' Then the next week I definitely had to have a barrier between working and being at home , " Thibault said .
The website designer says he 's gradually built not only a physical barrier between work and home but a mental one .
While he enjoyed time with his dog , he started to limit how much they lounged together .
Though he 'd set up a proper workspace at his dining room table , he soon realized simple adjustments like changing out of his pajamas had an impact on his productivity .
" Once I 'm in work mode , I just kind of stay there as much as possible and try to get my work done and then once I 'm done , I close my laptop and I 'm out of that room for the day .
I ca n't be in there any longer , " said Thibault .
Rohan recommends rather than viewing today 's uncertainty as a burden , we should see it as an opportunity .
" This is an opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to solve a problem , " said Rohan .
" It 's an opportunity to work together to protect our loved ones .
It 's an opportunity to feel more compassion for other people , and to appreciate life more .
"  Thibault says people working from home should do the same by counting their blessings .
" A lot of people are out of jobs right now and you 're lucky enough that you 're still being able to works , " said Thibault .
Rohan says mental health professionals are still available to help patients via video chat and phone , and she encourages you to reach out if you need to talk to someone .
