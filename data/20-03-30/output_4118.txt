New Care Payment Scheme announced for Limerick greyhounds during coronavirus restrictions  Reporter :  Jerome O'Connell  25 Mar 2020  Email :  **27;2389;TOOLONG  0  THE Irish Greyhound Board have announced a new Covid-19 Greyhound Care Payment Scheme to provide support for the care of racing greyhounds .
The new scheme will last for the period that greyhound racing remains suspended as a result of the Covid-19 crisis .
This Tuesday , the Irish Greyhound Board confirmed that all greyhound racing activity was suspended to ensure full compliance with the the latest directions of government and HSE protocols .
While many sporting events were postponed in recent weeks , the Dock Road greyhound facility had operated behind closed doors - race nights operated on a ' one dog-one person ' basis with no public admission to the racing , which could be viewed online .
Greyhound racing was to continue this Thursday and Saturday as normal until the new Covid-19 measures .
With all greyhound racing now cancelled until at least April 19 , the IGB have revealed details of their new Covid-19 Greyhound Care Payment Scheme .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect of each active greyhound currently registered on the IGB 's Racing Management System .
This includes greyhounds that have raced or had an official trial at any IGB licenced greyhound track in the previous 42 days .
The 42 days is part of the statutory racing regulation within which a greyhound is permitted to trial/race .
The 10% remittance to public trainers will continue to apply with respect to the greyhound care payment .
The scheme does not require any application by owners/trainers for the special payment as this will automatically be processed on a fortnightly basis similar to the current arrangements for prize money payments .
The new scheme will come into effect from April 8 when the final prize money payments have been made .
" The care and welfare of racing greyhounds remains a priority action for the IGB and the wider greyhound community .
The current Covid-19 crisis has required the suspension of racing activity which results in an income loss for those involved in the greyhound industry , " said Chairman of the IGB Frank Nyhan .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scheme is to ensure that the care and welfare of greyhounds continues to remain a priority and that funding is available to the greyhound community to support the costs associated with the daily care of their greyhounds , " siad the chairman .
" I ask all in the greyhound community to work together during the current crisis and to stay safe by complying with all government advice and HSE protocols .
I look forward to the resumption of greyhound racing as soon as is possible .
"  The new care scheme will be reviewed after one month of operation and in the event that restrictions arising from the Covid-19 pandemic remain in place .
The IGB has also announced that following discussions with the Irish Coursing Club ( ICC ) that the fee for registering new litters of greyhounds within 14 days of whelping will be waived .
The IGB will recoup to the ICC the cost of this measure .
This approach will ensure that an element of the costs associated with breeding activity will not apply during the current crisis .
