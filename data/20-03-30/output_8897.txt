Introducing The ARTery 's Living Room Livestream  Massive closures of museums , venues and other cultural spaces have impacted the arts and culture landscape in many ways .
The ARTery had to cancel our own events highlighting Boston creatives because of the coronavirus pandemic .
Local artists have been pushed to the edges of monetary security due to the loss of gigs , tour dates , performances , lectures and more .
Now , many are turning to the virtual world to continue to connect with their audiences .
We did n't want to let the closures of venues stop us from 1 ) continuing our programming with local artists and 2 ) connecting with arts lovers in Boston and beyond .
Over the coming weeks , we 'll be highlighting some creatives here in the city who are finding virtual ways to expand their artistic practice .
