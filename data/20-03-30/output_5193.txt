Zoom 's valuation surges to $42 billion in the wake of Covid-19 .
Share Via :  What is Zoom ? Hint : Not referring to cars .
Why has this this video conferencing app become a worldwide rage among smartphone users in recent weeks ?  Till a month ago I 'd not heard of Zoom .
Suddenly , the video conferencing app is on everybody 's phones .
It 's being used for business conferences and to teach school children remotely .
Why has Zoom become one of the most downloaded apps of 2020 ? It 's quite a story .
It was set up by Eric Yuan , a Chinese engineer who migrated to the US in 1997 after his visa was turned down 8 times ! Yuan joined WebEx , an online meeting platform , acquired by Cisco in 2007 .
He was head of engineering but when he quit in 2011 customers were unhappy because improvements had come to a standstill .
When he started Zoom , few gave him a chance .
Similar services from Google , Skype and GoToMeeting ( WebEx too ) existed .
Undeterred , Yuan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer-unfriendly .
He devoted himself to creating a great product .
The combination of free and paid service led Zoom to record triple digit growth for many years .
When Zoom listed on NASDAQ in April last year , Yuan 's 20 per cent share was worth $3 billion .
Since COVID-19 hit the scene , Zoom 's valuation has surged to $42 billion .
And Yuan is one among a few billionaires whose worth has shot up in the carnage of 2020 .
Closing fact : Yuan hates the term ' unicorn ' because " if customers do n't like your product , very soon you become nothing " .
