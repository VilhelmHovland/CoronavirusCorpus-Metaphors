Ontario 's ability to give front-line medical workers crucial equipment will be " severely challenged " if there 's a " massive surge " of COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks , Premier Doug Ford said Monday .
Last week , Health Minister Christine Elliottdenied reports of equipment shortages on the front line of the pandemic .
But speaking to reporters by teleconference , Ford repeated pleas for residents to stay home as much as possible , saying that limiting the spread of the novel coronavirus would buy the province more time to get crucial personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for medical workers .
" The hard truth is , the more time we have , the more lives we can save , " said a visibly grim Ford , flanked by Elliott and Dr .
Merrilee Fullerton , Minister of Long-Term Care .
Ford said officials are working day and night to procure more medical supplies , even as shortages hamper pandemic response efforts worldwide .
Some Ontario manufacturers are now repurposing their equipment to make PPE , and " millions " of pieces are expected soon , he said .
Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedoms in Ontario to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus : " I 'm not afraid to pull the trigger on that , " he said .
The province will follow the advice of Ontario 's Chief Medical Officer of Health , Dr .
David Williams , Ford said .
Minutes earlier , Dr .
Williams said in a press release that he 'd " strongly recommend " the public not leave their homes except for essentials .
( Groceries , medications , medical care and dog-walking would be OK , Dr .
Williams said .
)  Meanwhile , Ontario recorded its highest spike in new COVID-19 cases Monday : 351 , bringing the province 's total to 1,706 .
Fatal cases also appear to be accelerating -- Associate Medical Officer of Health Dr .
Barbara Yaffe announced 10 more deaths from the virus , as opposed to four new deaths on Sunday ( in total , 33 people in Ontario have died from COVID-19 ) .
Another 431 people have recovered .
Ford announced the province would give $10 million to businesses , non-profits and volunteers who are helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They need an " iron ring of protection , " he said .
Anyone over the age of 70 and all people with underlying health conditions should stay home and self-isolate , Ford said .
Elderly people are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 , and seven deaths have been recorded at the Pinecrest Nursing Home in Bobcaygeon , Ont .
, about a two-hour drive northeast of Toronto , since last Wednesday .
Data on testing backlog briefly removed from website  Since Ontario 's first case of COVID-19 was identified in January , the province has publicly posted data on how many people have been infected with the virus .
On Monday , it changed the format of that data , giving more information on demographic data and trends .
" The hard truth is , the more time we have , the more lives we can save , " said a visibly grim Premier Doug Ford .
#onpoli  For a few hours , the province removed data about how many people are waiting for the results of a COVID-19 test .
That data is crucial because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backlog of tests that has held health officials back from knowing how many people have the virus .
The category was added back in by Monday evening .
On Friday , with nearly 11,000 people waiting for test results , the provincial government said it was expanding testing capacity and hoping to clear the logjam by early this week .
That queue appeared to have been nearly cut in half but not entirely cleared Monday afternoon -- 5,651 people are waiting for test results .
Some of Monday 's jump in cases was due to those tests being processed , Dr .
Williams said .
The province has also shifted to doing one update per day on cases instead of two .
