A total of 35 Tennessee counties were represented , destinations for troops assembling at the Tennessee Army National Guard 's medical command .
Each with its own concerns and shortages .
And , very soon , each would have replenished medical resources to fight COVID-19 .
It wo n't be easy for health departments in rural Tennessee counties , some that might be understaffed and undersupplied , to combat the spread of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karen Hyman with the Tennessee Department of Health come in .
They are part of the community health service department , meaning that while they are based in Nashville , their focus extends to all corners of Tennessee .
Obremskey , medical director , and Hyman , assistant health commissioner , are part of a team responsible for health departments in 89 rural counties .
They are responsible for assisting and guiding departments in rural parts of the state .
As two of the few civilians standing out among soldiers in fatigues , each worked quickly Thursdaypreparing boxes of supplies for soldiers heading to those communities to help establish testing centers .
Between long days and weeks , the duo has n't had much time to learn -- or to dwell on the fact they are still relatively new at this .
Obremskey and Hyman each started the first week of January at the Tennessee Department of Health .
" We 're calling it baptism by fire , " said Hyman with a smile .
It 's a unique , difficult challenge in these unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health department really care about their community and are there for them and are doing the best they can to meet the needs of their community , " Obremskey said , " and we have at times very limited resources .

Shelley Mays / The Tennessean  While a majority of COVID-19 cases have been concentrated in larger cities , the virus continues to spread to rural locations , presenting problems for areas not as equipped to handle them .
At least 11 rural hospitals in Tennessee have closed since 2012 , according to coverage by The Tennessean , and at least 20 counties in the state are without a functioning hospital , according to state government reports .
In a global pandemic , Obremskey and Hyman are there to help .
" It 's an honor to be part of the Department of Health at this point in time , " said Obremskey , who worked previously as the chief medical officer at Centennial Children 's Hospital and in pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center .
" Each day is different .
We wake up in the morning thinking things are getting on their way and then there 's always a curveball that throws you , " she said .
" But that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission is daunting .
County health departments , despite limitations , are being tasked with COVID-19 testing and contact tracing , an essential part of limiting the spread of the virus .
The goal is for each county to meet those needs for the COVID-19 crisis -- and keep the public as safe as possible during a time of social distancing -- without also hindering ongoing essential services like the Women , Infants and Children ( WIC ) program and efforts to stop the spread of other diseases .
And this came on the heels of tornadoes that hit the state earlier this month .
Obremskey said she always wanted to be a part of this , helping in public health .
Her days start around 7 a .
and go well into the evening .
She 's often working through the weekends , and that 's likely to continue .
" We are trying to operate -- 6-feet apart -- every day , " she said .
Additional help has been provided initially by the state 's military operation .
" These teams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , ' said Hyman , who came to Nashville from Asheville , North Carolina .
" There are really well-thought-out plans , really talented , smart people who are just managing a lot of the testing and tracking the cases , contacting the people who turn out positive and keeping track of them and making sure they get tested and that they stay quarantined .
" It 's a huge effort .
"  Know a health care hero ?  Not all heroes wear capes , after all , and The Tennessean is seeking to highlight our local heroes on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic .
