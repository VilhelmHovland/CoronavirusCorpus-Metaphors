Wearing masks in the time of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak -- contrary to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) ' s advisory -- is crucial in reducing the risk of spreading the virus , two medical experts opined .
George Gao , director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , told Science Magazine in an interview that not wearing masks -- a phenomenon currently widely seen in the United States and European countries -- during the COVID-19 pandemic is a " big mistake " .
" This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact .
Droplets play a very important role -- you 've got to wear a mask , because when you speak , there are always droplets coming out of your mouth .
" Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections .
If they are wearing face masks , it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others , " he said .
Kim Woo-joo , a professor of infectious diseases at the Korea University Guro Hospital and South Korea 's most prominent coronavirus expert , similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing masks to prevent infection of COVID-19 is " definitely effective " .
" Why else would doctors wear masks in hospitals ? They wear them because they prevent infection , " he added , referencing the effectiveness of masks during the SARS and MERS outbreaks .
Professor Kim , who has around 30 years of experience in the area of infectious diseases , said he finds it quite " odd " that not many people wear masks in the West .
" The US Surgeon-General said people did n't need to wear masks , and WHO recommended people not to wear masks , but I 'd have to disagree .
" I did read his tweet .
You have to understand the context .
I think the point was to prevent the public from hoarding masks , because medical professionals need them more , " said Professor Kim , particularly due to the shortage of masks in the US .
Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS !  They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus , but if healthcare providers ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts them and our communities at risk ! https : //t .
Professor Kim also criticised the WHO 's statement on how people are only encouraged to wear masks in Asian countries due to purported cultural differences , stating that such a view is " problematic " as masks have been " proven " to prevent infection .
" Just look at China , Hong Kong , Japan and Korea .
In the meantime , if you look at many European countries and the US , the virus is spreading rapidly .
One of the reasons Korea has a relatively low rate of infection is because everyone is wearing a mask and washing their hands regularly , " he said .
Even wearing glasses may help protect a person against coming in contact with droplets carrying the virus , said Professor Kim , as the virus can enter the body through mucous membranes in the eyelids .
" These mucous membranes have a receptor called ACE2 .
The virus has to stick to those receptors .
We do n't have receptors on our skin .
Our skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added .
Professor Kim stressed that while people generally can not catch the virus simply by breathing -- the known routes of COVID-19 transmission are droplet transfer , direct contact and indirect contact with infected persons and surfaces -- aerosol or airborne transmission of the virus is still possible .
Citing the Shincheonji church gathering in late Feb -- which led to a supercluster in the city of Daegu and an astronomical spike in cases nationwide -- Professor Kim said : " Imagine these hundreds of people gathered within one to two metres of each other , praying and singing for hours .
If one infected person is present , think about the number of droplets produced .
"  " We all spit even when we talk normally .
but if you are singing and shouting , you are going to get a lot of droplets .
Gravity does n't pull all the spit down , which means the droplets do n't land within one to two metres .
because the air can also flow sideways , " said Professor Kim , adding that the droplets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The droplets shrink to less than 5 microns when they dry out , turning into an aerosol that allows them to travel as far as two metres , he said .
" That 's how a person standing quite a few feet away can still get infected , " said Professor Kim .
Airborne transmission in open spaces such as parks , however , is unlikely , according to Professor Kim .
Another South Korean medical expert similarly opined that the risk of aerosol transmission in such regular outdoor environments is low .
Choi Jae-wook , professor at the Preventive Medicine Department of Korea University College of Medicine , was quoted by Korea Biomedical Review as saying that aerosols are usually only formed in specific circumstances , such as " when mucus of a patient comes out from the upper respiratory tract through coughing , or when a patient with a lot of sputum is suctioned or incubated in a hospital " .
" In some patients , upper respiratory tract infections can result in a lot of mucus , causing aerosols , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this post  No Result  View All Result  Democracy is best served by having an informed and involved citizenry that has access to a wide range of sources of news and views and an open and vibrant environment in which to share and to debate ideas and opinions .
