The aggressive actions of local governments in the San Francisco Bay Area may have successfully bent the coronavirus curve .
" State leaders and doctors are cautiously optimistic that the Bay Area 's early moves to lock down residents two weeks ago have prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region 's health care capacity thus far , " Politico reported Monday .
" Six Bay Area counties were first in the country to adopt aggressive tactics with an enforceable March 16 order requiring residents to stay at home , " Politico noted .
" After 14 days -- the outermost period at which symptoms are believed to emerge post-infection -- doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected to see at this point , and officials credit the lockdown with stemming the tide of patients they feared would flood into emergency rooms .
