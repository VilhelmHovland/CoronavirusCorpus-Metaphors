Joining the likes of Oracle and Adobe , Nike is set to report its figures for 2020 's Q1 earnings season next week .
How will Nike 's share price manage amid coronavirus panic ?  With its share price battered by coronavirus and recession concerns , Nike NKE is set to report its results for the fiscal quarter ending February 2020 on Tuesday ( 24 March ) .
Nike 's share price has lost 37 .
of its value in the month to 23 March .
Like many of the companies to have already reported this season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the pandemic 's spread , particularly as it has already taken the decision to close its stores across the US , Canada , Western Europe , Australia and New Zealand , effective last week .
With so much uncertainty around what the impact of the virus truly means for businesses , share price traders will be wanting clear reporting from Nike on how it expects its revenue and earnings figures to be impacted in the coming year , and they will want comment on how Nike plans to deal with the crisis .
So , should traders expect a post-earnings bounce in Nike 's share price ?  Nike to report earnings during a pandemic  In a recent report , Zacks highlights that so far there has been only " average " decline in Q1 estimates for companies reporting for the fiscal quarter ending in February , which somewhat contradicts the " actual and perceived disruptions " to normal business activities by the pandemic .
A key reason for this is the fact that a lot of companies have simply withdrawn earlier issued guidance because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic 's impact .
" The ongoing market sell-off shows there is n't a lot of confidence in these consensus expectations , " says Zacks .
" That will likely change only once visibility on containment of the pandemic improves , which will enable companies to get a handle on the full extent of their exposure and the pandemic 's macroeconomic impact .

That will likely change only once visibility on containment of the pandemic improves , which will enable companies to get a handle on the full extent of their exposure and the pandemic 's macroeconomic impact " - Zacks  As a result , much of what is being forecast by companies for the quarter is likely to be guesswork .
Unless Nike reveals a reassuring action plan during its earnings call , its share price is still likely to see volatility in the next few months .
Zacks says the apparel maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0 .
per share in its Q3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , revenues are expected to be $10 .
, up 4 .
year-on-year .
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 9 .
lower over the past month , which illustrates how the prevailing sentiment among analysts covering the stock has evolved over time .
A billion-dollar drop  In the near future , Nike could suffer a $3 .
drop in revenue for the fiscal quarter ending May ( Nike 's Q4 ) as a result of the coronavirus outbreak , according to investment bank Cowen .
This will result in a loss per share of $0 .
Last week , Cowen told Reuters that the apparel maker is getting hit not only by store closures , but also the loss of promotional opportunities at prominent international events such as the NBA , which has been suspended due to the pandemic .
As a result , Nike may put some troubling estimates on the table for its fourth quarter when it reports results .
" Nike also has incurred relatively modest borrowings , carrying just $3 .
of long-term debt on its balance sheet , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
While Nike 's anticipated revenue decline is troublesome , the company is in a good position to weather the storm , even if the coronavirus impact stretches beyond Q4 .
" For now , I 'd advise long-term shareholders to simply hold on to the stock of this dominant athletics brand , despite its current turbulence , " says Sharma .
Other analysts , however , are more optimistic .
According to CNN , 21 of 32 analysts polled currently hold a " buy " recommendation on the stock .
The average price target currently sits at $105 , a potential 49% increase on 19 March 's closing price of $70 .
Ahead of results , Nike has pledged more than $15m to help efforts to slow the virus 's spread and support those who may be struggling financially as a result of it .
More than $10m of this donation comes directly from Nike co-founder Phil Knight , chairman of the board Mark Parker and CEO John Donahoe .
$15million  Amount pledged by Nike to help slow spread of coronavirus  The cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Oregon Community Recovery Fund and Oregon Food Bank .
