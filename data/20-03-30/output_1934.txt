Thousands of Norfolk children eligible for free school meals are to benefit from a national voucher scheme which will allow them to keep getting them while they are at home .
The move was hailed as a lifeline , given that some struggling families are dependent upon those meals and the closure of schools to all but key workers will have pushed up their shopping bills .
But the government announced every eligible child will get a weekly shopping voucher worth ? 15 which can be spent at supermarkets while schools are shut .
Schools can continue to provide meals for collection or delivery themselves , but where this is not possible , the scheme will allow schools to provide vouchers to families electronically , or as a gift card for those without internet access .
The vouchers can be spent on food at a range of shops including Sainsbury 's , Tesco , Asda , Morrisons , Waitrose and M&amp;S , with the Department for Education working to get more shops to join the scheme as soon as possible .
Dan Mobbs , chief executive of the Norfolk-based Mancroft Advice Project ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Free school meals are lifelines for families in poverty and it is a huge benefit to those at school getting a good meal when not at home .
" There is a lot of pressure for families at this time .
It is more stressful if siblings are sharing rooms and there is not a garden to play in -- being at school is a really good thing .
" It is good that the government has thought about access to meals and it is amazing what you can achieve in a short time .
" The biggest challenge is doing things quickly and without a trial so we will have to wait for feedback from families to see how it works , but I 'm sure it will be welcomed .
"  John Fisher , cabinet member for children 's services at Norfolk County Council , said : " We welcome this clarity from the government on how it will be ensured that all children eligible for free school meals will be able to access their entitlement .
" The council is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and processes around free school meals .
" We will now expand this work to support schools in rolling out this new voucher scheme to all those eligible for it .
"  Education secretary Gavin Williamson said : " No child should go hungry as a result of the measures introduced to keep people at home , protect the NHS and save lives .
