Yoga is not just asanas and pranayams , but a complete way of life , conceived to enable one to keep working at one 's highest goals , always , undaunted by ups and downs of existence .
To walk this path , one has to follow certain rules - 5 niyamas , which were first outlined by Maharshi Patanjali around 250 BC in his work Yog Sutras .
While these niyamas of Ashtanga yoga are meant to help all humans living in any age , to lead happy , fulfilling lives , these are particularly relevant in today 's stressed times , when the bulk of humanity is battling a formidable enemy , and is ridden with uncertainties .
The five ancient niyamas which we can follow today to advantage :  Saucha : It means cleanliness .
Cleanliness of one 's body , mind and external surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( asanas , pranayams ) , kriyas ( cleansing actions like jalaneti , ) and right diet , mental hygiene is equally important as stress lowers immunity .
Clean the mind by flooding it with noble thoughts .
Read good messages , study any subject , listen to uplifting music and spiritual discourses , watch inspiring films , and pray sincerely .
Just as we do not put garbage in our mouths , so also at all times , we need to be conscious of the words , images , etc .
with which we fill our minds -- for our good mental health .
Santosha : To be content with what we have in life .
Keeping our desires limited .
Instead of comparing with others and looking at what we do n't have , appreciating fully the persons and things in front of us .
Appreciation leads to joy and calmness .
And one becomes a source of peace and pleasure for others .
Tapa : Training the senses through austere practices .
Being hard on oneself .
Accepting both pain and pleasure with grace .
Determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing things -- in sync with changing needs .
Observing rules like fasting .
Through the practice of tapa , we become stronger in mind and body .
Tapa literally means ' to heat .
' For example , the more gold is heated , the purer it becomes .
Swadhyaya : Study of oneself ( ' Swa ' - one 's own and ' adyhyaya ' - to study ) and also scriptures for direction .
To know oneself is difficult .
Deep reflection , contemplation and meditation on our thoughts , speech and action regularly , is essential to identify corrections that we need to make in ourselves , to become happier and more worthy humans .
Reciting hymns aloud or specific mantras quietly ( japa ) are two methods of swadhyaya .
Ishwarpranidhan : Surrendering to the will of the universe and working for the highest good at all times , and not just for oneself .
Ishwar signifies a higher , bigger reality than ourselves-- the universe .
The universe is eternal , subtle , has unsurpassable excellence and is benevolent .
We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our good at all times .
Such faith drives out painful thoughts from the mind and steadies it , to focus on one 's work .
Prayer helps to build faith and also develops our ability to concentrate .
By keeping our minds , bodies and houses clean ; appreciating all the resources we have at this moment ; taking on strenuous household chores and bearing discomforts ungrudgingly ( knowing this will only strengthen us ) ; introspecting on changes we need to make in ourselves to be better humans ; and above all by praying with full faith in the universe -- we can effectively fight Corona and emerge victorious .
