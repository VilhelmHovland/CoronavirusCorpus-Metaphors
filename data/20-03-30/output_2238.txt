( Supplied/Mike Cavanagh )  The Canadian Pharmacists Association wants to ensure its members are given the same protections as other essential healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak , especially when it comes to accessing personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .
The association said pharmacists are currently not receiving PPE from the government .
The organization said it understands supply is limited , and must be allocated properly , but it would like pharmacists to be part of the distribution .
" Community pharmacists are really on the frontline of what 's going on right now , " the association 's director of practice development Shelita Dattani said .
Dattani said there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still going to the pharmacies where staff have no PPE to protect themselves .
Canadian Pharmacists Association director of practice development Shelita Dattani said she does n't want the industry overlooked during the COVID-19 pandemic .
( Supplied/Canadian Pharmacists Association )  She said pharmacies could previously order PPE from suppliers , but with a limited global supply chain , there is n't any available .
The association also wants pharmacists to be supported and recognized as other frontline health workers have been during the pandemic , which includes access to mental health services and COVID-19 testing when it becomes more widely available .
It also wants pharmacists and pharmacy staff to be able to access child-care centres that have opened up in some provinces , including Ontario , for other essential health workers .
" Sometimes people forget about us , " Dattani said .
' We just need to be included '  Pharmacist Mike Cavanagh owns two pharmacies in Lindsay , where the majority of his clients are elderly .
Earlier this week he enacted a new screening process based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before allowing patients into the pharmacies .
Cavanagh said on the first day of screening three people were turned away at one location .
He said the screening has provided the opportunity to not only protect staff and the public , but to educate patients on the symptoms of COVID-19 , the importance of quarantining after travel and practicing physical distancing .
If patients are turned away , the pharmacy delivers medication to them if possible .
Staff wear a mask when screening patients thanks to a community member who donated 20 of them -- but there still are n't enough .
" At the rate we 're going now that will probably only last about 10 days , " Cavanagh said in an interview earlier this week .
" We 're not trying to say one deserves something more than the other , " he said , adding he understands hospitals should get first priority to PPE .
" We just need to be included in that consideration as well just because we are seeing so many patients .
"  Cavanagh said pharmacists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said his busiest pharmacy sees around 200 patients a day , including in-person consultations with about 40 people .
" We 're seeing multiple patients , probably more patients than other healthcare providers on a daily basis , " he said .
" We want to make sure that we 're safe as well .
"  Protecting staff and patients  Pharmacies are taking different approaches to protecting staff and patients based on advice from the national association , which includes installing protective shields and putting markers on the floor to ensure customers lineup at least six feet apart .
In addition to the screening centre , Cavanagh ordered shields for his two pharmacies and has already put the lineup markers on the floor .
His staff is also doing three times the amount of medication deliveries as usual .
Some pharmacies have installed plastic shields to protect pharmacy staff and patients during the COVID-19 outbreak .

A spokesperson for the province 's Minister of Health Christine Elliot said while the role of pharmacists is valued , the global supply chain for PPE is extremely strained .
" Personal protective equipment is being prioritized for frontline workers who may experience exposure ( close contact within two meters ) to members of the public who are symptomatic , " Hayley Chazan wrote in a statement .
She pointed to the province 's new website that helps businesses and the government work together to address shortages by removing barriers to allow companies to produce masks , swabs and ventilators .
