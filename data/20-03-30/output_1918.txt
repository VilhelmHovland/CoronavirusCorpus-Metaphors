Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli has slammed those not following social distancing during the countrywide lockdown and gathering in crowds on roads .
Kohli issued a video message from his social media page to ask people to stay indoors and follow rules formulated by the government .
He said , " Hi , I am Virat Kohli .
Today , I am not talking to you as an Indian cricketer but as an Indian citizen .
Whatever I have seen in the last few days , people 's crowd on the street , people wandering around on the road , not following curfew rules , not obeying law and order .
After seeing this , I felt as if we are taking this fight ( against coronavirus ) lightly .
This fight is not as simple as it appears .
"  Kohli added , " My request to people today is ; please please please , follow the rules on social distancing .
Please follow every rule and instruction laid down by our government .
"  Please wake up to the reality and seriousness of the situation and take responsibility .
The nation needs our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds during the lockdown came after thousands of people gathered in Delhi 's Anand Vihar to return home .
These people were migrant workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar , who decided to return home in the wake of looming uncertainty on their livelihood in big cities .
The migration of hundreds of thousands of workers prompted Congress MP to take a dig at the central government as he wrote on Twitter , " Out of work &amp; facing an uncertain future , millions of our brothers &amp; sisters across India are struggling to find their way back home .
It 's shameful that we 've allowed any Indian citizen to be treated this way &amp; that the Govt had no contingency plans in place for this exodus .
