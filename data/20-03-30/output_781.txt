The Food and Drug Administration on Sunday issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine , decades-old malaria drugs championed by President Donald Trump for coronavirus treatment despite scant evidence .
The agency allowed for the drugs to be " donated to the Strategic National Stockpile to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalized teen and adult patients with COVID-19 , as appropriate , when a clinical trial is not available or feasible , " HHS said in a statement , announcing that Sandoz donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to the stockpile and Bayer donated 1 million doses of chloroquine .
Advertisement  The move was supported by the White House , part of a larger Trump-backed effort to speed the use of anti-malaria drugs as a potential therapy for a virus that has no proven treatment or cure .
FDA already has allowed New York state to test administering the medication to seriously ill patients , and some hospitals have added it to their treatment protocols .
" Let 's see how it works , " Trump said at a press briefing on Sunday , referencing New York state 's efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Scientists in America and around the world have identified multiple potential therapeutics for COVID19 , including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , " HHS Secretary Alex Azar tweeted on Sunday night , praising Trump and the EUA .
Career scientists have been skeptical of the effort , noting the lack of data on the drugs ' efficacy for coronavirus care and worried that it would siphon medication away from patients who need it for other conditions , calling instead for the agency to pursue its usual clinical trials .
FDA 's move is expected to facilitate more access to the drugs by allowing more donations , and a second EUA is under consideration that would allow more manufacturers to produce it , said three officials .
Hydroxychloroquine , which is already available commercially in the United States , is commonly used to treat malaria , lupus and rheumatoid arthritis .
The drug also has been touted as a therapy for coronavirus by an unusual assortment of investors , TV correspondents and even some advisers to the White House -- including some advocates who overstated their claims and credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  However , a growing number of lupus and arthritis patients have complained that they 've been unable to full their prescriptions amid ongoing shortages , and reports have emerged that some physicians are hoarding the drug for themselves .
Federal officials also have privately complained that Trump 's focus on anti-malaria drugs has distracted from efforts to investigate more promising therapies , and several scientists immediately panned the announcement .
" I would like to see who at FDA 's Medical Countermeasures Initiative signed off on this EUA despite the total lack of scientific evidence that **30;3870;TOOLONG are beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19 , " tweeted Luciana Borio , who served as FDA 's acting chief scientist between 2015 and 2017 .
" EUA is supposed to be issued when the evidence indicates that benefits outweigh the risks .
"  Trump has pushed to experiment with new therapies and not wait on the usual clinical protocols , given the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic .
Asked by a POLITICO reporter whether his agencies should wait for more evidence on anti-malaria drugs , the president on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with infectious-disease specialist Anthony Fauci -- one of several officials who has privately counseled the president not to rush on unproven medicines .
" I think Tony would disagree with me .
but we have a pandemic , we have people dying now , " Trump said , adding that he 'd recently spoken with FDA and been frustrated by the agency 's pace .
" They indicated that we 'll start working on it right away .
It could take a year , " the president said .
" I said what do you mean a year ? We have to have it tonight .
