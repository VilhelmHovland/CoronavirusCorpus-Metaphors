Saag 's best-of Q&amp;A : Expert answers coronavirus questions  EDITOR 'S NOTE:UAB 's Michael Saag made headlines last week with his urgent warning in an AL .
Op-Ed that Alabama was not prepared for the onslaught to come of COVID-19 , aka , coronavirus .
Over the next few days he did a series of short Q&amp;A 's that appeared separately on AL .
Saag then , in an ironic twist , got sick , with , you guessed it coronavirus .
He 's doing as well as expected , speaking virtually to the Rotary Club Wednesday .
While waiting for the good doctor to recover , I am going to pull these together for a one-stop shop of Saag 's answers , right here , in case you missed one or more of these .
OLIVER : Can you get the coronavirus and the flu either at the same time or separately within weeks or months ?  SAAG : It is very unlikely someone will have coronavirus and any other respiratory virus ( e .
the flu ) at the same time .
The information out of China shows that very few patients who were seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respiratory virus .
Some of their providers felt strongly that once someone tests positive for COVID-19 , there is no need to test for any other virus at that the time of COIVD diagnosis .
There is no specific explanation for this , other than it could simply be a matter of coincidence : IT would be really bad luck to catch two viruses at the same time .
OLIVER : How does coronavirus kill you when it does ?  The virus itself does not directly kill someone .
Rather , it is the patient 's immune response to the virus that kills the patient .
As with any infection , the immune system responds to get rid of the pathogen .
That is the job of the immune system .
Sometimes , the immune system response becomes excessive , releasing a lot of immune-based substances ( called ' cytokines ' ) that are designed to turn on and stimulate the immune system .
When the production of these substances becomes excessive , the resultant ' cytokine storm ' overwhelms the host ( patient ) leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-19 , the excessive cytokine production damages the lungs , causing the lungs to fill with fluid , which prevents oxygen from getting into the blood to nourish the other organs in the body .
One of the experimental approaches in the treatment of people with advanced COVID-19 is to use drugs to ' cool off ' the immune system , reducing cytokine production and giving the lungs a chance to ' breathe ' .
OLIVER ( question from reader ) : I do n't understand why mortality rates go up in older age groups ?  SAAG : For whatever reason , those folks who are older and get COVID-19 have more respiratory failure .
My best guess is that the cytokine storm , referenced above , is more exuberant among older folks .
This results in more damage to the lungs .
The reason why this happens is unknown .
OLIVER ( From reader ) : Are people with autoimmune diseases more at risk ?  SAAG : They appear to be , but the ' angel is in the details ' .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autoimmune disease , especially those who are being treated with drugs that suppress or stimulate the immune system ( ' immune modulators ' ) .
What is for sure known is that anyone with an underlying chronic disease of any type ( co-morbid conditions ) are more likely to have more severe disease and an associated higher chance of dying ( mortality ) once they contract COVID-19 .
This is especially true if the person is older ( &gt; 60 years of age ) .
That said , those folks who are older with co-morbid conditions , while having a higher risk of mortality , can for sure survive the infection .
Indeed , the majority of patients ( even if older ) survive .
It 's the RISK of death that is higher than younger folks  Finally , just because someone is young ( Say 25 of 30 years of age ) does not mean they can not die from the infection .
A small fraction of young , otherwise healthy people indeed die from the infection .
So , it 's best for ALL OF US to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Since we ca n't know who is infected in a social setting , it is best to stay at home as much as possible , avoid crowds , and leave home only when doing tasks that are judged to be ' Essential ' ( e .
, grocery shopping , going to the drug store , and so forth ) .
OLIVER : What about Parkinson 's , Lewy body dementia or Alzheimer 's ?  SAAG : There are no specific data on the relative risk of dying if someone with dementia contracts COVID-19 .
In general , the statements above apply to persons with these disorders as well .
For anyone who has advanced co-morbid diseases ( e .
, advanced dementia , end stage heart disease , advanced bronchitis / COPD , and so forth ) , the relative ' reserve ' available to absorb the insult of COVID-19 is reduced and they are more likely to die from the infection than others .
MIKE ( from reader ) : Why ca n't reports of cases ca n't be more localized instead of just telling us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she would like to know if there were any clusters geographically .
SAAG : Great question .
Ideally , we would want to track infections by their local ' geo-code ' ( think of it like a more sophisticated zip code with more granularity ) .
And ideally , we would want to do surveillance testing in neighborhoods that seem to be ' hot spots ' and use more restrictive isolation measures .
Unfortunately , we are just now getting to the point where we can test at all ( ! ) .
We are well behind in our testing capability and are restricting tests to only those who present with symptoms .
Typically , the positive tests are reported by the county where the patient lives .
Hopefully , over time , we can become more granular in locating ' hot spots .
' Right now , that is not possible owing to the speed with which this infection is moving through our state and nation .
We are struggling simply to keep up  OLIVER : How do I know whether I should cancel an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  SAAG : My best advice is to filter the answer through the lens of two questions :  * How many people will attend ; and  * " Is it essential ? "  No matter what , everyone should avoid gatherings of more than 25 people , the fewer the better .
And when in any crowd , maintain ' social distance ' , which is typically 4 to 6 feet apart from one another .
So , in the case of a wedding , I suggest postponing the event to a later time .
If that is not desired , reduce the gathering to ' essential ' guests : close family , closest friends at the ceremony .
One viable option is to have a small ceremony but cancel the reception and reschedule it to a later time when everyone can attend without concern about contracting the virus .
Call it a " Celebration of Marriage " .
You could even hold it on the first wedding anniversary .
Regarding travel , the fundamental question remains : Is it essential .
In reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not have to happen and can be postponed to another time when the fear of contagion is reduced and an unexpected travel ban does not restrict your ability to get home .
Also consider the location .
You may be traveling to a region that does not have healthcare services readily available .
You do not want to become ill , in another country for example , and need to seek care for coronavirus symptoms .
Many of the ' air ambulance ' services have restrictions on transporting individuals with coronavirus infection .
Fortunately most air carriers have now waived their change and cancelation fees so there is no penalty for delaying your trip .
Similar supportive policies are now active in the hotel industry .
What about religious services ?  I have had several conversations with clergy and lay leadership of churches .
My advice : Cancel formal religious services and Sunday School activities until the threat blows over .
Many congregants are over the age of 60 , the group of people with the highest morbidity and mortality from coronavirus .
Sharing pews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding hands , and simply greeting one another can spread the virus unwittingly from one person to another .
We are metaphorically in the middle of a hurricane .
No one would hold or attend services while the storm is hitting our neighborhood .
If your place of worship refuses to cancel services , my advice is to stay home .
Many congregations employ webcasting of services .
This is a safe way to participate from a distance .
It 's easy to understand why clergy and church leadership would resist such advice .
But we are in new and unprecedented times .
Never in our lifetimes have we encountered this type of threat to such a large number of our citizens .
As covered in the article I wrote on Friday , the threat is direct ( someone getting ill ) as well as indirect through the destabilization of our health care delivery capacity .
We all must do our part to minimize risk .
OLIVER : What do I do if I feel ill ?  SAAG : First off , stay calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus it is normal to be frightened if symptoms appear .
Fortunately , for 4 out of 5 people who become ill , the symptoms are mild and do not progress .
In circumstances when the disease worsens , the usual progression is as follows :  * This tends to progress over the next few days .
( Note , this is very different than the flu , which has a sudden onset of illness with all of the symptoms occurring all at once and progressing quickly over 4 to 12 hours )  * Next is muscle aches and headaches .
Some people have stomach upset or diarrhea .
Appetite diminishes .
* By day 6 or 7 , fever appears .
While the fever may occur early in the course , it typically is one of the later symptoms .
* Finally , cough develops .
This may occur earlier in the course , but often is one of the later symptoms to occur .
It is also the symptom that should be monitored very closely .
For those whose symptoms progress to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need evaluation at a healthcare facility .
Do not ' tough this out ' at home without a formal evaluation when the symptoms become more advanced .
If possible , please discuss where to go with your healthcare provider .
They may be set up to manage cases of coronavirus in their office/clinic , but many providers do not have the capacity to evaluate folks with this infection in their outpatient clinics / offices .
Please call before arriving unannounced at their office .
Those that do have the capacity are setting up specific , protected areas within their facility for patients who have suspected coronavirus infection .
Waiting rooms that are not divided are not safe for those who do not have the infection .
In most instances , you will be instructed to go to the Emergency Room ( this recommendation may change in the coming days should ERs develop specific Coronavirus assessment outposts to de-congest the ERs ) .
If you do not have a healthcare provider , you should go to the Emergency Department .
What do I do if someone living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  As recommended above , first of all stay calm .
You likely will become the support person for the patient with the virus .
If you stay calm , they have a better chance of staying calm .
Second , you should try to minimize your chances of picking up the infection .
Suggestions include :  * Isolating the person to a specific area of the house or apartment .
* Try to minimize direct contact with the patient  * Use gloves ( if available ) when picking up dishes , trash , or materials used by the patient and immediately dispose of the items .
* Wash your hands thoroughly ( at least 20 seconds with soap and water ) any time there is contact with materials / items handled by the patient and immediately after removing gloves  * Clean down surfaces with disinfecting wipes or alcohol-based cleansers that may have been touched or used by the patient over the prior 48 hours  * Place alcohol-based hand sanitizer in areas around the house ; use frequently , even if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Avoid touching your face .
You should help monitor the person for advancing symptoms ( described above ) .
If the symptoms are progressing to coughing spells with shortness of breath or difficulty breathing , you should help them get to an Emergency Room as soon as possible .
If the symptoms are mild , the symptoms should be managed at home as indicated above .
