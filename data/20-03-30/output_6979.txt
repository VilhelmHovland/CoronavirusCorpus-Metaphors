" The new dates , exactly one year after those originally planned for 2020 also have the added benefit that any disruption that the postponement will cause to the international sports calendar can be kept to a minimum , in the interests of the athletes and the international federations .

The same heat mitigation measures as planned for 2020 will be implemented .

Humankind currently finds itself in a dark tunnel .
These Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 can be a light at the end of this tunnel .
"  Tokyo 2020 organising committee president Yoshiro Mori said he had proposed the July 23 to August 8 time frame to the IOC , and that Bach had agreed following consultations with the international sports federations .
" A certain amount of time is required for the selection and qualification of athletes and for their training and preparation , and the consensus was that staging the rescheduled Games during the summer vacation in Japan would be preferable , " Mori said .
" In terms of transport , arranging volunteers and the provision of tickets for those in Japan and overseas , as well as allowing for the COVID-19 situation , we think that it would be better to reschedule the Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2021 .
"  International Paralympic Committee president Andrew Parsons added : " When the Paralympic Games do take place in Tokyo next year , they will be an extra-special display of humanity uniting as one , a global celebration of human resilience and a sensational showcase of sport .
" With the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games 512 days away , the priority for all those involved in the Paralympic Movement must be to focus on staying safe with their friends and family during this unprecedented and difficult time .
