It 's a dramatic expansion of the program and comes as the ranks of Canada 's unemployed swell by the day and the prospect of a prolonged economic shutdown well into April to contain the virus .
" This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a business that employs 10 people or a 1,000 people , " Trudeau said during his daily briefing .
The government unveiled new criteria Monday to determine which firms will be eligible .
Any business that has seen a drop of 30 per cent or more in revenue will be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers on the payroll , Trudeau said .
It will also apply to non-profit organizations and charities .
The program will cover 75 per cent up to a salary of $58,700 , paying up to $847 a week and will be backdated to March 15 .
In light of the program 's new , more generous terms , the prime minister urged employers to rehire employees who have already been laid off because of the widespread closures across the economy and where possible , to top up wages to cover the remaining 25 per cent .
He also warned employers not the " game " the program and said there would be consequences for those who do .

" This unprecedented situation calls for unprecedented action and it calls for good faith and trust between everyone involved , " he said .
" If there is abuse , there will be severe consequences for anyone who takes advantage of the system and therefore takes advantage of Canadians , " Trudeau said .
When first unveiled earlier this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a workers ' wage and only small- to medium-sized firms were eligible , sparking criticism from business groups that it was too low to alleviate job losses .
On Friday , the government raised the subsidy to 75 per cent and Monday 's move opened it to more companies .
" It 's a substantial wage subsidy and it looks like it 's broadly applied and those were the most important criteria , " said Dan Kelly , president and CEO of Canadian Federation of Independent Business , which had pushed for changes .
" If governments can cover the wage bill for a period of time or a large chunk of it .
then the business itself has a fighting chance , " Kelly said .
He said businesses are keen to see the detailed criteria .
And he cautioned that some firms forced to close up shop completely wo n't have the financial resources to cover wages while waiting for Ottawa to reimburse them .
" Even with the promise of 75 per cent down the road , if you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to offer you much help , " he said .
Still , Kelly said he was encouraged that the government seems to be using an " honour system " and not requiring detailed paperwork upfront to access the subsidy .
" Getting this sped up fast is super , super critical , " he said .

Even under the best-case scenario , he warned that the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 will see thousands of businesses go under .
Trudeau was unable to say what the cost of the program might be .
Finance Minister Bill Morneau would have additional details on Tuesday , he said .

billion .
Now it could be 10 times that amount .
" These costs keep climbing but I can assure people that our focus right now is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not working at them right now , " Trudeau said .
The prime minister made the announcement on a day when his government was originally scheduled to be delivering its budget .
In a speech just over three weeks ago , Morneau boasted that the country 's debt-to-GDP ratio was expected to continue trending downward .
Now the government is spending on the fly with a promise to work out the costs later .
In a Friday briefing note , Scotiabank economist Rebekah Young estimated the cumulative price tag on deficit spending could top $140 billion or almost seven per cent of GDP with debt levels approaching 40 per cent of GDP .
The wage subsidy program alone could cost at least $42 billion over three months , perhaps higher given Monday 's changes , she said in an interview .
" We 're looking at tens of billions , " said Young , director of fiscal and provincial economics at the bank .
She cautioned that it may also be hard for the government to suddenly withdraw its wage supports until the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus is over in three months -- which I think few scientists think will happen -- it 's really difficult to pull stimulus suddenly , " Young said .
But the price tag of not acting would certainly be higher in terms of its cost on the individuals , businesses and the overall economy .
" There 's that potential of just totally devastating the economy , " Young said .
She noted that household and corporate debt levels have swelled since the 2008 financial crisis , making them all less able to weather a financial upset , raising the spectre of financial ruin if the government did not provide a lifeline .
" You could have a lot of households going bankrupt and a lot of businesses going insolvent , " she said .
The promised funding is n't about stimulus .
It 's about helping Canadians survive , she said .
" This is more about .
bridge financing to make sure no one gets evicted , that they can pay the rent and they can pay their essentials , " Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency subsidy " sizable .
" He estimated the total fiscal cost to come in around $25 billion , noting that while the federal government had not released the official numbers , that total would be " consistent " with the governments ' estimates for the previous 10 per cent wage subsidy .
Page said he expects more Canadians to be unemployed thanks to COVID-19 than the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis .
" The number of unemployed increased by 500,000 in the 2008-09 financial crisis .
We are likely facing a larger increase in unemployed ( now ) , " Page said .
