@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limerick woman 's eviction fears during the coronavirus crisis  AMID the coronavirus , subsequent job losses and money shortages , the necessity of having a home has never felt more relevant .
For many , the possibility of eviction and homelessness have become far more of reality than a month ago .
However , for one young woman living in the city , the fear of eviction is more than just a fear , with her landlord giving her a notice to move out .
" My landlord gave me my notice during the pandemic , " said the woman , who is in her 20s  " I was working in Limerick but out of work because the business is shut .
The landlord gave me just over a month to move out because he 's selling the house .
What a time to push us out .
I have been here for almost two years , " she added .
Recently , the Government announced legislation that contains measures to prevent evictions and implement a rent freeze for the duration of the coronavirus crisis .
Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Covid-19 and said the notice period for tenancies of less than six months is being increased from 28 days to 90 days .
However , the woman , who runs a small business in Limerick , is n't sure whether this will halt her eviction , as it came after her notice to leave .
" It 's awful ! I thought we would get three months before we had to move out .
And thought he might have been more considerate of the current crisis .
He told us by email and gave us 42 days ! "  " It is so inconsiderate ! There are three of us , renting rooms separately .
And one of the guys moved in only about eight weeks ago and he then sent this notice .
I 've been thinking of going to the Private Residential Tenancies Board about it because I think we should have got more notice ! I 'm panicking because we are supposed to be in self-quarantine , so I do n't think letting agencies will be doing viewings .
I 've called about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a bit screwed "  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on 028 7129 6600 for Derry City stories Or 028 7774 3970 for County Derry stories .
