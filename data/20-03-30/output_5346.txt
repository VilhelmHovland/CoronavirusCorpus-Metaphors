If the recent bushfire crisis and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic have taught us anything , it 's that Australia has an opportunity to evaluate its coordination on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief ( HADR ) .
The tumultuous start to 2020 presents two key lessons .
Australia and its ANZUS treaty partners need to work more closely together , and non-traditional security threats need to be factored more heavily into Australia 's military strategy , particularly its naval strategy .
The ANZUS alliance gains enormous benefits from its members ' shared culture and language .
Collaboration between Australia and the US is extensive , with hundreds of Australian Defence Force personnel embedded in the US military .
The ANZUS states would appear to be well placed for greater collaboration on HADR activities in the Asia -- Pacific .
However , an investigation of the extent of cooperation among their militaries reveals that , despite broadly similar regional goals and a shared need for interoperability , strategic coordination on HADR is absent .
All three states are more engaged with building and maintaining individual relationships with states in the Asia -- Pacific .
The failure to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a logistical perspective , and the need for greater HADR cooperation at the military level appears to have fallen under the radar of the media , government and academics .
Cooperation on HADR may not have been seriously considered because , despite the increase in the priority given to HADR by all three national militaries , the response in Australia and New Zealand has often been more reactive than proactive .
And unlike NATO , which maintains a headquarters and has a broad conception of its role as a regional security provider , the ANZUS alliance is largely viewed as a limited instrument of war-making .
The natural interoperability of ANZUS states was evident in their collaboration on fighting Australia 's recent bushfires .
Firefighters from the US reported that it ' had been no trouble to assume their roles and get down to work in a new country .
The incident command system used to fight fires is standardised in all of these countries .
'  By its organisational nature , the military is well suited to be self-sustaining , rapidly mobile and able to coordinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has increasingly regarded HADR as part of its strategy .
Australia has participated in the Pacific Partnership -- which involves the deployment into the region of units from the US Pacific Fleet with a range of government and non-government humanitarian organisations -- since its formation in 2006 .
Australia initially conceptualised an increase in the ADF 's humanitarian activities as part of prosecuting the war on terror .
The 2013 defence white paper included HADR among the stated objectives of Australia 's amphibious capability .
In the 2016 version , the importance of HADR was emphasised in the context of regional relations .
In 2012 the ADF took possession of ADV Ocean Shield , a ship dedicated to HADR missions , and in 2014 and 2015 two Canberra-class multipurpose amphibious ships were acquired whose role includes HADR operations .
Natural disasters can quickly overwhelm the capabilities of local responders .
Lessons learned from previous disasters illustrate the need for robust command and control and communications ; a medical surge capability beyond that available locally ; and a fast and heavy-lift capability for evacuation , decontamination and isolation .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospital ships for HADR needs to be considered more closely .
After the tsunamis in Indonesia and Japan in 2004 and 2005 , the US Navy 's hospital ships Mercy and Comfort were indispensable sources of medical aid and relief .
They have now been deployed to the east and west coasts of the US to assist with the coronavirus responses in New York and California .
As we are witnessing here in Europe , the capacity of local hospitals to deal with coronavirus has already been overwhelmed in some countries .
Although , as ASPI 's Michael Shoebridge notes , hotels and cruise ships may be viable quick-fix alternatives , in terms of preparedness and resilience , hospital ships are well equipped with medical teams and supplies and provide more secure isolation .
Airlift may be the fastest way to deliver medical services , but not if landing sites have been compromised , such as after an earthquake .
Ships , however , can still provide supplies and facilities .
During non-crisis periods , hospital ships can travel to regions in which medical facilities are limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dental examinations .
A general increase in the number of hospital ships capable of serving Australasia and the Asia -- Pacific would be a welcome addition .
As one of the region 's largest and wealthiest states , Australia should consider how its military -- in particular , the navy -- can be better positioned to assist with both domestic and international crises .
