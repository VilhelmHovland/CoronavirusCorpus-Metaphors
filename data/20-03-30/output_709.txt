His daughter , Elizabeth Glascock , said her father spent " a little over a week " at the facility in Northampton County .
He arrived there on March 12 and was taken to a hospital in Virginia on March 20 .
He had an appendectomy on March 23 and was tested for coronavirus at the time because his oxygen levels were so low , Elizabeth Glascock said .
James Glascock had had health issues for months , including heart problems and blood clots in his legs and lungs , according to his daughter .
He had moved among various hospitals and rehabilitation centers .
" They would n't let me in the room , " Elizabeth Glascock said of her father 's final hours , " so me and my mom and my sister and my boyfriend , we stood outside the window , and Dad , he was sedated .
They put the walkie-talkie up to his ear , and I just said that I loved him and that , even though I was n't there , physically , I was right there with him .
" His heart just fluctuated every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she said .
The rest home in Potecasi was identified on Sunday night as the site of a cluster of 24 confirmed cases , which makes up the vast majority of Northampton County 's 26 total confirmed cases .
Pastor Matthew Dupuy of Galatia Baptist Church in Seaboard said Sunday his congregation was providing support to the home , which is not-for-profit .
" They were really short staffed because of people having to stay home because of the virus .
We heard about workers giving selflessly of what they had , " Dupuy told WRAL News .
County leaders said the facility has been " on lockdown " to all visitors and family since March 10 as a precaution .
Only staff and residents were allowed to come in and out .
" My access to the patients is limited because they 've been on lockdown for several weeks , " Dupuy said .
Members of the church and those with family members at Pine Forest Rest Home posted to Facebook to ask for help and support for the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an offer to bring food .
He then activated the church 's phone tree to get others involved , and expanded the call to all the Baptist churches nearby .
" Within a couple of hours , we had the entire weekend filled with lunch and dinner , " he said .
" There are people calling from all over the state wanting to help .
I 'm mean from Charlotte , from Greensboro , from Raleigh , Baptist churches , Methodist churches , non-denominational churches , different businesses .
"  With offers of cash donations coming in , Dupuy saw a way to help struggling local restaurants as well .
He funneled donations to them to pay for meals .
" We 're paying them full price for those meals .
That 's 21 meals for dinner and for lunch , each one of them .
That 's been a big help to those restaurants as well , " he said .
Dupuy had nothing but praise for the staff of Pine Forest Rest Home .
" They 're tired of being locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some by phone .
" I think most of them understand why they have to be locked down , but , you know , it 's been a long few weeks for them .
The staff , their spirits have been lifted by what we 're doing as well .
