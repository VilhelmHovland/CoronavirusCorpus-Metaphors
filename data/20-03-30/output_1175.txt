Why the UK 's startup sector is worth saving  Covid-19 has already destroyed so much .
Lives , livelihoods , freedom of movement .
For those on the frontlines , whether in the NHS , social care or supermarkets , or in the country 's many sick beds , the battle is fierce .
As the dominoes of our economy have tumbled , the government has quickly stepped in .
First to safeguard business .
Then to support workers .
Now to back the self-employed .
Chancellor Rishi Sunak has had the most extraordinary baptism of economic fire .
But one group has so far been left to fend for themselves -- the country 's startups .
They now need help .
For the last 10 years , the UK 's technology ecosystem has grown at a very impressive rate .
Where there was once very little seed-stage investing , the UK is now Europe 's best place to start and get financing for a technology startup .
And it is not just a London phenomenon -- from Bristol to Birmingham , through Leeds and Manchester , to Belfast and Edinburgh , the UK 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aviv and Shanghai .
This has created thousands of well-paid jobs , allowed the UK to be at the forefront of innovation in sectors from financial services ( Monzo , Revolut , Pockit ) , retail and ecommerce ( Ocado , Boohoo ) and cyber ( Darktrace ) , and created a flow of inward investment unparalleled globally .
As Prime Minister Boris Johnson noted in the annual Tech Nation report , technology investment in the UK soaring by 44 per cent to over ? 10bn -- more than France and Germany combined .
Startups have also shown how vital they could be to an eventual viral victory .
Last week we launched Techforce19 , a joint effort between NHS and Public , the venture firm I run , to get the country 's innovator to offer solutions for the Covid-19 frontlines .
In just 24 hours thousands of startups got in touch offering to pivot their product or focus on the challenges identified by NHS experts .
Similar efforts are going on up and down the country .
But all this is now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of progress , destroy countless solid companies and burn through VC as an asset class .
Startups are being hit by a slow-down in orders , closures of offices , problems getting staff .
But unlike other businesses they need fresh capital injections frequently because even the best of the bunch are normally loss-making as they grow .
They are investing in growth and innovations .
This crisis threatens to dry up capital .
Angel investors will likely conserve cash , not least for their own lives .
Many VCs will be under pressure to slow down investing -- either because they do not know how long the crisis will last or because because their investors , so-called limited partners like pension funds of family offices , have taken a bath in equity markets and so may not honour commitments made or be interested in backing new or followup funds .
As the well known investor Fred Destin has said : " Whether we hit pause for two weeks or two months I do n't know yet .
" He is not alone in stopping to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies will undoubtedly come out of the crisis stronger , for example those focused on healthtech and deliveries .
But many companies that have solid business models and no reason not to succeed in a post-vaccine future , will collapse .
Even many companies that are delivering to the NHS right now will struggle .
Because of the short cash runway of many of these companies -- there 's a real risk of a huge number of companies ( 1,324 startups have raised between ? 100,000 and ? 2m in the past two years ) going bust .
This will affect both early stage startups , who may not have found product market fit yet ; or who have and were hoping to raise money on the back of that ; as well as companies who were counting on further rounds of funding to support their growth .
There is a real risk of a triple tumble -- with a slowdown in new companies as people favour secure jobs rather than entrepreneurial risk ; a collapse of many companies that have just gotten going ; and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not now develop .
After the dotcom crisis , it took nearly two years for the taps to be turned on again .
The Treasury has in the course of the crisis become the " Department of Yes " , forced to dole out support to a collapsing economy .
It can understandably not support everyone .
But to survive a crisis it is critical to continue to move forward , to invest in new services , new products .
Stand still and you will move back .
For this reason the government should provide a package of support for the country 's startups .
They are developing the innovations that we will live off in the future as everyone else battles to just keep the status quo .
In practical terms , the government should push for a seizable intervention , following the steps taken by the French and Danish governments .
This is probably a ? 1bn action .
Any solution needs to do several things .
It needs to help the early-stage end of the market ; it needs to support growth-stage companies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Co-investment by the private sector might be part of the solution but it is unwise to assume the same appetite to match funds as in normal times .
It will also be important to work with existing schemes .
This is no time to build new institutions -- although it may be worthwhile supporting new funds .
The British Business Bank , set up during the Cameron administration at Vince Cable 's urging , has supported the UK ecosystem by funding countless venture funds .
This state-owned bank is the best vehicle to distribute funding , support new funds and get money into the hands of startups .
Backing the country 's Silicon Valleys , fens , glens , canals and roundabouts is likely to return money rather than just lose capital , even if returns will be much lower than normally .
Most importantly , it will help ensure that the UK can come out of the crisis having not just survived but with new products and new services to offer a post-Covid-19 market .
