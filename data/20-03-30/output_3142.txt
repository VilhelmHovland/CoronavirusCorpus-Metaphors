Here are the accidental frontline workers keeping food on your table  Ralph Stabile at the Italian Centre Shop in Edmonton ( Photograph by Amber Bracken )  Like many Canadians , you might still be cooking your favourite recipes at home this week .
You might have some extra cans of chickpeas in the cupboard .
You might be stress-baking all the things and running low on all-purpose flour .
But you 're fairly confident you can get more -- maybe even without having to leave your house .
All of this is thanks to your neighbours in the food and grocery industry .
Perhaps you picture men and women in uniform when you think about emergency services -- firefighters ' protective gear , doctors ' scrubs , police officers ' navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or apron of a grocery store cashier , the winter jacket of a truck driver , and the jeans your Uber Eats driver is wearing today .
Essential services are being provided by those stocking ( let 's be honest : re-stocking ) shelves at the supermarket , filling and emptying vast warehouses and dropping off groceries at your front door .
These hundreds of thousands of people never signed up to work on the front lines of a pandemic .
And while companies are raising wages , implementing sanitation measures and installing plexiglass screens at the check-out line , it 's not a stretch to say workers are risking their health to keep Canadian bellies full -- and those of their families .
A Real Canadian Superstore employee in Oshawa , Ont .
tested positive for COVID-19 , according to a March 24 note to customers from Galen Weston , the head of Loblaw Companies Limited , which employs some 190,000 people across 2,500 stores .
That case likely wo n't be the last .
A handful of your local heroes spoke to Maclean 's about what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Usually I try not to be on deliveries , because I like to be in the office and make sure everything runs smoothly , if drivers need support or if something happens on the road .
But at rough times like right now , everybody goes on the road .
Our volumes , recently , with the COVID-19 , grew about 280 per cent .
So it 's stress-testing us pretty hard right now .
We 're all hands on deck .
People are working overtime .
People do need groceries , and the company is in a tough position , so lots of drivers stepped forward and offered .
Drivers are out risking their health .
You have the situation where the door opens and the customer is wearing a mask .
That 's something new right now .
I 'm worried , a little bit , but with safe techniques , like using gloves , social distancing , hopefully we can avoid the virus .
It 's obviously a concern .
Especially as the volumes grow , it 's pressure on everybody .
most businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , are medical workers and groceries .
Because people need to be healthy , and people need to eat .
We 're kind of used to chaos in this business , to be honest -- not this chaos .
But this boom right now is beneficial for the growth of the online grocery business , and for the safety of people .

Refrigerator truck driver , Erb Transport  I was on the road for 15 days .
I came home for just over 24 hours and I had to go back out and do a short emergency run , a load of frozen meals down to Nestle in Ohio .
And then I picked up in Pennsylvania , for Papa John 's in Kitchener , Ontario , and Whitby .
I was the only one allowed on their loading dock .
They kept six feet distance from me while I was on there , made me step away every time they came around .
Once we were loaded , the only concern was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bacteria or virus , that it 's frozen out .
When I was in Arkansas before that , they would n't open up the warehouse window .
I had to talk to them through the glass .
talks about self-isolation .
Right now , I feel more self-isolated when I 'm out on the road .
In truck stops , our drivers ' lounges and restaurant seating that 's inside -- none of that is open .
They do n't kick you out , but it 's posted everywhere .
So when you go in , you use the washroom , you buy whatever and you 're back out in your truck .
I 'll say hi to others , but that 's about it .
There literally is no one congregating right now .
They stay away from each other .
Right now , being told you 're essential service , it puts pressure on everyone that we 're doing everything properly .
We have protocol for everything like food safety , and we always have .
What we 're hauling , we still hold the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants us there as quick as possible .
And you 've got to stay safe on the roads .
-- as told to Jason Markusoff  Henry : My brother , Joseph , and I used to have at least one day off a week , now we have no days off .
I 'd say we 're getting about double the amount of customers per day .
We are n't limiting the amount of people in the store , but we 've changed our hours .
Usually we 're open from 7 a .
to midnight ; now we 're open from 7 a .
to 8 p .
It 's still hard to keep a distance in the market though .
I 'll be stocking apples or other produce , and people come up behind me with questions .
We just put down tape to keep people separate when they 're waiting to pay , because some people do n't understand social distancing .
We 're a family business , and I am worried about the risk for my family -- especially my mom , who works at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't washing my hands 10 times a day before , but now I am .
I wear gloves and we have sanitizer by the cash .
My mom wears a mask .
I do n't , though .
I thought about it , but I heard that you should only wear it if you 're sick , so I do n't think a mask would help me right now .
We knew owning a store could be dangerous .
Before the pandemic , we had a few customers that tried stealing from us .
That was the main threat .
Now our biggest concern is this virus .
Joseph:It 's getting more wild in here ; less sleep , more stress .
We have to maintain the quality of product that we have in the store to satisfy our customers .
At the same time , we have customers who are coughing almost every day and we have to stay a safe distance from them -- it 's scary .
My mom is nervous for me and my brother .
We lie to her , which is not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from calling every five minutes .
Like Henry , I decided not to wear a mask .
I find that if I wear one , customers are n't able to hear me , or people might be scared that I have the virus .
My brother and I live with my mom and we talk about the pandemic almost every night .
I ca n't think about it too much , though , because I have to be at work .

Cash manager , No Frills  I distinctly remember Thursday , March 12 , the day after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a pandemic .
I had the closing shift and when I got in , I was told things had been nuts all day .
It was the busiest I 've ever seen our store , like Christmas and New Year 's times 10 .
People were waiting up to an 1 .
hours to pay for their groceries and we were totally cleaned out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been at this No Frills for two years and we implemented increased cleaning practices a few weeks back .
Cashiers used to clean their station every hour , and between customers when it 's not busy .
Now we aim to clean the stations every 20 to 30 minutes .
When I 'm not on cash , I also sanitize things like freezer door handles and anything else customers touch .
Social distancing is still a struggle though , because cashiers and customers stand less than a metre apart .
Since that Thursday , things have calmed down a lot .
We still get quite a few customers , but the store seems eerily empty .
With everything that 's happening , I am the slightest bit nervous .
I avoid touching my face and I wash my hands and sanitize as often as I can , especially after I touch cash .
I know that I need to operate differently than before , but I 'm trying not to let that scare me .
I 'm just going to do what I can to get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ishani Nath  ( Photograph by Jennifer Roberts )  Vanessa Vedia , 38Toronto , Ont .
Food delivery , UberEats  I only started driving for UberEats about two months ago , and it 's saving my butt right now .
I run a photography and videography business , but with COVID-19 , almost all of my projects have been cancelled .
My current freelance work only pays my rent , so I rely on deliveries to cover groceries and feeding my dogs .
When I first started driving for UberEats , I 'd usually work the lunch hour from around 11 a .
to 5 p .
In two hours , I 'd get about six calls and be delivering non-stop , making around $50 , but things have really slowed down .
The other day , I drove around for four hours and made that same amount -- and despite everything , customers still rarely tip .
People seem afraid to order food .
Even the restaurant employees I pick up from are concerned for my safety because , while they 're isolated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
When I pick up deliveries , I have restaurant employees place the order directly into my thermal carrier and then have the customer take it out of the bag , so I never touch it .
I figure that 's safer for the customers , and for me .
I 'm also getting one or two no-contact deliveries per day .
I use gloves and hand sanitizer while I 'm working .
I keep thinking that as long as I do n't touch anything , I 'll be okay .
Driving for UberEats was only meant to be temporary , until my freelance work picked up again .
If there was something else I could do for that extra income , where I would n't have to be on the frontline , I would stop .
-- as told to Ishani Nath  " We 're definitely busier .
Some of the items we sell , it could be 10 times as much as what we would typically do .
We sell frozen bakery items , so , bread and what not .
Canned goods , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that .
We 're probably overall up about 25 per cent , as far as our volume leaving the warehouse .
A big part of our business is retail .
We sell everything from local grocery stores to regional chains and some larger chains throughout Western Canada .
I 've been doing this for 13 years now .
I 've never seen anything like this .
It 's changing so fast .
We have delivery vehicles on the road where we 're basically having to change their plans throughout the day , simply because we 'll get word that customers are closing due to the virus .
For our smaller restaurants and local customers , some of it 's actually declined .
A lot of these places are closing daily .
There 's going to be a demand for what we do , so everyone seems to be buying in .
We 're the end of that supply chain , so as long as we keep doing what we 're doing , our customers are going to keep getting their products .
At this point we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose spouses or partners have been laid off because they 're working retail and in other sectors .
Everyone knows that what we 're doing is important .
There 's a reason why we 're going to keep going .
We 're willing to do whatever it takes .

Buyer , Italian Centre  Everybody is panicked .
The last two weeks have been crazy .
People have been buying left and right all kinds of stuff , pasta , oil , they clean us out .
It 's calming down a little bit , but there 's still some shortages .
We bring fresh cheese from Italy , but the cuts in flights means we do n't know if we 're going to get them .
We try to keep the customers happy .
Stock-wise , we 're still okay .
We follow the rules with how to serve customers , we 're very careful , we have sanitizer all over the place .
And if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Any work where we have to serve the public , yes we could be in danger , but if we have to be here to serve the customers or clients , we try to do our best .
I feel good , thank God .
My own family lives near Naples .
Their neighbourhood is not that bad yet -- the biggest hit is Northern Italy , Rome and up , that 's where the big problem is .
For now , my family is okay .
They 're isolated , they do n't go out .
Watching the news , you see a lot of deaths in Italy .
It 's bad all over the place .
As Italians , but also Canadians , we try to help each other .
We pray all together , and hopefully everything is going to get better soon .
Not just for Italians but everyone else .
We can not see what 's coming tomorrow .

supervisor , Sobey 's  I help run the dairy frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that kind of stuff .
The store has definitely gotten busier for sure , but my role stays the same because we do the best we can everyday for our community .
We 're just trying to provide , keep spirits high , keep people from panicking .
We have wipes at the front , we wipe carts and baskets down and ensure everything stays sanitized , and we 're washing our hands .
We 're trying to maintain a distance from customers but still make sure that they know we 're here for them .
Even a greeting with a smile -- people really respect that at this moment .
We 're all in this together , so we just want to keep everyone calm .
The customers have been amazing .
They 're thanking us constantly when walking by , and we ca n't high-five so we 're elbowing them .
I 've worked in three different stores and I 've never seen a team that 's come together more than this one right now .
From how I look at it , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I would want the same treatment for my family .
So , we 're treating people with the utmost respect .
And the team is still laughing , they 're still carrying on .
You just have to keep the spirits high .
We can conquer this .
