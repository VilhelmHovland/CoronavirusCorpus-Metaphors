The Bulletin : Nurse tests positive amid wider workforce fears  Good morning and welcome to The Bulletin .
In today 's edition : Queenstown nurse tests positive for Covid-19 , more detail emerges on case clusters , and NZers in Australia score moderate victory .
A Queenstown nurse has tested positive for Covid-19 , bringing to light wider fears of health workers .
The Otago Daily Times reports the nurse worked at the Lakes District Hospital , where there have been several Covid-19 patients in recent days .
However , that particular staff member had not treated those patients directly , so an investigation is currently underway as to how they contracted the virus .
Other staff are also being tested , and are in self-isolation as a precaution .
For the system as a whole , these sorts of incidents bring to light fears that the workforce could face staffing shocks at unexpected moments .
After the country 's first Covid-19 death , 21 staff members at Greymouth 's hospital had to go into self-isolation , after treating the patient who they originally thought had influenza , rather than the coronavirus .
Radio NZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the gaps on the West Coast .
In this instance , they 'll be able to manage .
But rural areas and smaller centres are at huge risk of such incidents , because staffing levels start at a much lower base .
Nurses and other health professionals also have very real fears of what is to come .
One nurse spoke to The Spinoff candidly and anonymously about their last few weeks have been like , and their fears that if a major outbreak were to happen New Zealand could go the way of Italy .
Community healthcare workers are also deeply worried , particularly with a lack of PPE available to them , with a group telling Newsroom that they 're worried they could become carriers of the virus and bring it back to their own families , among other concerns .
Stuff reports the ministry of health is currently scrambling to set up new distribution networks for PPE , amid anecdotal reports that some parts of the country did n't have enough .
Even with those fears , the health workforce is still stepping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are staying through this crisis .
But it also includes the more than 6000 health professionals who were n't in the workforce who have put their hands up to return , including those who have recently retired .
It 's a remarkable display of selflessness and service .
And you 're probably getting bored of hearing this message again and again , but it still stands .
You can do something to help these health workers , by staying at home and not putting yourself at risk of catching Covid-19 -- or in fact not doing anything to put yourself at risk of needing medical attention at all .
Because there are going to be a lot of us -- through no fault of their own -- who will need to get treatment for all sorts of conditions and illnesses over the coming months , and the health system has to be able to handle them all .
Just quickly , a message from our editor Toby Manhire :  " Here at The Spinoff , members ' support is more important than ever as the Covid-19 crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a tight time for everyone , of course , but if you 're able to , please consider joining Spinoff Members to help us stay afloat and keep producing work by the likes of Siouxsie Wiles and Toby Morris , whose collaborations have had a real impact in New Zealand and around the world .
"  More detail is emerging around some of the clusters of Covid-19 that have popped up .
Two of the stories really reinforce the need for social gatherings to be cancelled right now .
Radio NZ reports the cluster in Matamata is mostly linked to a single St Patrick 's Day celebration in a bar .
And the Dominion Post 's Tom Hunt has a rather colourful report on a cluster centred around a wedding in Wellington .
Meanwhile , the largest cluster by far , around Marist College in Auckland , is now up to 47 confirmed and probable cases .
A moderate victory for New Zealanders living in Australia and hoping for government support : They will be eligible for a huge new wage subsidy , which is aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Cooke at Stuff .
But as the story also notes , most unemployed New Zealanders over there will still be barred from accessing welfare payments , even if until recently they were paying taxes .
Supermarkets have been warned that a new email alert system has been set up for the public to make price gouging complaints .
The details on this story can be found in yesterday 's live updates page , and the email address is pricewatch@mbie .
govt .
Supermarkets have consistently denied they 're putting prices up to cash in on their monopoly over the food supply market , and Business Desk ( paywalled ) has reported comments from Foodstuffs North Island CEO Chris Quin , who says the sector is at risk of unfair scrutiny .
" The media only have two topics to talk about at the moment : coronavirus and supermarkets .
There is nothing else in the news , " he said .
Guidelines on funerals and tangihanga have been changed after consultation with Maori , reports Te Manu Korihi .
It followed concerns that the previous guidelines were far too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a breach of tikanga .
The guidelines have only been relaxed slightly , they still apply only to those within the bubble of the deceased , and regional travel is still out .
But the new rules give more of an opportunity to grieve properly , says funeral director Francis Tipene , who consulted on the changes .
Landlords who are considering offering hard-up tenants a reduction in rent are being discouraged by a nationwide property management company , reports Radio NZ 's Robin Martin .
The move from Property Brokers has appalled tenancy advocates , who say it goes totally against the call from government for people to be kind to each other amid the global pandemic , and the economic disruption it is causing .
Even some other property investors say it 's a weird call , given the offers are being freely made by landlord to tenants in need .
On this issue , it 's worth reading this opinion piece from Metro 's Tess Nichol calling for an expansion of imagination around tenancy relationships , particularly in times of economic crisis .
We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launching on The Spinoff today , put together by the brilliant Chris McDowall .
They break down exactly how this outbreak can be measured -- from sources of transmission , country of origin for cases , the split between confirmed and probable cases , and more .

For a feature today , an article about the death toll of Covid-19 in China , and whether the official version is accurate .
It comes from Radio Free Asia , which some see as an American propaganda outlet , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really compelling is the use of detail to illustrate why doubts are being raised , rather than just general mistrust of a government that is n't often truly open with information .
Here 's an excerpt :  Another popular estimate is based on the cremation capacity of the funeral homes , which run a total of 84 furnaces with a capacity over 24 hours of 1,560 urns city-wide , assuming that one cremation takes one hour .
This calculation results in an estimated 46,800 deaths .
A resident of Hubei province , of which Wuhan is the capital , said most people there now believe that more than 40,000 people died in the city before and during the lockdown .
" Maybe the authorities are gradually releasing the real figures , intentionally or unintentionally , so that people will gradually come to accept the reality , " the resident , who gave only his surname Mao , said .
In sport , a terribly sad day for the media industry that covers it .
With no warning given to listeners or staff , Radio Sport was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closed indefinitely .
I 've reported on it here .
It comes amid a massive crunch for the media amid Covid-19 , and sport being particularly hard hit with competitions cancelled all over the world .
I will miss the station terribly as a listener , and would urge any media organisation with a budget for new hiring to move quickly and get Radio Sport 's people on the books -- they really are champions at what they do .
