Kelly wants out of prison amid coronavirus fears  R .
Kelly is asking to be released from prison over coronavirus concerns .
The ' Ignition ' hitmaker is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Chicago , Illinois , after being arrested on several sex crime charges , but his legal team have filed paperwork to have him released , because of the risk he might catch coronavirus - which is also known as COVID-19 - if he stays in the facility .
In papers filed in US District Court in Chicago , his lawyers claim the 52-year-old singer is within the category of people described as high-risk by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention , and therefore should be allowed to self-isolate away from other prisoners .
The filing also claims that sanitiser and soap are scarce in the Metropolitan Correctional Center , where the majority of inmates are kept in small , two-person cells that make social distancing difficult .
Kelly 's lawyers state : " The visitor 's bathroom on the entry-level floor of the MCC frequently has no soap or paper towels available , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean their hands before visiting .
" The courts have long recognised that there is no greater necessity than keeping a defendant alive , no matter the charge .
"  A judge is yet to rule on the singer 's motion , but according to the Chicago Tribune , prosecutors in New York have asked that he remain jailed .
Earlier this month , it was reported Kelly was having difficulty meeting with his legal team , as the Metropolitan Correctional Center had suspended visits for 30 days in an attempt to keep coronavirus at bay .
The ' I Believe I Can Fly ' hitmaker is facing multiple charges in various states , including Chicago and New York , for crimes including sex trafficking , racketeering and child pornography .
Kelly has maintained his innocence and denied all charges against him .
