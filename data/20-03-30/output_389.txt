* * *  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida is doubling every three days , putting the state on a trajectory to see tens of thousands of infections in the coming weeks , a Tampa Bay Times analysis shows .
No rigorous model has been calculated for Florida to predict the disease 's spread in detail .
Those usually take months to create .
But at this point , experts say the math is simple .
The number of cases is already past the point of easy containment and infections are growing faster and faster , at what statisticians call an exponential rate .
Without dramatic steps , they worry that the epidemic will balloon across Florida and place an unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a University of Florida research scientist who specializes in disease modeling and has been advising the state on the outbreak , said that while epidemiologists might disagree on the nuances of their projections , they all agree on the main point .
" We do understand the math and the models well enough to say with great confidence that Florida is going to have a huge public health crisis , " Hladish said .
" And we are just at the beginning of it right now .
"  By 11 a .
Saturday , Florida had reported more than 3,700 cases -- an increase of nearly 1,000 in 24 hours .
Florida remains one of the few states with a large outbreak not to issue a statewide order to keep residents at home .
Several counties across the state , including Hillsborough and Pinellas , issued " safer at home " orders in the last week .
Some public health experts say it will take the more extreme step of shutting down the state to halt the disease 's rapid spread in Florida .
Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for the same thing .
The effects of the intervention would n't be apparent right away .
The same is true for the smaller steps that have already been taken in Florida , like social distancing or closing restaurants and fitness studios .
" We are not going to see the benefits for a few weeks , which is frustrating to everyone , " said Dr .
Mary Jo Trepka , an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at Florida International University .
That 's because the statistics take time to catch up with the actual magnitude of the epidemic .
The reason for the lag is twofold .
People who get sick from the virus do n't typically show immediate symptoms of the illness it causes , COVID-19 .
Research by Johns Hopkins shows 50 percent of patients take five days or longer to develop symptoms .
And people often wait another few days to get tested .
The testing process can add extra delays .
Cases show up in the data only after a positive test .
Some labs are providing results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more .
A Hillsborough County administrator said that results there were taking eight days or longer to process .
And the BayCare Health System , one of the leading providers of tests in the Tampa Bay area , has said its results are n't coming back for about a week .
Deaths , which climbed past 50 Saturday morning , take longer to appear in the data .
The people who died recently were likely exposed to the virus in early March .
" What we are seeing today is where the epidemic was three weeks ago , " said Jos ? Szapocznik , a professor of public health sciences at the University of Miami 's Miller School of Medicine .
None of the information is captured if people with the disease are n't tested .
Even though providers across Florida ramped up testing last week , the state has performed only about 40,000 tests .
New York leads the country with more than 146,000 , according to the COVID Tracking Project .
In Florida , as in the nation , the number of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , the Times analysis shows .
Experts say the low volume of testing nationwide -- and the fact that different states have different criteria for who they will test -- has made it difficult to get a handle of the size of the epidemic and make state-to-state comparisons .
Without more robust data in Florida , it 's impossible to know how many cases are actually out there .
But knowing the reported numbers are an undercount does n't change the alarming shape of the state 's curve .
On some recent days , reports of new cases in Florida have been accelerating as quickly as they were in New York .
New York has become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States .
By Saturday afternoon , the state had logged more than 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths .
While the epidemic has progressed differently in the two states and New York has more population density , experts say there 's no reason to expect the number of cases in Florida wo n't continue spiking in a similar fashion .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , we 'll be like New York , " said Szapocznik , who believes a statewide stay-at-home order is necessary .
Reaching New York levels would mean not only a wave of sickness , but a crush of patients in the state 's intensive care units .
Some New York hospitals are already approaching capacity .
" Think about it : The hospitals stop functioning because they are overwhelmed .
They ca n't be able to take care of regular patients , " said Robyn Gershon , a clinical professor of epidemiology at New York University 's School of Global Public Health .
