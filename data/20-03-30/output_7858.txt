President Donald Trump on Sunday said limiting the U .
death toll to 100,000 would constitute a " good job , " and that his administration has lowered the number of potential deaths from earlier estimates of more than 2 million .
" If we could hold that down as we 're saying to 100,000 , that 's a horrible number , maybe even less .
" So we have between 100,000 and 200,000 ; we all together have done a very good job , " Trump said during a news conference .
Trump said his previous comment that he wanted the country open by the April 12 Easter holiday was " aspirational " .
" Easter should be the peak number and it should start coming down and hopefully very substantially from that point , " he added .
