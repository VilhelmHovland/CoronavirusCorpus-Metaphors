Tony **26;1193;TOOLONG  Utilities typically use 1,000-kilowattt hour residential bills as a benchmark , but electricity consumption varies widely .
Also , Gulf 's business customers would receive a one-time savings in May , though commercial rates are designed differently than residential rates .
Gulf has about 470,000 customers in eight counties in Northwest Florida .
Gulf and FPL are part of NextEra Energy , Inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rooted in a process that utilities go through to pay for fuel and recoup money from customers .
Each year , utilities project their fuel costs , with those projected expenses then passed along to customers in the subsequent year .
If fuel costs are far lower -- or far higher -- than expected , they can be adjusted mid-year on customers ' bills .
Utilities are not supposed to make profits on fuel costs .
The Gulf Power and FPL plans are similar to a proposal that Tampa Electric Co .
filed at the Public Service Commission last week .
Tampa Electric pointed to a nearly $131 million " over-recovery " from customers expected this year because of low natural-gas costs .
The proposal would pass along chunks of fuel-cost savings to Tampa Electric customers from June through August and then smaller savings through the rest of the year .
That would be done by giving customers credits on their bills from June through August for over-recovered amounts .
The savings during the rest of the year would reflect the remaining projected lower fuel costs .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the proposal during a May 5 meeting and said it could help provide bigger savings this summer as customers struggle with the effects of the coronavirus .
" Tampa Electric hopes to aid customers during this unique time in our history , given the pandemic , by returning the over-recovery amount more quickly than would typically be done , " the filing said .
