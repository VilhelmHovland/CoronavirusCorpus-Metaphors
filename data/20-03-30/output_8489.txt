SHANGHAI -- China 's army of electric-vehicle startups were once positioned to put China at the head of the global EV revolution , but the coronavirus and struggles before the pandemic threaten ruin for dozens of them .
With lucrative state subsidies set to end soon and private capital drying up , hard-pressed startups are now chasing funding to keep afloat .
" We do need to get investment very quickly , " said Huang Ximing , a former Ford Motor Co .
and General Motors Co .
employee who founded Bordrin Motors , an EV startup based in the city of Nanjing .
Huang had lined up meetings with potential investors -- most importantly with the government of Tianjin , a port city near Beijing -- early this year as he sought a financial lifeline .
" But the virus disrupted that , " he said .
" We hoped to close deals in February , but nobody could work .
"  It has been a sharp reversal of fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , the startups had once looked unstoppable .
By early 2019 , the country had 635 of them , according to the government-backed NEV State Monitoring Center , some promising to reinvent the automobile just as Apple Inc .
transformed the cellphone .
But there is little to show for all the hype .
Most of China 's EV startups have yet to make a single production car , and the few that have are n't selling nearly enough to survive .
China 's EV subsidies previously filled the gap left by meager sales , but those are now due to end this year , while most private investors have grown disillusioned .
Market conditions have also conspired against them .
EV startups had been banking on a fast ramp-up in 2020 sales to generate some much-needed cash flow .
But after EV sales in China declined 4% to 1 .
million vehicles last year as an unprecedented downturn gripped the auto sector , the coronavirus , hitting consumer confidence , has further crushed demand .
Auto sales could fall 25% year-over-year in the first half of 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday the Ministry of Commerce said it was planning stimulus measures for the sector , including EV promotions .
Dozens of new electric-vehicle models are expected to arrive at dealerships in the next few years .
We followed eight Wall Street Journal reporters in four countries to see if they , and the world , are ready to make the switch .
While local startups have struggled to make an impression , Tesla Inc .
and several established auto makers , notably BYD Co .
, have been ramping up their EV sales , suggesting the startups may have missed their chance .
" Call it game over for most EV startups in China , " said Michael Dunne , chief executive of consulting firm ZoZoGo .
" Without fresh funding most will simply grind to a halt .
"  NIO Inc .
, China 's best-known EV startup , sold 20,565 cars last year -- more than any of its startup peers -- but lost $1 .
billion in the process , with a negative 9 .
margin on each vehicle sold .
NIO has cut costs and slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start delivering positive margins in the second quarter , the company said in response to questions .
NIO and other startups -- once champions of Chinese private-sector innovation -- are now turning to the one entity that is still prepared to bankroll many EV companies : the Chinese state .
In February , NIO announced a preliminary agreement with the government of Hefei , a city 300 miles west of Shanghai .
Hefei would provide funding in return for NIO moving its headquarters there and deepening its relationships with local companies , chiefly JAC Motors , a state-owned auto maker that already assembles NIO 's cars .
Local governments in China have a history of making risky bets on EV companies , seeing them as a means to modernize fusty local car makers and support the economy through jobs and taxes , " even if it means financial losses , " said Mr .
Dunne .
Huang 's Bordrin is beating a similar path to the government 's door .
The company has already burned through roughly $300 million developing EVs at research-and-development centers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese EV startups were founded by people with little car-making know-how , Bordrin , staffed by experienced auto professionals , has built a high-quality EV from the ground up , said Mr .
Huang , who started the company in 2016 .
That quality will win over customers , even though Bordrin 's brand is little-known , he said .
Bordrin 's first car , a $28,000 electric crossover resembling Tesla 's Model Y is also relatively affordable compared with Tesla 's locally built Model 3 , which starts at around $42,300 .
That will all count for nothing , though , without a big cash injection to fund mass production .
Numerous startups have faltered at this capital-intensive stage , developing a nice-looking EV that never gets built .
While formal bankruptcies are rare in China 's auto sector , the country is already home to many zombie EV companies that have effectively failed .
Bordrin needs to sell between 50,000 and 100,000 cars a year to start making a profit , but with the coronavirus complicating his plans , Mr .
Huang said manufacturing wo n't start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now hinges on the success of the talks under way with the government of Tianjin .
Money is already tight : Mr .
Huang said payments to some staff and suppliers have been delayed .
The company 's EV development has n't been affected , he said , but mass production demands a massive funding boost .
To help persuade Tianjin officials , Mr .
Huang last year formed a joint venture with Tianjin FAW Xiali Automobile Co .
, a struggling local auto maker .
Building Bordrin 's EVs there would potentially safeguard about 1,000 jobs and stoke the local economy -- provided Tianjin foots the bill .
