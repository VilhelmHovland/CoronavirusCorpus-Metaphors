South Africans will not be allowed to run or take their dogs for a walk in their estates or complexes during the unprecedented 21-day lockdown , and can not use communal gardens , the South Africa police service ( SAPS ) confirmed .
South Africa locked down on Friday , forcing most business to close and people to stay at home , in a bid to slow down the spread of the deadly coronavirus in the country .
National police spokesperson Brig Vish Naidoo has , however , said that the national disaster declaration is clear that people be confined to their place of residence , unless they are an essential service , buying goods , collecting a social grant , or seeking medical attention .
Naidoo said the roads , parks and other amenities of the estate do not form part of anyone 's " place of residence " , and is therefore strictly prohibited .
This also includes communal areas such as gardens and parking lots in complexes , Naidoo told Business Insider South Africa .
He said it is a criminal offence to not comply with these regulations .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general manager Paul Burchell said everyone residing in the estate should stay in their homes , including children and live-in staff , according to the regulations .
" There may be no walking around our streets and no gathering of people in groups at all , in any common area .
This also means no leaving home to exercise or to walk dogs ( or other pets ) , " Burchell said .
He said the only visitors allowed into the estate will be food and medicine deliveries , caregivers for the elderly and other essential services .
Sectional title specialist Graham Paddock said that managing agents and trustees do not have the power to tell owners they can not use it , or can only use it for access .
