Could loss of smell or taste be a symptom of COVID-19 ?  With healthcare professionals working overtime across the world to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus , doctors in several countries are now noting that the sudden loss of taste and smell may be a previously under-reported symptom of the virus .
Known as anosmia and dysgeusia in medical circles , the loss of smell and an altered sense of taste , respectively , are common temporary medical conditions .
Anosmia can be caused by the common cold and over 200 other viruses that cause upper respiratory tract infections , according to ENT UK , an organisation of ear , nose , and throat doctors in the UK .
While you should still watch out for those symptoms of COVID-19 already pinpointed by the CDC ( including fever , coughing or trouble breathing ) , doctors are hopeful that this discovery will help identify more cases and lead more people to self-isolate who do n't have other symptoms of the virus .
