Patients at the hospital who have tested positive for the virus with pneumonia symptoms may be offered remdesivir , an antiviral drug created to fight the Ebola and Marburg viruses , said Dr .
Richard Larson , the executive vice chancellor at the UNM Health Sciences Center .
UNMH patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 but do n't have pneumonia symptoms also can be part of a clinical trial .
In that trial , patients will be treated with a combination of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin , an antibiotic , according to the release .
Neither clinical trial will give patients a placebo , Larson said .
" The way we set up this clinical trial there is not a placebo arm .
Some scientists would say that 's not as scientifically rigorous , but we have taken the position on this clinical trial that it 's better to see if it works and compare it to historical outcomes , " he said .
" If the drug turns out to be effective we do n't want to force people onto a trial arm where they could n't get it .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pulmonary , Critical Care and Sleep Medicine , will be a lead investigator on both studies .
" We are working actively with Gilead ( Sciences , Inc .
