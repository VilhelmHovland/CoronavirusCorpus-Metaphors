This is a coronavirus themed video edited together by Vimeo user Cut To Black using a ton of different pop culture shows and movies .
Like a dog toy between me and the fridge in the dark , I half assumed it was going to be a turd , but it was actually a pretty great edit .
That dog toy ? It really was a turd , and I was dumb enough to kick it trying to convince myself it was a toy .
Keep going for the video while I applaud Jack Torrance and his family for really doing the social distancing thing right .
Thanks to hairless , who agrees with loan rates so low there 's never been a better time to buy an apocalypse bunker .
