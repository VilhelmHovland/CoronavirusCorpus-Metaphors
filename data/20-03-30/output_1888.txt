It 's been a rather tumultuous time for the world , as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to run rampant across many nations .
In an interesting turn of events , however , an unlikely hero seems to have taken up the rallying cry to raise the spirits of those quarantined at home : video games .
This is part of a new campaign kickstarted by World Health Organisation ( WHO ) , called #PlayApartTogether , to encourage people to pick up gaming controllers , keyboards and handhelds alike to play games together , but in their separate homes ( via Business Wire ) .

Joining the campaign by WHO are 18 video game companies , who will be stepping up their efforts in raising awareness to play more video games in wake of this trying period .
The companies involved in the initiative are :  Activision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Glu Mobile  Jam City  Kabam  Maysalward  Playtika  Pocket Gems  Riot Games  SciPlay  Snap Games  Twitch  Unity  Wooga  YouTube Gaming  Zynga  " We 're at a crucial moment in defining outcomes of this pandemic , " said WHO ambassador for global strategy , Ray Chambers in a recent statement on Twitter .
" Games industry companies have a global audience -- we encourage all to #PlayApartTogether .
More physical distancing + other measures will help to flatten the curve + save lives .

" It 's never been more critical to ensure people stay safely connected to one another , " said Activision Blizzard CEO , Bobby Kotick , in a statement of his own .
" Games are the perfect platform because they connect people through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proud to participate in such a worthwhile and necessary initiative .
"  While 18 video game companies does n't seem like a lot at first glance , given there are so many big names out there that are n't on this list , it would n't be fair to rule out that there are n't a lot of titles involved in the campaign .
Activision Blizzard , alone , has the likes of World of Warcraft , Call of Duty : Warzone , Call of Duty : Mobile , and Overwatch , to keep players preoccupied .
Riot Games , likewise , have League of Legends , Teamfight Tactics , and Legends of Runeterra , which have largely consistent player bases as well .
