COVID-19 : The Joys of Silence and Coming Together  Share this :  Did it take a virus to bring out the human side in us -- which we were losing at a rapid pace as we had begun to distance ourselves emotionally from people more and more while indulging in a virtual world 24 ? 7 ?  Not noticing the morning breeze that caressed our faces or bothering to listen to the birds in the trees or even to the silence -- which if heard , felt and seen would show us a thousand things , right from the soundless blossoming of a flower to the crack of an egg as the life in it comes out with an unsteady step .
Or the clouds playing jazz in the sky .
Or the rustle of a leaf blown in from somewhere by the wind that dances with carefree abandon on your terrace .
Today , I believe I have all the time in the world to sit , watch and enjoy this incredible plethora of things that have been happening all along all around me and that I have been blind and deaf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media , it is incredible how at the end of the day , you simply do not want any more of it and would rather listen to sounds you never cared for , sights that never mattered .
As I look out and see an empty road , I also see a lone man feeding stray dogs in the sweltering afternoon sun .
As I open my WhatsApp , I find an appeal from a friend asking me to donate money to help out health workers and policemen who are out there where the action .
I look at my workaholic husband who seems retired now and has strangely begun to follow the sprouting of a seed and its journey into a plant as it uncoils itself bit by bit , centimetre by centimetre everyday .
I look at my son who does n't crib anymore about the football or the cricket matches he is missing .
he who has instead taken to watching YouTube and memorising new recipes to try out with his dad .
I have n't been able to see my mother , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three weeks -- something that has never happened before .
I have a bad cough and I do not want to pass it to her .
And yet , I do not find her complaining or hinting that she is bored because none of us takes for granted , this fact , this absolute blessing , that we are safe at least for the moment for the time being -- not even my eight-year-old .
And each one of us individually and alone is reaching out metaphorically .
Sitting down as a family to have a meal together , watching Hrishikesh Mukherjee films on Netflix , witnessing a business tycoon slowly yet unmistakably transforming into a responsible father , learning small ways to manage the house ; and my mind wanders to my domestic help and how this lockdown would be like some rare gift -- that welcome paid vacation which she may never have had or even imagined in her entire life .
And how , at this moment , instead of sweating in someone 's kitchen , she is actually having the same kind of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all grown up , acting responsible , asking me if I have gargled , drunk enough water , washed my hands with soap that generates more lather ( not the other one ) , getting a paper towel and a sanitiser to clean my laptop and my phone .
Sometimes I am a part of the banter and sometimes when all goes quiet , I listen to that which can neither be seen nor heard , not if you do not pay enough attention .
And I imagine the sounds that go with the signs of life thriving , asserting itself , affirming its existence , willing to live and exist despite everything .
If you listen carefully , you might be able to hear it too since there are n't many cars out there to distract you .
And then you will hear the Earth breathing , heaving a long held sigh of relief as she feels unburdened , smiling secretly because her long-standing petition has finally been heard .
COVID-19 , a virus that does not differentiate on religious or ethnic or class grounds , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in death , destruction , misery and worldwide chaos and lockdown , but it has also taught us a lesson that generations to come will remember -- do n't run too fast because you might not be able to stop yourself before you hit the edge of the cliff .
It has taught us that sometimes it 's nice to stop by the woods on a snowy evening and you can excuse yourself for doing it even if you have miles to go .
It has reminded us that it is supremely rewarding to simply stand and stare at the marvel all around us -- which we neither conceived nor created but were hell bent on destroying .
COVID-19 is perhaps Mother Earth 's way of telling us , ' Enough is enough .
You are grounded indefinitely .
