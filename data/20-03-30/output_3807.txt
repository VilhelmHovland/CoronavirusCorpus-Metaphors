These days , it can often be difficult to find good news .
The past few weeks have seen Instagram , Facebook , and Twitter feeds awash with fears around the coronavirus outbreak - the rapidly growing numbers of cases , the stretched thin frontline staff , the notices of those who have sadly passed away .
And yet amidst all of the anxiety and uncertainty , some people are doing their bit to bring a bit of relief to our timelines in whatever way they can .
One of them is illustrator Jeri Mahon .
The artist behind Instagram account Dubliner Doodles , she has been creating custom illustrations for people who might need a pick-me-up amid the Covid-19 pandemic .
On March 17 , she posted an illustration to mark a St Patrick 's Day where the streets were empty and the celebrations had waned .
A single shamrock held between two pieces of string attached to two separate hands , the drawing was positioned above the text : ' N ? neart go cur le ch ? ile ' .
There is no strength without unity .
A reminder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit that still exists among communities , Jeri 's shamrock received a considerable response online with many people from around the world asking if she could make them a copy .
So , she decided to do one better and open her DMs to nominations for custom illustrations .
" I thought , while I 'm staying at home , the illustrations could be a nice way for others to send a personalised message to loved ones without the contact , " she tells Her .
" It 's the very least I can do when others are doing so much to keep us all safe .
"  So far , Jeri has created images for frontline workers , for couples who have had to cancel their honeymoons , and for friends who are missing one another .
She says that while she has received a lot of nominations for healthcare staff , opening her account up to suggestions made her realise the true scale of the pandemic - and just how many people have been affected .
" Nominations for grandparents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , " people whose weddings have been impacted ; people living abroad but ca n't come home .
" Those who suffer from anxiety , loneliness , and those who are immunocompromised have all been nominated by friends and loved ones who want them to know that they 're being thought of .
"  But Jeri 's illustrations have n't just been brightening the days of those who have been nominated , they 've been adding a necessary lightness to her followers ' timelines too .
A glimmer of hope in a pair of Irish dancing shoes , a reminder to stay busy with cake ingredients .
Jeri says that while we all need to be well informed during the pandemic , she knows that everybody needs a break from bad news - even just for a little while .
" We need to be aware of the toll it 's taking on our well-being , especially when we are being exposed to news everywhere , " she says .
" I believe seeing and sharing wholesome content and good news is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own spirits , but give those who see it a chance to experience some of that kindness , hope and faith in humanity across the world .
