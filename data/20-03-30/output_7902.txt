Defence budgets should be diverted for use to defend human beings against Coronavirus  CHITRAL : The whole world has one common enemy at this time .
From China to America , from Newzealand to Africa , all of humanity is reeling under the effect of the ever so powerful Corona pandemic .
In a condition like this who would like to wage a war against another  Defence budgets vs Coronavirus  country which is also equally shaken and scared by the mysterious infection .
This makes it an ideal time to announce global demilitarization and divert at least 50 percent of all defence budgets of all countries towards fighting the virus .
After all defence budget and the defence forces are established for the defence of a country .
Now the most defence needed by any country is against the current pandemic and any future possibility like this , rather than any enemy in the form of a marching army or tanks or warplanes or missiles .
Availing this crisis as an opportunity for adopting sanity , all countries with exaggerated defence budgets should come to an agreement with their potential rivals and mutually decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards fighting the Corona enemy .
If the US , Russia and China only act upon this recipe , the whole world can afford to be shutdown for a year and yet be fed and stay healthy , without undergoing any financial crisis .
