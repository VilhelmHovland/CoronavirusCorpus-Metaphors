Coronavirus - UK union calls for social distancing in food factories  The UK and Ireland 's largest trade union , Unite , has called for a mandatory two-metre social distancing to be put in place for those working in the food industry .
It has urged George Eustice , the UK Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) , to introduce the measure to protect those working on production lines in processing plants during the coronavirus crisis .
Bev Clarkson , Unite national officer for the food industry , said : " The lack of the mandatory imposition of the two-metre rule by government is a problem currently nationwide .
Ministers need to make the two-metre rule mandatory , as matter of urgency , across food processing , and also in the retail sector  " As a society , we have quickly recognised that food production and the retail sector are key areas in maintaining adequate food supplies and keeping people 's morale high .
" I have been in contact with all the meat suppliers where we have union recognition .
Some of the employers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because the government has not stated that it is mandatory within the sector then they are not implementing it on production lines .
" We have strenuously put it to them that if they do not implement it on production lines then the virus could spread rapidly throughout the factories .
" I have put a number of proposals forward , such as slowing the lines down enabling them to pull people off the lines and do it on a rotation , as well as putting perplex screens up .
" I have been informed that production is up by at least 40% on all meat poultry sites because of the increase in demand , however , I pointed out that if the virus spreads in the factories then they wo n't have enough staff to continue the production .
