Ace of clubs If guilty -- and that looks increasingly likely -- Jack Grealish has handed the tabloid press an absolute gift with his ridiculous and dangerous antics at the weekend .
He is an ' ace ' , you see .
And anything an ' ace ' does is massive news .
' COVIDIOT ' is a cracking headline on the front page of The Sun , to be absolutely fair ; they then tell us that ' Ace tells fans ' stay in ' then crashes car after 4am party ' .
They double down on the ' ace ' online with a headline of ' PREM ACE CRASH Jack Grealish ' crashes ? 80k Range Rover ' just hours after Aston Villa ace told fans to stay home over coronavirus ' .
But we all know that the only people who use the word ' ace ' in a football context are tabloid reporters .
Literally nobody has said those words out loud .
Literally nobody .
So we are taking these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle a snow drift :  " The party had been going on all night .
It was unbearable .
The noise had only stopped a short while when , just after 8am , there were a series of almighty collisions which reverberated through the flats .
" Outside , Jack Grealish was stood next to his car rowing with a security guard .
It was strange to see an England ace looking so unkempt and dishevelled .
He looked unsteady and confused .
" There was an almighty row because Jack did n't want to wait around but people wanted answers from him .
"  It was ' strange to see an England ace ' ? It 's a whole lot bloody stranger to hear anyone say the words ' England ace ' .
And that 's even before you consider that he has never actually played for England .
Cry me a f***ing river The back page of the Daily Mirror brings us the exclusive ' news ' that ' BT SPORT have told their star pundits they may not be paid because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell is this classed as news ? They will presumably not be paid because they will not be working , like millions of others around the country .
If people on freelance contracts were being paid despite doing literally no work , then that would be a story .
Secondly , who gives a f*** ? We think Rio Ferdinand and Steve McManaman will just about avoid having to claim universal credit .
Football talkAlso on the Daily Mirror 's back page is the ' exclusive ' news -- widely reported elsewhere -- that ' PREMIER LEAGUE stars could be put under a strict quarantine lockdown in hotels for a month ' .
What particularly amused Mediawatch was this sentence :  ' There is talk within football that the virus will reach its peak in three weeks ' time .
'  There is talk within the whole of the UK that the virus will reach its peak in three weeks ' time , fella .
Breaking news : Not everything is football gossip .
Dirty SanchoThe back page of The Sun focuses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not stay at Tottenham , while there is also space for Martin Blackburn 's tale about Jadon Sancho .
Apparently , Sancho ' has been told he can leave by Borussia Dortmund -- putting Manchester United and Chelsea on alert ' .
Catch up , granddad .
These are headlines from your own website over the last five days :  ' How Man Utd will line-up with Jadon Sancho next season but how will Solskjaer replace Paul Pogba in midfield ? '  ' Jadon Sancho will not think twice about ? 120m Man Utd transfer and should jump at chance to join , says Berbatov '  ' Man Utd transfer for Jadon Sancho gets green light from Borussia Dortmund but German side refuse to let him go cheaply '  Your colleagues would have us believe that we are way , way , way past the ' on alert ' stage .
It 's almost like nobody actually has the faintest idea but everybody wants those sweet Manchester United clicks .
Bruno ! Talking of sweet Manchester United clicks , the top story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediawatch suspects -- though we may be wrong -- that if they sell Paul Pogba , they probably will not be allowed to play him .
We also suspect that they wo n't abandon Bruno Fernandes so swiftly after he became their most important player .
Never , everOver at the Liverpool Echo , they are also shamelessly chasing sweet Manchester United clicks -- this is not the time to be choosy -- with this headline :  ' Liverpool are doing something Manchester United never could '  And it turns out that what Manchester United ' never could ' is not actually ' see their title put on hold because of a worldwide pandemic ' but ' win lots of games by a one-goal margin ' .
So we have fixed that headline :  ' Liverpool were doing something Manchester United never wanted to do '  You 're welcome .
Feel the forceBut the award -- were there such an award -- for desperate headline of the day goes to the Liverpool Echo for this doozy :  So who will he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced to buy from Chelsea ? It seems odd that he will be ' forced ' to do either .
Mediawatch suspects you could guess for approximately 427 years and still not come up with the actual ' story ' .
that Klopp could be forced to sell reserve right-back Neco Williams just like Chelsea were forced to sell reserve right-back Tariq Lamptey .
For f*** 's sake .
