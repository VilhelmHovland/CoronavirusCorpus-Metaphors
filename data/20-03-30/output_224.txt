Outside the Box  Opinion : Brace for more voting by mail because of coronavirus -- and other logistical challenges facing election officials  Charles Stewart III  The 2020 election in November wo n't be called off because of coronavirus  Voting by mail in 2018 .

has faced in at least a century , the nation 's election administrators are scrambling to plan how 165 million Americans will vote safely and securely in November .
Inattention to the health challenge risks contributing to a flare-up of the virus .
Poorly executed logistics risk creating chaos at the polls .
The stakes are high .
Postponing the Nov .
3 election is not an option .
Both the U .
Constitution and federal law establish Election Day , and there is no chance Congress could change either in the next months .
States have been postponingprimaries , but the latitude afforded parties and states to schedule their own elections will diminish significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2020 presidential election will be safe and result in a legitimate outcome .
The response to the coronavirus crisis and the COVID-19 illness it causes will revolve around two major strategies .
First , paper ballots must be available to more voters .
Every mail ballot is one less voter in a polling place .
Achieving this will fall largely on the shoulders of state officials -- governors , secretaries of state , legislators and election boards .
Decisions on how to increase mail-in voting need to be made in the next four to six weeks .
Second , polling places must be made safe for poll workers and voters .
Responsibility for this will fall mainly on the shoulders of the ground troops of election administration , ranging from state election directors to poll workers .
These same people also bear the responsibility of implementing decisions related to expanding the availability of mail ballots .
Expanding access to mail ballots is easier said than done .
In many states , a century 's worth of established practices will need to be relaxed .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be confronted .
For the past decade , Democrats have become associated with supporting liberalized mail balloting .
It is easy for Republican leaders to regard advocacy for expanded mail balloting as a Democratic power grab .
That view , while understandable , is wrong .
First , in 2016 Democrats and Republicans availed themselves of mail ballots at roughly the same rates .
Second , older voters are more likely to use mail ballots than younger voters -- a demographic that has skewed Republican in recent years .
Still , charges of partisan overreach can be reduced , if not eliminated , if it is agreed by both sides that many of the actions taken to expand access to mail ballots in 2020 are for the emergency , and not permanent .
There will be time to debate permanent changes next January .
Any expansion of mail balloting would make voting safer .
Even relatively modest policy accommodations would help .
For instance , seven states that require an excuse to vote absentee already make exceptions for voters 65 and older .
The other states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions to their older voters .
Similarly , states that require an excuse could consider restricted-movement orders due to public health concerns as constituting a medical excuse .
Other measures , such as removing the requirement for an excuse altogether , would go even further to getting mail ballots into more hands .
States that already have 70% of voters mailing in their ballots , such as Arizona , could realistically implement a complete vote-by-mail model by November .
If the policy decisions that need to be made in the next few weeks are challenging , the logistical issues to implement them are also daunting .
Although time is a precious commodity , state and local officials have four to five months to implement the new policies .
This is good , because changes to election policy can not be implemented by flipping a switch .
A state that dramatically expands voting by mail will need to review the accuracy of its voter lists , create systems to track ballots while they are in the mail stream , develop new working relationships with the U .
Postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature matching , and give voters the timely opportunity to " cure " problems that arise with signatures not matching .
On top of all this , local jurisdictions will need to hire workers to handle all the new tasks -- tasks that often occur in confined spaces on short deadlines .
In-person voting wo n't go away , of course .
Voters are creatures of habit .
Many do n't pay attention to the election until the last minute ; these may not be able to take advantage of voting by mail .
Others just do n't trust the mail .
It is likely that even if election officials pull out all the stops and make paper ballots available to the greatest number of people possible , most voters will cast ballots in person this November .
How to make this safe ?  This is where time may be on our side .
Even now , as the pandemic still appears to be approaching its apex , some activities that require people to congregate are still happening .
Think about grocery shopping .
Large stores are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as placing tape on the floor every six feet .
Checkout lanes are maximally staffed , to keep people moving .
Smaller food shops are limiting the number of shoppers who may come inside at any one time .
These practices will become codified for all essential public gatherings and can be copied at polling places .
The bigger challenge with in-person voting will be staffing .
Today , staffing the polls relies on people over 65 -- those most vulnerable to COVID-19 .
Just as grocery clerks are put at risk of infection with each checkout , poll workers are put at risk with each voter checked in .
Some poll workers have refused to work during the primaries .
This will occur in November , too .
Replacing those poll workers produces a new challenge .
Working the polls is complex .
It will be even more complex this year .
How will thousands of new poll workers be trained about these complexities in an environment in which public gatherings are limited ?  The logistical challenges of expanding voting-by-mail and ensuring the continuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale ) come at a time of collapsing state and local budgets and insufficient appropriations for the coming election in the just-signed $2 trillion stimulus package .
Ultimately , something is likely to give .
In this environment of daunting logistical changes , constrained budgets , equipment and personnel shortages , the public needs to prepare now for all things related to elections to take longer than normal this November .
With fewer election workers and only marginally more ballot scanners processing more mail ballots , it 's going to take longer to count those ballots .
With more mail ballots will come more signature challenges that will have to be adjudicated .
With access to polling places limited , lines will be longer .
Making the November election work will require immediate policy decisions by state officials in the coming weeks .
Election administrators will have several months to implement them , but the challenges are real .
In the end , we as citizens will play our part by holding elected officials accountable for the decisions they make now , and for supporting the efforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote count .
