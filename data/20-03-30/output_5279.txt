The government has announced it will pay businesses seriously affected by the coronavirus a wage subsidy , to ensure they keep employees on the books through the coronavirus pandemic .
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the ' Jobkeeper ' payment in a press conference on Monday afternoon , saying it was intended to " cushion the blow " of the coronavirus-led downturn , and prevent the loss of potentially millions of jobs .
" We are living in unprecedented times , " Morrison said .
" This calls for unprecedented action .
"  The wage subsidy is a flat payment of $1,500 per employee per fortnight , which Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said represented 70% of the Australian median wage and 100% of the median wage in the industries most seriously affected by the coronavirus , including hospitality , retail and tourism .
Employers with turnovers of under $1 billion will be eligible to receive the subsidy if they have taken a 30% hit to their annual turnover .
For businesses with turnovers of more than $1 billion , they will have had to take a hit of 50% or more .

Casual employees must have been with their employers for 12 months or more to be eligible .
In a first , New Zealanders on 444 visas who have been working for more than one year will also be eligible .
It is a flat payment , both Morrison and Frydenberg stressed , meaning that for some employees -- especially casual workers -- it may represent more than 100% of their fortnightly earnings .
The payments to employers will start on 1 May , and will be backdated until 1 March , which is the cutoff date for eligibility .
" That means they can still have them on the books and start working together on how they can resuscitate the business on the other side , " Morrison said .
Those already stood down due to the coronavirus crisis are eligible , encouraging employers to put them back on the books .
The payments will be delivered through the Australian Taxation Office ( ATO ) .
The wage subsidy will cost $130 billion , bringing the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Australia 's GDP .
In announcing the program , Morrison said it was intended to prevent nothing short of an economic collapse -- the likes of which we may see internationally through the pandemic .
" Many countries , in the months ahead and perhaps beyond that , may well see their economies collapse , " Morrison said .
" Some will see them hollow out .
In the very worst of circumstances , we could see countries themselves fall into chaos .
