UNMC doctor says loss of smell could be key symptom of COVID-19  A link between loss of smell and COVID-19 is being investigated by medical experts .
Nebraska Medicine ear , nose and throat specialist Christie Barnes has been investigating with Nebraska Medicine infectious disease experts .
In a video interview with UNMC , Barnes addressed the link to COVID-19 and how it could affect patients .
Barnes said over the past couple weeks , UNMC has seen more patients that complain of loss of sense of smell with minimal additional symptoms of COVID-19 .
" Unfortunately , with this particular virus and the reason it 's spreading among us like wildfire is that there 's so many people that are relatively asymptomatic and they 're essentially carriers , " she said .
" They 're spreading it without knowing they 're doing so .
"  Thinking something tastes bland is one way Barnes said people might notice the symptom .
" That really is the loss of sense of smell they are perceiving , " she said .
" It 's not necessarily that this virus effects your sense of taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Barnes said some patients are concerned with not regaining their sense of smell , but she said that is a rare occurrence .
Discovering that loss of smell as a symptom of COVID-19 gives providers the opportunity to tell people it could be their only symptom , according to Barnes .
" I think this may be another piece of the puzzle , " she said .
" This may be an opportunity for us to get the word out that if you have these symptoms , this may be the only sign you will have of this viral infection .
