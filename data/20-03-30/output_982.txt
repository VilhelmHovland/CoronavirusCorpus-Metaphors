Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAMBURG , Pa .
-- The spring breezes of 2020 are carrying more than just tree pollen .
There 's a whiff of paranoia in the air .
For millions of seasonal allergy sufferers , the annual onset of watery eyes and scratchy throats is bumping up against the global spread of a new virus that produces its own constellation of respiratory symptoms .
Forecasters are predicting a brutal spring allergy season for swaths of the U .
at the same time that COVID-19 cases are rising dramatically .
That 's causing angst for people who never have had to particularly worry about their hay fever , other than to stock up on antihistamines , decongestants and tissues .
Now they 're asking : Are these my allergies ? Or something more sinister ?  ' ? Everyone is sort of analyzing every sneeze and cough right now , ' ? said Kathy Przywara , who manages an online community of allergy sufferers for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America .
Never mind the differing symptoms - that sneezing and runny nose , hallmarks of hay fever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing , fever and in more serious cases shortness of breath .
Never mind that allergies do n't cause fevers .
Allergy sufferers fret that there 's just enough overlap to make them nervous .
Allergy season is already underway in Oceanside , California , where Ampie Convocar is dealing with a runny nose , sinus pain and headache , and an urge to sneeze .
Last year , she would 've considered her symptoms mere annoyance .
Now they cause tremendous anxiety .
People with asthma , like Convocar , are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 .
' ? I consider it as something that could kill me because of COVID-19 floating around , ' ? Convocar said via email .
With a family member still traveling to work every day , she said , ' ? I do n't know what he got out there .
' ?  Many garden-variety hay fever sufferers , of whom there are about 19 million adults in the U .
, are also on heightened alert .
They 're taking their temperatures each day , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from suspicious colleagues and grossed-out grocery shoppers .
They 're commiserating with each other and sharing memes on social media ( ' ? I do n't know if I should buy Zyrtec or turn myself in to the CDC ' ? ) .
Pamela Smelser is reminded of allergy season every time she looks out the window of her home office , where her cherry tree is blooming .
Spring came early to Maryland , she said , and lots of people are coughing and sneezing from the pollen .
' ? You do what you have to do : You take your meds for allergies and stay away from people , ' ? Smelser said .
' ? People get really hinky about coughing right now .
' ?  Though she 's had allergies for years , Smelser , a semi-retired social worker and community college teacher outside Baltimore , admits to being a touch paranoid .
She takes her temperature every day because she 's 66 and , well , you can never be too careful .
' ? I ca n't rule out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? That 's the paranoia : You ca n't even get a test to say , ' ? This is all seasonal allergies .
' ' ?  In Pennsylvania , pear trees are budding , red maple are beginning to flower and Leslie Haerer 's allergies are already in full bloom .
The 64-year-old retired nurse , who lives about an hour north of Philadelphia , is coping with a scratchy throat , an urge to sneeze and a headache behind the eyes .
As a medical professional , Haerer knows her symptoms are attributable to her allergies .
She also knows that other people are ' ? really flipped out about this , ' ? including the scowling family of three who saw her sneeze into her elbow outside a Chinese restaurant and , instead of continuing on to their destination - the pizza shop next door - got in their car and sped away .
' ? I was like , ' ? I 'm sorry you missed your pizza , ' ' ? Haerer said .
' ? People 's reactions are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , where pollen counts are high , Marty Watson initially dismissed his itchy eyes , mild headache , coughing and sneezing as the product of a tree allergy , even after his temperature became slightly elevated .
Then , in mid-March , he realized he could no longer smell a pungent sourdough starter , and friends began sending him news stories that said a loss of smell sometimes accompanied a coronavirus infection .
" Austin is notorious for all sorts of allergies , and it became really hard to tell : Is it this ? Is it that ? ' ? said Watson , 52 .
For most people , the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple weeks .
Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .
As allergy season ramps up in Pennsylvania , Dr .
Laura Fisher , an allergist in Lancaster , expects an influx of worried patients .
She is advising them to keep up with their medications , stay at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrelated to their allergies .
' ? I think people are more afraid of catching it , more afraid of going out and getting it from the grocery store or drive-thru , than they are of their usual symptoms being COVID , ' ? said Fisher , president of the Pennsylvania Allergy and Asthma Association .
Jessica Tanniehill initially blew off her symptoms as allergy-related .
Tanniehill , 39 , of Adamsville , Alabama , started with a runny nose and sneezing .
Body aches and a cough came next , following by shortness of breath .
She thought her seasonal allergies had led to a bout of anxiety , nothing more , especially since she 'd been outside all day doing yard work and washing her truck .
' ? I did n't take it seriously , ' ? she said .
Turns out she 'd contracted COVID-19 - which does n't preclude the possibility that she 'd had allergies as well .
Tanniehill , who 's now on the mend , acknowledged that she ' ? was one of the people that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish I was more careful .
