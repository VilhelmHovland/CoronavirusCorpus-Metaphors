Company promises 3 months ' worth of beer to people who adopt or foster a dog during coronavirus crisis  Nothing beats the company of man 's best friend as you self-isolate during the coronavirus outbreak .
But an ice-cold beer , free at that , comes in at a close second .
Now you can have both because Busch Beer is offering a three months ' supply of its beer to 500 people who adopt or foster a dog from Midwest Animal Rescue in Minnesota .
Animal shelters across the US are closing their doors to the public and cancelling adoption events to slow the spread of the coronavirus .
But nothing is stopping new abandoned animals from coming in , so shelters are trying to place as many animals in homes as quickly as possible .
To help this effort , Busch Beer has teamed up with Midwest Animal Rescue to launch the " Foster a Dog , Get Busch " offer .
" During these uncertain and lonelier times , people need an escape : cue the cute puppy memes and photos , " a spokesperson for Busch told People magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need those cute puppy pics to help get us through social distancing , it 's actually them who need us .
"  " Social distancing is better with a furry friend by your side and a cold beer in your hand , " the spokesperson added .
To enter , you must adopt or foster a dog through Midwest Animal Rescue .
After completing the adoption or foster process , you will receive a confirmation email from the animal shelter , which you should then send to  Busch through Facebook , Twitter or Instagram by April 25 .
If you are one of the first 500 people to enter , you will receive a $100 pre-paid debit card , which you can then use to buy your three months ' worth of beer .
So whether it 's for the dog or for the free beer , this is an offer that 's truly a win-win for everybody .
