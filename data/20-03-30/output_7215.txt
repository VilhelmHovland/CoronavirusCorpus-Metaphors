COSHOCTON -- A week into Ohio Gov Mike DeWine 's stay at home order , local officials stress people need to do the best the can to follow it .
Rob McMasters , director of the Coshocton County Emergency Management Agency , said he 's seeing some fewer vehicles on the road , but not by much .
" We ca n't stress this enough .
This is a stay at home order .
It 's not go to the store just because you want to go to the store .
Only go to the store if you need to go to the store .
Do n't go for the leisurely shopping trip , " McMasters said .
" This is like the Hail Mary to try and slow the spread of this virus down in the State of Ohio and lessen the strain on our health care system .

However , he still cautions people there and elsewhere to practice social distancing and stay 6 feet away from the next person .
He also reiterated that suggestions long touted , like frequent washing of hands , still need to be followed .
" If you do go out and do interact with others , even if it 's your neighbor , maintain washing your hands numerous times a day if you 're out .
Use hand sanitizer if soap and water is n't available , " McMasters said .
" Those basic hygiene items are one of the key items in preventing the spread of ( COVID-19 ) .

McMasters is continuing to meet daily with local emergency personnel to discuss needs and update coronavirus related information .
That includes representatives of Coshocton County Emergency Medical Services , Coshocton County Sheriff 's Office , fire departments , city and county health departments and Coshocton Regional Medical Center .
" It 's so we can all have that same picture as to where we are as a county and a community , " McMasters said .
" Any issues that may come up or things we see we may have to address in the future , those are brought up and we do our best to tackle those issues and bring them to a resolution .

She said that 's down from about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already been seen or understanding better what important symptoms to be cognizant of are .
" With us all starting to get used to this new routine and new world , we 've seen some of those visits trickle down a little bit at this point , " Conn said .
" We 're encouraging our community to use ( the center ) as their first stop , before symptoms get worse where you could need some emergency intervention .
"  She said the screening center is also being used to detect other illnesses still prevalent like respiratory syncytial virus and strep throat .
The hospital is also developing an area separate from the regular medical surgical unit that could house potential COVID-19 patients .
She said many medical facilities are doing the same in order to isolate the virus from other patients as they are still seeing other types of patients , many of whom would be high risk for COVID-19 .
However , with elective procedures and visits canceled , Conn said the number of patients in the hospital are down and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surge would hit .
" We might not be able to prevent 100 percent how many people are going to be infected by this virus .
The purpose of the stay at home order is to prevent a huge spike of individuals accessing and needing hospital care , " Conn said .
" Even despite all our planning and work to be ready for a surge , we wo n't be able to meet the need .
That 's Gov .
DeWine 's concern right now and what he 's trying to work with all the Ohio hospitals on .
How can we ensure everyone who needs a hospital will be able to be admitted and taken care of ? " .
