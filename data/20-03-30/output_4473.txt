If your internet connectivity proved spotty over the past weekend , it was the result of a recent breakage to the West Africa Cable System 's ( WACS ) undersea cable .
This is the same cable with caused so many issues at the beginning of the year and took several weeks to repair .
While this has left some internet service providers ( ISPs ) scrambling to find a workaround , Liquid Telecom says it has been able to mitigate these issues , and wants to assure its customers that its network remains stable and unencumbered .
" To help ensure continuity of service , Liquid Telecom 's network traffic is automatically re-routed during such outages .
We are responding to new and increased demand from customers with additional capacity across alternate routes , " explains Reshaad Sha , CEO of Liquid Telecom South Africa .
" Liquid Telecom operates a five-cable system for our international internet capacity in South Africa .

" The replacement of our core network has not only catered to legacy performance issues but has made Liquid Telecom 's network one of the most technologically advanced , modern and reliable networks in South Africa and across the African continent .
It has also addressed one of the core needs of local enterprises around network capacity , " notes Sha .
Along with addressing the need for increased capacity , the telecoms service provider has also developed a chatbot to help customers in real-time should the need arise .
