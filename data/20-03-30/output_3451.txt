Hospitals risk being swamped as virus claims 8 more victims  The expected daily growth in new coronavirus cases has halved , but hospitals remain at risk of being swamped by severely-ill patients if a surge can not be contained .
New figures show the day-to-day rise in the number of people being diagnosed with the killer virus has dropped from the expected rise of 33pc to 15pc .
Maynooth 's Professor Philip Nolan , who is leading a team advising the Government on the likely spread of the pandemic , said the 33pc rise was forecast in a scenario where no emergency measures such as physical distancing , school and business closures were implemented .
However , while the expected daily jump in cases has been dramatically reduced , it is still not enough to ensure the peak will be manageable and that hospitals will be able to cope with patients needing critical care .
Encouraging  Prof Nolan was speaking as eight more people died from the virus yesterday , including six patients from the east of the country .
Another patient died in the south , and there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five women and three men with a median age of 86 .
Another 295 cases of the virus have been diagnosed , bringing the total to 2,910 .
Prof Nolan , chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group , said : " We know what an unmitigated epidemic looks like , we are not on that track .
" The model reveals that before restrictions were in place , the daily growth rate of confirmed cases was at 33pc .
" This has fallen in recent days to around 15pc .
" But it is still growing and needs to fall further .
It takes time to see the impact of our efforts in the numbers .
" It will be another seven to 10 days before we have a reliable picture of how effective our collective efforts have been .
" The key message is that if you suspect you have the disease , you must ensure you infect nobody else .
"  The nation needs to double down in the drive to flatten the curve if the epidemic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer Dr Tony Holohan said yesterday : " We are beginning to see encouraging signs in our efforts to flatten the curve .
" However , we can not become complacent as we are still seeing new cases and more intensive admissions every day .
" Our strategy remains the implementation of public health restrictions to interrupt the spread of the virus and prevent people from arriving to intensive care in first place .
"  Half of new cases here are men , and there have been 111 clusters involving 428 cases .
The average age of those affected is 47 .
A total of 645 people have been hospitalised and 84 are in intensive care .
One in four of those infected is a healthcare worker .
Dublin continues to have the highest number of cases at 1,393 ( 56pc of the total ) , followed by Cork with 217 .
Community transmission accounts for 50pc of cases .
Dr Holohan was asked whether unrestricted movement across the border should continue in the context of differing health policies on tackling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel would be discussed at today 's meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team .
He said potential further restrictions on movement on the island would also be considered .
" We wo n't rule anything in or rule anything out - we will give further consideration again tomorrow , and that will include questions of movement on the island , " he said .
He challenged the suggestion that the Covid-19 infection rate could currently be lower if restrictions on movement had been introduced earlier .
He said introducing measures too early risked public fatigue when adherence was most needed .
" We need to make more progress , " he said .
" The line that we 're on at the moment is a line that will still create a challenge for us as it peaks at a point in the future .
Effectiveness  " That may be further than it would have otherwise peaked , but the package of measures that we 've asked of society as a whole was instituted at the right time , in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not too early and risked , then , the fatigue and losing the effectiveness of those measures and ultimately the impact that that would have had in limiting the extent to which you could prevent transmission of the infection .
"  The Department of Health recently published an Ethical Framework for Decision- Making in a Pandemic for medics who are on the frontline .
Dr Siobhan O'Sullivan , chief bioethics officer at the Department of Health , said : " Clinicians have to make tough decisions , often on a daily basis .
