We must redouble our efforts against the coronavirus- Burke  ( Above ) Deputy Peter Burke with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar .
We must " redouble " our efforts to slow the spread of coronavirus and stop the health system becoming overwhelmed , a local TD has said .
Speaking this week , Deputy Peter Burke praised the people of Westmeath for the sacrifices they have made since the start of the crisis .
" The vast majority of people are obeying the rules and I commend people for this sacrifice , as I know how hard it is to keep young children cooped up and away from their friends at this time .
I feel for parents of children with learning difficulties and behavioural problems , but it is for these and other risk categories , we must redouble our efforts and commitment to the cause .
There are also worries for the elderly who may live alone and are now cut off from the outside world .
" Communities are coming together to provide support to these people .
The point we must drive home is this : If you look after yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the most vulnerable in society .
Protection from COVID-19 is literally in all our hands " .
Commenting on the raft of new measures and legislation published and implemented late last week , the Mullingar TD said government ministers are working around the clock to support out citizens to the best of their ability at this time .
" I welcome that Gardai will increase interventions where venues and people are not adhering to recommended physical distancing .
There will be an increased presence of Park Rangers and Garda ? in parks and public places to ensure physical distancing is being observed .
In Ireland , since independence , we have always had policing by consent rather than coercion .
It is not our intention to change that now .
I would urge people to comply and not force our Garda ? to intervene and make their job more difficult .
The new powers afforded to the Garda ? will be used sparingly and only when necessary .
