And yet , to keep residents strong , the homes must be full of life .
In nursing homes across Ontario , the requirement of self-isolation is threatening residents ' need for emotional engagement to remain vital .
Absolon knows that for her mom , living behind locked doors cuts deep .
" When she was young , she was taken from her family and put in a residential school .
She wanted to leave .
And when she could n't , she cried and cried .
"  After the government issued the directive to close long-term care to visitors , Jennie asked if she could go out with her family for the day .
The nurse had to say no .
" I told my Mom , we will call you every day to have that connection and contact , " said Absolon , an associate professor in the faculty of social work at Wilfrid Laurier University and director of its Centre for Indigegogy of the Indigenous Field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact so that she knows she is loved .
"  In homes across Ontario , staff are helping residents see their families from afar .
" Window visits are becoming a thing , " said Lisa Levin , CEO of Advantage Ontario , which represents not-for-profit , charitable and municipal homes .
Levin said her association launched The Bright Lights in Dark Times Project to share creative ideas from homes , like asking children to draw happy-face pictures with messages for residents .

"  Staff at homes like the Rekai Centres , with homes on Wellesley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St .
Catharines , Brampton and London , are organizing window-visit schedules .
Families arrange a specific time for workers to bring their loved one to a window for visits with grandkids waving or dogs with noses pressed against the glass .
Families are buying white boards or Bristol board and colourmarkers , making signs that say " I love you Grandma .
" Homes are also working with families to schedule virtual visits , through Skype or Facetime .
Before COVID-19 , staff at Primacare Living had been going through training inspired by the Butterfly model .
Now called Meaningful Care Matters , the program teaches workers to focus on the feelings of residents and the importance of social connections and purpose in day-to-day life .
That training is now on hold but workers , who are screened before every shift for a temperature above 38 degrees or other COVID-19 symptoms and exposure , are asked to continue hugging and holding the hands of people in their care .
" What we can not do in our homes is stop touching people , " said Primacare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This is human , dignified care .
The touch , the hug , the moments that say ' You matter .

And when you are separated the way we are in this particular situation , it is devastating .
"  Social isolation protects against COVID-19 , but other than a deadly outbreak , loneliness is considered one of the most debilitating aspects of life in a nursing home .
That 's why Tamblyn Watts , of CanAge , a seniors ' advocacy group , wants the long-term care ministry to ask operators to find ways to keep people emotionally connected to families , staff and each other .
She tweets daily tips for seniors , families and homes , like Tuesday 's suggestion for a social-distancing sing-a-long to big band hits , everyone two metres apart .
" I 'm not saying do n't fight the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing we need to do is to ensure we are emotion-focused and to ensure wellbeing emotionally and mentally , otherwise older adults in long-term care will suffer twice .
"  Before COVID-19 , many residents were settled into the trusting routine of eating and dressing with the familiar face of a loved one .
Without their presence , Dr .
Samir Sinha believes many residents and hospital patients will now feel lost , leading to agitation , depression or even delirium , an acute state of confusion .
" A non-essential visit actually is an essential visit when ( a relative ) is the only person that they will allow to feed them or to dress them , " said Sinha , director of geriatrics at Sinai Health and the University Health Network .
" I think right now the goal of the ministry of health is to make sure these people are protected as much as possible from COVID .
I think family and residents and staff are realizing that these directives have unintended consequences .
"  Sinha said that last weekenda 103-year-old man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers , not his daughter or the caregiver who normallystays with him at his home 24 hours a day .
" Most of the government criteria ( for visitors ) that I 've seen across the country , that are being quickly implemented , do n't talk about an older person with advanced dementia who is at high risk of delirium or behavioural issues , " he said .
" If we ca n't meet their care needs , we know all too well that things can get complicated very quickly and their overall care can be compromised .
"  At Sheridan Villa in Mississauga , administrator Marianne Klein tries to calm people , moment by moment .
One of five long-term care homes operated by the Region of Peel , Sheridan Villa had been transforming its care model through Meaningful Care Matters training .
" The other day I walked out the elevator and one of our residents was playing the piano for other residents , " she said .
Moments like this happen because staff empower residents to find purpose for themselves and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early stages of emotion-focused training , art therapy classes continue with the teacher connecting through Skype projected onto a large screen .
Klein is also turning her attention to staff , to support those who are trying to juggle jobs with families and keep everyone healthy .
It 's a struggle in an industry that is constantly short-staffed .
" I came in this morning and talked to one of my staff and it almost brought me to tears , because she spoke about her situation and childcare , " Klein said .
" I told her , ' I understand how you feel , because I have a 12-year-old daughter .
' " Klein 's voice cracked .
While there were no cases of COVID-19 in Sheridan Villa , Klein said she is living alone so there is no risk of cross-infection .
" For the last week my daughter has been staying with my parents who are also pretty high-risk and I am keeping pretty close tabs on all three of them .
"  This week , the ministry of long-term care issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to different jobs throughout the home .
