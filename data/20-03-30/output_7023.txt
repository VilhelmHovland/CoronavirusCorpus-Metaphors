Kate and William Are Symbolically Leading the Monarchy During COVID-19  It 's been a difficult few months for Prince William and Kate Middleton , but it 's also been a period that 's seen them go from respected and beloved senior royals to the future of the royal family .
Following the resignation of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry as senior royals , and the necessary stepping back of the Queen , Prince Charles , and Camilla Parker-Bowles amid the coronavirus crisis that 's swept the U .
and much of the world , Kate and William have made a concerted effort to be the face of the royal family during a time of fear and uncertainty in the U .
-- and it 's a template for how we can expect them to behave as king and queen ( well , queen consort ) .
Part of the reason that we 've seen and heard more from the Cambridges than any other senior royal family household ( there are two others , now the Sussexes are formerly stepping down : The Queen and Prince Philip , and Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles ) is that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family right now .
While the other two households were forced to self-isolate by mid-March -- the Queen , Prince Philip , Prince Charles , and Camilla are all over the age of 70 , which is considered a risk factor for coronavirus -- the Cambridges were able to make a critical appearance at an emergency center in Croydon , England , on March 20 to show their support for first responders .
Body language expert Alison Ward told The Expressthat it looked as though that William and Kate " feel much more comfortable in their heightened roles .
"  In addition to taking the lead for the monarchy during the coronavirus crisis , Kate and William are coming off an uncomfortable few months following the resignation of another royal household , the Sussexes -- a pair they had been frequently compared to , even in spite of commentators pointing out that Kate and William have a very different role to play as future king and queen .
Yet the departure ( and apparent emigration ) of Meghan , Harry , and Archie means that Kate and William are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal family .
( One royal commentator , Richard Fitzwilliams , noted : " Harry and Meghan 's departure clears the way for William and Kate , who are devoted to their royal duties , to shine in the global spotlight .
" )  This fact was echoed in William 's address to the nation , in which he urged the British people to " come together " to " overcome the challenge " of COVID-19 , a speech not unlike the one that he would have given if he were king .
The Queen , meanwhile , is self-isolating in Windsor , but has not given any video speech , even though she 's been expected to -- perhaps a sign that she 's allowing William , who is no longer sharing any duties with his brother , to take the mantle .
Honestly , watch this and tell me this is n't king-like :  That said , the Cambridges ' effort to " keep calm and carry on " -- they had been the only senior royals to make an appearance since March 12 -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on March 23 .
Yet the couple has continued to post frequently to Instagram with never-before-seen photos and videos , which is in stark contrast to the winding down of the Sussexes ' popular Instagram account ( which formally posted for the last time March 30 ) .
The Cambridges , meanwhile , posted a sweet and much-talked-about collage of photos for U .
Mother 's Day , including a candid look at Prince George 's artwork ; released a video of their three children applauding first responders in tandem with the nation ; and shared candid photographs of their home office to make clear that they continue to be the face of the monarchy during this time .
All made headlines , while Harry and Meghan continue to retreat from them ( it 's likely that we wo n't hear from them for months ) .
None of this , of course , means that Kate and William are likely to become king and queen any sooner than they have long expected ; Prince Charles is next in line for the throne , and although there 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go directly to William , that 's actually very unlikely .
What it does suggest , however , is that Kate and William , who have hinted that they 've now completed their family , are becoming increasingly comfortable stepping into the leadership roles that they have long been certain are their destiny .
