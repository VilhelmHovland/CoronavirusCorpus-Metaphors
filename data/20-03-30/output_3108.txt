The value of the Internet in difficult times  The Coronavirusdisease ( COVID-19 ) has definitely disrupted life across the globe while forcing people into self-isolation for an indefinite period .
Despite all the gloom and doom , one way of life that has proved to be of good use during this time of uncertainty is the internet .
While we are stuck in our homes , we have this global system of interconnected computer networks that allows us to watch our favourite shows on Netflix and even communicate with friends and family through social media platforms .
Besides its use for leisure and entertainment , the internet has proven to be vital for several businesses , particularly on the African continent .
Jumia , the renowned Pan-African e-commerce company , is using its digital network to battle the COVID-19 outbreak .
Just last Friday , representatives from Jumia announced that they would be donating face masks and other healthcare facilities to ministries in Kenya , Ivory Coast , Morocco , Nigeria and Uganda .
In addition , Jumia has planned to reduce its fees on the Jumia Pay finance product in order to advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crunch , which also reports that the company plans to work with several health ministries across various African countries and vows to use its website , as well as its mobile platforms to share important messages on COVID-19 .
Most corporate entities , including American chambers over the region , business schools , etc .
, are holding workshops and conferences virtually .
Some private schools , even in Nigeria , are transiting to virtual classes in this world of the new normal .
Mobile service providers , such as Safaricom , Airtel , and Telkom have implemented mobile money systems , which allow their subscribers to transfer money through the use of apps .
According to Kahwa Tungu , Safaricom recently announced that customers can send money for free for all transactions of Ksh 1,000 and below , within a total period of 90 days .
There are companies that are also expanding their outreach with the presence of e-commerce .
This is the case for Copia Global Inc .
in Kenya .
According to Bloomberg , the company takes orders , from kitchen appliances to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country .
This is made possible by the agents they have contracted to the company , who own businesses that may be in need of these items .
The report from Bloomberg further notes that Copia 's sales from the e-commerce business are growing at a rate of 15% every month in Kenya .
This shows that the internet has a significant role in the future growth of online businesses .
There is measured optimism in utilizing internet in this manner due to the inability of people in remote areas of the African continent to have access .
As at 2017 , the World Bank estimated that only about 25% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to the internet ; however , according to Engoo , that number increased in recent times to 40% .
Engoo 's report also indicates that 47 .
of Nigeria 's population had access to internet in 2018 , mostly through the use of mobile phones .
This number increased to 74% in June 2019 ; however , only 24% of Nigerians were accessing the internet through computers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
A second hindrance to internet access is electricity .
Obviously , without the availability of electricity , there would not be as much internet penetration .
Brookings Institute stated that Africa had an average 43% access rate to electricity .
However , there have been marginal improvements over the last couple of years .
According to General Electric ( G .
) , the company installed its 100th power plant in Sub-Saharan Africa , as well as an installed base of over 300 turbines in 22 countries on the continent .
The internet is definitely the future and it is one that would produce maximum profits , particularly during this indefinite lockdown period .
I implore all Africans to make good use of the internet during this period , not only to keep themselves " busy " or to entertain themselves , but to also find new avenues of generating income .
African leaders should learn from this situation and prioritize the infrastructure growth , and regulatory reforms that will help improve the internet , and encourage local and foreign investment in this area .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who make the best of the way things turn out .
