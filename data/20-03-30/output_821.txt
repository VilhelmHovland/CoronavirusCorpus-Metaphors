Bang or bust : Will we get babies , divorces or both out of isolation ?  The saying , " You ca n't live with them .
You ca n't live without them , " implies balance -- a back and forth .
But , when in quarantine or self-isolation , there is one option : Livin ' with ' em .
And this can prompt stress , boredom , irritation , romance , withdrawal and a hoard of other emotions to passively dump on a significant other .
As COVID-19 cases began to pile up , the social media posts predicting a second baby boom and/or an increased need for marriage counseling did too .
And because of that stress , it is more likely that we see an increase in marital issues than babies in nine months .
A baby boom is definitely possible , said Natasha Zaretsky , a historian at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , but the most well-known baby boom after World War II was prompted by great prosperity in a time of optimism and a surge of home building .
COVID-19 is different , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different set of meanings in the current situation .
" A mass pandemic is expected to impact birth rates like the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 or a low-level storm : a slight bump as humans instinctively " come together for the sake of civilization " to begin working on the next generation , according to a piece written for The Washington Post by Richard Evans , director of the Open Source Economics Laboratory .
The " banding together " theory might rear its head in nine months , but babies might not be what society needs at the moment .
The lengthiest predications of how long coronavirus conditions could last stretch many months to a year if community-wide isolation is n't enforced or embraced , according to reporting by AL .
And in a state like Alabama , leading the country in poor healthcare , a rise in births -- or an increased need in hospital beds -- could put more stress on an already struggling rural healthcare system .
There 's no way to say how long the country will battle the virus or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once .
A family or couple together for an extended period of time can get a bit cramped , she said .
A Chinese city has reached a peak in divorces all ready as a repercussion of the virus , according to reporting by Global Times .
Marriage registration offices in multiple cities hit their daily upper limits of divorce appointments .
Being bound together , the article said , has " evoked the underlying conflicts " in marriages and the result has been impulsive divorces .
In addition to digging up old grievances , roles and expectations of each other might change , similar to when women were getting out of the home , getting jobs and taking their lives into their own hands in the 1970s , Zaretsky said .
While many saw the spike in divorces as the " deconstruction of the American family , " some women saw their new freedom as a way out of harmful marriages .
Just as there was a shift in family roles and gender identity , Zaretsky said , society will probably feel pressure on relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divorces and this surge could be really bump that up .
In 2018 , Alabama ranked top 10 for divorces at almost 10% of 1,000 women getting divorced in their first marriage , according to U .
News and World Report .
Hard conversations will be had moving forward , about the division of responsibilities and other issues that could drive up that statistic , she said .
Who is responsible for the cooking and cleaning if the partner who is usually home more frequently is deemed an essential employee and must go to work ? How can two people work from home with rivaling conference calls and one room with good reception ?  While these questions seem trivial at the moment , these issues could build to troubling conversations in relationships .
" Despite the strides that women have made , research says that women are still doing the majority of the child-rearing , cooking and housework .
"  " This is still very different from the ' 70s , " she said .
" This is an acute crisis .
I can see divorces going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  And the increase of stress and worry paired with changes in rhythm are likely to cause even the strongest of relationships to shutter .
" Everyone has a coping threshold , " Norton said .
" And it is important to realize that everyone , at this time , is at or above that threshold .
"  For many , the pandemic will be a crucible for personal relationships : Couples will melt together or reach a boiling point and separate , Norton said .
Creating shared routines like cooking breakfast together , learning a new skill or starting a show to watch at a similar time each night can fill in the gaps of normalcy with something new and exciting .
Avoid closing off or restricting access to what one is feeling , Norton said , and accepting advice or influence from those you love will make them feel loved as well .
" You within your marriage can not control a pandemic , " he said .
" You can control how you live within the space of your marriage .
