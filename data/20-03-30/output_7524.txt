WEBERAssociated Press  DES MOINES , Iowa ( AP ) -- A federal judge Monday temporarily blocked Texas ' efforts to ban abortions during the coronavirus pandemic , handing Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers a victory as clinics across the U .
filed a wave of lawsuits to stop states from trying to shutter them during the outbreak .
A new Ohio order is also unconstitutional if it prevents abortions from being carried out , a separate judge ruled Monday .
The ruling instructed clinics to determine on a case-by-case basis if an abortion can be delayed to maximize resources -- such as preserving personal protective equipment -- needed to fight the coronavirus .
If the abortion is deemed necessary and ca n't be delayed , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were signs of judges pushing back on Republican-controlled states including abortion in sweeping orders as the outbreak grows in the U .
In Texas , the ruling came down after state Attorney General Ken Paxton , a Republican , said abortion was included in a statewide ban on nonessential surgeries .
But U .
District Judge Lee Yeakel said the " Supreme Court has spoken clearly " on a woman 's right to abortion .
One abortion provider in Texas , Whole Woman 's Health , said it had canceled more than 150 appointments in the days after the Texas order went into effect .
" There can be no outright ban on such a procedure , " Yeakel wrote .
The rulings happened Monday as lawsuits were also filed in Alabama , Iowa and Oklahoma , after governors in those states similarly ordered a stop to non-emergency procedures and specifically included abortion among them .
The lawsuits were filed by Planned Parenthood , the American Civil Liberties Union , the Center for Reproductive Rights and local lawyers in each state .
Their aim , like abortion providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortions as part of temporary policy changes related to the coronavirus pandemic .
Oklahoma Gov .
Kevin Stitt announced Friday that abortions were included in his executive order banning all elective surgeries and minor medical procedures until April 7 , unless the procedure was necessary to prevent serious health risks to the mother .
Stitt said the order was needed to help preserve the state 's limited supply of personal protective equipment , like surgical masks and gloves .
A spokesman for Stitt referred questions about the challenge to Attorney General Mike Hunter , who vowed in a statement to defend the ban .
" My office will vigorously defend the governor 's executive order and the necessity to give precedence to essential medical procedures during this daunting public health crisis , " Hunter 's statement said .
" Make no mistake , this lawsuit will itself drain significant resources , medical and legal , from emergency efforts , and likely , directly and indirectly , bring harm to Oklahomans as a result .
"  Alabama abortion clinics said without court action , they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including one patient who will be pushed past the legal limit for abortion in the state if she does not get the procedure this week .
" Preventing them from getting an abortion does n't do anything to stop the COVID-19 virus , it just takes the decision whether to have a child out of their hands , " Randall Marshall , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama , said in a statement .
Alabama closed many nonessential businesses with a state health order , effective Saturday .
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said Monday the state would not offer a " blanket exemption " to abortion clinics .
" Put simply , no provider or clinic is excused from compliance with this order , " Steve Marshall said .
" In Texas and Ohio , as in Alabama , abortion providers are demanding special treatment and believe that they are above the law when it comes to the emergency orders .
"  In Ohio , Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics that sued last year to try to thwart a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbeat are asking a court to speed up its decision in that case and to consider a recent coronavirus order by the state health director .
In filings Monday , the groups ' attorneys argued " the state is again attempting to ban abortions " through Dr .
Amy Acton 's directive barring all " non-essential " procedures and Attorney General Dave Yost 's threats that it will be rigidly enforced .
Iowa Gov .
Kim Reynolds spokesman Pat Garrett said the governor " is focused on protecting Iowans from an unprecedented public health disaster , and she suspended all elective surgeries and procedures to preserve Iowa 's health care resources .
"  Reynolds said Sunday the move was not based on her personal ideology but a broad order to halt nonessential procedures to conserve medical equipment .
The Iowa lawsuit said abortion procedures do not require extensive use of medical equipment and do not use N95 respirators , the devices in shortest supply during the COVID-19 pandemic .
" Patients ' abortions will be delayed , and in some cases , denied altogether , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be forced to carry pregnancies to term , resulting in a deprivation of their fundamental right to determine when and whether to have a child or to add to their existing families .
