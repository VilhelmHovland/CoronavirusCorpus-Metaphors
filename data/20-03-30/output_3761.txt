Comment : Italy after three weeks of lock-down  Roberta Prandi , Associate Publisher at KHL 's Power division -- which publishes magazines including Diesel Progress and New Power Progress -- wrote this article from Northern Italy , where she is based .
" At the time this article is being written -- March 26 -- Italy has reached the 18th day of country lockdown in an attempt to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus .
The situation , especially in the northern regions is still very difficult , but the past three days have shown some positive signs as the curve of new positive cases has started to flatten out .
Roberta Prandi , KHL and Diesel Progress .
Only yesterday the Italian government reached an agreement with the major workers ' unions to review the list of non-essential activities that need to shut down .
The original list of essential activities included the production of electric motors and gensets , agricultural tractors and everything related to civil engineering .
With the latest update , companies manufacturing agricultural machinery and rubber products ( including tires ) have to close .
Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
One of the challenges for many employers that tried to keep production going so far was the protest of workers and lately a threat of strike by the metalworkers unions .
The concern for the safety of the employees and their families , together with these ' practical ' obstacles , led many companies to close before the government acted officially .
One of the biggest players announcing early the decision to stop production was CNH Industrial , which posted on March 20 an official note saying the majority of its European assembly operations are closed for two weeks ( until April 3 ) .
Most component facilities are to remain open although at reduced rates .
At this time , we have to assume that most OEMs and component manufacturers in Italy have closed production until April 3 .
Just a few companies have issued official releases on the topic , including hydraulic filter manufacturer MP Filtri and driveline system specialist Carraro ( which announced closure of its Italian plants , plus Carraro India in Pune , Carraro Argentina and Carraro Brasil ) .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental faces up to virus challenge  By Russian Rental **36;802;TOOLONG  The following article was written by the Russian Rental Association ( HAACT ) , who have kindly given us permission to reprint it here .
We pass on our sincere thanks and best wishes to the association and its members .
We have contacted the leaders of rental companies , conducted a survey and asked them to comment on the current situation .
Opinions were divided , from quite positive to negative .
It seems that the crisis has not yet fully impacted the activities of our rental company members .
Oleg Malakhovsky , the managing director of Rental Tech , was optimistic ; " This situation has a beneficial effect on the work of our company , since right now it has become clear which non-efficient internal processes need to be optimised .
" There is an opportunity to look at the company from the outside and adapt to temporary difficulties .
"  The flow of customers has so far remained within its forecasts , he added , and has not changed compared to last year .
Some parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sales department is working more remotely , but they have to come to the office for documents .
The main requirement is to have at least two staff at the office if there are calls , etc .
Clients are also asking to cancel personal meetings .
"  The CEO of Vertex , Dmitry Pankin , has a different opinion : " The situation is not straightforward .
The difficulty is that we ca n't estimate how long the crisis will last .
Now we are paying special attention to receivables - many of our clients have decided that it is not necessary to pay for rental services .
" First , they have to find solutions to questions that , in their view , are more important .
Therefore , I draw to the attention of other rental companies the fact that it is now especially important to control payment discipline .
All the ' good ' rental companies are now adding to their list of arbitration cases .
"  In northern regions of Russia the construction season has not yet begun , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rental companies have not yet faced a reduction in orders or the closure of sites .
Pavel Piktorov , from Stratech rental company , said ; " All projects are still working , and there are no reductions .
The only problem is staff reassignments due to measures in connection with the coronavirus .
"  There are already signs that some objects may be frozen because of uncertainties on exchange rates .
In addition , a shortage of construction workers , including foreign specialists , is expected .
The situation may worsen .
Dmitry Pankin , co-founder and CEO of Vertex .
We recommend that rental companies prepare for such a development .
Dmitry Pankin at Vertex believes that many rental companies may close : " They ca n't cope with the debt burden .
There will be nothing to close cash gaps .
It will also be difficult for those who previously ignored equipment repair costs , or who allowed customers to phase payments , and who engaged in price dumping .
" I am sure a lot of stolen spare parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out .
Let 's see who worked efficiently and who worked for show .
My forecast is that the lift market will show an average annual volume of 50% compared to last year .
We will be forced to lower the rental rates , which are in Rubles , while the cost of spare parts - in Euros - will increase .
"  Yevgeny Gorev , of Gora rental company , said : " Due to the high volatility of the exchange rate and political tension in the country , short-term and medium-term expansion projects have become questionable .
" The exchange rate changes will undoubtedly impact on fleet investment plans and the purchase of new equipment .
But this could also bring advantages for rental companies , said Andrei Khvalev , head of rental company Orenprokat ; " Prices for new machinery and equipment will rise due to the strength of the dollar , and as a result , rental will become important for equipment users .
"  Ruslan Gorb , who leads Transbaza , the online rental service , also sees potential advantages ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution .
A huge number of people are locked-down at home and the only way to communicate with the world is the Internet .
" Despite quarantine , they all continue to work and live their lives , albeit in a limited space .
Most online businesses will actively use this opportunity to attract new customers and subscribers .
I believe that our rental industry , despite the fact that it is not actively using digital technologies , will not be able to resist going online .
" Many new online resources may appear on the market , and those that already exist have a good opportunity to expand the range of their services and attract new customers .
"  It is difficult to predict how the current situation will affect the rental market for construction equipment .
European rental companies expect a 30-50% drop in the market in 2020 .
In Russia , the peak of the pandemic has not yet been passed , and in addition , what happens to the economy depends on the actions of government and the measures that are taken .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-working , so a decline is possible in the near future , but we expect the market to grow by September .
The situation will impact on those companies that have leasing and loan obligations , and delays in the supply of equipment are also expected .
The purchase price rises and , in such circumstances , it will not be possible to raise rental rates .
Last year , a lot of rental equipment was acquired and at the end of the year it was placed on the market .
That will lead to increased competition in this period , but not an increase in rental rates .
On the other hand , if new work does appear , that can play a positive role in the use of rental equipment .
Rental companies will also face rising prices for parts and the prices of new Russian-built equipment will grow , as a large proportion of components are imported .
We hope that the peak of the pandemic will pass soon , and the Russian government will be able to minimize the impact .
We wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
