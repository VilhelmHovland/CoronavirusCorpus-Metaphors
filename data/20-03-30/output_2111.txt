I am a 64-year-old avid outdoor person enjoying the trails all over Greater Sudbury almost daily .
Born raised in Sudbury , now I live north end of the city .
While enjoying these trails , especially the Moonlight Beach area to get to trails away from the public , I encounter many off-leash dogs .
The city has put up posts saying dogs must be on a leash .
Very few owners respect this and have allowed their dogs to jump on and nip me , then they become rude when I show my disgust .
I do have medical issues and walking on soft earth is the best for me , so I try to enjoy my day on the trails .
Recently , off-leash dogs jumped up with their paws in my face .
I spoke with the city 's bylaw staff and was told yes , Moonlight , Fielding and a few other parks have issues with such dogs .
Ward 11 Coun .
Bill Leduc sent me an email then called me .
Within a few minutes of explaining this problem , he told me if I do not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town to walk .
My town ? I thought ' greater ' included all the outlying areas of Greater Sudbury ? What a thing to say to anyone , especially to a senior when the City of Greater Sudbury vows they are looking after us .
I have yet to hear from anyone about this .
Leduc suggests I either put up with off-leash dogs harassing me or go home .
Shame on him and shame on owners of dogs who refuse to respect the rights of others on these trails .
Linda Derkacz  Capreol  Profiting from fear is a disgrace  Fear seems to do strange things to the usually rational thinking person , especially during this COVID-19 pandemic .
I stopped by my local grocer recently after realizing we were out of bread for the weekend .
What a surprise to find that I was taking the last loaf off the shelf .
I could expect that on the Friday of May 24 , but March 13 ?  A walk down the aisle that used to carry toilet paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing we bought some at Costco the last time we were there .
The hoarders that are reselling on Kijiji and Amazon appear to be on the same social level as phone scammers .
Profiting from fear is a disgrace .
Perhaps the next scam will involve accommodations in the Norad Hole to sit out the virus and toilet paper shortage .
A recent meme circulating around hit it right on the head .
This sort of fear-mongering is the reason why we 'll never know what is going on in Area 51 .
If humanity does something foolish like hoarding toilet paper for a non-gastro virus , what would people do if they realized that aliens were , or are , actually here ?  I ask people to return to their senses and stop the ridiculous over-purchasing of certain goods and only buy what they need .
Having a little extra on the pantry shelf is a good thing as long as we do n't deprive those in real need .
Take the necessary precautions to slow the spread of the virus with proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic control rational thought .
The last thing anyone would want is to contact the newspaper to increase the production of its print version while using a little less ink , if you know what I mean .
Murray Cooper  North Bay  Praise for retail workers  Hats off to the many retail employees who , despite the threat of COVID-19 , choose to carry on serving the public .
It 's sad to say that a pandemic opens a lot of eyes as to the various members of our society who keep it running .
It brings out the best of us .
Money aside , they certainly do n't have to risk their health to keep us fed and protected .
This city truly does have a heart of gold ( too bad it 's not also made of toilet paper ) .
