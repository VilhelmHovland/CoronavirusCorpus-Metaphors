MUMBAI/NEW DELHI : The Reserve Bank of India today hit the nail on the head by giving a reprieve to corporate bond and commercial paper market from the relentless selling by mutual funds and easing the pressure on yields .
The central bank today announced it would conduct " targeted " term repos of three-year tenures for up to 1 trln rupees in tranches to provide liquidity to banks , and commercial paper and corporate bond markets .
The RBI mandated banks to invest the additional liquidity availed of through the targeted long-term repo operations in investment grade corporate bonds and commercial papers .
The RBI said banks will have to buy up to 50% of these papers from the primary market and the remaining 50% from the secondary market , including from mutual funds and non-banking finance companies .
Any investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held-to-maturity even in excess of 25% of total investment permitted under this portfolio .
Additionally , exposures under this facility will not be reckoned under the large exposure framework .
The central bank 's announcement comes at a time when yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 , mainly due to sell-off by mutual funds amid concern over growth in the wake of fast-spreading coronavirus .
" The objective is to provide relief to mutual funds in the secondary market , which are actually facing redemption pressure on their schemes , " said Anil Gupta , the vice-president , financial sector ratings , ICRA .
" To provide them an exit , so yields do n't shoot up and funds will be able to sell to meet the redemption pressure , " " Gupta said .
Despite the ample liquidity in the system , banks have not been deploying funds in debt capital market .
" The design of the new programme and the dispensations on fluctuation risk and exposure limits will hopefully restart banks ' appetite in quality money market and corporate bonds , " said Suyash Choudhary , head -- fixed income at IDFC Asset Management .
The requirement to invest up to 50% fund in the secondary market will also help in improving the liquidity in corporate bond market .
If banks start investing in investment grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool off , bringing down the issuer 's cost in the primary market .
" After a fairly long time , if not first time , the RBI has done something for the corporate bonds to provide liquidity , " Ajay Manglunia , the managing director and head -- institutional fixed income at JM Financial , said .
The move has not only calmed nerves and broke the panic selling cycle but also restored some confidence in the debt market , which was grappling with issues such as credit defaults and ratings downgrade besides the coronavirus scare .
In addition to banks buying bonds from them , the NBFCs can also take advantage of the three-month moratorium on term loans from bank .
The move is expected to help NBFCs , which dominate the corporate debt market , to borrow funds at cheaper rates .
The announcement will bring down the borrowing cost for all issuers , but more so for top-rated issuers , which in any case had better access to funds .
" Banks would be more careful and do due diligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and HFCs ( housing finance companies ) where they already might have credit exposures , " Manglunia said .
The central bank has made it clear that the move was aimed at stabilising financial markets , which had seen heavy sell-off due to deepening worries over the economic impact of coronavirus pandemic .
By providing liquidity to banks to invest in corporate bonds , the central bank has provided a breather to the market .
However , with most places globally and domestically still in lockdown due to the pandemic , restoring normalcy in the market will take some time .
" Hopefully the market will stabilise soon , " said Shameek Ray , senior vice-president and head debt capital markets at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership .
" But I have one word of caution , whether the market will be 100% effective when so many people are working from home .
I do n't expect the market to go back to fully normal from tomorrow .
This is the best way to start , and then we have to take it further when we come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants , operational difficulties due to lockdowns could affect primary issuances of bonds or commercial papers , especially for companies with investment grade rating .
The central bank is trying its best to bring the debt market back on its feet , but the market is unlikely to rebound soon , especially when there are rising concern about recession , globally .
