EXCLUSIVE : Body bags just one emergency resource discussed in a coronavirus disaster management committee meeting with SA state authorities and Indigenous organisations as the COVID-19 outbreak escalated across the nation in early March .
The general manager for the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara ( APY ) on Sunday confirmed that a discussion about body bags , makeshift morgues and body retrieval options from remote areas was had at a state emergency response meeting with SA authorities in the last few weeks .
Speaking with NITV News on Sunday , Richard King said that such discussions , held during a committee meeting that involved SA Health and relevant Indigenous community organisations , were standard practice and good governance when preparing for a potential major disaster .
He said logistical plans had been put in place for a ' worst-case ' scenario should a Covid-19 outbreak occur in Central Australia .
" That is just a general thing that you do when preparing for the reality of it .
If you do n't do that , if you do n't prepare and make sure you have places to store bodies when they pass away .
you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a general thing that you do when preparing for the reality of it .
Mr King said other communicable diseases may linger around human or animal tissue following a potential major disaster , which could make a bad situation worse .
" It 's very dangerous for people on the ground that have to physically go out there and do this work , " he said .
" We ca n't have bodies stacked up in the yard because we have no cool areas to keep them .
We do n't have that luxury .
We did n't have a morgue here .
We have none of that .
"  An asset from the Central Land Council promoting self-isolation to prevent the spread of COVID-19 Source : CLC  Mr King said that typical logistics and preparation for such a potential disaster involved four stages , involving prevention , mitigation , response and recovery .
He said currently the APY Lands were in the ' mitigation ' phase and said he did not expect to enter the ' recovery ' phase for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory governments have implemented heavy new restrictions regarding travel into and between remote Indigenous communities in recent days to stop , or slow , the spread of COVID-19 .
Last week , new areas were designated across the states and territories under the Biosecurity Act 2015 that now require a person wishing to enter to self-quarantine for 14 days before entry can be approved .
Residents who leave their communities are required to spend two weeks in isolation before being able to return .
All unnecessary travel is also either restricted or discouraged in these areas , in line with advised measures in place in regional and metropolitan areas .
In WA , as of midnight Tuesday , non-essential regional travel will not be allowed .
Checkpoints and mobile patrols will be deployed to enforce the restrictions , with those in breach facing fines of up to $50,000 .
Indigenous communities in general are particularly susceptible to the coronavirus due to longstanding disparities in health with the rest of Australia .
While overcrowding in housing and the prevalence of vulnerable elderly community members are significant concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread transmission in the APY Lands could have an devastating impact on community .
Source : APY Land Council  Prepare for the worst , hope for the best  The APY Lands was the first remote community in Australia to close its borders after a decision made by the executive in February , a measure which Mr King said " bought a week or two " in terms of strategic preparation for a ' worst-case ' scenario .
" We have to prepare for the worst and hope for the best , and the reality is , this is going to kill people if it gets in , " he told NITV News on Sunday .
" This virus is not going to discriminate .
If you 're not ready , you 're going to need every bit of body bag you can find .
You 're going to need every .
staff member out there , protected , to do what they have to do .
Because this is going to test our systems , all of us , all around Australia .
"  This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in the APY Lands have described COVID-19 as a crisis waiting to explode in remote areas .
In a signed letter from the Nganampa Health Council addressed to relevant federal and state government ministers , and obtained by NITV News on Monday , the council said that in a worst-case scenario of widespread community transmission , its services would be under-resourced in terms of Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) and nursing staff and would be forced to " shut all clinics , leaving no way to assist the Anangu population " .
" Under current circumstances , once widespread community transmission occurs , there will be no means to sustain the health service network .
We will not be able to quarantine possible infected or proven infected people .
Deaths and impairment will follow , " the letter said .
The letter sought " urgent military assistance " and appealed for " resources related to planning for and responding to the imminent prospect of wide-scale COVID-19 infection in the APY Lands " .
Anxieties and fears  There have been escalating fears and anxieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags after a story was published in The West newspaper , and subsequently in the Daily Mail , about body bags being sent to the Kimberley region of Western Australia .
On Saturday , Edna O'Malley , an Elder from Wijilawarrim-Molly Springs , a remote community near Kununurra in far northern WA , around 37 kilometres from the Northern Territory border , posted an emotional video to Facebook expressing her concerns .
" While we are on lockdown we are hearing that Aboriginal communities in the desert have been handed out body bags for their communities , for their children , in sizes , " Ms O'Malley said .
Later in the video post , Ms O'Malley questions why a community would be delivered body bags if , like her own community , they were not first being aided with supplies and essential items , including cleaning products to prevent transmission of the virus .
In his own Facebook post on Monday responding to the anxiety within community on Monday , WA minister for Finance , Energy and Aboriginal Affairs , Ben Wyatt , said incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made assurances that the WA Government was doing all it could " to stop the spread of COVID-19 to remote Aboriginal communities " .
" WA Country Health Service is preparing all levels of our health service to respond to COVID-19 .
However , that has NOT included increasing bodybag supply to remote communities , " Mr Wyatt said in the post .
NITV News contacted the Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service ( KAMS ) for comment but had not received an official response about its disaster management strategy before publication .
NITV News also contacted South Australia Health for comment .
