LTE : We should shame those who are hoarding  Sunday  They continue to hoard food and paper products despite all the announcements to reassure them that the cows will still be milked , the chickens will lay eggs and Charmin will make toilet paper .
The sad reality is that most of the hoarded food will be thrown away .
I personally put hoarding on the same level as looting .
Perhaps the local stores and the newspaper should get together and post the names of excessive buyers on the front page .
If they happen to have a legitimate reason let them explain it in person to their friends and neighbors .
