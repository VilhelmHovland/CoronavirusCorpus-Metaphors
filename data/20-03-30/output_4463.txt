I am bit of an OCD freak , but it seems that when you stay at home for longer than a day you REALLY start seeing the dust , the chipped paint and the menace of dog hair -- everywhere !  While at home one also seems to use a heck load of crockery , and the most frequently asked question is , " What are we going to have for breakfast/lunch/supper ? '  A lot of time and energy is channeled into ' managing the fort ' , and I do n't know about you , but I seem to be eating more and feel ' snackish ' -- all the time .
I have also lost track of time or what day it is .
So my day four mission was to clean the house -- which began promptly at 8am and went onto about 6pm , I think .
house was turned upside down , and the dogs were sent to spend the day in the front garden .
If anyone has ever tried to clean a house with a pack of seven dogs , they would know , it 's virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll just do a quick sweep and wipe " into a spring clean and then into a deep clean .
I was washing floors twice -- the second time with a detergent .
As I progressed , I started to realise just how untidy the cupboards were and how every window in the house needed to be polished .
" Wax on , wax off " -- the sweat dipping from my brow .
I had a serious arm and leg workout .
Come to think of it , I must have burnt off around 3 000 calories -- or so I 'd like to think ! Now I understand how they can rate housework and gardening as an exercise .
I never sat down once -- staying focused on the goal : kitchen -- do a load of washing -- bedroom -- do a load of washing -- bathroom .
This marathon of cleaning confused the hounds who kept spying on mom -- deeply concerned -- and shooting me that ' when will things ever be normal ' kind of look ! .
