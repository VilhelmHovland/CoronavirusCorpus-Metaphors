Former members have also asked her to contact police , but she wanted to give Gloriavale leaders time to process the information and come up with solutions .
" There are 600 people to think about , so this will require some planning , " she said .
As well as looking at different living arrangements , leaders could enable residents to access Working for Families , enabling them to feed their families .
" They have plenty of options .
"  Gregory said she is certain Gloriavale will not entertain any option which might lead to the breakdown of the strict group , saying leaders will even go so far as to use lawyers to try to interpret the rules , so they can behave differently than the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust general manager and support worker Liz Gregory says she has been contacted by many former members worried about life in the religious community .
( File photo )  " This could be a turning point for Gloriavale , and the leaders will be working hard to turn it in their direction .
They are interested in maintaining control at all costs and they are hoping this virus will help them pull everyone back into line again .
"  " Reports are that the leaders are , not surprisingly , preaching that if they get the virus , the Government will come in and force vaccinations on them or take their children away .
" They 're capitalising on the end-of-the-world paranoia , and the mark of the beast theories , as they have done with other major world events ( 9-11 and the Gulf War ) .
This stuff fits their narrative .
"  A former member said 600 people will be in a self-isolation bubble " and that does n't seem to be what the Government was intending " .

" Two of the newer hostels have some small ensuite bathrooms as well as shared bathroom facilities .

?  Former members said while isolation procedures are in place for things like the ' flu and vomiting bugs , Glorivale 's facilities will not be adequate for a coronavirus case .
Gregory has made contact with many leavers recently to ensure they feel comfortable with the lockdown , and said some were getting into their gardens , while others are looking forward to playing board games , and hanging out as a family .
" They are just hoping and praying that Gloriavale will follow the Government requirements and let their families who are still inside live in a safe little bubble for a while .
"  The Gloriavale community was approached for comment but a member told Stuff " we are not speaking to the media at the moment " .
