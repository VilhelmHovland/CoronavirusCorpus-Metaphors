Sands China gets waivers on US$2bln credit facility  U .
casino operator Las Vegas Sands says its Macau unit , Sands China Ltd , has negotiated a number of amendments to the conditions of a US$2 .
loan facility it holds .
Sands China has an ongoing commitment to spend hundreds of millions of U .
dollars on infrastructure in the Macau casino market .
That market currently has witnessed a sharp fall in revenue amid the novel coronavirus pandemic , which has seen widespread restrictions regionally and globally on tourism and travel .
The revolving unsecured credit facility -- that Sands China had agreed in November 2018 and which is available until July 31 , 2023 -- is with a number of banks , with Bank of China Ltd , Macau Branch , as agent for the lenders .
The newly-stated conditions also envisage the agent and lenders would " waive any default that may arise as a result of any breach of the requirements " even in the restated form .
The changes include : the lenders waiving the requirements for Sands China to ensure that its consolidated leverage ratio on the last day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the consolidated interest coverage ratio on the last day of any financial quarter is greater than 2 .
to 1 .
The lenders also agreed to " extend the period of time during which the company may supply the lenders ' agent with its audited consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended on December 31 , 2019 ; to April 30 , 2020 " ; with a similar relaxation of the deadline to report the 2020 financial-year results -- namely to April 30 , 2021 .
" Pursuant to the waiver letter , the company agreed to pay a customary fee to the lenders , " added the filing .
Sands China did not state in its Friday filing specific reasons for the amendments .
In mid-March Moody 's Investors Service Inc said it had placed Sands China and the latter 's parent under review respectively for possible credit-rating downgrades .
Las Vegas Sands also runs the Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore .
Moody 's had said the review for downgrade had been " prompted by steep declines in visitation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singapore operations , as a result of the spread of the coronavirus that has restricted travel in the region as well as the expected reduced travel , consumer and business activity in the U .
"  Sands China had said in its unaudited annual results filed in Hong Kong on February 21 , that as of December 31 last year , the firm held cash and cash equivalents of US$2 .
billion , " primarily generated " from its operations .
Such cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in Hong Kong dollars and Macau patacas , the firm stated .
In late February another Macau casino operator , MGM China Holdings Ltd , confirmed to GGRAsia it had asked lenders to ease financial covenants related to a HKD9 .
( US$1 .
billion ) credit facility , amid the negative impact on business wrought by the novel coronavirus associated with the Covid-19 disease .
" The junket sector has already been trying its best to answer to the Macau government call not to impose lay-offs .
But some smaller junket firms that are more financially challenged will likely close " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Entertainment Promoters .
