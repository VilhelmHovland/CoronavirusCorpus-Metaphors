You can see a full list of who is eligible for the $550 fortnightly payment here .
Most Centrelink recipients will also receive a one-off payment of $750 from March 31 .
Centrelink reckons most will receive the cash by April 17 , and some people may also receive a second payment of $750 in July .
You can see a full list of who is eligible for the payment here .
How do I get a CRN ?  First things first : you do not need a CRN to lodge your intent to claim .
Do this first on MyGov so that your payments will be backdated to that day .
Now , after you 've lodged your intent to claim , you will need to get a CRN in order for your claim to be processed .
In the past , this involved physically going into a Centrelink service centre and showing ID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Now all you need to do is state your identity over the phone , but this is of course easier said than done .
After you 've lodged your intent to claim , you should call Centrelink 's online accounts hotline on 132 307 .
It operates between 7 AM-10 PM from Monday to Friday , and between 10 AM-5 PM on weekends and public holidays .
Because of the huge influx of new customers , expect to be put on hold for ages .
There 's nothing wrong with your claim , the system is just overwhelmed .
I 've lodged my intent to claim but have n't heard back yet .
When will Centrelink contact me ?  The official line from Centrelink is that you should wait for them to contact you .
We know that many hundreds of thousands of Aussies have already lodged their intent to claim , so there 's a pretty massive backlog to work through .
If you think something has gone wrong in the process , you can in theory ring Centrelink at the relevant phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the phone are totally backed up at the moment .
If you lodged your intent to claim before today , your payments will be backdated to March 23 .
This is the Centrelink 's way of compensating for the fact MyGov had been down for many days .
If you lodged after today , your payments will be backdated to the day you lodged .
This gives you some breathing room to supply the info you need , and for Centrelink to work through the massive influx of new claims .
The best thing to do in most cases is to just wait .
Centrelink is still asking for documents .
Did n't they waive these requirements ?  After a rough start , Centrelink did axe means testing and other requirements during the coronavirus pandemic .
Centrelink applicants now no longer need to provide a bank statement , Employment Separation Certificate or proof of rental arrangement .
If MyGov is forcing you to supply these documents and wo n't let you progress your claim otherwise , you 're in a pickle .
Normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's not really possible at this time .
You may have luck starting your claim over from scratch .
Just be sure you 've already lodged your intent to claim so that the payments are backdated .
The government has already announced that it intends to make changes to means testing , so that your partner 's income wo n't disqualify you from claiming Centrelink payment if you 've lost your job due to the coronavirus pandemic .
While this has not been finalised yet , it is expected to be set at around $70,000 .
If you or your partner also receive Centrelink payments such as the Family Tax Benefit , you will still be able to claim new payments such as the Jobseeker Payment ( formerly known as Newstart ) during the coronavirus pandemic .
This is n't new , as many payments are not mutually-exclusive .
The only way existing payments can affect your eligibility during the coronavirus pandemic is that you will be entitled to additional payments .
For example , people who receive the Family Tax Benefit will automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  I have n't lost my job but my shifts have been reduced .
Am I entitled to anything ?  Yes !  As we 've covered in the past , the claims process has been simplified so that most people earning less than $1,075 a fortnight will be eligible for some kind of payment .
If you 're technically still employed , that 's fine -- you no longer need to provide an Employment Separation Certificate anyway .
I 'm crashing at a mate 's place with no fixed address .
Can I still claim ?  The address you provide to Centrelink is not super important .
Although you might not have a fixed address , your bank account should still have one listed already .
The government has waived the need to supply proof of rental arrangement , which means people informally paying rent to a mate or relative have been spared of an additional hurdle .
During the coronavirus pandemic , it does n't matter what your rent expenses are in order to make a claim .
In terms of receiving important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowadays .
Are new claims being fast-tracked ?  Yes and no .
It 's true that waiting times have been cut .
Previously , if you had over $5,500 in funds as an individual or over $11,000 as a couple , you 'd have to wait between one and 13 weeks before your claim was processed .
Due to the coronavirus pandemic , this has been abolished for the time being .
Services Australia , which oversees Centrelink , Medicare and more , is also in the process of hiring around 5,000 additional staff to speed up processing times .
However , other rumours that certain people 's claims have been " fast-tracked " are not based in fact .
