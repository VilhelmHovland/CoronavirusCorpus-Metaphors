But Mr Frydenberg said it amounted to 70 per cent of the national median wage and " about 100 per cent of the median wage in those sectors most heavily impacted by the coronavirus , such as retail , hospitality and tourism " .
The wage subsidy could also mean a pay rise for casual employees who worked a limited number of hours in the lead up to the crisis .
Some workers could miss out  Gerard Dwyer , the national president of the Shop , Distributive and Allied Employees Association ( SDA ) union -- which looks after retail , fast food and warehousing workers -- said the subsidy would help tens of thousands of retail and fast food workers keep their jobs .
But he urged the government to make the payment available to all casual workers who had lost work because of COVID-19 , as well as Australia 's 1 .
million visa workers .
He also warned that delaying the first payment until the first week of May would result in " more workers stood down and more businesses folding than would be the case if payment began more rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary Sally McManus welcomed the announcement but said it should be expanded to all casual workers and lifted to $1375 a week .
And Innes Willox , chief executive of the nation 's peak industry association Ai Group , said the " well-targeted " stimulus would " boost the employment prospects of many Australians " .
Spending ' swamps ' GFC stimulus  AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said the subsidy , which took the combined value of the federal and state government stimulus packages to roughly $200 billion , or 10 per cent of GDP , would n't prevent a recession but would minimise the number of business closures .
" It wo n't stop the virus and it wo n't boost spending when people are locked up inside such that they ca n't spend as they usually do , " he said .
" But it will help protect the economy from collateral damage by minimising business failures and household defaults , and it will help the economy bounce back when the time comes to emerge from ' hibernation ' .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp that seen at the time of the GFC " .
" This is necessary given that the threat to economic activity is bigger than anything seen in the whole post World War II period with a potential hit to June quarter GDP of 10 per cent or so , " he said .
" More stimulus may still be needed , including as the focus eventually moves from protecting the economy to boosting a recovery once the virus is brought under control .
" This may take the form of direct cash handouts to Australian households .
"  Not the last stimulus package  Meanwhile , Indeed APAC economist Callam Pickering welcomed the announcement but said the size of the economic shock meant the government would need to support the economy for years to come .
" Because history suggests that when you do have a recession -- when you have that big fall in economic activity and the unemployment rate rises a lot -- it takes a long time for the economy to get back to where it was , " Mr Pickering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still going to see a big spike in the unemployment rate -- it 's just a question of how high it gets to .
" And I think perhaps just as important is where does the unemployment rate settle once the dust clears and the economy is allowed to bounce back and businesses can start operating again ?  " Because that is the level that 's really going to determine what our economic experience is like for the next five or 10 years .
that 's how long it took to recover from our last two recessions .
