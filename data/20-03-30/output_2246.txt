WATCH : Premier Ford is asking people not to head north to self-isolate .
There are concerns the more rural areas do n't have the capacity or resources to deal with COVID-19 .
Miranda Anthistle reports from Queen 's Park .
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic , Ontario 's Muskoka District has seen an increase in human traffic from its seasonal residents , leaving some officials concerned that the region 's hospitals wo n't be able to support the increased population .
" There 's small hospitals up here , only so many ICU beds , only so many ventilators , and if for whatever reason we 're so unlucky as to have a run of cases that require hospitalization , those rooms could theoretically fill up pretty quickly .
"  On Friday , Ontario Premier Doug Ford asked urban residents to avoid heading to their cottages during the COVID-19 outbreak .
He said he 's received calls from several cottage country mayors and residents about the issue .
" If a whole bunch of people head up there , the retail stores do n't have the vital essentials to keep the people that live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a press conference Friday .

"  " I think our food supply and our grocery stores were taxed at that point , not just because cottagers were here , but more so because everyone started to worry about COVID-19 , " Muskoka Lakes Mayor Phil Harding said .
According to Smith , however , the region has seen stability in its food supply since then .
" It 's somewhat slowed down , " the Bracbridge mayor said .
" It 's still reasonably busy at the grocery stores and at some of the hardware stores .

The Muskoka Lakes mayor also noted the township saw an increase in residents two weeks ago , which could have been due to March Break , and Smith said he noticed more traffic in the area two weekends ago than he did this past weekend  " Many of our seasonal properties are not accessible this time of year , " Harding said .
" They 're island properties , the ice is in , some of the cottage roads have still not opened up if they were n't plowed or the frost is n't out of the ground yet .
"  And while there 's been controversy over seasonal residents migrating to Ontario cottage country , Smith said the community recently banded together to donate $135,000 for more ICU beds .
" That 's the kind of generosity that we 're thankful for from our seasonal residents , " Smith said , adding that he 's encouraging people to have a plan on where they can get the best care if they become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the directions , " Harding said .
