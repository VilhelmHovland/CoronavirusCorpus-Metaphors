SPONSORED :  The pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson said Monday it had identified a promising candidate vaccine for the coronavirus spreading around the globe and that it expects to begin human trials by September .
The company has partnered with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) to speed research into the new vaccine .
Together , they said they hope to produce more than 1 billion doses for use around the world .
Johnson &amp; Johnson said it anticipated the first batches of a coronavirus vaccine would be ready for use under emergency use authorizations by early 2021 , an almost unprecedented race from initial research to commercially available .

BARDA , an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services , and Johnson &amp; Johnson each plan to invest $1 billion in research , development and clinical testing , they said in a statement Monday morning .
" We have a candidate that has a high degree of probability of being successful against the COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to ramp up production of this in a relatively short period of time so it can become available , " Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said Monday on NBC 's " Today .
