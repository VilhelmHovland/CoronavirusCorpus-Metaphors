Restaurants , bars , pubs and other venues are now being forced to comply with an indoor limit of one person for every four square metres .
The rule will drastically limit the number of people allowed in cafes , restaurants and pubs .
But they can stay open for now .
" If you 've got a room , if you 've got a premise , if you 've got a meeting room or something like that , that 's 100 square metres , then you can have 25 people in that room , " Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday .
" In addition to that , you should continue to practise wherever possible the 1 metre or 1 .

This will require legislation when parliament sits next week to guarantee supply and funding for government programs , but it is unclear just how it will work given Labor will be reluctant to give the government the green light to spend without scrutiny .
