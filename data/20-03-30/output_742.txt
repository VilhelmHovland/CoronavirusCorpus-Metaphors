NEW YORK ( AP ) -- Macy 's , Kohl 's and Gap Inc .
all said Monday they will stop paying tens of thousands of employees who were thrown out of work when the chains temporarily closed their stores and sales collapsed as a result of the pandemic .
Macy 's said the majority of its 125,000 employees will be furloughed this week and that it is transitioning to an " absolute minimum workforce " needed to maintain basic operations .
Macy 's said it has lost the bulk of its sales due to the temporarily closing of more than 600 stores starting March 18 .
Kohl 's , based in Menomonee Falls , Wisconsin , said that the furloughs will apply to 85,000 of its 120,000 employees at stores and distribution centers .
It will continue to ship products and do curbside pickup from most stores with a limited number of staff .
Gap 's spokesman Sandy Goldberg said the furloughs affect nearly 80,000 out of 129,000 employees across all brands , including Banana Republic and Old Navy .
The furloughed workers will continue to collect health benefits .

It is also perhaps the most dramatic sign that even big name retailers are seeing their business evaporate and that the $2 trillion rescue package passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last week may have limited impact .
Nordstrom said last week it was furloughing a portion of its corporate staff .
And shoe company Designer Brands Inc .
, which operates DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse , furloughed 80% of its workers , effective this past weekend .
Analysts expect more furloughs to come as retailers scramble to pay their employees from fast-dwindling cash reserves .
Labor is the single biggest monthly fixed cost for retailers , according to investment research firm Cowen &amp; Co .
The furlough of workers will have negative consequences for an economy in which the retail industry supports one out of four workers .
" This could push us further into a damaging recession that will last longer than the duration of the crisis , " said Neil Saunders , managing director of GlobalData Retail .
More than 190,000 stores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , accounting for nearly 50% of the U .
retail square footage , according to Saunders .
Discounters , grocers and wholesale clubs that sell essential items like groceries remain open , although they have their own challenges of keeping up with shoppers who continue to stockpile canned goods , paper towels and other staples .
According to a recent report by Cowen &amp; Co , department stores have enough cash to make it to about five to eight months with their stores temporarily closed .
Macy 's and Kohl 's , however , have enough for five months , Cowen said .
Penney and Nordstrom are better positioned at eight months of available liquidity , according to Cowen .
When announcing the temporary closures , most retailers said they would keep paying their workers but they were looking at a two-week timetable .
That moment has now passed and the furloughs have become increasingly necessary as the coronavirus rapidly spreads .
The big question is how much of these furloughs will lead to permanent layoffs .

Coresight Research 's Deborah Weinswig now forecasts a new record high of 15,000 stores will close this year , up from her original prediction of 8,000 -- all because of the viral outbreak .
Analysts believe that already ailing stores with heavy debt loads may have to dramatically close more stores or be pushed closer to bankruptcy .
Even before the pandemic , traditional retailers , particularly department stores and mall-based clothing stores , had been struggling to reinvent themselves as shoppers shift more of their purchases online and embrace experiences like cooking classes and subscription services .
Now , the pandemic has forced people to stay home and clamp down on spending for non-essential items like clothing .
Macy 's said that there wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to operate .
Employees who are enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage with the company covering 100% of the premium .
" We expect to bring colleagues back on a staggered basis as business resumes , " Macy 's said .
To survive in the meantime , Macy 's , Kohl 's and others have taken steps to preserve their cash .
That includes suspending their dividend , drawing down their lines of credit , freezing hiring and spending , and cancelling orders .
Macy 's said Monday it is now evaluating all financing options .
