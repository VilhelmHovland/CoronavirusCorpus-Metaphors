' A recipe for stress ' : Psychologist details toll of working from home amid coronavirus  The coronavirus pandemic has an obvious physical impact -- over 60,000 people in the U .
have tested positive for COVID-19 , and more than 1,000 people have died so far in the country -- but there are also psychological effects as well .
In states like New York and California , 100% of the workforce is expected to work from home unless deemed essential .
And while isolation measures are crucial for flattening the curve and containing the spread of the virus , the circumstances negatively affect mental health .

" All of a sudden , there 's been a drastic change from working in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social isolation , sadness , boredom .
Our routines go out the door .
All of these things that we 're used to , disappear .
"  Swody continued : " Especially given the context of a lot of uncertainty , ambiguity , we do n't know how long it 's going to last .
We do n't know how bad it 's going to get .
That 's a recipe for stress , and that leads to physical and psychological health concerns .
"  Coronavirus cases are still on the rise .
( David Foster/Yahoo Finance )  ' August , could be July , could be longer than that '  The U .
has seen an increasing number of coronavirus cases since the first case back in January .
New York City has become the country 's epicenter of the pandemic while other states are following at varying levels of spread .
It still is n't clear when the pandemic and ensuing restrictions will come to an end .

" They 're not only home , but they 're home under scary circumstances .
They may have lost a lot of the structure of their day that they typically have .
They 're together with people -- their family -- but in the setting of being more anxious to get on each other 's nerves .

" They go to work every day and all of a sudden , now they 're not , " he told Yahoo Finance .
" And that could put a stress on relationships , too .
All of a sudden you 're together all the time , which can be great , but sometimes it 's not .
"  Klontz explained that people have an " equilibrium " in their relationships , and that situations like these disrupt it .
" It can go one of two ways , " Klontz said .
" Either people can use it as an opportunity to grow closer , or it becomes a source of conflict and leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Felix while working with her husband Doug Hassebroek at their home , in Brooklyn , New York , U .

( REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs )  ' A hit ' to productivity and performance  Aside from the psychological aspects , Swody said , being forced to work from home in these circumstances could hamper productivity .
" It 's interesting because I think when people volunteer to work from home , they actually tend to be more productive , " she said .
" ' I want to keep this the way it 's going .
Let me demonstrate it .
' Right ? Especially for people who perhaps are a little bit more introverted , or for people who really need to focus because of the nature of their work .
"  For those who write , Swody said this could potentially open up " a new realm " of productivity because of the solitude .
But for a lot of jobs , there will be " a hit " to productivity and performance .

" And a lot of creativity and productivity come from working with other people in an office .
I 'm working by myself and I 'm not having the chit-chat in the hallway with my co-worker and then calling my boss over being like , ' Hey what do you think about this ? ' I 'm working in a vacuum .
And so the end product may not be as good .
So I might have to go back and do it over again , which destroys my productivity .
"  Another barrier to productivity is the natural distraction of family members in close quarters .

" A lot of people are absorbing a large volume of information , and that can be distracting too .

For managers , " communication is more important than ever , " she said .
" And no matter how busy you are as a boss , those regular touchpoints are so important .
Taking time out to talk to each individual on your team on a regular basis is important .
By regular , I mean daily , every other day .
Have a regular checkpoint where you can just talk to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on at home .
"  She continued : " Just give people a moment to be human and not just be a robot .
People really need that social connection .
And to go along with that , get the group together .
Find a way to get the group together virtually , and if possible , some type of video conferencing .
"  Swody suggested a virtual happy hour or something " with that water cooler vibe " so that people do n't feel " like robots " and can still maintain " some semblance of " human-to-human connection .
"  As for individual employees , aside from good communication as well , Swody stressed that " routine is our friend .
"  " Routine is good , " she said .
" Psychologically , we 're just such creatures of habit and it 's so ingrained in us .
As much as we 'd like to stay in our pajamas all day and work from our bed , that may not be best for our health long term , psychologically or physically .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clothes ( even if it 's daytime pajamas ) , and " cue the brain " to remind yourself to focus and get work done .
" I 'd also recommend you 've identified a time where you 're going to step away from the laptop , because a lot of people who work from home have a hard time doing that , and then you do n't get that break from work and home , and it just all blurs together , and that 's not good for us psychologically either , " Swody said .
" We need to have a little bit of distance .
So being able to disengage at the end of the workday too is really healthy .
And then we can change back into our pajamas .
That 's really good for maintaining our well-being .
