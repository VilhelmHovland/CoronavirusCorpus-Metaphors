Last week , specialist nose and throat doctors urged ministers to recognise loss of smell and taste as an official sign of the deadly illness .
The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology ( ENT UK ) , which represents ear , nose and throat experts around the country , say they have seen a ' significant ' number of patients suffering from these effects of Covid-19 .
ENT UK say medics across the world have reported rising numbers of people in the past month saying they have anosmia - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The organisation says it has told Public Health England about the apparent link .
Meanwhile , the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) also said it is investigating the link between loss of smell and taste and Covid-19 .
It 's thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat .
Experts say it 's something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold .
Prof Carl Philpott , of the Norwich Medical School at UEA , said : " Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss -- this is smell loss that persists after a cold .
" There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors .
" So far with Covid-19 , the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss .
"  Cases rise  Meanwhile , there has been almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the number of people being treated for coronavirus in England 's hospitals , according to new figures .
Sir Simon Stevens , chief executive of NHS England , said on Friday that more than 6,200 patients were in hospital with Covid-19 .
But on Monday , he said this figure had jumped to more than 9,000 .
6  Scientists have produced a day-by-day breakdown of the typical Covid-19 symptoms  It comes as 1,408 people are now confirmed to have died in UK hospitals after testing positive for Covid-19 , as of 5pm on Sunday .
This is up 180 from the 1,228 the day before .
Earlier the head of the Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ) said around one in four NHS doctors are off work sick or in isolation .
Public Health England ( PHE ) also announced that almost 11,000 coronavirus tests a day can now be carried out .
The Government had set a target of carrying out 10,000 tests a day by Sunday but PHE figures show 9,114 had been carried out as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time on Sunday .
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) will this week release figures on deaths involving Covid-19 in the wider community , such as care homes .
The ONS will look at deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned anywhere on the death certificate , including in combination with other health conditions .
These figures are likely to inform a truer picture of how many people have died after being diagnosed with coronavirus , rather than just looking at deaths in hospitals .
Speaking on a visit to the new NHS Nightingale Hospital on the ExCeL site in east London , Sir Simon said that the number of patients will increase , but extra capacity is being made available .

That 's what this is about .
