Letters to the editor , March 31  Virtual learning is vital  The U .
has been putting many measures in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 , but how many deaths have they prevented ? We will not know until the virus has run its course , but we are unlikely to witness the 1 .
million to 2 .
million deaths the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had predicted would occur if we did not take preventative measures .
One of those mitigating measures is closing schools .
Students should be out of school until the coronavirus is under control -- but no longer .
Virtual learning is just like normal school but done on a computer at home .
Most students have personal devices or school-issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no computer devices , they could check out technology from school .
For students with no Wi-Fi , many data providers are offering discounted Wi-Fi .
Distance learning is equivalent to classroom learning .
Online students get the same interactions as classroom students with their teachers and classmates through video conferencing platforms , which allow teachers to instruct students directly and students to ask questions .
Learners complete assigned work in an online site/link and then hit submit to send the work to their teachers , who can share the graded work through the same site/link .
Schools are germ pools because they are crowded and because of all the kids touching each other and each other 's items .
COVID-19 spreads very easily in this type of environment .
If schools reopen too soon , many kids will be infected and will infect many adults , contributing to a high death rate .
