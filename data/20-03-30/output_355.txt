Florida schools are responding differently to the pandemic than other states  A massive push to keep instruction going online separates the Sunshine State from places like Michigan , Virginia , Alabama and Kansas .
Was it the right call ?  Florida education commissioner Richard Corcoran disagrees with states like Michigan , which have closed schools in response to the coronavirus and will not count student work until they reopen .
" That 's not who we are as Americans , " he said .

* * *  Christina Ottersbach watches with a degree of disbelief as Florida embarks on its version of school closures during the coronavirus pandemic .
A special education teacher in Hernando County , she has concerns about how she will help her students , all of whom have individualized plans that might or might not work remotely .
Her inability to get a steady internet signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her middle school sons ' needs to get online for classes -- only compounds her skepticism .
Add to that her limited family support system , personal anxiety and relative lack of training in distance teaching , and , well , it 's pretty clear .
The veteran educator struggles to fathom how Florida 's plan to hold required , graded online education with a closure order that expires April 15 makes sense -- especially in light of what other states are doing .
Michigan , where Ottersbach has friends teaching , ordered all its schools closed for three weeks and stated any distance learning that takes place during that time would not count toward required instructional time .
Virginia closed its schools for the remainder of the academic year , and gave districts the option of providing additional teaching as long as they guarantee equitable opportunities for all students .
" Florida does n't seem to be in touch with reality , " said Ottersbach , who like many , preferred to just call off the current school year and pick up again when the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happening .
"  Leaders in the state Department of Education do n't see it that way at all .
Commissioner Richard Corcoran said his team never gave a thought to shutting down the system for the remaining weeks of class .
" We 're following the CDC guidelines .
We 're going to reevaluate it every 15 days , " said Corcoran , a lawyer and former House speaker was nominated for commissioner just over a year ago by Gov .
Ron DeSantis .
If Florida were to see a significant " flattening of the curve " of the virus ' spread , he said , it could make sense to reopen schools in time to finish the academic year in actual classrooms .
The next review is scheduled for April 15 .
He hinted that a return is n't out of the question , stating that Singapore did n't send its students home , its leaders deciding the action would do more harm than good .
Some people need to be isolated , and everyone should protect themselves , he said , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about living your life .
"  Corcoran has agreed to call off all state testing for the year , along with all of the attached accountability measures .
That way , he said , if and when in-person classes resume , teachers and students can spend their time on curriculum rather than worrying about assessments .
" They 'll be learning every day .
That 's a great thing , " he said , quickly adding that test-based accountability will return in normal times .
The state also has put out the word that the school year could be extended through June to get all the curriculum covered , though Corcoran had nothing but positives for the educators who ramped up a distance learning system that he deemed a " great solution to the predicament that we 've found ourselves in .
"  As for the Michigan model of shutting down school and not counting any of the work that students do until classes resume , that was a complete non-starter for the man making the call for Florida 's schools .
" That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , suggesting such a move would sell students short and undervalue teachers .
" What Michigan has done is throw up the white flag in surrender as no state should .
"  Like Florida , Michigan closed schools for several weeks , and sought a federal waiver to call off required annual tests .
But unlike Florida , Michigan has a Democrat as governor .
Its actions have taken a different tone than those who have looked for ways to stem the virus ' spread with something less than a full-blown shutdown .
Shortly after classrooms shut down , the Michigan Department of Education issued a memo that encouraged distance learning , but did n't require it as Florida has .
And it stated that the lessons would be for enrichment .
" There is no mechanism to earn instructional time during a period of mandated school closure , " the department stated .
" However , schools can and are encouraged to offer supplemental learning opportunities to students using distance learning methods as they see fit .
"  A spokesman for the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than making additional comments .
He noted that the situation remains fluid , and the state is changing its approach as needed .
The memos coming out of the Michigan agency stress the importance of access for everyone before any transition to full online instruction .
Gretchen Whitmer did say she would take steps to ensure seniors graduate on time , and no child is held back because of the situation .
" We do not know what the future will hold , but we are absolutely committed to ensuring the needs of our students , parents , and families are met as we navigate these uncharted waters , " Whitmer said in a statement .
Virginia , which also has a Democratic governor but in a more " purple " state , went a different direction .
It closed all schools for the remainder of the academic year -- an action similar to Kansas and Alabama -- and then gave its districts options for how to provide students " with equitable opportunities and instruction covering required course content .
without disrupting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , over the summer or into the next school year .
Like Florida , Virginia waived some graduation requirements for high school seniors who were on track to a diploma .
It canceled its spring exams , as well .
And in a move between Florida and Michigan , Virginia has encouraged individual districts -- which the state calls divisions -- to provide students with opportunities to keep learning .
" We are advising school divisions not to grade that work .
unless they are able to do that in a way that is equitable for all students , " Virginia Department of Education spokesman Charles Pyle said .
" It has to include students with disabilities and English language learners .
We want school divisions to keep students engaged , but we also want them to be mindful of their responsibility to serve all students .
"  Virginia , as Florida , has a wide variety of communities from the small rural to the densely urban .
So the state has tried not to prescribe a single approach for any one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
Regardless of location , relative wealth , size or types of students served , none of the divisions appear able to provide the full equitable access that 's desired .
Three states , three approaches .
Is any one of them more right than the other ?  University of Wisconsin education professor Gloria Ladson-Billings , president of the National Academy of Education , is a strong advocate for accessibility and equity in education .
She can speak at length about the challenges that poorer communities face just in annual summer learning loss , not to mention the disparities inherent between those families with technology and home stability vs .
those without .
Her take on the entire situation : Who knows ?  " I can see the arguments on both sides , " Ladson-Billings said .
Florida spent years investing in classroom technology , for instance , and might have enough equipment to bridge the divide by providing materials to families .
Michigan might not have a similar ability .
Both might change their efforts as they learn more , just as Philadelphia city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance instruction and then switching gears amid a community uproar , she said .
" We all know this is not the same as instruction in a classroom .
I do n't think anybody is trying to make it that , " Ladson-Billings said .
" What people are trying to do is ensure there are not learning losses .
"  And truth be told , she said , no one really knows what will work in this new dynamic .
" That 's the most honest thing we can say , " she said .
" We have never had anything like this before .
"  She expressed hope that , as schools go about their business , they do n't lose track of the stress that isolation can cause , which could lead to potential child abuse .
" Some of our kids are going to be in some very difficult situations , " she said , as they no longer have the safe haven that school has provided up to now .
