This is the international day of remembrance and action for workers killed , disabled , injured or made unwell by their work .
The focus this year is of course the global COVID-19 pandemic .
While everyone is affected by the crisis , workers are on the front line .
" Healthcare workers in particular are risking their lives doing their job to take care of the sick .
There are people working in aged care facilities looking after the most vulnerable group of people .
But then we also need transport , supermarket workers , and providers of for essential services , to keep the economy going .
People should thank these workers because if you ca n't buy food , then you ca n't keep your family sustained and healthy " said Sharan Burrow .
