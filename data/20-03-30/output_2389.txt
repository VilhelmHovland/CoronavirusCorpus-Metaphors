Science doubts accuracy of in-a-minute test results  3 days ago  MADRID , March 28 , ( AP ) : Some political leaders are hailing a potential breakthrough in the fight against COVID- 19 : simple pin-prick blood tests or nasal swabs that can determine within minutes if someone has , or previously had , the virus .
The tests could reveal the true extent of the outbreak and help separate the healthy from the sick .
But some scientists have challenged their accuracy .
Hopes are hanging on two types of quick tests : antigen tests that use a nose or throat swab to look for the virus , and antibody tests that look in the blood for evidence someone had the virus and recovered .
The tests are in short supply , and some of them are considered unreliable .
" The market has gone completely mad , " Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa said Thursday , lamenting the lack of face masks , personal protection equipment and rapid tests " because everybody wants these products , and they want the good ones .
"  The Spanish government on Friday said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a Chinese producer because the first 8,000 proved fl awed .
It said the producer agreed to replace the returned tests and another 582,000 tests ordered with kits that would meet requirements .
Chinese authorities said Thursday that the manufacturer did not have a license to sell the products .
But Spain said the company did have permission to do so in Europe and the kits came with European Union certificates .
The Spanish government initially said 9,000 tests , not 8,000 , had proved unreliable .
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week called the rapid tests a " game changer " and said his government had ordered 3 .
million of them .
The UK hopes the tests will allow people who have had COVID-19 and recovered to go back to work , safe in the knowledge that they are immune , at least for now .
That could ease the country 's economic lockdown and bring back healthcare workers who are being quarantined out of fears they may have the virus .
Many scientists have been cautious , saying it 's unclear if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months , much of the testing has involved doctors sticking something akin to a long cotton swab deep into a patient 's nose or throat to retrieve cells that contain live virus .
Lab scientists pull genetic material from the virus and make billions of copies to get enough for computers to detect the bug .
Results sometimes take several days .
Rapid antigen tests have shorter swabs that patients can use themselves to gather specimens .
They are akin to rapid fl u tests , which can produce results in less than 15 minutes .
They focus on antigens -- parts of the surface of viruses that trigger an infected person 's body to start producing antibodies .
Health authorities in China , the United States and other countries have offered few details on the rates of false positive and false negative results on any coronavirus tests .
Experts worry that the rapid tests may be significantly less reliable than the more time-consuming method .
Lower accuracy has been a concern with rapid fl u tests .
Spanish scientists said the rapid tests for coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more established lab tests were about 84 percent accurate .
Those results " would prevent its routine introduction , " according to a report by the Spanish Society of Infectious Disease and Clinical Microbiology that triggered the alarms in Spain and spurred the government 's rejection of the 58,000 antigen tests .
Similar questions swirl around new antibody tests involving blood samples .
Some versions have been described as finger-prick tests that can provide important information in minutes .
Antibody tests are most valuable as a way of seeing who has been infected in the recent past , who became immune to the disease and -- if done on a wide scale -- how widely an infection has spread in a community .
The antibody tests also will allow scientists to get a better understanding of how deadly coronavirus is to all people , because they will provide a better understanding of how many people were ever infected , ranging from those who never showed symptoms to those who became fatally ill .
The results will also guide vaccine development .
But so much is unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who the blood tests should be used on .
" We do n't have all the answers , " said Dr Robin Patel , president of the American Society for Microbiology .
For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .
Most people recover .
More than 15 companies have notified the US Food and Drug Administration that they have developed antibody tests , the agency said .
The companies are permitted to distributing the tests to hospitals and doctors ' offices , provided they carry certain disclaimer statements , including :  " This test has not been reviewed by the FDA .
" In Spain , the government sought the rapid tests for use first in hospitals and nursing homes , where efforts to halt the spread of the virus have been hampered by widespread infections among health workers .
Hopes about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partially dashed , in the UK Sharon Peacock , director of the national infection service at Public Health England , told lawmakers this week that the tests would be available in the " near future " for purchase through Amazon for use at home or to have completed in a pharmacy .
" We need to evaluate them in the laboratory to be clear , because these are brandnew products , " she said , explaining that the evaluation should be completed this week .
She said " further millions " were being ordered on top of the 3 .
million the government had already bought .
But England 's chief medical officer , Chris Whitty , urged caution .
" I do not think , and I want to make this clear , that this is something you will suddenly be ordering on the internet next week , " Whitty told a news conference Wednesday .
" The one thing worse than no test is a bad test .
" If they are incredibly accurate , we will work out the quickest way to release them .
If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " he said .
The prime minister 's spokesman was unable to say Thursday how much the UK had paid for the tests , which come from several suppliers , or whether the money would be refunded if they turned out to be unreliable .
The chief scientist at the World Health Organization said wider testing would allow health officials to pinpoint infections in people who appear healthy but may be carrying the virus .
" We know that if you really go out and test everyone in the community , you 're going to find people walking around with this virus in their nose who do not feel at all ill , " Dr Soumya Swaminathan said in an interview .
WHO believes most transmissions of the virus occur through people who already show symptoms , but " the question is still open " about how asymptomatic people may spread infection , Swaminathan said .
