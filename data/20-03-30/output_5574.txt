Quarantine expert Omar Abdullah has a lot of ' survival tips ' based on personal experience  Staying home for days on an end was a dream come true for many , something we have all wished for at some or the other point in time .
Well , at least until it actually happened .
On Wednesday , India went into a nearly absolute lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus .
People are being strongly discouraged from leaving their houses and all outlets save those providing essential services have been shut .
Now to be fair , this is n't an option for everyone .
Doctors and others working in the health sector continue to put their lives on the line to fight the virus , while essential personnel such as the police , those providing food and other essential items , and so on continue to work .
Nor does being home mean that you are doing nothing .
Nonetheless , the solitude may get to you after a day or two .
Ennui sets in and anxious thoughts may crowd your head .
Former Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through every stage .
While many of us have been cowed by the prospect of a 21 day lockdown , Abdullah recently spent 232 days in detention , nearly 8 months .
" If anyone wants tips on surviving quarantine or a lock down I have months of experience at my disposal , perhaps a blog is in order , " he had written on Twitter after being released .
Seemingly , he received an affirmative response , and has since shared a few of the tricks that he had employed while captive at the Hari Niwas Sub-Jail .
The response to the tweet has encouraged me to share a bit of my own experience .
It will probably sound rather self evident but it really helped me over the months of solitary detention .
I ? ? ? ll keep adding tweets to this thread as things come to mind so keep checking back .
2/n  The first step , as per Abdullah , is to establish a routine and then stick to it .
" In all the months I was in HNSJ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though it were carved in stone .
The routine gave me a sense of purpose and stopped me feeling aimless or lost , " ' he recounted .
Fix your meal times &amp; stick to them .
I ate my meals on my own .
Put it down to the habit of boarding school &amp; my need for structure For me it was breakfast at 8:30 , lunch at 2 &amp; dinner at 7:30 with a mug of coffee at 12 ( after the doctor had checked my BP ) &amp; evening tea at 6 .
5/n  The second point , Abdullah said , was to exercise frequently and repeatedly .
" I ca n't emphasise this point enough .
I was fortunate to have space and access to the grounds in HNSJ to get outside but even when the weather did n't permit I exercised indoors - walking in the corridor , up and down the stairs or just endless burpees , " he wrote .
He also added that he had used apps where he had earlier downloaded workouts .
" Nike Training Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ) were great for workouts of varying intensity and equipment levels , " he added .
I used a couple of apps which were really helpful because I had workouts downloaded on them earlier .
Nike Training Club &amp; Fitbod ( both on iOS &amp; probably Android as well ) were great for workouts of varying intensity &amp; equipment levels .
7/n  While these updates had been posted a few days ago , on Sunday Abdullah took to Twitter to talk about anxiety .
" Day 5 : By now anxiety is a major problem , " he wrote .
And many might be able to relate to his description of feeling " claustrophobic or trapped in an open room " .
Fresh air , he added had really helped .
" Deep breaths near an open window , " he advised .
Another suggestion was the use of apps such as Headspace and Calm , or simply soft music and deep breathing .
There a couple of apps that are very useful to help deal with anxiety .
Two that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in-app purchases but the free content is also very useful .
Otherwise just some soft music &amp; deep breathing will help enormously .
