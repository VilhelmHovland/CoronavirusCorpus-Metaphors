5 things that wo n't change in the post-coronavirus economy  The longer the coronavirus pandemic persists , the more it shakes our belief in linear progress .
From 9/11 to the financial crisis to the current global pandemic , we have experienced a major global shock roughly every 10 years .
And each time , there are unanimous cries that " everything will change .
"  Yet numerous trends that were underway before the current global shutdown began will not only continue , but accelerate .
Here are five such undercurrents that will be reinforced by the pandemic .
If nothing else , this list should give us a more confident view of the world of tomorrow .
China will be less dominant  The propaganda war is already at a fever pitch : US president Donald Trump has tentatively said he 'll avoid calling the Covid-19 respiratory disease the " Chinese virus " ( secretary of state Mike Pompeo prefers " Wuhan virus " ) , while China is asserting its statesmanship by supplying surgical masks , testing kits , and ventilators to countries in need -- including Italy and the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaration as Europe tries to play nice .
But even as China demonstrates its strong capacity to beat back the virus and help others ,  Yes , the world knows where the virus first broke out .
But across Asia and the rest of the world , trust in China was falling well before the pandemic hit .
Its military aggression in the South China Sea and dominance of big infrastructure contracts as part of its Belt and Road Initiative have been raising suspicions from Kenya to Pakistan , Sri Lanka to Myanmar .
These and other countries had begun to scale back big ticket Chinese dams , power plants , and railways at least since 2017 in order to control costs and negotiate for a bigger share of the pie for their own companies .
Europe , Japan , India , and the US also launched their own competing ventures to fund infrastructure such as the EU 's " Asia Connectivity Initiative .
" At a time when countries ca n't afford China 's high interest rates , alternatives to China will be even more welcome .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Silk Roads , ultimately fracturing the Mongols ' vast empire , so too will the coronavirus lead to China 's a lessened dominance across Eurasia .
Furthermore China 's demographic and economic trajectories are peaking .
The country 's population is aging and near its plateau , and its economy is slowing .
Its response to the virus proves that it makes almost everything its own people need ; the lesson to others is to do the same .
India ( whose population is equivalent to China 's , but much younger ) and the rest of Southeast Asia ( which adds another 700 million young people ) combine to receive more foreign investment into their low-wage workforces and fast-growing markets than China , indicating that supply chains began shifting out of China well before the virus .
And now , that trend will only speed up .
Regionalism = the new globalism  The coronavirus pandemic has proved beyond any doubt how interconnected our lives are .
The novel coronavirus is only the most recent of several shocks to global supply chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reliance on foreign imports for critical supplies , such as medical equipment and pharmaceuticals .
In 1999 , the devastating Taiwan earthquake led to shortfalls in semiconductor supplies .
But the near-shoring of at least some manufacturing has been underway since the mid-2010s , when America 's shale energy boom drastically brought down the price of oil and American firms grew frustrated with Chinese industrial policy and theft of foreign technology .
The trade war with China then kicked off in 2017 , resulting in Mexico becoming America 's top trading partner by 2019 , with $309 billion worth of trade , and Canada coming in second at $306 billion -- both ahead of China 's $271 billion .
As a region , North America is far more self-sufficient ( and less trade dependent ) than other regions due to its large combined population of nearly 500 million abundant natural resources , massive financial wealth , and industrial and technological base .
Trump may not like NAFTA , but the continent has effectively become a North American Union .
This mirrors what has already been true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and China were practicing their own versions of Trump 's " Buy American , Hire American " campaign long before he entered the White House .
To compete more with the US and China , Europe last year launched a giant program to bolster strategic industries from clean energy to semiconductors .
Seventy percent of Europe 's trade is within the European Union ( something Brexit supporters probably should have noted before their 2016 referendum ) .
In Asia , the figure has climbed to 60% on the back of major trade agreements such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership .
Migration and investment are also far more regional than global .
You can safely bet that will be even more the case after the pandemic .
That said , globalization is far from dead .
Countries trade abundantly in food , fuel , automobiles , and electronics , to name just a few areas contributing to the world 's $20 trillion in annual trade and trade in digital services -- bits rather than atoms .
This continues to surge as we exchange software , music , video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as countries practice beggar-thy-neighbor policies thus reinforcing their own industry at the expense of others ' , many large multinational companies depend on foreign markets for half or more of their revenue .
Where would Apple or GE 's share price be without iPhone or car sales in Europe and Asia ? Especially because the US has not joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement , American companies actually have to invest more in Asia to access its sizable markets .
The objective for global supply chains is therefore the same as before the pandemic : Make it where you sell it .
Automation will accelerate  Who will be doing the making ? As before the pandemic , the answer is , increasingly , robots .
Labor automation has been a significant factor in the global economy for more than a decade ( and studies emphasize that it has caused far more job losses than outsourcing ) .
Germany , Japan , South Korea , and China are among the countries with already high ratios of robots per human worker , and while they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance will ever more favor machines -- especially after the pandemic .
Consider South Korea 's chief carmaker Hyundai , which suffered the double whammy of dependency on car parts made in Wuhan and a high infection rate that forced it to stop production at its plants .
Moving forward , it is certain to invest even more in automation , both to near-shore production and decrease dependency on virus-prone human labor .
China and other countries will likely do the same .
In America , the near-shoring revival will be powered by cheap oil and accelerated deployment of industrial robotics .
Apple recently announced the opening of a new factory near Austin , Texas , to manufacture MacBook Pro computers ( although there 's some controversy as it 's reportedly been operational since 2013 ) .
But in due course , as with Taiwan-based Foxconn 's assembly lines that make Apple products , the Texas plant too will be nearly fully automated , as will manufacturing plants in China .
With the US 's large share of workers in transportation , retail , hospitality , manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply vulnerable well before the coronavirus caused the current economic standstill and spike in jobless claims .
Though Amazon has promised to hire 100,000 workers to aid in deliveries , it is also one of the companies investing the most in automating its warehouses and distribution channels .
And this week , that same Amazon workforce and other delivery workers announced a strike to call for better wages and protection , including reliable personal protective gear .
With the economy contracting and profits shrunk , corporations will in the long run tend even more toward reducing their labor costs through automation , leaving the task of supporting the population ever more to the government rather than to the private sector .
Fiscal policy will be an economic crutch  Main Street is finally getting the bailout it never received after the financial crisis .
G20 governments have pledged to do " whatever it takes " to counteract the staggering effects of the virus , including providing $5 trillion in immediate stimulus including tax cuts , cash transfers , bridge loans for businesses , and bailouts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater fiscal support for the masses , whether in the form of higher minimum wages or universal basic income , has been mounting since the Occupy Wall Street movement formed in response to stagnant median wages , high student debt , weak housing price growth , and retirement portfolios suppressed by low interest rates .
The pandemic has only compounded the pre-existing misery and desire for radical policies that fueled the campaigns of Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren , and Andrew Yang .
This entire process is often referred to as " Japanification " -- and it 's more or less been the norm in Europe since the financial crisis ; now Japanification has formally arrived in the US , too .
Big government is here to stay .
Some see a silver lining in the significant asset price correction that is to come , proposing that corporate bailouts come with strings attached , such as preferred stocks granted to the public so that ordinary citizens can benefit from an eventual economic recovery .
But this wo n't be enough to get most Americans off the crutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require for the next decade or more .
From gig workers to baby boomers , new job creation in social services , education , and many other sectors will fundamentally depend on public finance in one way or another .
For those who do n't get the unemployment benefits or social support they need , the only choice left will be to move somewhere else .
More people will move  This may seem ironic given today 's widespread border closures and standstill in global transportation , but as the curtain lifts , people will seek to relocate from poorly governed and ill-prepared " red zones " to " green zones , " or places with good medical care .
Or , people may relocate to places where involuntary quarantine , whenever it strikes next , is n't so torturous .
Both domestic and international migration were surging before the pandemic , with Gen-Xers and millennials shifting to cheaper second-tier cities in the Sun Belt or abroad to Latin American and Asia in search of an affordable life .
Once quarantines lift and airline prices stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongings and buy one-way tickets to counties or countries cheap enough to start fresh .
At the higher end of the value chain , telecommuting has long been the norm ; now it has been thrust upon the entire corporate world .
This will allow talented remote workers to justify becoming even more remote as they move to places offering higher quality of life , lower taxes , and equal , if not better , connectivity .
There 's also been talk that the coronavirus signals a deepening of nationalism and xenophobia .
Do n't bet on it .
With a stagnant or shrinking tax base and aging populations to support , countries from the US and Canada to the UK and Germany have long faced worker shortages for nurses , teachers , and other roles that today 's domestic unemployed are n't qualified for .
Shortly before he was excused from his position as White House chief of staff , Mick Mulvaney stated that America is " desperate for more people , " urging more ( " legal " ) immigrants to help fuel economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , even populist governments will finally wake up and realize that hard-working immigrants are the solution , not the problem .
And the contest for talent will pull people across borders more than ever .
The coronavirus pandemic has proved beyond any doubt how interconnected our lives are .
As a result , humankind is experiencing unprecedented common focus on the same challenges , evoking coordinated response across hundreds of nations and billions of people .
That in itself is something remarkable to behold .
But we should n't forget that well before the pandemic , geopolitical tensions , a broad economic slowdown , aging populations , high debt levels , technological disruptions , and climate change were already conspiring to shift supply chains , populations , and public policy .
All of these factors -- not the pandemic alone -- will continue to shape the global future .
If one can encapsulate the picture that results from the confluence of today 's colliding vectors , it would be a neo-medieval world in which empires , cities , and companies compete for authority and offer varying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded us that we seek physical and financial security above all else , but also that connectedness -- both local and global -- is as much an element of that security as ever .
