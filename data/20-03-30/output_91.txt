They will be allowed to be printed and distributed via dairies and other collection points .
Periodical publications like magazines will remain ' non-essential ' .
" Where people can provide their community information online we ask them to focus on that mode of publication .
but we accept there may be remote communities and non-English language communities who may not be accessing information through other means , " Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said .
" I do acknowledge that the media will be significantly affected by the financial impact of Covid-19 .
"  MediaRoom column : A decision to block publication of community newspapers under the State of Emergency could be changed tomorrow .
Tim Murphy reports .
A decision to stop community newspapers from circulating in the country 's suburbs , towns and settlements appears to have been an example of officials scratching their regulatory itch .
On Friday , without consultation , newspapers and magazines that do not come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of essential services , leaving many community-driven newspapers and ethnic minority publications unable to be printed or distributed .
This was done in the name of safety - there being allegedly too much risk in their production at print works and in the delivery to people 's homes - and because they were supposedly not supplying vital , urgent information to the public .
News media are exempt from industry closedowns because of the need for information to be issued widely and regularly to the public .
Today , the silencing of the community presses was among the issues discussed by Cabinet 's Covid-19 committee when it considered the ambit of ' essential services ' .
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at her daily briefing she expected to announce a decision on Tuesday , which would be contingent on publishers agreeing to safety issues for staff , work from home and hygiene practices .
She acknowledged many people obtained vital local information from the community titles .

It could be that rural delivery of newspapers direct to properties is also permitted .
The media industry , including the Community Newspapers Association ( CNA ) , had pushed back hard on the ban , arguing community papers provide just the sort of advice and information needed for readers in a time of crisis .
The Free Speech Coalition has even threatened to take court action to challenge the decision .
Many community papers have an online presence and would try to keep their readers informed via the internet , but the physical paper is considered to have a strong bond with older readers and in some districts those who can not or do not receive broadband and therefore a digital news service .
Stephan Bosman , the owner and editor of The Mercury Bay Informer which serves the top part of the Coromandel Peninsula from Whitianga , told Newsroom the sudden downturn in advertising had made his business hard enough , but the ban on distributing printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's more like running into a bulldozer and then being pushed backwards " .
He had worked with the CNA , and contacted his local MP National 's Scott Simpson , in a bid to have the decision reversed .
He had also contacted the Ministry of Business , Innovation and Employment but received no reply .
Bosman had hoped for a reprieve from the Cabinet discussions - and was working towards the compromise where community papers could be printed but then left at designated pick-up spots for readers to collect .
At the same time , he has had to find a back-up print works as his normal supplier might not have sufficient customer demand to reopen .
Coromandel 's northern paper could end up being printed in the South Island .
Whitianga and Mercury Bay readers were supportive on Facebook .
One , Rohit Ranchhod , told Bosman : " Fighting the good fight , as always .
Well done ? ? ? ? keep it up .
The community needs access to its local news .
"  Another , Melanie Orbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on businesses in the region : " Thanks to you also looking into the business side of things with Scott Simpson - this has been overlooked ! No one seems to want to talk about it ! "  Bosman said , if approved , he would print at his and his wife 's own expense if necessary .
" Important to note is that our cashflow has reduced to less than a trickle .
We probably have only 20 percent of the advertising we normally have .
My wife and I have decided to print ( if we can ) in order to keep on providing our community with what almost everyone ( but not everyone ) believes is an essential service .
I doubt we 'll cover our printing and distribution costs with the amount of advertising we have .
"  The CNA represents nearly 80 newspapers nationwide .

Their immediate fate is less clear .
