As coronavirus cases rise , here are the challenges Michigan faces in setting up field hospitals  Governor Gretchen Whitmer joined Grand Valley State University President Philomena V .
Mantella ( far right ) and Tina Freese Decker , president and CEO of Spectrum Health , on the tour of Cook-DeVos Center for Health Sciences located on GVSU 's Health Campus , across from Spectrum Health 's Butterworth Campus on Michigan Street , the Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley-Mills , Grand Valley State University )  As local , state and federal officials scour Michigan for sites that could be transformed into coronavirus overflow hospitals , experts in dealing with mass disasters warn of the mammoth task ahead that 's filled with logistical nightmares and severe staffing shortages .
Already , TCF Center in Detroit has been selected to become a 900-bed field hospital for COVID-19 cases for at least six months , leading to the cancellation of the 2020 North American International Auto Show .
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) will pay for the transformation of TCF and supply the site with the necessary medical equipment and beds .
But dozens of other sites across the region are also under consideration .
And the task ahead will be enormous , with the federal government stretched thin nationwide .
" There are field hospitals being constructed at the same time that you have the double whammy of overwhelmed existing facilities and maxed out staff .
And some of the staff are being taken out because they become afflicted themselves , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida hospitals who helped lead the effort to operate temporary field hospitals and rebuild three Florida hospitals in the aftermath of Hurricanes Andrew in 1992 and Irma in 2017 .
" It 's almost like you 're simultaneously experiencing the storm and waiting for the storm at the same time .
"  To deal with one of the biggest challenges -- staffing shortages -- Michigan State University is looking to certify at least 300 of the school 's 500 medical and osteopathic school students who will graduate this spring and get them immediately working to help treat patients .
Other steps underway to deal with the pandemic :  Grand Valley State University has almost completed turning one of its health profession classroom buildings in Grand Rapids into an alternative site for Spectrum Health to use if and when its downtown hospital reaches capacity because of a surge in coronavirus patients .
The University of Michigan is looking at converting empty dorms into facilities for overtaxed health care professionals who need a respite spot close to the university 's health care system .
State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan for buildings that can be transformed into overflow medical facilities at a moment 's notice as metro Detroit 's health care system is bursting past capacity with patients who have tested positive for coronavirus .
It 's a task that is being replicated in states across the country :  Up to 600 medical soldiers will operate a field hospital alongside FEMA personnel at the Jacob K .
Javits Convention Center in Manhattan .
They will treat non-coronavirus patients to help lighten the load at other New York hospitals .
The soldiers are from Fort Campbell 's 531st Hospital Center in Kentucky and Fort Hood 's 9th Hospital Center in Texas and will bring 284 hospital beds to the convention center .
Another army field hospital will be deployed to Seattle from the 627th Hospital Center in Fort Carson , Colorado , and could be placed at Century Link Field , home to the Seattle Seahawks football team .
The state of California is asking the federal government for two mobile hospitals that would add 496 beds each , is awaiting the arrival of the U .
Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopening two closed hospitals to ease the overflow of beds needed to treat coronavirus patients .
The National Guard is setting up a field hospital at the Baltimore Convention Center in Maryland that will have 250 beds for patients who are sick , but not in need of critical care .
An Army field hospital is being deployed to the New Orleans Convention Center in Louisiana to help with the surge of COVID-19 patients .
Four military field hospitals will be set up in New Jersey -- at the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus , the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center in Edison , the Atlantic City Convention Center and an urban search and rescue facility in Wall Township .
Mobilizing to look for the right spot  It 's a monumental task to deal with an unprecedented pandemic , and health , political and military leaders are trying to juggle the demands of the seriously ill coronavirus patients while a firehose of the newly stricken continue to flood the system .
Some Southeast Michigan hospitals , including Beaumont and Henry Ford Health System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started shuffling patients between hospitals and clinics .
Many health systems have gotten expedited approval from the state to add more than 2,500 beds to hospitals , long-term care acute care facilities and nursing homes to help ease the overcrowding .
But those beds are expected to be quickly filled as the number of coronavirus patients in the state continues to climb past 4,000 and is n't expected to peak for at least a week or more .
So the search for field hospital locations has mobilized local , state and federal officials .
Besides the TCF Center , other potential locations include the Detroit Pistons practice facility and two dorms at Wayne State University , all in Detroit , the O'Rena sports arena and dorms at Oakland University in Auburn Hills , and Suburban Showplace Collection in Novi .
But it 's not just the big conference and convention centers that are being scrutinized .
" We put out a call to anyone who owns a facility that could be appropriate .
It could be rehabilitation centers or residence halls , hotels and motels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County Executive Dave Coulter .
" Oakland University has been talking directly with Beaumont Hospital about how they could use their residence halls or the arena there .
"  He fears that space will be needed to not only care for critically ill coronavirus patients , but also to isolate those people with a positive COVID-19 test who have not yet shown symptoms that require hospitalization .
" We should also be making plans on how to accommodate those folks by keeping them out of the house with some level of medical attention so they do n't infect their loved ones , " he said .
Lynn Rose , spokesperson for the Detroit district of the Army Corp of Engineers , said the corp is evaluating 15 sites for the state , but she declined to specify what buildings are rising to the top of the list .
" We 're going through the entire list first until anything is finalized , " she said .
" But we are pushing forward and doing what we can to get done so when the need arises we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hackel is traveling the county with Major General Paul Rogers , adjutant General of the Michgan Army and Air National Guard and the director of the state 's Military and Veterans Affairs Department .
" All of the hospitals in Macomb County are inundated with patients , " Hackel said in a video clip on his Facebook page .
" How do we try and identify locations in the county .
We 're looking at about needing 2,000 more beds outside of the hospital .
"  Good parking , food service needed  But finding a spot for a field hospital is complicated .
The logistics alone are enormous .
Teri Smith , president of the International Association of Emergency Managers and emergency preparedness manager at LMH Health in Lawrence , Kansas , said planners have to take into account a number of factors when it comes to expanding hospital bed capacity .
" You need to make sure you have good parking , a good loading dock , capabilities to provide food service , " she said .
" Do they have access to widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have laundry service , adequate security ? There are just a lot of things : bathroom and shower capabilities , being able to get the equipment into the building and service elevators .
"  She noted that there are big and little things that planners have to focus on , such as whether a temporary hospital facility is able to separate patients adequately and not have too many floors that health care workers have to climb if elevators become too crowded .
" Being creative and thinking outside of the box is going to be one of the biggest things in planning these facilities , " Smith said .
At least one health system in Michigan has had an overflow plan ready to go for years .
Spectrum Health in Grand Rapids and Grand Valley State University in Allendale entered into a cooperative agreement in 2005 that would allow GVSU to transform its Cook DeVos Center for Health Sciences building into an overflow for Spectrum .
The classroom building is across the street from Spectrum and has the ability to add 250 beds to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up 170 of the beds and necessary equipment , said Dr .
Philomena Mantella , president of GVSU .
It 's the first time that the crisis and pandemic planning agreement has had to be used .
" Of course we never really wanted to activate it .
But it 's an all hands on deck strategy , " she said , noting that the community , hospital and university have a symbiotic relationship .
" The university and community both have to work together .
That 's how the university was born and how it 's been funded .
This is our values on steroids .
This is how communities are built and this is how they need to behave .
"  Staffing might be biggest challenge  While setting up field hospitals may be the easiest part of dealing with a disaster , Brackin said , the biggest issue , by far , for temporary hospitals , is the staffing .
" The physical things that are needed are ultimately less the problem than the staffing -- it 's always going to come back to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a far cry from being over-staffed .
There was already a lot of stress on the system .
"  Laura Appel , chief innovation officer for the Michigan Health and Hospital Association , said the state has done a number of things already that have made it easier to get more health care professionals into active duty .
Gretchen Whitmer signed executive orders that allow for easier registration for certified nurse aides ; renewal of some health care licenses that have lapsed in the last five years ; allowi for non-nursing assistants , such as social social workers and activity coordinators , to help feed and transport patients , and make it easier for out-of-state and Canadian nurses to work in Michigan .
Other rules that have helped , include allowing certification of newly graduating medical students , so they can get to work immediately instead of having to wait until July when typical internships normally start .
That rule is allowing Michigan State University to certify roughly 300 of its 500 graduating medical and osteopathic medicine students in April and get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , executive vice president for health sciences at MSU .
" It 's a huge amount and I believe it 's going to make a substantive difference in facing the struggles we 're facing in the state right now , " he said .
" We 're looking at things like helping staff field hospitals as hospitals exceed capacity and look to increase Intensive Care Units to double capacity .
"  And for those who think the newly minted doctors are too green to help deal with the pandemic , Beauchamp noted that all the students have gone through eight years of college and medical school .
" The one thing we do n't want to do is have people think this is anything less than excellent care , " he said .
" These students have completed everything needed to graduate .
And they would otherwise be sitting idle until July 1 .
"  Hospitals also are looking toward recently retired health care professionals who could come back to work to help deal with the coronavirus crisis .
But it 's not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Expanded hospital facilities will have many , many more jobs to fill .
" We tend to only think about the doctors and nurses .
But you need the people who clean up after everybody , the food service workers , the med techs , " she said .
" And you need labs -- I 'm not talking about COVID testing , just labs for all the other tests too .
"  And many fear the worst is yet to come .
" We 've been working non-stop for 15 days , but the people at those hospitals , they 're doing everything we 're dong times 100 , " she said .
" This is amazingly hard for them already .
It 's going to be another really bad week coming up .
"  This disaster is different , though  Not all disasters are created equal .
When Brackin , who is now the CEO of Coral Gables-based Kidz Medical Services , which provides pediatric care in South Florida , was the head of Homestead Hospital and Baptist Health , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of the federal government was to provide aid to the hurricane-stricken region .
" The focus of FEMA ( Federal Emergency Management Agency ) and the federal government was exclusively on south Florida .
You could really feel the full force of the federal effort , and once that started happening it was impressive , " he said .
The temporary hospitals set up in the parking lots of existing hospitals went up in about a week and the military was immediately deployed to help .
" It was small and limited , but it did the job for nearly a year , " he said .
" But there 's so much open-ended uncertainty with this , " and the federal government has 50 states to worry about , not just South Florida .
