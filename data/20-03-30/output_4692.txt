Health and development experts warn of a possible health catastrophe with serious consequences for Australia if COVID-19 gets established in Papua New Guinea .
At his meeting with fellow G20 leaders on Friday , Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for international focus on the plight of Pacific island nations and said Australia was " reconfiguring " its development assistance to support the operation of critical health services and manage the economic impact .
According to the ABC , this includes the reallocation of $22 million of existing aid commitments toward a COVID-19 support package for the PNG Government .
The shift in focus comes amid mounting concerns that an outbreak could be disastrous for Pacific island nations , especially Australia 's closest neighbour , PNG .
PNG has so far confirmed just one coronavirus infection but public health specialists and development workers caution that PNG 's high rates of poverty , poor nutrition , threadbare health services and pre-existing health problems such as tuberculosis mean the country of eight million is highly vulnerable to the disease .

Ann Clarke , project manager for the non-government organisation Businesses for Health : TB and HIV , said an outbreak of COVID-19 in PNG , particularly in Port Moresby and other large centres , would be " an absolute catastrophe " .
Dr Clarke said respiratory problems and diseases such as tuberculosis , pneumonia and asthma were prevalent , accounting for a third of the country 's total health burden .
The most recent available data show that in 2018 there were 37,000 active cases of tuberculosis alone , resulting in 4700 deaths .
Dr Clarke warned that if there was community transmission of COVID-19 in the country , the health system would quickly become overwhelmed .

Ms Payne said 60 per cent of people lack access to safe water and just 2 per cent have somewhere in or near their home where they can wash their hands .

Aid to the Pacific has been attacked by critics who argue that the Australian government should focus its efforts on the country 's needs first .
But Mr Pryke said it was in Australia 's own interests to be part of politically stable and healthy neighbourhood .
China has also increased the pressure on the Australian government to increase its efforts in the region .
