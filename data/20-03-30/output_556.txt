Baker : Expect Surge Of Coronavirus Patients In Mass .
As Early As April 7  Gov .
Charlie Baker at a news conference on the state 's coronavirus response on March 30 , 2020 .
( Sam Doran/State House News Service )  The surge in coronavirus cases long expected by public health officials could start to hit Massachusetts between April 7 and April 17 , Gov .
Charlie Baker said Monday , stressing the importance of taking steps to prepare additional health care capacity .
With the state 's testing apparatus up to thousands of patients per day , confirmed COVID-19 cases have recently been increasing at a rapid pace .
Massachusetts had 5,752 cases as of Monday and 56 deaths attributable to the disease .
That trend will likely continue , Baker forecast during his daily press briefing Monday , and according to at least some models could hit its apex in the next eight to 18 days .
" This is n't an exact science , but generally speaking , most of the calculations that are out there with respect to Massachusetts , both some of the ones we 've done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that the surge here is probably going to start somewhere between ( April ) 7th and the 17th , " Baker said .
State officials continue to prepare to manage and mitigate the peak .
Baker identified four key areas of focus : protective gear , hospital bed capacity , ventilators and staffing .
On Monday , Baker announced that the federal government -- which he criticized last week as handcuffing states ' efforts to acquire protective equipment -- will send more than 1,000 ventilators to Massachusetts , which will make a " big difference " to the most critical patients .
He said he expected the ventilators to arrive by week 's end .
The state also received another shipment of personal protective equipment from the national strategic stockpile over the weekend , and local manufacturers have begun working with the administration to supplement supplies .
Baker said New Balance will begin manufacturing face mask prototypes in its Lawrence factory and then ramp up production across New England .
In another new state effort , about 1,800 people have registered to volunteer their medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portal last week , Baker announced Monday .
They will be brought on board on an accelerated basis under a Department of Public Health order .
The governor outlined plans in motion to designate nursing homes specifically -- and only -- for care of patients with COVID-19 .
Beaumont Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center in Worcester will start the process with 150 beds ready to begin transfer by Thursday , Baker said , before ramping up to a maximum capacity of about 300 .
Altogether , the administration is targeting establishment of at least 1,000 beds for coronavirus-afflicted older adults , hoping both to lessen the strain on hospitals ahead of the forthcoming surge and to avoid requiring that skilled nursing facilities receive patients from hospitals .
" We need to continue to create significant capacity so our most vulnerable population , should they get infected with COVID-19 and need acute care in a well-equipped and safe setting , will get it , " Baker said .
" We know this is n't an easy task , but without these designated sites , hospitals would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open capacity , which could put the rest of the healthy residents and staff at those facilities at risk .
"  In a statement after Baker 's announcement , Massachusetts Senior Care Association President Tara Gregorio said the push to open coronavirus-specific facilities is a " difficult , but right " decision .
" Massachusetts is acting boldly and responsibly , while other states are mandating that all nursing facilities admit COVID-19 positive patients , " Gregorio said in a statement .
" We believe based on clinical guidance that this approach unnecessarily introduces a highly contagious and deadly virus into nursing homes .
"  While he offered a projection about the surge , Baker declined to estimate specific numbers of cases or deaths due to the spread of COVID-19 after Dr .
Anthony Fauci , a member of the White House 's coronavirus task force , on Sunday said some models roughly predict 100,000 or more fatalities nationwide .
" A huge part of what we 're trying to do , both through preparation around the surge and a lot of the other work we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved is saved , " Baker said .
" I prefer to think about it that way than I do with respect to some really cold and impersonal number .
I know a couple of people who have lost people as a result of the COVID-19 virus , and it 's a way more personal item in my mind than any number you can put on it .
"  The administration has not offered any estimate about the statewide hospital capacity amid the outbreak .
In January , the Center for Health Information and Analysis in a report identified 14,596 acute care hospital beds across the state .
Through Monday afternoon , the Department of Public Health confirmed 453 of the state 's 5,752 COVID-19 cases required hospitalization .
In the same figures , 1,603 patients did not need to be admitted , and the hospitalization status remained unknown for another 3,696 .
Baker also asked those newly eligible for unemployment insurance under the new federal stimulus -- gig workers , freelancers and those who previously did n't make enough money , among others -- hold off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits are not available to be applied for today , " he said .
The governor said Massachusetts is still waiting on guidance from the federal government on how to fold these applicants into the existing state system .
Baker said those newly eligible workers who apply now will likely not be able to get through the system and create a backlog for others .
Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said Monday she ordered the Massachusetts Health Connector , the state 's health insurance marketplace , to delay many coverage terminations that would normally result from administrative issues such as lack of documentation .
The governor also issued an order Monday granting HHS flexibility to offer health providers financial relief , including rate adjustments and supplemental payments , to cope with skyrocketing demand or high volumes of vulnerable individuals during the outbreak .
Baker stressed the importance of social distancing as he has in almost every public appearance since the outbreak began , particularly after Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel announced on Friday that she tested positive for COVID-19 .
Baker said Bharel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  The governor also forecast announcements to come , saying his administration would likely offer an update Tuesday on an order that non-essential businesses must close and would provide more information later this week on efforts to trace contacts of those who contracted the virus .
