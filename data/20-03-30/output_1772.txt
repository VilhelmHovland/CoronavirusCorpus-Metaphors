The outbreak of coronavirus around the globe has led to a shortage of protective face masks .
During that shortage , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) says that healthcare workers should use homemade masks as a last resort when no protective equipment is available .
Homemade masks offer much less protection compared to surgical masks and N95 respirators .
But they are better than nothing , most medical professionals say .
" While homemade masks are not as effective as surgical masks or N95 masks , they are absolutely helpful in this time with the major shortage going on , " says Shawn Nasseri , MD .
" They help keep the area clean and clear , so it is better than wearing nothing .
"  How effective are homemade masks ?  A 2013 study looked at the ability of homemade masks made from cotton t-shirt material to prevent the spread of influenza .
The researchers found that the cotton masks were one-third as effective as surgical masks , but that even the homemade masks " significantly reduced the number of microorganisms expelled by volunteers .
" However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masks protected people from breathing in particles that could contain a virus .
Right now , it 's important to try to save N95 respirators for medical professionals caring for patients with COVID-19 , says Joyce Fulton , RN .
Because of that , Fulton is helping organize people to make masks for the general public , in hopes of freeing more medical supplies for medical professionals .
" People that would normally wear a mask like cancer patients going to their chemo appointments , immune compromised people or senior citizens going to the grocery store , can wear these masks instead of using the N95 ones , " she says .
How to make an effective face mask  Nasseri says layers are key to making an effective mask .
It 's also key to have a mask that forms a snug seal over the mouth and nose , so that particles ca n't get in through gaps .
" Masks with a silky outer layer ( if possible ) , middle layer of a thick , tightly woven material like nylon or cotton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says .
Skip the wool or other fabrics that can cause allergies or irritate your skin .
There are also no-sew options for masks .
In 2006 , researchers from the University of Pittsburgh shared with the CDC guidelines for making an effective facemask when surgical masks and N95 masks are unavailable during a viral outbreak .
The researchers used regular cotton t-shirts to make no-sew face masks .
First , they boiled the cotton for ten minutes in order to sterilize it .
Then , they cut the cotton to size and formed a mask using one outer layer and eight inner layers that covered the nose and mouth .
The mask could be tied around the wearer 's head , to get a snug fit without elastic .
Testing showed that this mask " offered substantial protection .
"  Annie Cook , an expert quilter and linguist from Los Angeles , has made over 120 masks for people in her neighborhood .
" I was just hearing so much fear and despair that I posted on NextDoor that I would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized quickly that hair ties would make perfect ear loops , " she says .
" People are so heartbreakingly relieved when they pick up the masks as they then feel that they can venture into .
