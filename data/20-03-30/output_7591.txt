Which nursing home in Yucaipa is the site of a COVID-19 outbreak ?  A woman whose mother is a resident at Cedar Mountain Post Acute Rehabilitation in Yucaipa said staff called her Sunday about a COVID-19 outbreak at the facility -- three days after a resident died from complications .
Both the facility and San Bernardino County public health officials , however , have declined to confirm Cedar Mountain as the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casey 's interactions with her 74-year-old mother , who is a resident at the facility , had dwindled in recent weeks .
The facility closed its doors to visitors nearly two weeks ago as part of ongoing precautions due to the coronavirus pandemic .
Even after those restrictions went into place , Casey said she was still able to drop off care packages filled with personal items like non-skid socks and her mother 's favorite shampoo to replace the hair care product she did n't like at the facility .
But when Casey tried to drop off lunch last Thursday , she said she was greeted at the door by the receptionist who informed her that packages for residents would no longer be accepted because nothing could go in or out of the facility .
This seemed odd to Casey , 53 , but she headed back to her home in Redlands with the uneaten lunch and little information about the sudden change .
San Bernardino County announced on Saturday that 12 residents at an unnamed nursing facility in Yucaipa tested positive for COVID-19 .
The county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that same facility died on Thursday -- the same day that Casey 's lunch delivery was turned away .
The cluster of reported cases is the first concentrated COVID-19 outbreak in San Bernardino County , according to county health officer Erin Gustafson .
San Bernardino County spokesman David Wert said the county could not identify the nursing home facility because it is against the public health department 's policy to release identifiable information .
When contacted by The Desert Sun , a Cedar Mountain representative declined to say whether the outbreak was at the Yucaipa facility .
The for-profit home is operated by Cedar Operations , LLC , based in Delaware .
There are two other assisted nursing home facilities in Yucaipa , according to the U .
Centers for Medicare .
A spokeswoman at Creekside Care Center , about 3 miles away , said the facility has no cases of coronavirus .
A spokesperson at Calimesa Post Acute , less than 3 miles away , told The Desert Sun the outbreak was not at their facility but at another home " just a short drive away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge .
When she saw a post about it on social media on Saturday , she said she immediately called Cedar Mountain .
" They said the outbreak was n't there , " Casey said .
" Then , I called again later in the day , and they said they did n't know .
From talking to different people , I figured out it was there , but still they would n't confirm it .
"  It was n't until Sunday morning that Casey said someone from Cedar Mountain called to inform her that there was a known coronavirus outbreak at her mother 's nursing home , she said .
Casey said she does not remember the name of the staff member who called .
On the nursing home 's website , a COVID-19 message informs residents and their families that the facility 's staff has taken measures to address the pandemic , including increased cleaning protocols and closing the facility to visitors .
The facility made tablet computers available to residents to allow them to conduct video chats with loved ones and launched a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are all together in this time of crisis and we take keeping you and your loved one safe very seriously .
Thank you for trusting us , " the message reads .
" If you have any questions or concerns , please do not hesitate to reach out to our facility through our contact form or give us a call .
The Desert Sun reviewed billing documentation provided by Casey to confirm her mother 's residence at Cedar Mountain but is not identifying her to protect her privacy .
Casey said her mother has lived at Cedar Mountain for a year and a half , since she broke her leg and did n't fully recover .
She ca n't fully walk on her own , Casey said .

Vickie Connor/The Desert Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Casey said .
" If coronavirus gets her , then it 's going to be pretty bad .
I talked to her on the phone yesterday , and she was n't quite understanding the severity of the situation .
She did n't quite get it .
I talked to her again today , and now she is understanding the need for isolation better .
"  Casey said her mother told her that the nursing assistant denied that the outbreak was at the facility when asked about it over the weekend .
" Knowledge just makes things a little better in situations like this , " Casey said .
Shannon Dean , whose 69-year-old father , James Dean , is a resident at the facility , said she was experiencing similar challenges .
She said the facility staff has not informed her or her other family members of the outbreak .
" All they have told us ( is ) that the facility is on lockdown , " she said .
" My dad says he does n't know anything besides ( that ) he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  While the patients are being kept isolated in their rooms , according to Casey , her mom does share a room with one other person .
All employees are now wearing masks , gowns and gloves , Casey said , but the residents are not .
Casey said she was told that all residents and staff were tested for coronavirus on Saturday , and that test results would take about four days to return .
For now , she says , her mother is n't showing any symptoms .
While Casey expressed anger at what she called a lack of transparency , the Redlands resident was also frustrated because she " knew this place had bad reviews to begin with .
"  " When we were looking for someplace for her to go , there were n't many options and it was hard to find a home with good reviews , " Casey said .
" But I check on her all the time and I always visit , so I felt like I could still keep an eye on what 's going on .

The facility received four health citations during its last inspection in December 2019 ; the state average is 13 .
