More  $40b more for the ' toughest year of our lives '  The Morrison government has set aside another $40 billion to spend on measures such as purchasing emergency medical supplies , boosting the front-line health response , and another round of economic assistance as the coronavirus crisis intensifies in the months ahead .
The extra money was set aside in budget bills that were rushed through a special sitting of Parliament on Monday after Prime Minister Scott Morrison used a speech to invoke the Great Depression , urge people of faith to pray , and warn that 2020 for many " will be the toughest year of our lives " .
" A one in a 100-year event .
A global health pandemic that has fast become an economic crisis , the likes of which we have not seen since the Great Depression .
' ' Alex Ellinghausen  The budget supply bills ensure the government can fund its operating expenses over the next seven months , by when the postponed federal budget is due and which may be the next time Parliament sits .
But the bills were also amended so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the control of Finance Minister Mathias Cormann for unforseen expenses , was expanded to $40 billion .
The government is anticipating having to pay top dollar for emergency supplies as global demand soars .
The new money will also be available to help state and local governments with health costs .
" We 're giving ourselves the flexibility to respond to unforseen , urgent needs in the context where there 's no certainty when the Parliament may be able to return , ' ' Senator Cormann told The Australian Financial Review .
" This ensures we have sufficient appropriations available to meet unforeseen costs .
This may include responding to the need for additional more costly medical equipment and supplies given high international demand .
" It also gives us the capacity to provide further support to our economy and to Australians if and as required and to support the ongoing operations of government .
"  Parliament wo n't sit for months  Parliament sat on Monday only to pass the budget supply bills as well as the legislation needed for the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and income support measures announced on Sunday .

These include a weekly media release on every use of the fund and for the government to seek written approval from the Opposition for all expenditure over $1 billion .
The money was secured as Health Minster Greg Hunt told Parliament a shipment of masks headed for Australia had been diverted to another country , while Australian company ResMed , which makes sleep apnoea machines , has been asked by the government to make 1000 ventilators .
A government source said medical supplies were becoming increasingly difficult to secure from overseas and prices were rising as a result .
As the coronavirus crisis continued to escalate , Queensland joined other states in closing its borders and imposing a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for all arrivals , while Centre Alliance Senator Rex Patrick became the fourth federal politician to test positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-essential military personnel from Afghanistan and Iraq .

" There will be more support to come and it will keep coming for as long as this challenge is before this nation , ' ' Mr Morrison said in a sobering speech to the Parliament .
' The toughest year of our lives '  " For many , young and old , 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives .
Meeting this challenge is bigger than any Australian .
" It is bigger than any of us who are in this chamber , prime ministers , leader of the oppositions , ministers , shadow minister , members of parliament .
it is bigger than premiers , chief ministers , captains of industry , leaders of union movements , it is bigger than all of us .
If we think we are going to take action next week , we should take that action today .

' '  " Today parents are concerned about whether to send their kids to school or not .
People are anxious and that is understandable , " he said .
" They know this is a big deal and when people feel that they ca n't control events they seek comfort in what they can control .
We 've seen that exhibited around the country .
That they have enough essentials such as toilet paper or pasta .
That 's a signal .
"  He urged Mr Morrison to stop delaying and implement the tougher restrictions that are considered inevitable .
" If we think we are going to take action next week , we should take that action today , ' ' he added .
" The last thing we want to do is to be looking back on this time in the near future and saying , ' If only we had done more and done it sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories now have slightly different protocols regarding school closures .
The national cabinet , which meets again Tuesday night , was formed to provide a consistency of response .

Relations with NSW are unlikely to improve after Mr Morrison , in Parliament , blamed that government for allowing passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship to disembark .
