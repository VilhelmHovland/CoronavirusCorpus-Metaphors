The Indian auto industry faced a tumultuous 2019 with demand patterns being far more inconsistent than in preceding years .
The transition from BS 4 to BS 6 technology also created pressures of its own with several manufacturers struggling to clear their old stocks before April 1 ( 2020 ) deadline .
According to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers ( SIAM ) , only around 29 lakh passenger vehicles were sold in the year , the sharpest drop in sales in 20 years .
And just when it seemed like the worst may be over , it just got a whole lot more bad with a national lockdown due to coronavirus forcing OEMs to suspend production .
Silent factories and locked up families are clear indications that sales figures in March could be one of the worst ever .
While supply lines were already getting disrupted for many due to coronavirus in China and the forced lockdown there , a lockdown in India may have already dealt a crushing blow to the automotive sector here .
The lockdown is in force till April 14 which means people are cooped up inside their homes and only stepping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile shopping is understandably invisible .
Besides , showrooms and dealers are shut anyway and even if some OEMs have begun pushing online sales platform , the figures from the month could well be pitiful .
Several car manufacturers like Maruti Suzuki and Mahindra and Mahindra have joined the battle against coronavirus by manufacturing key medical equipment - either directly or indirectly .
Hyundai 's CSR wing has ordered medical testing kit for coronavirus from South Korea .
Many others are donating to relief funds .
With over 1,000 positive cases reported from across the country , India is still right in the middle of its fight against coronavirus .
The economic fallout of the lockdown may only be known in detail once the disease is successfuly controlled .
