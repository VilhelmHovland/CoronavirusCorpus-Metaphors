Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended not rushing into a wage subsidy plan to help employers and their staff during the coronavirus crisis , saying it is not a case of " cutting and pasting " what other countries might be doing .
Earlier , Finance Minister Mathias Cormann confirmed the Morrison government is working on a wage subsidy so that business can keep workers on their payrolls during the crisis .
The government , including the prime minister and Senator Cormann , has repeatedly resisted following a UK-style 80 per cent wage subsidy , saying it would take too long to introduce .
" We are going to do it in an Australian way , " Senator Cormann told ABC television 's Insiders program on Sunday .
" We 're going to do it in a way that actually is going to be able to be delivered , using our existing systems and our existing architecture .
" Mr Morrison said the government was working very carefully to ensure that income support could be delivered in a way that gets it to people as quickly as possible using the existing payment systems .
" When we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pasting ideas from other places , " he said on Sunday when announcing a new $1 .
billion package to help with mental health and other issues on Sunday .
" We have seen in many other jurisdictions that are putting these in place , they ( are ) having to rapidly redesign them and change them .
" Senator Cormann declined to go into the specifics of the plan but said the government intended to make an announcement " over the next few days " .
Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles said a wage subsidy would be a step in the right direction .
" I think that the long queues that we 've seen at Centrelink during the course of this week have been a function of an absence of a proper wage subsidy , " he told Sky News .
Business groups and unions have also urged the government to pursue a wage subsidy in response to the escalating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic .
" To cushion the broader impacts of the virus , the common goal in Australia and other countries is to keep businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian Industry chief executive Innes Willox said in a statement .
More than 100 economists , social and public policy experts , unionists and business leaders have sent an open letter to the federal government and national cabinet urging the introduction of a liveable income guarantee .
They say the existing welfare system is unable to cope with extraordinarily difficult circumstances .
" The measures the government has introduced already , doubling the Jobseeker payment and temporarily lifting mutual obligation requirements are welcome but far from enough at this extraordinary moment , " the University of Queensland 's Professor Greg Marson said in a statement .
He said a liveable income guarantee would streamline processes as the crisis accelerates .
This would include removing conditions attached to accessing to the Jobseeker and other payments , including the coronavirus supplement , fast and simple .
