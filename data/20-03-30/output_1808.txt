More families will inevitably lose loved ones to coronavirus because patients dying now were infected around a month ago -- weeks before social distancing measures were put in place -- an expert has warned .
Professor James Naismith , director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford , spoke out after a further 209 people in the UK died after being tested for Covid-19 , bringing the total to 1,228 .
And other academics cautioned people not to assume that because the 209 figure was lower than the 260 who died in the previous 24 hours , it meant the disease was under control .

" It can take up to two weeks from infection to onset of symptoms .
For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild , for the much care is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not recover but die , data from China suggests this takes around another four days .
The tragic deaths today will be from people infected roughly a month ago .
It is inevitable that there will be more tragedies for families ahead .
" We can reduce the final death toll only by following current Government advice .
We must expect and welcome changes in Government advice as science , medicine and social science work together to learn more .

However , daily numbers can be lower ( or higher ) than expected due to random factors .
" It is far too early to conclude that the lower number today than yesterday is not simply due to chance .
"  Eleanor Riley , professor of immunology and infectious disease , University of Edinburgh , said : " It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's data .
" Only when the epidemic has peaked -- which is some time away -- and we get sustained daily reductions in new cases and then sustained daily reductions in deaths , will we know that we are beginning to get on top of the epidemic .

" But it is still too early to claim that the curve is beginning to flatten off .
" It is also important not to over-interpret counts for single days : delays in reporting can lead to the numbers varying far more than one would expect by chance alone .
For example , one of the deaths reported today actually occurred 13 days ago .
