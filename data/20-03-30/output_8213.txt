Asa Hutchinson said Monday that he has approved an additional $45 million to purchase protective equipment for medical providers and for ventilators due to the coronavirus in the state .

" We can place an order ( and ) the Department of Defense might come in and say ' we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a premium , " Hutchinson said .
The state is also waiving late fees on vehicle registration and tag renewal through April 16 due to the virus .
Hutchinson said there are at least 473 COVID-19 cases in Arkansas , up from 426 reported Sunday , and the number of deaths rose by one , to seven .
