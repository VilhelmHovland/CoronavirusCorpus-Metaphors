CANADIAN PRESS/HO-Kelly Marshall , *MANDATORY CREDIT*  The daughter of a Nova Scotia man relying on a ventilator to breathe wants Canadians to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another in their time of deepest need .
Kelly Marshall says she wants to encourage others to follow the directives of public health officials aimed at curbing the pandemic 's spread .
The 39-year-old has watched her 69-year-old father , Rick Cameron , go from aches and pains to being hospitalized on a ventilator within the span of one week .
Her mother , Faye Cameron , has also tested positive for the virus and is ill at home .
The family 's struggle began more than two weeks after Rick Cameron returned from Florida on Feb .
22 , though the original source of infection remains uncertain .
Marshall and her husband Brian -- who were living with her parents due to a fire at their own home -- have also shown symptoms and are in quarantine .
Her father 's illness progressed rapidly and by March 19 , he could n't hear his daughter speak to him as he tried to catch his breath , and was taken to hospital in an ambulance .
Marshall says one of the cruelest features of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit and touch loved ones who are fighting for breath in hospital .
" When somebody 's sick you want to be there and hold them and hug them -- and it 's the one thing you ca n't do with this , " she said during a recent telephone interview from her home .
" When we got the news , I watched my mother break down and I could n't even console her due to her having the illness .
I wanted a hug from my Mom and I could n't get it .
"  Meanwhile , she says the smallest details of her family 's daily life have been turned upside down due to COVID-19 's presence in the home .
" Even a simple thing like brushing our teeth has changed .
It could be harmful to somebody .
You really have to be conscientious of everything you do , " she said .
Each day , Marshall repeatedly cleans and then disinfects her mother 's room as she cares for her .
She said her father always preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly .
It 's that attitude that is motivating her to speak publicly about the disease , she said .
" He always taught me that knowledge is power .
I want people to educate themselves so they can have this power , " she said .
She describes her dad as an extrovert , who before retirement worked at the Michelin plant in Granton for decades and had also coached hockey in Pictou County .
Over the past 40 years , other than the occasional cold , Cameron " had perfect health , " she said .
Zahid Butt , an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at the University of Waterloo department of public health , said in an interview that the general scientific consensus is there is a higher risk of complications from COVID-19 for patients in their late 60s and older .
He cited a study from Imperial College in London , U .
, where the mean case fatality rate for adults aged under 60 is estimated to be less than 0 .
per cent , compared with 9 .
per cent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies completed by Chinese researchers who looked at 46,248 COVID-19 patients , indicated those with the most severe form of the disease were more likely to have underlying conditions of hypertension , respiratory disease , and cardiovascular disease .
Researchers , however , are still trying to understand why some otherwise healthy people such as Cameron become severely ill , Butt said .
Nova Scotia had 127 cases of COVID-19 as of Monday , and Cameron is among four people who are hospitalized in the province with the disease .
Robert Strang , the province 's chief medical officer of health , said on Sunday up to 30 per cent of ICU beds in the province are being set aside for COVID patients , but he said the percentage could grow if needed .
" There are plans in place to expand and maximize the number of people that could be cared for if they need ventilators , " he said .
In Ontario , critical care data received by CBC indicated that as of Monday , one in four intensive care unit beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of COVID-19 .
But Strang said Ontario is two-to-three weeks ahead of Nova Scotia in the progress of the pandemic , and the larger province " has much more disease .
"  Meanwhile , as of Monday afternoon , Cameron remained heavily sedated and had a high temperature , and his daughter said it 's expected he 'd remain in that state for several weeks .
" He 's a fighter .
He 's fighting , " she said .
Her sister is keeping family and friends aware of Cameron 's condition on a blog titled " Rick Cameron : His road to recovery , " detailing the small increments of improvement .
" The doctor says , ' Maybe a centimetre of progress ' .
They are seeing what they expect to see in a COVID patient suffering from respiratory failure and it is a slow recovery , " a recent blog post said .
" X-rays show COVID pneumonia on both lungs .
"  For Marshall , a steady flow good wishes since her first public statements last week have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians to obey orders to keep a physical distance between themselves and others .
