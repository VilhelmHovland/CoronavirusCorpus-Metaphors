World Bank urges G20 to refrain from export restrictions for pandemic supplies  WASHINGTON , March 30 ( Reuters ) - The World Bank on Monday urged the Group of 20 major economies ( G20 ) to refrain from imposing new export restrictions on critical medical supplies , food or other key products as the world battles the devastating coronavirus pandemic .
In a statement to a video conference of G20 trade ministers , a senior World Bank official said the pandemic was projected to plunge the global economy into a deep recession , disrupting supply chains and hitting critical trade nodes .
To mitigate the impact on poorest countries , who are at risk due to the limited supply of medical goods , the global lender also called on G20 countries to eliminate or reduce tariffs on imports of key products needed to fight the pandemic , and lower or temporarily suspend tariffs and export taxes on food and other basic goods .
