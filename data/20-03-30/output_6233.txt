Anticipatory Grief : What We 're Feeling &amp; How To Cope with COVID-19  One of the most pervasive refrains I am encountering in therapy these days is how do we not let the millstone of uncertainty break our backs .
The coronavirus outbreak accounts for staggering statistics globally .
Apart from the snowballing numbers , mainstream and social media are teeming with visual chronicles of people trying to navigate this weary load on a daily basis .
We are reading through twitter threads narrating the experience of frontline responders and medical professionals fighting the grim vise of this virus .
The vicarious trauma is so strong and unrelenting that it leaves us shaken like a weather-beaten tree .
In psychology , a lot of what we are experiencing can be named " anticipatory grief " .
Anticipatory grief is when people experience a deep sense of sorrow before the tangible occurrence of a loss .
The term usually refers to loss through death or illness but is equally applicable to separation , difficult surgical procedures or medical treatments ( e .
chemotherapy ) as well as community/environmental disruptions ( e .
Australian bushfires or the anti-CAA protests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This is a skulking presence that sits heavy on the chest like a determined predator .
The impact is compounded if the person experiencing anticipatory grief already deals with other psychosocial disabilities and/or a mental illness .
On the flip-side , it can also unlock and suddenly shine a light on our ability for deep reflections about our lives , our relationships , our careers , our communities and our social/political climate .
If there are well-guided and considerate methods through which we are able to channel these reflections , this process can alter the course of our existence in a healing way .
Stillness is not welcomed in a world driven by capitalist frenzy .
Stillness is perceived as inactivity and penalized for being unproductive .
This outbreak has forced us into a form of stillness with which we have to reconcile .
This has also made the disparities and injustices so rampant in our social order glaringly obvious .
Videos of daily wage earners left stranded on the streets while being roughed up by a heavy-handed law enforcement machinery evoke rage and anxiety .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of privilege .
We can no longer hide or shun this awareness .
We have to acknowledge it even if it makes us uncomfortable .
Grief and Hope  In her essay " The Long Road " , Jennifer Allen states -- " My arsenal was depleted .
There was nothing to do but surrender and redefine hope .
"  This is critical discernment .
This world is not inherently organized to make sense to us but we carve meaning out of its " dis-order " .
Allen also presses upon the importance of how trepidation requires us to be keepers of contradictory emotions -- grief and hope .
If we try to instantly lean into one or the other too much , the imbalance will make us feel more powerless or less prepared .
Yes , there is uncertainty and underlined anxiety about loss -- the loss of loved ones , loss of a job , loss of a home .
Our sense of belonging is threatened and it is important to acknowledge how we feel .
However , this does n't mean that we are completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , for surmounting this crisis .
We have to choose what we integrate into our daily awareness if we want to move beyond these crashing waves of anticipatory grief .
Buddhist monk and clinical psychologist , Jack Kornfield wrote about what he calls the " bodhisattva response " to the humanitarian crisis in the wake of coronavirus .
" The Bodhisattva path is in front of us .
The beautiful thing is , we can see Bodhisattvas all around .
We see them singing from their balconies to those shut inside .
We see them in young neighbours caring for the elders nearby , in our brave healthcare workers and the unheralded ones who stock the shelves of our grocery stores .
"  We have to go beyond ourselves now and that is why collective healing begins with social solidarity .
Despite the fact that we are physically isolated and quarantined to protect ourselves and each other , we must hold space collectively .
Anticipatory grief is a 5-stage process in most cases .
I am borrowing and further modifying these categories from T .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its impact on caregivers :  1 .
Mourning  This is the feeling of helplessness crashing against us , breaking us bit by bit .
We ca n't escape this even if what we fear is a possibility more than an eventuality .
A pandemic is particularly difficult to deal with because it positions us squarely against our mortality .
Its immensity seems invulnerable in the moment .
However , it is important to reconnect with our resilience .
Yes , this is difficult .
Yes , it is harrowing .
But natural disasters , conflicts , illnesses , oppression and other forms of accelerated turmoil are a part of our existence in this world .
It is ok to be saddened and even devastated by the possibility of loss as well as the ongoing reality of loss .
It is ok to let mourning lead the way .
Coping  Mourning if attended to thoroughly , can transform into coping .
Life is a series of choices .
We feel powerless when we feel that our choices have been thieved from us .
Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space to recognize that we need to cope in order to rise to the surface again .
In tarot readings , the card " Tower " is considered ominous because it is symbolic of breakdowns .
It shows a burning edifice crumbling to the ground but if you look closely , little leaves are sprouting at the base as if to indicate that given time , life can be reaffirmed and built back up .
Coping means solidarity and acceptance .
Coping should translate into offering and seeking help .
Coping begins with acknowledging that we are carrying a heavy burden but we have to find ways in which we can put it down for a while .
Interaction  In order to cope , we ca n't remain detached and disengaged even when we are alone .
Yes , the pandemic necessitates that we remain physically separate but most of us we are privileged enough to live in a time where technology allows for easier connections .
A text , a phone-call , a video chat , all of these can be means of empathetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can extend help forward .
We can be more vigilant of other people 's pain and challenges .
A little bit of interaction can remind us that we are n't forgotten islands .
Planning  On a personal level , planning means figuring out resources to deal with our grief .
What kind of a toolkit do we need to keep steady through instability ? On a larger scale , this is where our social awareness needs to kick in full throttle .
Community wellness is a matter of intersectionality , not hierarchies .
We plan better when we plan together whether it is in the form of digital care circles , food/grocery distribution communes or online reading club .
Planning should n't be about personal hoarding and stockpiling of resources but creating cohesive , inter-connected units that center and build up from the needs of the most under-privileged members of a society .
Reorganisation  The world as we know it will change .
We have to reorganize mentally to handle this .
This is not going to happen in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to sit with the evident paradoxes and contradictions that we might face on this journey .
It is not easy at the onset but survival has always been cumulative .
These steps are sometimes rooted in a slow-moving awareness .
This awareness is n't always neat or linear .
We are allowed to fall off the wagon .
During these months of shelter-in-place , let us not forget to tap into our collective resilience .
