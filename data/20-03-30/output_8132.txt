The Tennessee General Assembly approved a measure that waives the requirement for districts to fulfill 180 classroom days .
The federal government also has initially approved a state request for a waiver to waive that requirement .
Is school done for the year ?  That 's not clear , Battle said .
Battle said she ca n't predict what happens next or how long it will take for the threat of the coronavirus to dissipate .
" I do n't know exactly what that may look like , " she said .
End-of-year tests and homework  Year-end tests are canceled for the year by the state , said Chief Academic Officer David Williams .
The tests are factored into student grades and Williams said the district has a plan how to calculate final student grades for the year .
He also said any homework that might have been due before closures wo n't hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District officials did not rule out the possibility that there will be summer school in some form .
Chief Academic Officer David Williams said summer school or summer work is a consideration in long-term plans for the district so it can ready students for next year .
" We are mindful of the loss of instructional time , " Williams said .
" You ca n't replace face-to-face time with a teacher .
"  He said there could be remedial or summer work to help students transition into a new grade .
Is there a change in graduation requirements ?  It is expected the Tennessee State Board of Education will take up how to change graduation requirements on April 9 , Williams said .
The district will change its graduation requirements and expectations after the state board lays out its plan , he said .
If there are students that need to make up credits , the district will work to get those students opportunities , he said .
Are laptops available for students other than graduating seniors ?  Seniors have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can do work to earn any necessary credits toward graduation .
Williams said the district is working on a longer-range plan about how to get students tools to do work .
" There is an equity and digital gap that we are working toward closing , " he said .
Prom and other activities  Prom is canceled and it 's unclear whether the event will be held even if students return this year .
" When we resume and are safely allowed to let the public back into schools , we will look to maintain or recoup some of the senior activities lost during school closures , " Battle said .
Teacher evaluations and portfolios  Under the measure passed by the Tennessee General Assembly , no work from this year can adversely affect a teacher , said MNPS Human Resources Chief Chris Barnes .
" And we will make sure that there is equity and fairness so no teachers are affected adversely , " he said .
