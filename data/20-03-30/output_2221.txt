Celebrating victories during uncertainty  With COVID-19 top of mind for us all , I acknowledge that this is an anxious time for many of us and that it can be a challenge to think about anything else .
I continue to see people pull together and support one another .
At times like these , co-operation is our best asset .
I am proud to represent the community of Fort Garry .
Fort Garry is no stranger to rallying together to protect the things we care about most .
This is why I want to take this moment to step away from the very serious issues we are all facing with the COVID-19 outbreak and focus on some wins that we have seen in our community .
Fort Garry residents rallied to save our library and we won .
I ca n't thank everyone enough who showed up and made it clear that our library provides invaluable services that we can not lose .
Students in Fort Garry , along with other students in the city , have also potentially saved the U-Pass -- students will now vote on keeping the U-Pass with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lines of defence against climate change and it is imperative that we continue to encourage people to use this service .
We know that it is far more sustainable for our environment and for our infrastructure to have people take the bus than for everyone to drive their own cars .
Bus passes must be affordable to those who need them , and even though there will be a price increase , the program is continuing .
Finally , I want to say thank you to all of you in our community who are on the front lines of fighting this virus .
All the health-care workers , first responders , grocery store employees , and childcare workers who continue to work to provide us with our basic needs and keep us safe and healthy .
Please note that my constituency staff and I have closed the office but we are still continuing to work for you .
