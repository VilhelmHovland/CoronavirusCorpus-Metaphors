Working from home  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , business as usual is anything but .
Andrew and I felt like we should interrupt our regularly scheduled podcast to take some time and talk about working from home -- something that we all are going to have to deal with for the foreseeable future .

Working from home  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , business as usual is anything but .
Andrew and I felt like we should interrupt our regularly scheduled podcast to take some time and talk about working from home -- something that we all are going to have to deal with for the foreseeable future .
Since so many of the people we listen to this podcast are single or small office practitioners , we thought that instead of running our scheduled ( and completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A Culture of Design " and will be released a bit later in the year -- that we should take this moment in time and talk a little bit about how the current climate is impacting our daily routines , our jobs , the basic stuff that for the vast majority of us , are the givens that help ground us .
A bit of this is purely selfish on my part because I wanted to make a record of sorts of this particular moment in time -- talk about what is happening to our daily lives in what is unquestionably unprecedented activities .
We will also be talking about working from home -- what that actually looks like -- home office setups , multiple people all working from home , teaching classes remotely , thinking about what that might be like from both the teacher and the student side of things , along with some more mundane realities that we are having to deal with .
I will go on record and say that I am not really a " work-from-home " fan .
As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the vast majority of people really do their best work when left completely to their own devices , a big part of that is based on my own behavior , but as an employee , I really feed off the energy and conversations that take place within the work environment .
Traveling and Going to the Grocery Store 4:36 mark Just about every part of our daily routines is being affected in ways that still do n't make a great deal of sense to me .
I 'm not sure if it 's hoarding behavior taking place , or something along the supply chain has been impacted ( across the entire planet ) but I do n't know why it 's so difficult to get your hands on some toilet paper .
I was out of town for the week when most of the craziness took place where I live .
I was in Northern California spending the week at a rental house in Sea Ranch ( if you 're not familiar with this landmark project , I 've written about it in detail previously here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched more and more things close down and become unavailable .
Friends were telling me about how everything in the grocery stores was gone and that by the time I get back into town all that will be left will be canned asparagus and potted meat .
Luckily it was n't that bad but there were limits put in place on the number of specific items you could purchase .
Luckily , my wife and I do not exhibit hoarding personalities and most of the things on this restriction list were not an issue for us .
Working from Home 15:12 mark I would be interested to hear from people how their work from home situation is shaping up .
Andrew and I recorded this episode on Sunday , March 22nd , and I have now spent 1 week working from home .
and my opinions on the matter have been profoundly impacted by this single week .
I will say that my dogs LOVE having all of us at home all day .
In the beginning , it was a bit overbearing -- they wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted me to pet them , throw the ball and play fetch , even a game of tug-of-war was not out of the question .
On day one , I thought " Okay , I 'll do some of this so you will leave me alone .
"  They still are n't leaving me alone .
Hopefully , they will start to tone down their neediness of my attention because I honestly do n't have the time to pay attention to them .
I was very surprised by just how much time I spent working last week .
I 'm not sure I was very efficient with my efforts on Monday and part of Tuesday , but I finally broke down and set up a " proper " workspace late Tuesday night because sitting on the couch and standing at the bar counter was not working for me .
We have two viable workspaces in my house -- there is a proper office at one end of the house which is the domain of my wife .
Since she already works from home from time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances , she rightfully claimed this space when we bought this house a few years ago .
My daughter has a built-in desk in her bedroom because she basically has 4 hours of homework every night and has needed a proper workspace since she started the 7th grade 4 years ago .
And then there 's me .
I have nothing .
Here is a look at the " temporary " workspace I am throwing down .
I am set up in my bedroom in front of the sliding glass door , and while it looks terrible , so far it 's functioning fairly well .
I can open the sliding glass door -- which I do every day -- to get fresh air , the view is pretty nice , and the surface area is pretty large and can accommodate all the computers and papers that I put on here .
However .
I might need to do something about my chair .
It 's unquestionably the coolest part of this setup and is remarkably comfortable for long periods of time , but the issue is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ? higher ) than what I need and by the end of the day , this disconnect results in sore and achy shoulders from being hunched up all day .
This is my ( Andrew 's ) current setup .
I am working on my dining room table .
While this is 100% temporary , it is working well enough .
Obviously I need more desk real-estate .
I have been spending some of this isolation time to work on my future home office space , but it has been going a bit slower than I hoped .
That is mainly due to the amount of actual work I have been doing during spring break and now isolation .
I hope to have my permanent home office completed in the month of April .
It will be my new home for professional practice , teaching , podcasting , and blogging .
A real HQ ! At the moment we are in sheetrock repair and paint mode .
Teleconferencing -- The New Normal 21:10 mark I am a little shocked to admit that I have participated in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 25 years of my career .
At my last job , I participated in a grand total of three in a 6-year window whereas at my current position at BOKA Powell , I might do 6 a week !  I did a screen grab during one of my meetings last week when we had 10 people on the call .
We are working through a masterplan study and I am part of a 4-person team within my office .
On this particular call , we were presenting our progress to the clients with the intent to receive their input and feedback as we move forward on this project .
While this was the presentation meeting , I bet the members of this team jumped onto a teleconference call either using GoTo Meeting or the conferencing feature within the Teams feature offered by Microsoft 365 .
So we wanted to provide a small list of teleconferencing/remote working applications during this time .
While there are dozens of services , the list I have compiled below is based on those services that I personally know someone who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , I had never even heard of before , but as it turns out , they are fairly popular .
If you look up a " Top 10 " list , these will most likely be there .
GoTo Meeting This one has been around for a while .
They have 2 standard plans ( $14-$16/month ) that you can choose .
The ' professional ' plan has limited features and the business plan would most likely be the one used by AEC .
This is mainly due to the drawing tools feature that is not available on the basic professional version .
They both allow a large number of participants ( 25+ HD video ) and have the standard features of most applications .
GoTo has a good mobile interface for Android and iOS and it seems to have some good features as well .
But you can not use the draw tools on mobile or web interface ; you are required to install the desktop app for that feature .
Skype Skype is almost a household name in the video calling arena .
It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component , screen sharing , call recording , mobile interface , and other typical features .
You can have up to 50 people per call via various methods including phone call only .
Sending files and sharing content within Skype is fairly easy and the messaging is active and stored long term .
Skype also works with Alexa ( the video one ) and also Xbox .
This is touted as mainly a personal service .
It used to have a business component , but now that is part of Microsoft Teams .
Zoom This service includes video and chat features in one package .
This is the one that I am using for my teaching , granted I did not choose , but it has been good to use .
Zoom allows up to 49 persons on a single video conference .
Meetings can be saved locally or to the cloud , has audio transcription , file sharing and calendar integration for meetings with outlook , google , and iCal .
There is a free version of this that allows group meeting of 40 minutes and most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to share screens , remote control screens , and annotate .
Paid versions begin at $15/month and add features .
Cisco Webex WebEx has been in the video conferencing realm for a long time .
They are one of the original players in the market .
Although I mentioned this as being an expensive product in the podcast , it seems that that might be only for the enterprise type usage .
They now have a free version that has some strong basic features .
They modified the options on the free version due to the current situation .
Now you can have unlimited length meetings and up to 100 participants .
Also , Webex has a mobile interface that allows screen sharing , whiteboards , messaging , screen sharing and file sharing .
They also have paid plans that of course increase features , mainly related to storage , recording , and transcription .
The free version of this one seems very robust and could fulfill all the needs of a small business .
BlueJeans This service does not have a free version but plans start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
BlueJeans allows 50 attendees per meeting and has mobile platforms .
You can also call in via phone to a meeting for free with the auto-generated numbers .
This has the basic features of screen share , recording , etc .
but also offers a few other analytical features that are different than others .
BlueJeans offers Dolby Voice and high-quality video and claim this as an outstanding feature .
At the moment the plans are 20% off .
Uberconference Uberconference ( not related to rideshare ) is a newer service that has a free option .
The free option has up to 10 video call participants and now they have increased the call time to 45 minutes .
They paid version is $15/month which increased participants up to 50 per call and a 5 hour time .
Bob and I were recently on a call using these services and it appeared to be basic but easy to use .
It has the features of most of the others in the list within the free version although they may be somewhat limited .
Google Hangouts You should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years .
Google allows up to 10 participants in a video call and is automatically integrated into your google account .
Group chats can include up to 100 people and stay active for as long as you want .
I have some chat conversations that are 9 years old .
Of course , since this is a Google product it works on multiple devices and platforms .
This is a very simple application and does not offer a lot of features like the other services .
The benefit of Google Hangouts is the ease of access and usability .
While not feature-rich , it can be useful for just a face to face chat .
Microsoft Teams This is part of the Office 365 platform from Microsoft .
You have to be a 365 subscriber of a certain level to use this application .
It has the typical features of all the other applications but also includes full integration with all MS Office products .
It also allows you to add third-party applications to the teams and has a " store " to browse MS Teams only applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the work from home situation .
If you have any additional services that you think should be on the list , please let us know in the comments .
The list of these applications was exhausting , but I wanted to look for ones that may be better suited to the AEC industry with features that allowed some collaboration and interaction .
I also put together a list of digital whiteboards that may be of use .
While I wo n't go into the list with any details , I still wanted to share at some of you might find these useful .
I am still in the process of investigating these for my own use in my online studio .
Maybe soon I will do a blog post on these and share more information .
Again if you have alternatives or comments please leave them below .
I would definitely like to know more .
Since we are all having to work from home , we decided to stay on topic and come up with a hypothetical that would be a bit more pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to work from home for the next 5 years and you can only use two rooms that are immediately connected to one another .
obviously one of those should be a bathroom but I 'll leave that up to you .
You can equip this room with only 5 things -- so what will they be ? FYI -- Things like software do n't count as one of the 5 , same goes for office supplies like paper , staplers , etc .
"  Turns out that coming up with 3 things was really easy , the 4th item was almost as easy , and the 5th item .
crazy .
I was wondering if anybody had at least two things that were different than the items Andrew and I put on our lists .
Doing so would suggest that you might work completely differently than us , which I would absolutely like to hear about .
After just a week of working from home , I will admit that I have changed my tune a bit from what I was expecting .
I probably spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my sliding glass door last week as I would have spent sitting in the office -- possibly even more .
One item that we did not spend much time talking about was the " social " part of going into the office .
I am really a social person ( until I 'm not ) and this was one of my main concerns .
Despite the fact that there are two other people in my house with me all day long , we are all having to do our jobs , or in the case of my daughter , do distance learning .
We are all somewhat scattered throughout the house and other than a chance meeting in the break room kitchen , I do n't see either of them for the vast majority of my day .
Surprisingly , I have had great success in getting that social connection to my coworkers through teleconferencing -- much more so than I would have thought possible .
