to a friend or someone like you ?  Comments  A few days ago , I told my children we were going for a walk .
We 'd been in self-isolation for about a week , and , except for going to the park ( before city parks were closed ) , we 'd stayed indoors in our townhouse in the suburbs .
My son yelled no and said he did n't want to go for a walk .
I assumed that was because he did n't want to stop playing video games ( do n't judge me -- I must work ) .
I told him we needed to get some fresh air and stretch our legs .
He started to shout and scream .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected , but I stomped my way to the basement and yelled back that we were going whether he liked it or not .
What he said next stopped me in my tracks .
He came upstairs and said , " But we 're going to catch the coronavirus .
" His face was covered in tears .
It dawned on me that , a month ago , I 'd been doing verbal gymnastics trying to explain to my youngest why the tooth fairy had forgotten to leave money under her pillow .
Now , like most parents , I 'm trying to figure out what to say to my kids about the coronavirus .
So I turned to Ann Douglas , a health and parenting author , for some advice .

" They need to know that they can turn to you for support and encouragement during a scary and uncertain time .
They need to know that you will listen to them and that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thinking and feeling , " says Douglas , whose most recent book is Happy Parents , Happy Kids .
" And they need to know that you will do everything in your power to keep them safe .
In other words , they want you to be an emotional anchor for them in what feels like a really stormy sea .
"  When my son had that reaction to going outside , I spoke to him about how we would be safe if we stayed far from other people .
I felt terrible for not having been able to anticipate how he might be feeling .
I was laser-focused on making sure the kids washed their hands , making sure they did n't touch anything when we were outside .
I 'd failed to consider the kind of emotional and mental impact staying inside and not seeing his friends was having on him .
Recently Kids Help Phone reported a 350 per cent increase in calls .
The national hotline needs volunteers to handle the increase in traffic .
" Words they 're saying are ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus -- what does that mean ? ' Worried about their family , worried about their friends , " said president and CEO Katherine Hay in an interview with CityNews .
" They 're at the start of an isolation period ; that 's kind of scary for them .
They do n't know what next week will look like for them .
"  This past weekend , Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced $7 .
million in funding for Kids Help Phone and addressed Canadian children .
" I know this is tough .
Not being able to see your friends at school , not being able to have your support network close by or do the things that keep you healthy , " he said .
" It can take its toll .
It 's okay to be vulnerable .
It 's okay to have tough days .
But I want you to know that you 're not alone .
"  Before COVID-19 , there were about 28,000 children on wait-lists for mental-health services in Ontario .
Because of the additional demands created by the pandemic , Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ontario government .
Douglas says that that it 's important to be alert for warning signs that a child may be struggling .
If a child changes their behaviour -- say , an outgoing child becomes clingy and fearful -- you should talk to them about what you 're noticing .
And when you convey information about what 's happening in the world , you should consider your child 's age .
" If your child is n't saying a word about everything that is happening , do n't be afraid to start a conversation out of fear that you might end up alarming your child .
Odds are your child is already worried and quietly absorbing a lot of information , " says Douglas .
" Even babies will pick up on the fact that something feels different right now .
Not talking about what 's happening will make the situation even scarier for your child .
They might say to themselves , ' Wow , things are so bad and so scary that we ca n't even talk about it .
' It 's much healthier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you can work through them together and so that you can encourage your child to park some of those worries with you .
"  Douglas advises that , during this time of physical distancing , families try to stick to their regular routines as much as possible and to make sure that everyone is getting enough sleep .
When talking to teenagers , she says , it 's important to respect their understanding of what 's happening .
" Teens hate to feel like they 're being talked down to or being treated like little kids , " she says .
" A conversation about COVID-19 with a teen will be more about sharing information : finding out what your teen knows , addressing any worries and concerns , and helping your teen to come up with their own solutions to the biggest challenges they 're facing right now -- like the challenges of social distancing .
Before March break , my son told me that his teacher had taught them about the coronavirus .
He said that , on the playground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about it because it was only Chinese people who caught the virus .
Parents have a way of thinking that their own children are the moons and the stars , but we must make sure that they are n't and adding to the distress of others with misinformation and prejudice .
We are all in this together .
According to Douglas , we should recognize that this will be a defining moment for all of us .
" It 's okay to reach out to the village for support and to be the village for other families .
We 've never needed one another more , and we can find ways to express our support and caring in new and creative ways -- ways that reflect the need for physical distancing , " she says .
" Parenting is ultimately about empathy : recognizing that it 's hard to be the parent , and it 's hard to be the kid .
And , right now , it 's even harder than usual .
