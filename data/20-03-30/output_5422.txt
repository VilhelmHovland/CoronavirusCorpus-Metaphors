Tens of thousands of people flocked to the Anand Vihar-Kaushambi bus depot in the evening on Saturday , in hope of finding a bus to their respective hometowns and native villages .
From the foot overbridge , one could see people on the roads leading to the depot as far as eyes could take you .
The police cracked sticks to streamline them and keep a strip of road clear for the vehicular traffic .
RSS volunteers wearing black Nehru-caps assisted the police to manage the crowd .
With the scale of the influx , social distancing is a wild impossibility .
One woman fainted in the crowd .
Meanwhile , the depot announcer says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people must go back home .
Amongst the many stranded is Anuj Singh , who is waiting with his family .
His hometown is Shahjahanpur , Uttar Pradesh .
" I heard in the news this morning that the government has arranged 1000 buses .
But there is nothing here , " he says .
He works at a plant where old AC parts are recycled .
Looking at the people jostling against each other , he says , " Ek se ek chipki phir rahi hai public .
Ye sab marne ke hain .
( The people are packed against each other .
They all will die ) , " referring to the risk such proximity holds in times of spread of the Coronavirus .
On the other side of the road , cops casting long , sinister shadows are telling people to keep moving and keep distance .
" There are buses at the Ghazipur depot ahead .
Keep moving .
Hold hands of your children , " a cop says on a loudspeaker .
One of the young boys snaps at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a huge gathering was also witnessed at Ghazipur , near Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border , where people were waiting to board special buses arranged by the Uttar Pradesh government for their native districts in the neighbouring state .
