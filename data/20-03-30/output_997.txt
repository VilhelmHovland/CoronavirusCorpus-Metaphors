What would Thatcher make of Sunak 's coronavirus intervention ?  COMMENT  FOR anyone who is old enough to remember growing up in the Thatcher years , it might have seemed odd for the Conservative Government to have dragged their heels on responding with a financial package for the self-employed during the Covid-19 pandemic .
Chancellor Rishi Sunak surprised many when he announced his eye-watering ? 330 billion of support for workers last week .
He has now followed this up with what he has described himself as " the most significant economic intervention in the history of the British state , " with a similar taxable grant scheme to that offered to employees , worth 80% of self-employed earnings based on their profits for the last three years up to a ceiling of ? 2500 .
From the party traditionally associated with business and enterprise ( despite Johnson 's past disparaging comments ) , it is right and proper that they support the innovators and risk-takers in our workforce .
After all , Tory party heroine , Margaret Thatcher , described her dream of Britain as " a nation of shopkeepers " .
Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on ( their ) bikes " and a generation of workers jumped into self-employment and business start-ups .
Many of them failed and were left to their own devices , abandoned by the doctrine of Thatcher individualism and her insinuation that they just had n't worked hard enough .
Now , in the corona crisis , self-employed workers are suffering from catastrophic losses almost overnight as a result of necessary life-saving health restrictions and social distancing .
A week has felt like an eternity while they wait for this Government 's next move .
More than 20 years on from the end of her controversial reign , Mrs Thatcher would no doubt be impressed to see that entrepreneurs bring in more than ? 300bn to the UK economy every year .
But what would she make of Sunak 's unprecedented intervention in this time of crisis , a woman who was determined to " roll back the frontiers of the state in Britain " ? I doubt she would approve .
Since the Chancellor announced his financial plans for employees and businesses last week , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Ireland , where they have introduced a new " pandemic unemployment payment " now at ? 350 per week , available for all employed or self-employed workers .
In Norway , the government has ensured that the self-employed are also entitled to 80% of their average pay over the last three years .
The UK Government have had to shift into unchartered waters in their tailored response to catastrophic job and income losses ; after their initial disastrous " herd immunity " strategy , they 've obviously decided that it 's better to emulate the successful responses to the Covid-19 crisis that we 've seen across Europe than take a different route .
However , these new proposals do not go far enough , nor do they match the Prime Minister 's pledge at PMQs to deliver parity with the package available for employees .
Although Sunak 's intervention will be welcomed by many , the small print says they will have to wait at least until June to see this help materialise .
There is also the question of new self-employed businesses that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 , they 're left without access to the lifeboats .
The UK Government could have taken a different route .
The SNP , among other opposition parties , have been calling for a Universal Basic Income as the answer to those needing immediate cash and to give workers financial security for the duration of the pandemic .
Many in the Tory party , such as grandees like Iain Duncan Smith , have an almost primal aversion to this policy , describing any kind of UBI as " a disincentive to work " while continuing to push his disastrous Universal credit scheme , with a five week wait for payment .
With 330,000 self-employed people at risk in Scotland , the SNP have repeatedly pushed the Government to raise the Statutory Sick Pay in line with the EU national average and to expand the arrangement for all self-employed , as well as including them in the Coronavirus Job Retention scheme .
Many are facing utter ruin by the abrupt end to their incomes , and Sunak 's package of measures will not reach them in time .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the job of rebuilding our economy and personal livelihoods will begin in earnest .
By that time , we will have learnt much about the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of vital support , both personal and national in a time of danger and tragic loss .
One thing is already clear ; Tory governance , from the Thatcher " no society " years , through David Cameron 's austerity and drastic welfare cuts programme , Theresa May 's " hostile environment " and Johnson 's " get Brexit done " , has failed to address the important needs of the British people .
It 's taken this dramatic turn of events in the shape of a global pandemic to open their eyes to the fragility of many peoples ' lives and the failures of their policies .
It 's taken a threat to life and the economy to shift them out of their traditional comfort zone and let the state take back control .
The old structures are broken .
Let 's hope the electorate never fall for outdated and inadequate Conservative doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Independent Press Standards Organisation 's Editors ' Code of Practice .
