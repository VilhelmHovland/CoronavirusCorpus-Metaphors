Some past societies , such as medieval Europe , abandoned economic activities as people tried to escape plagues , and suffered heavy disruptions to their social order .
In other pandemics , such as the flu of 1918 , economic interactions continued with only limited quarantine measures , as authorities accepted contagion and deaths as the price of continuity .
Today , many nations are more willing -- or feel more able -- to try to have it both ways .
Their hope is to press pause on the economy , save lives , and then press play again .
If it works cleanly , it will be a testament to the flexibility of modern capitalism and the ingenuity of modern government .
More likely , much will go wrong .
" We 're in unknown territory .
Inevitably there 's a lot of guesswork , " said Simon Tilford , an economist at Forum New Economy , a Berlin think tank .

Social-distancing measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close unless essential , can suspend the buying and selling of most goods and services .
But many costs keep on running .
Households have rent or mortgages to pay , as well as bills for food and other necessities .
Businesses have payrolls , debts and other fixed overheads .
Banks owe money and so must collect it .
The conundrum of how to pay wages , rents and interest in the absence of sales has three kinds of answer .
People and businesses could live off their savings until the restrictions end .
But many do n't have enough reserves .
The longer the health emergency lasts , the more people will run out of money .
The private sector could cut its outlays to match the commerce that is still permitted .
But that raises the specter of mass unemployment and bankruptcies , the destruction of countless normally viable businesses , the scattering of workforces , and perhaps a lasting depression .
" There 's a clear common societal interest in preserving jobs and companies from this external shock , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform , a think tank .
" Our economic structure is a very complex machine , and its organization , the match between workers and firms , is difficult to replicate once it 's gone .

In theory , the state could preserve today 's companies and jobs for months on end , provided it can borrow or print enough money and target the aid perfectly , and that people trust normality will return .
In practice , the outcome in many countries is likely to involve a mix of savings , slump and subsidies .
Government packages of fiscal and liquidity support are already huge : $2 trillion in the U .
and hundreds of billions of dollars in Germany , the U .
and France .
European countries are focusing on subsidizing payrolls so that companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering forgivable loans to businesses that hold on to staff , but also expanding unemployment benefits and sending one-time checks to households .
Many countries are delaying taxes and encouraging or paying banks to accept late payments on loans .
But politics has inevitably meant disagreement about how to target the aid , and how far to go in subsidizing the private sector .
The U .
's aid package came too late to avoid a sudden jump in job losses last week .
" We 're seeing unprecedented liquidity support in many countries , but the collapse of private consumption is so big that many firms will go under , " said Mr .
Tilford .
In the U .
and Europe , there is debate over which sectors and companies deserve handouts , which parts of the private sector should be asked to absorb some of the cost themselves , and how to avoid pumping money into ailing companies that would have gone bust anyway .
There is also reluctance in some countries to borrow too much , only a decade after the global financial crisis pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , which has both the world 's deadliest coronavirus outbreak and fragile finances .
Italy 's fiscal and liquidity measures of around ? 25 billion ( $27 .
billion ) are small compared with those of most other big European economies .
Yet Italy 's lockdown is among the most stringent outside central China , where the pandemic began , and is already weighing heavily on an economy that never fully recovered from the last financial crisis .
Rome 's cautious economic response reflects its high national debt and fragile bond market , which in bad times relies on investors ' trust that the European Central Bank would intervene to stop a rout .
Italy , wanting more protection , is pushing for joint borrowing by eurozone members , but countries led by Germany and the Netherlands reject that .

Countries do n't want resurgent coronavirus outbreaks to force a second bout of lockdowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal commercial activity resumes in full .
For countries with large tourism sectors , such as Italy and Spain , losing the summer to continued restrictions would be another heavy blow .
If the operation succeeds , there will be the question of what to do about the large additional public and private debts .
Forgiving loans to businesses that held on the workers could help the private sector to recover , but add to public costs .

Experience suggests they are usually dealt with in several ways , from central banks buying and sitting on them , to forcing private banks and savers to lend cheaply to the government , to eroding their value through inflation .
A decade ago , European countries tried to pay down high public debts after the financial crisis with fiscal austerity .
