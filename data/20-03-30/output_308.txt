In the spring of 1918 , the Great War spawned a sports revolution and a pandemic .
The early signs of change could be seen that March in Hot Springs , Arkansas , where Babe Ruth , a 23-year-old moon-faced German American , discovered the thrill he felt -- and the joy he brought soldiers -- swinging his mighty " war club .
" At the same time , the first wave of the so-called " Spanish Influenza " swept through the resort town .
The question for the gregarious , handshaking , backslapping Babe was whether he could survive the outbreak long enough to fulfill his promise .
By the time the Boston Red Sox began spring training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , and they sorely needed his services in the field and at the plate .
In the season to come , Ruth , a dominant pitcher , filled the void for the Red Sox and America .
Unlike most hitters who choked up on the bat and chopped at the ball , he unleashed an uppercut swing with all his might , launching baseballs into the ether .
Swinging for the fences , Ruth would become the first real slugger , a one-man revolution , single-handedly pounding the game into an entirely different shape .
During one exhibition against the Brooklyn Dodgers , Babe displayed his innovative hitting approach before several hundred doughboys .
On March 23 , both teams left their quarters in Hot Springs early in the morning , took a train through the hills of Arkansas to Little Rock , and then traveled by automobile to the Army cantonment at Camp Pike for the game .
No sooner had the Red Sox arrived at Camp Pike and taken the field to warm up than dark clouds swept in and the skies opened , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the managers canceled the contest , they still held batting practice , and Babe 's performance was thoroughly entertaining for " the khaki boys .
"  To the immense enjoyment of the soldiers , he drove five balls over the right-field fence .
The feat was so unusual that a Boston American headline blared : " Babe Ruth Puts Five Over Fence , Heretofore Unknown to Baseball Fans .
"  The stories of Ruth 's home runs overshadowed a curious development on the team .
During their time in Hot Springs , two of his teammates , George Whiteman and Sam Agnew , fell ill with " the grippe , " and several other players soon became sick .
" The reign of the grippe and sore throats continues , " noted Boston Globe reporter Edward Martin .
That same day , Henry Daily of the Boston American reported , " A perfect epidemic has run through the entire city , and almost everyone complains .
"  No one on the Red Sox seemed too concerned about influenza decimating the team .
Looking back , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among soldiers at Camp Pike and in Hot Springs , a " spa city " of bathhouses and saloons .
It 's likely that influenza struck Hot Springs when troops visited the town .
Shortly before , an initial influenza outbreak began in Haskell County , Kansas , and spread to nearby Camp Funston .
From there the infected soldiers carried influenza from Funston to other camps , infecting civilians along the way .
Yet , the Red Sox encounter with influenza did not end in Hot Springs .
The pathogen followed Babe all the way to Boston .
On May 19 , 1918 , the first warm day of the year , Ruth took his wife , Helen , to Revere Beach for an afternoon outing .
Located just north of the city , it was the nation 's first public beach , a working-class " people 's beach " that featured amusement rides , a boardwalk , and an elaborate pier .
Babe spent the day in the sun , eating a picnic basket full of sandwiches and drinking warm beer , swimming on a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of baseball in the sand with some locals .
He could n't have been happier .
Later that night , Ruth complained of a terrible fever .
His temperature climbed to 104 degrees , his body ached , he shivered with chills , and his throat throbbed .
He had all the symptoms of the flu , a condition that he shared with millions of other Americans in the spring of 1918 .
Although some people died , most struck with the " spring flu " struggled through the aches and sweats of the fever and recovered .
Rumors shot through Boston that " the Colossus .
worth more than his weight in gold " was on hisdeathbed .
Ruth might have been among the lucky ones , but the Red Sox physician made matters worse .
The day after Ruth 's trip to the beach , he was scheduled to pitch .
He showed up at Fenway looking like a ghost , feeling miserable , obviously ill , and in no condition to take the field -- but determined to throw nonetheless .
Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that the trouble was something more than a mere sore throat , and recommended four or five days of complete rest in bed .
" Red Sox manager Ed Barrow agreed , and immediately crossed Ruth 's name off the lineup card and sent him home with the doctor , who liberally swabbed his throat with a caustic compound of silver nitrate , probably a 10 percent solution .
In fact , he painted Babe 's throat too liberally .
Among the dangers of using the solution to treat tonsillitis , the standard American Journal of Clinical Medicine noted in 1914 : " Caution : Great care must be exercised that no excess silver-nitrate solution oozing from the swab drops into the throat , lest serious results follow ; for as we know , cases are on record in which edema swelling of the glottis , severe spasms of the larynx and other spastic affections of the throat , even suffocation , resulted from such accidents .
"  The treatment hit Ruth like a line drive to the throat .
He choked and gagged , writhed in pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the eye and ear ward of the Massachusetts General Hospital .
There a physician packed his inflamed throat in ice .
Soon rumors shot through Boston that " the Colossus .
worth more than his weight in gold " was on his deathbed .
Two days later , the news from Massachusetts General significantly improved .
" Babe 's great vitality and admirable physical condition have started to throw off the aggravated attack of tonsillitis , " noted the Boston Herald and Journal .
" The prophecy now is that the big lad will be out of the hospital in four or five days " and would be ready by the end of the month to travel west with his teammates .
Ruth made a full recovery .
During May and June , he cracked 11 home runs , more than five entire American League teams would hit that year .
In the context of America 's deadly attacks on the Western Front , his awesome power -- his violent , full-bodied swings -- resonated with the country 's glorification of unrestrained force .
Yet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard transport ships set for France .
By May , hundreds of thousands of troops -- countless infected -- sailed across the Atlantic each month , carrying the virus into the packed trenches on the Western Front .
There the virus mutated , and then a more lethal strain returned home later that summer .
Despite warnings from health officials about a citywide outbreak , the World Series between Ruth 's Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs still went on as planned , fueling the plague and infecting patrons at Fenway Park .
Undoubtedly , crowded public events -- three World Series games , parades , rallies , and a draft registration drive -- fueled the epidemic , ultimately killing more than 4,800 Bostonians alone by the end of the year .
On Sept .
11 , 1918 , the day that the Red Sox won the title , Boston newspapers reported that 500 bilious sailors at Commonwealth Pier had contracted " the grippe .
" The next day , 96,000 Bostonians stood in line to register for the draft -- sneezing , coughing , and breathing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of days , the contagion spread as fast as the fear of death .
Boston , a major shipping port where soldiers and sailors came and went , would soon become the epicenter of a pandemic that killed more than 675,000 of America 's 105 million inhabitants .
Worldwide , the figures are even more stunning : Somewhere between 50 million and 100 million died .
After the season ended , Ruth returned to Baltimore , his hometown .
In early October , the Baltimore Sun reported , " The great and only Babe Ruth has fallen victim to the ' Spanish ' flu .
" Ultimately , he recovered from a second fight against the affliction .
Finally , after being dogged by the flu for an entire season , Babe was safe .
But for much of America , the horrors were only beginning .
