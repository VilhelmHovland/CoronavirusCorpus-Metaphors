Gov 's choice of indirect primary overwhelms Oshiomhole  National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC ) seems to have been overwhelmed by the serving governors of the party over the choice of mode of primary as most of them settled for indirect primary .
This revelation came after a closed door meeting of the Progressives Governors Forum held on Tuesday night at the Imo governor 's lodge , Abuja .
The meeting which had both the APC national chairman and his national secretary in attendance was well attended by all members of the APC governors forum .
While addressing the media after the meeting , chairman of the forum and the Imo state Governor , Rochas Okorocha said : " We have adopted both direct and indirect and most of the states are going for indirect primaries .
But for the president , it is going to be direct primary .
Oshiomohle , has been campaigning for the use of direct primary even as his home state is one of the chapters that adopted indirect primary .
" We just held a meeting with the Chairman and we 've resolved that in support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair primaries .
Everybody will be given equal chance to participate in the primaries which will be transparent , free and fair .
" Okorocha assured that both the governors forum and the APC NWC were working together to ensure victory for the party in 2019 general elections .
Also speaking , Kaduna state Governor , Nasir El-rufai , explained that there is no way one hundred percent of the party will agree to one thing .
" There will always be some that will disagree , but the decision of NEC is that majority of the state Executive Committee decided on the mode of primaries .
And the Kaduna state that you mentioned which I 'm the Governor by the grace of God , the majority of the State Executive Committee decided on indirect primaries .
If one or two members do n't agree , that is not the decision of NEC .
" But for the APC national chairman , the task before the party is clear .
" We have a tradition as a progressive party to submit ourselves to the dictates of our party and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must begin from within the house before we can do it outside .
" Those all of us , governors , NWC and even president , we all agreed that this is the way to go and that is what we are going to do .
" When asked to comment on Governor Akinwumi Ambode 's travail in Lagos , Oshiomohle said the party in Lagos state is at peace .
