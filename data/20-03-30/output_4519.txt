Breakfast with Bongani Bingwa  Agriculture Business Chamber economist Wandile Sihlobo says there is no need to panic buy and that doing so may in fact disrupt the food supply chain .
Sihlobo was speaking to Joanne Joseph on the Afternoon Drive on COVID-19 and what it means for South Africa 's food supply .
He says as all of the supporting services in the chain remain operational , the goal is to ensure that there is an efficient flow of food as usual .
We are good in terms of the supply and where its going and to the point that we are saying the shops will remain open but not only the shops , starting from the farm - those will remain operational .
The goal is to ensure that there is an efficient flow of food as usual so South Africans are able to access all of those things .
-- Wandile Sihlobo , Economist - Agricultural Business Chamber ( Agbiz )  I am understanding of the fear that people may perhaps have but I think there is no need to be panic buying because firstly you have the raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain operational and the point where consumers access their products , that too will remain operational .
-- Wandile Sihlobo , Economist - Agricultural Business Chamber ( Agbiz )  Panic buying even does now , it 's actually disruptive because if in certain stores you know you keep a certain amount of stock , there is this artificial demand that comes out and breaks those supply chains - it creates these inconvenience where people might think that there are shortages but it 's actually induced because of our behaviour on how we shop , which is way different than the normal patterns at which business people plan .
-- Wandile Sihlobo , Economist - Agricultural Business Chamber ( Agbiz )  He also adds that there is no need to worry about price hikes given President Cyril Ramaphosa 's reassurance .
I think the president made the point clear yesterday .
People are aware of the difficulties of the day and I do n't anticipate that people might be taking advantage of this but we are not only depending on that , there are monitoring systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sit back and know that most of these things will really be running in a normal way and they will be able to get their supplies when needed .
