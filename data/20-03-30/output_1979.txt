Myria Georgiou  March 30th , 2020  Solidarity at the time of COVID-19 : An(other) digital revolution ?  As the world faces a pandemic on a scale not seen for generations , with much of Western Europe , the US and Asia in various degrees of ' lockdown ' to slow the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 , LSE Professor Myria Georgiou discusses the new digital networks emerging focused on solidarity , and their implications and limitations .
As I am writing this post , we are witnessing incredible levels of citizen mobilisation and acts of solidarity across the UK in response to the coronavirus pandemic .
The call from the National Health Service ( NHS ) for 250,000 volunteers has received a response beyond all expectations , with three times that many people registering online to support health professionals and the particularly vulnerable in just the first few days .
Hundreds of local WhatsApp mutual aid networks of solidarity are now active across the country , when only few days ago just a handful existed in London 's inner city .
There is no doubt that the scale of such acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to .
There is also no doubt that at times of social distancing , social media make such mobilisation possible , quick and effective .
And while we witness these new digital networks of solidarity coming to life , their emergence and focus should come as no surprise .
The scale of digital mobilisation is impressive .
The hundreds of thousands joining WhatsApp and Facebook groups of mutual aid initiatives are becoming local activists , rather than just spectators of the crisis .
At the time of COVID-19 , activism has become hyperlocal and granular -- with citizens organising on social media networks for support of those in need and those in isolation in every corner of the country , but most importantly , in every corner of the neighbourhood .
As often happens at these extraordinary moments , techno-utopian celebrations emerge around the novelty of digital connectivity .
Yet , and while there is no doubt that the speed and the effectiveness of organisation and mutual aid owes a lot to the affordances of social media , the solidarity cultures behind them do not .
Having seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last few days , I made three initial observations :  First , the early and often most active groups emerged in the inner city , that is , in places where local mobilisation and activism have long histories , as the immediate response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy showed during the aftermath of the 2017 disaster .
Thus , the new digital street networks build on the histories and knowledge of the material street networks .
Second , many of the new hyperlocal activists mobilising at the level of the neighbourhood have been learning activism not only from their neighbours , but also from established grassroots movements .
For example , a number of local mutual aid groups in London and eventually the national network Mutual Aid UK , adopted Queercare 's guidelines for supporting those in need without risking spreading infection .
These guidelines , among other material produced by grassroots organisations , became key resources for learning and practicing activism in the neighbourhood .
Third , new alliances from the street to the national level have emerged on social media , as digital networks connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another but also to others across the country .
While this translocal connectivity is impressive in its speed and extent , these networks ' primary focus remains on the immediate locale .
The most active conversations and mobilisation takes place at the level of the neighbourhood .
Thus , the digital response to COVID-19 has been effective precisely because it builds on what we are so used to : communicating , organising and connecting with people we know , or with those our friends know , on social media .
But right now , it is happening more intensely , and importantly , collectively , as a response to a new shared challenge .
These of course are no more than initial observations , and solidarity during times of COVID-19 will most certainly attract systematic research in the near future .
As I conclude , I want to share a final observation and a question .
The more visible that hyperlocal solidarity becomes , the less visible that solidarity towards those beyond the proximate and the familiar seems to be .
As neighbours mobilise to support each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
As life for many at the margins of society becomes even moreunbearable in the context of the pandemic , questions are raised about the potentials and limits of digital solidarity .
How can the tools and the ethos of solidarity driving hyperlocal activism expand beyond the familiar , to include the stranger ?  Share this :  About the author  Myria Georgiou  Myria Georgiou is Professor of Media and Communications in the Department of Media and Communications at LSE .
