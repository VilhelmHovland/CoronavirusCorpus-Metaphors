Covid-19 total lockdown : An economic and humanitarian disaster  India has launched what by any standard is the most draconian and complete nation-wide lockdown of any country affected by novel Coronavirus or Covid-19 .
This is unusual for several reasons .
First , reported infections in India as of March 27 , 2020 are 747 out of a total population of 1 .
billion .
Of these , 20 have died , and 66 have recovered .
What is more , of all the active cases , each and every one of them has shown only mild symptoms .
By any metric , India has a far less serious COVID-19 crisis than many advanced and emerging countries .
It has been suggested , including by me , that the low reported infection rate might reflect a very low testing rate in India .
So far , India has tested a little more than 27,000 samples or a testing rate of about 20 per million .
Compare this to testing rates of more than 6000 in South Korea and more than 600 in Spain .
It is theoretically possible therefore that the infection rate in India is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it raises another puzzle , why is n't an already ill prepared public health system overwhelmed with people showing up with COVID-19 like symptoms ? Why are n't thousands of people on ventilators ? Given India 's large elderly population and many a kind of respiratory problems due to pollution and other reasons , why are n't thousands of people on ventilators and in overcrowded hospitals ? If any of this has happened , it 's a well-guarded secret .
This might just be possible in a totalitarian state like China but it 's impossible in open and democratic India .
Despite its well-known flaws , Indian media , to say nothing of foreign media in India , would have jumped on such a story of alleged cover up .
The other noteworthy feature of the Indian situation is a very low fatality rate when computed as a percentage of all reported cases , as low as 2 .
percent .
Contrast this with fatality rates as staggeringly high as 10 percent in Italy and in the US of 1 .
percent , just a little lower than India .
Apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates around 1-2 percent give or take .

Contrast this with fatality rates as staggeringly high as 10 percent in Italy and in the US of 1 .
percent , just a little lower than India  On the face of it , the Indian data suggest no reason for panic , especially given India 's early and aggressive action in closing international borders to travellers from affected regions -- much before such action was undertaken in places like the US and Europe .
The panic in India and elsewhere emanates from statistical and epidemiological models which predict massive fatality rates if draconian action is not taken to curb the spread of COVID-19 .
It turns out that these models are very likely wrong and have overstated the probable number of deaths from the virus .
Especially egregious is a recent New York Times op-ed by Ramanan Laxminarayan , an economist and epidemiologist who praised India 's lockdown as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model based judgement 500 million Indians could be infected and the consequences would be dire in the absence of draconian measures .
The author claims to have a model but the https : //cddep .
he provides has a barebones verbal description of what the model purports to do with no presentation of either the mathematical model or statistical methodology and jumping directly to his alarmist conclusions .
Yet , this dubious piece of research which can not be replicated has dominated thinking about the spread of COVID-19 and ways to respond to it .
On March 26 , the United Kingdom downgraded COVID-19 and said it is no longer a High Consequence Infectious Disease ( HCID ) .
In particular , low mortality rates were cited as a reason for the downgrade .
Reacting to the UK announcement , Deborah Birx , the White House Response Coordinator for COVID-19 , went so far as to say that the doomsday fatality scenarios predicted by widely publicized models are very likely wrong .
Specifically , she argued that either infection rates , especially of those asymptomatic , are much higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood .
Even more extraordinary , she stated bluntly : " The predictions of the models do n't match the reality on the ground either in China , South Korea or Italy .
"  This is the crux of the matter .
As argued by Stanford medicine professors Eran Bendavid and Jay Bhattacharya in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal on March 24 , a few days prior to the UK decision , there 's a serious methodological error in the way that fatality rates are being computed .
Following conventional practice , as we did above , the fatality rate is computed as the number of deaths out of total confirmed cases , converted into a percentage .
They correctly argue that this is an upward biased estimate as it commits the fallacy of selection .
In other words , confirmed cases are those who 've obviously shown symptoms and been admitted for treatment .
However , the correct denominator is not confirmed cases but the actual total number of infections , a number which is obviously much larger .
In the event that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be much larger than the number of confirmed cases , and the correct mortality rate therefore will be much lower by several orders of magnitude .
According to their estimates , the true mortality rate is not what we reported above for the US , 1 .
percent , but more like 0 .
percent .
If we assume that their calculation would hold true for India as well , the actual mortality rate in India would be an almost unmeasurably small 0 .
percent .
In the event that there are many infected people who 're asymptomatic , the number infected will be much larger than the number of confirmed cases , and the correct mortality rate therefore will be much lower by several orders of magnitude  The public policy implications are very clear .
A disease which has a high infection rate that produces mostly mild symptoms and a mortality rate lower than the common flu is not a non-issue , but it 's not a cause for the levels of panic and paranoia that we 're witnessing around the world , including in India .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring people with even mild symptoms to seek medical help will be a huge burden on the public health system .
At some point , as is already happening in some places including the US , hospital beds and ventilators may have to be rationed .
There is thus a strong case to ensure testing , screening and enforced self-isolation for those exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms for the recommended 14 day quarantine period .
However , there is no valid argument for a draconian total lockdown of the type that has been imposed in India .
For an uncertain and relatively small gain in reduced infections , there is a huge economic , social , and human cost which has already begun to manifest itself .
Good public policy is always based on the best science and most recent and reliable evidence .
Unfortunately , it is not at all clear that science or evidence were the basis of India 's lockdown .
The good news is that there is still time to recalibrate in light of new research , as the UK and the US are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost-benefit analysis to measure the likely gain of a lockdown versus the burgeoning economic costs of basically shutting the economy down , in a country with many poor people already reeling from an economic downturn .
The total lockdown perhaps makes sense in a world in which COVID-19 carries extremely high mortality rates .
We now know that this is very likely incorrect .
The Narendra Modi government needs to re-think its policy before the lockdown produces an economic and humanitarian disaster .
