Tech problems mar 1st day of distance learning in Minnesota  Technology problems marred the first day of distance learning for thousands of students across Minnesota .
Monday marked the first official day of distance learning since school buildings were closed down by Gov .
Tim Walz earlier this month because of the COVID-19 outbreak .
And with students in most other states doing the same , the sheer volume of traffic heading to the online teaching programs led to some tech problems .
Users of one of these services , Schoology , reported crashes and being booted out of the system , as well as problems logging in and loading programs .
Schoology tweeted on Monday that it was aware that some users were " experiencing degraded service , " and that its engineers were working on a fix .
Among the school districts reporting problems was Faribault Schools , which said schools and Minnesota and beyond was experiencing errors in not only Schoology , but other educational software applications including SeeSaw and Flipgrid .
Cloud Schools reported the same issues , tweeting : " Our Distance Learning platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The company is aware of the problem and working to resolve the issues as quickly as possible .
Please have your student attempt to log in to Schoology periodically throughout the day .
"  Distance learning will continue for Minnesota schools until at least May 4 , and depending on how the efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 are progressing , could be extended further .
