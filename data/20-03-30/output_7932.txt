Photo : Tim Fischer / Midland Reporter-Telegram  Opinion : Relieve coronavirus stress and anxiety through meditation  1 / 3  Back to Gallery  The outbreak of the coronavirus , which causes the disease COVID-19 , has been stressful for people .
Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children .
As the World Health Organization officially declared the virus a pandemic , cities across the country are implementing preventative measures , like " social distancing , " to try to mitigate the number of cases and almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pausing our busy lifestyle .
Strengthening immunity is the need of the hour !  What weakens our immune system ?  Constant stress , less sleep , malnourishment , fast-paced lifestyle , anxiety etc .
are typical sources that cause stress and weaken our immune system .
A weakened immune system can lead to chronic infections , inflammation and autoimmune issues .
How can we strengthen our immune system ?  Scientifically , breathing and meditation can help to enhance our immunity .
Taking daily conscious deep breaths helps to balance the nervous system , reinforces the respiratory system , lowers blood pressure , reduces stress hormones , and can even help activate the lymphatic system , which plays a major role in immune function .
To combat the scary news and anxiety around it , yoga , deep breathing and meditation are highly effective and powerful tools .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Harvard medical school recommend to take deep breaths , stretch and meditate .
These tools wo n't keep you free from disease .
But they can certainly help you be free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in touch with your own inner wisdom and resilience .
I learned powerful breathing techniques and meditation almost a decade ago and have been practicing since then .
Daily meditation practice has proven benefits in reducing stress , calming the mind , improving clarity of thoughts , better sleep , enhanced self-awareness , and the list of so many benefits is endless .
I also teach meditation techniques as a volunteer teacher for the Art of Living Foundation , the largest volunteer based non-profit organization .
The Art of Living Foundation is committed to creating a **25;1136;TOOLONG society , through instruction in yoga and meditation .
Art of Living is spread across 155 countries , more than 370 million people have benefited with the unique breathing technique and meditation .
And it is right here in Norwalk .
You are welcome to free online meditation sessions and experience how to manage your stress and anxiety effortlessly .
These sessions are directed by The Art of Living Foundation Instructors every day for 30 minutes from 7 to 7:30 p .
You can choose to join one or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no obligation using the same web conference link you will receive when you register to any one session .
In these 30-minute sessions , you will learn simple and effective breathing exercises , obtain peace and a calm mind with a unique guided meditation , and manage stress and anxiety .
Guided meditations require no preparation or training .
While many people find it difficult to meditate , guided meditations and doing it as a group make it easy for anyone to practice .
I hope that bringing people together for peaceful online meditation will raise awareness , and inspire the public to stand together for building a peaceful society .
