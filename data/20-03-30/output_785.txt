SANDY -- Amid efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 and one week after Governor Gary Herbert issued a " no dine-in " order , small , local restaurants have reported falling sales .
" I hope we can get through this , " said Daniel Yuswadi , owner of MakanMakan in Sandy .
" This is all we have .
We put everything here in one basket .
"  For two years , Yuswadi has seen success at his Indonesian restaurant .
But in just one week , he said business has dropped about 80% .
As state leaders continue to put out the call to take extra precautions to stay healthy and slow the spread of the coronavirus , takeout and delivery options just have n't been enough to make up for social distancing .
And his business is n't alone .
" This is the time more than ever to support your local restaurants , " said Indu Sudhakar , co-owner of Chefpanzee , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small ethnic restaurants across Salt Lake County .
She said takeout and delivery are " honestly the only lifeline that a lot of these restaurants have right now .
"  Sudhakar believed chain restaurants will survive this okay , but she was experiencing firsthand the financial toll the virus is taking on small businesses .
Many of their partners have already closed their doors .
Others , like MakanMakan , are fighting to survive .
" Seeing that they 're giving themselves one-week deadlines to see if they can stay in business through delivery or takeout and then shut down after that .
It 's pretty heartbreaking , " she said .
Chefpanzee is hoping to help relieve some of the pressure on small restaurants , charging them much less than competitors like DoorDash and giving customers the option to donate directly to restaurants .
" We have folks who are placing 15 orders and leaving 20 donations and 10 tips for their drivers .
And that 's Utah , " Sudhakar said , adding she hopes to see more of that in the days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to keep his place virus free .
The visible Clorox wipes and hand sanitizer do n't tell half the story .
He goes so far as to check himself and his employees with a thermometer gun every day before going into work .
" We will get through this together .
Together , " he said , cautiously optimistic the downpour will end and they will come out on top .
