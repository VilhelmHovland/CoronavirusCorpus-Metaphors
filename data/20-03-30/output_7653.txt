University of Maine System cancels in-person graduations  The University of Maine System announced Monday that in-person graduation ceremonies for campuses around the state wo n't be taking place this year because of the coronavirus pandemic .

" It is with a sober sense of responsibility that our presidents and I have therefore decided that we can not proceed with our planned in-person commencement exercises in early May .
"  All universities and the law school will still be awarding degrees on schedule and recognizing students ' academic achievements , Malloy said .
