Any shops deemed non-essential are under orders to close their doors to curb the spread of coronavirus in the UK .
However the Association of Convenience Stores ( ACS ) has said its members have faced " overzealous enforcement and a misreading of the rules " over whether products , such as Easter eggs , are essential items .
Local police authorities could be " interpreting rules in their own way and coming up with incorrect approaches " , it warned .
ACS chief executive James Lowman said : " The government have defined which stores can remain open , and that includes convenience stores including newsagents and off licences .
There is no government definition of which products can be sold within those stores .
Police ' mis-reading coronavirus rules '  " This is overzealous enforcement and a mis-reading of the rules .
In the cases where officers have challenged retailers and shoppers in this way , it 's brought confusion , distracted retailers in the busiest weeks of their lives , and increased the interactions between people at a time when the government is trying to minimise them .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would normally be selling " .
Supermarkets , pharmacies , banks and post offices are among the other essential retailers allowed to stay open during the lockdown .
The lockdown measures will be in place for an initial three weeks , after which they will be reviewed .
The deputy chief medical officer yesterday warned that life in the UK would not get back to normal within the next six months .
However , coronavirus measures will likely be gradually eased off during that time frame .
