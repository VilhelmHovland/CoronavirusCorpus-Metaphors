Share this article  Two 1-year-olds among Niagara County 's Covid-19 cases , now at 51  Two of the 51 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Niagara County are 1-year-old infants , county Public Health Director Daniel J .
Stapleton said in a briefing today .
Stapleton said the oldest confirmed patient in the county is 83 years old .
He did n't give any details on the locations of any patients , and he does n't intend to .
Stapleton said counties have been working with the State Health Department to craft a consistent policy on public disclosure .
Generally , counties now post maps showing cases within the boundaries of cities and towns , and go no further than that .
The Niagara County Health Department updated its online map of cases for the first time since Friday , showing new cases across the county by municipality .
The county added 23 new cases since Friday , and 13 since Sunday , when it offered a written update .
Niagara Falls and Wheatfield have the most cases , with 10 each , followed by North Tonawanda and the city and town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case rundown is : Lewiston 4 , Pendleton 3 , Newfane and Porter each 2 , Somerset and Town of Niagara each 1 .
These are the first cases reported in Porter and the Town of Niagara .
" The numbers in the higher density populations are increasing , and we 're moving up to the lakeshore , Lake Ontario , " Stapleton said .
Tracking information about where patients went before their diagnosis will no longer be provided , he said .
His staff is n't big enough to work on that as the number of cases grows daily , Stapleton said .
" It also seems that it 's less medically necessary for people to know the exact whereabouts of these individuals throughout their weeks past .
We say again and again , this is everywhere now , " County Legislature Chairwoman Rebecca J .
Wydysh said .
" Where that person visited a week ago , two days ago or a month ago is irrelevant , " Stapleton said .
" People hate to hear that , but it is when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  Stapleton said the county lacks the resources to do much Covid-19 testing , so it is being reserved for those in the most immediate danger .
" We 're really focusing on inpatients -- our top priority -- first responders and health care personnel , " he said .
" Those are the people who will be tested and are being tested .
People who do not have symptoms will not be tested .
"  Stapleton did not disclose the number of people in quarantine .
He did say during his briefing on a local cable TV channel that no one has been admitted to the former Inter-Community Memorial Hospital in Newfane , where the county set up a quarantine site for those whose home circumstances prevented them from being quarantined at home .
