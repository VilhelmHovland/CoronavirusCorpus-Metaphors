For Small , and many other people who have been to prison , they have a unique perspective on being in confinement and isolation .
It 's forced many of them to relive some of the darkest chapters of their lives .
But it also stirred a camaraderie in online discussions and social media , with many of them sharing their coping skills with others .

The coronavirus pandemic , a crisis that has driven as much uncertainty as any challenge in American history , has left many searching for the strength of experience and hope .
The elderly tell tales of soup lines and rations in the Great Depression and World War II .
Veterans tell war stories of how they made it through tours of duty .
The chronically ill tell about finding the joy in each day .
Ex-prisoners have a tale to tell here too .
It 's one of making the best of an unpleasant situation .
Learning to accept things beyond your control .
Finding the peace to sit through the silence of each day knowing that it will eventually come to an end .
Of course , criminal justice advocates , mental health workers and formerly incarcerated individuals the Press talked to all agreed the circumstances were not exactly the same .

But they did say lessons could be drawn from the experiences .
" These are insights they obtained involuntarily , " said Craig Haney , a professor of psychology at University of California Santa Cruz .
He 's spent the past four decades studying incarceration , with a particular focus on individuals held in solitary confinement .
In the wake of social distancing measures taking place for the coronavirus pandemic , Haney penned a letter to colleagues about some of his observations .
He said while there is no comparison between the situations , the social isolation aspect they hold in common presents opportunities for learning .
" We 're not all going to live in solitary confinement .
Those places are harsh , they 're degrading , they 're dehumanizing -- what is comparable is the social isolation that most of us rarely ever experience .
"  J .
Wesley Boyd , an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , said solitary confinement is a form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw between someone who is voluntarily staying in their house and has internet access and privacy in the toilet and things like that .
But what we know about solitary confinement -- especially if it 's prolonged -- it can cause mental health issues even in people who never had any mental health problems , " Boyd said .
Antonne Henshaw , 50 , of Camden , who spent 30 years in state prison for murder , said he recently spoke with members of a group that advocates for prisoners re-entering society .
and the social distancing measures were on everyone 's mind .
In the video above this story , you can see Henshaw and other formerly incarcerated individuals talk about their experiences with solitary confinement along with Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello .

( Photo : Tanya Breen )  " We 're all formerly incarcerated , and we 're like wow , who knew this would be a skill ? It 's about transferrable skills -- hard skills , soft skills .
"  Henshaw , who is a graduate student at Rutgers in Camden and works with the Camden Center for Youth Development , said the key to surviving isolation was structure .
" You can only watch so much TV , " he said .
Henshaw said reading , focusing on spirituality and following a set schedule is required to help maintain mental discipline .
Henshaw 's advice was similar to that of Michael Mendoza , national director of #cut50 , a criminal justice reform group .
Mendoza spent 17 years in prison in California after he participated in a gang-related killing when he was 15 years old .
At times , he too was held in isolation during his incarceration .
