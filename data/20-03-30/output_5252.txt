' I 've stopped talking to someone I love because of their COVID-19 attitude '  By Anonymous 8 hours ago  I 've just discovered that one of the people I love most in this world is a total a-hole when it comes to coronavirus behaviour , and it 's breaking our relationship .
No , it 's not my husband or anyone in my immediate family -- and you wo n't be able to guess who it is , so do n't try .
I 've had several discussions with this close person recently , and in each and every one I have discovered that while my family and I are taking every precaution ( working from home , home schooling , only leaving the house for one of the four sanctioned reasons ) , this person is still out and about for no real reason , only thinking about their own risk of infection and blithely telling me they need to " still live life " .
Well , that 's great .
Until there 's no life to live anymore , because of your stupidity -- and I 'm not talking exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought all my friends and associates were on the same page when it came to #slowthespread and #flattenthecurve .
" While my family and I are taking every precaution , she 's out and about for no reason .
" ( iStock )  I work in media , and we are well across sharing the latest government advice on how to put the health of the whole population ahead of a personal desire to continue business-as-usual .
It is not business as usual .
We 're all aware of it , and we should all be heeding it .
But this one , this one person , is not .
And it was so confronting to me after a week of social-distancing and general life-disruption that I could n't hold back the tears anymore .
I hung up the phone and realised that right now , amongst all the anxiety and flux that 's swirling around all of us , I could n't speak to this person anymore .
Not to check in .
Not to say hi .
Not to shoot the breeze to alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough toilet paper , because after that last selfish assertion ( that their personal rights are more important than the health of a neighbour ) I could n't care less if they have toilet paper or not .
Not only were they simply being outstandingly selfish with their physical behaviour , they were now adding to the personal anxiety and stress of everyone around them by voicing their self-centred attitude to other people 's health .
I was so shaken by their latest display of contempt for the well-being of others and their disregard for spreading the virus ( as long as they do n't get it themselves , of course ) that I almost stopped breathing .
How do you say to someone you love , someone you previously thought of as sensible and compassionate , " What if you do n't get it , but you pass it along to someone you love , and they die ? "  WATCH : Creative ways people are staying connected while practising social distancing and self isolation .
( Post continues .
)  This person actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk , I 'm very healthy , and I 'll be going out again later today .
"  To be clear , they were n't going out for their work , a medical appointment , and not even for essential supplies .
They were just ' going out ' .
It was all I could do not to scream at them -- " Well , lucky you ! What about all the people who are n't as healthy who you pass the virus onto because you wanted to go to the shops just because you 're bored ! "  You might not catch it , but there are countless lift buttons , hand rails , jars in supermarkets , coffee counters and endless other things you touch while you 're out .
That 's a lot of stuff for you to move the virus around on .
even if you do n't get symptoms yourself .
I do n't care if you 're wearing a mask , you 're still punching those lift buttons a bunch of times more than you needed to if you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But that 's the flaw in our thinking right now : We 're all assuming it 's about us personally catching the virus , not about the fact unnecessary movements push it around .
" You might not catch it , but there are countless lift buttons , hand rails and endless other things you touch while you 're out .
" ( iStock )  When I did ask " What about the people you might pass it onto ? " this person simply said , " But where would I get it from ? I 'm being careful .
"  Well , that 's great .
Tell that to the people who do n't know how they caught it and ca n't track where they 've been with it .
That 's how you get it .
So , I 'm cutting you off .
If you 're only thinking in the most selfish terms about how to stop yourself getting the virus and taking the view ' but I 'm safe , it 's OK for me to make that extra trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the one meme that sums it all up for me and it might help you reassess why I 've stopped talking to you :  Stupid people : ' But it only has a three per cent death rate'Smart people : ' If I gave you 100 Skittles and told you three of them were poison , you 'd avoid all the f---ing Skittles '  It 's that simple , people .
This is n't about you .
It 's about the people around you -- even if they 're 1 .
metres away .
And the more you pretend it 's not , then the more Skittles become poison because you touched them , even if you did n't eat them .
Stay home .
Unless it 's absolutely essential .
