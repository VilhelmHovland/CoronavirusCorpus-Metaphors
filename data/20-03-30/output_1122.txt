While football across Africa has been suspended amidst the coronavirus pandemic , sport in Burundi continues unabated , with the Central African country yet to record a case of COVID-19 .
The tiny nation -- with an area of 27,834 km2 just slightly bigger than the state of Maryland -- is one of the few territories in the world yet to be officially touched by the virus , and one of only a handful of countries worldwide where domestic football , and anything else with a crowd , continues .
The men 's President 's Cup and second division matches , as well as the top two tiers of women 's football , took place across the country this weekend , with fans in attendance , although it 's a decision that is proving divisive among the country 's footballing community .
Even though they play on , and opinions differ about that decision , Burundi is not ignorant of the external threat of COVID-19 , and have already taken drastic steps to seemingly prevent their first case .
They were among the first African nations to appeal to the Confederation of African Football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifiers , having refused to call up any Europe-based players for their double-header against Mauritania .
" The measure is taken because of the 14 days ' quarantine required to enter Burundi after having been in Europe , " read a statement on the BFF 's website on March 13 .
Since then , the country has yet to record a confirmed case of coronavirus , with strict measures being observed to limit the flow of people into the nation 's territory .
Only cargo planes are allowed to land at Bujumbura International Airport , while anyone arriving from affected countries must observe two weeks of quarantine .
As it stands , football fans in Burundi can still attend games .
Burundi is the only African country that still has live sports , in the face of the coronavirus pandemic , as the country has no recorded cases .

" I believe that the problem is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's like Catholic Mass , many countries have closed the services , but in Burundi , they continue .
There are no cases confirmed here , and no other explanations needed .
"  The decision to continue playing reflects the regulations across the country , where weddings , conferences , meetings and various forms of other entertainment continue without restriction .
It 's also generated support from the country 's other sporting stakeholders , with domestic basketball , beach soccer and volleyball competitions also being conducted at the weekend .
" The government has taken the necessary measures , except confinement , " Liliane Nshimirimana , President of the Association of Sports Journalists in Burundi , told ESPN .
" I support the idea of respecting the measures that have already been taken , but as there are no positive cases detected , nothing is preventing us from continuing our activities , including sports .
" We feel we 're safe .
The local players are going ahead , relaxed , everyone is in agreement and these are measures set by the federation .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available and they are playing as normal .
For those of us who are here in the country , we have no problems .
" We all agree that we should continue with our activities , there is no fear , or panic .
"  Burundi , a staunchly Catholic country , has not stopped Mass services , or any sporting fixtures , during the global coronavirus pandemic .

" There still are n't any cases in Burundi , so activities are continuing freely as normal , " he began .
" They 've closed the borders , and even the airport , so if there are no people coming from outside , then there will be no contamination , although it is risky .
" We 'll wait to see what happens in June , as nobody knows exactly what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't yet followed the steps of their regional neighbours , including Kenya , where football was halted after three cases had been confirmed .
" Here , as they already had positive cases , it was responsible to take this decision , " he added , " because the contamination of the virus happens very fast and you just do n't know .
"  Burundians outside the country , who witness first-hand the impact of the virus in their adopted nations , appear more sceptical about their homeland 's approach to preventing the virus 's spread .
Nshimirimana acknowledges that the Burundian diaspora have offered words of warning , with only eight African countries still without a confirmed case , and Burundi the only one of those to continue with sports .
She said : " There are Burundians in exile who are the ones who go on social media and write things like how Burundi will have positive cases despite the lack of such results , but there are n't any , honestly , I swear in God 's name .
" Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures taken by the government and we continue with our activities .
"  Burundi national team player Laudit Mavugo is in self-isolation in Zambia , and feels it can not be true that Burundi has no cases of the coronavirus .
Muzi Ntombela/BackpagePix  Laudit Mavugo , who represented Burundi at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations , has expressed concern about the country 's handling of events and gatherings , and the broader approach taken by the authorities .
He told ESPN : " They say that there 's no pandemic over there , but I do n't think so .
" Of course there are cases but I do n't know why they say that there are n't .
Really , it 's shocking , and of course I 'm afraid for my country .
I still have family there .
" Everyone says God will protect the country , but it 's not a good reason to still play .
"  The striker is currently in self-isolation in Zambia , where the Super League has been closed down , and is witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a similar story for Equatorial Guinea-based youngster Jules Ulimwengu , whose move to Chinese second division side Shaanxi Chang'an Athletic fell through in late 2019 due to the onset of the virus .
" Here , the championship has stopped , " he told ESPN .
" It 's serious , in Burundi and they will stop , because they 've already closed nightclubs , and bars have a curfew .
" I do n't really know why football is carrying on , and I do n't agree that there are no cases in Burundi , but honestly I do n't know .
"  The 20-year-old has expressed concern about his family 's well-being , although has been unable to return home from Equatorial Guinea due to the travel restrictions placed on those based overseas .
Ultimately , the decision to halt domestic sports will likely only be taken by the federations themselves , if and when the government and the influential Catholic Church adopt a different approach and transmit a different message .
This weekend , the archbishop of Bujumbura , Gervais Banshimiyubusa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat the virus , but insisted that church doors would not be closed and Mass would not be cancelled .
The church has , however , introduced measures such as avoiding physical contact during church services and instructing those who are coughing to remain at home .
In a country where the Catholic Church has great influence over the public psyche , Banshimiyubusa will be one of several key figures in setting the tone in future .
