To : Honourable Tyler Shandro , Minister of Health of Alberta AND Honourable Jason Kenny , Premier of Alberta CC : MLA David Shepherd , Opposition Health Critic AND Dr .
Christine Molnar , President of the Alberta Medical Association AND Honourable Patty Hajdu , Minister of Health of Canada Dear Minister of Health , Premier and leaders of the Government of Alberta ,  We are the front-line doctors serving patients across the province of Alberta in this unprecedented time .
The proposed changes that will be initiated April 1 , 2020 are detrimental to our patients and the healthcare system .
Now is not the time to restructure the system that we understand and intrinsically know how to operate .
COVID-19 is spreading like a wildfire in this province .
We are a strong and trusted team who require necessary resources to help us put out this fire .
We oppose this Government 's implementation of harmful actions targeted towards our public healthcare system .
These actions will destabilize an already stressed healthcare system during this uncertain time .
We are essential responders that can not be replaced ; our crisis training will serve Albertans during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time where we are counted on to perform to the best of our capabilities .
Now is not the time for Albertans .
Albertans are overwhelmed by the physical , emotional and financial issues surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic .
All Albertans are dealing with profound changes that are beyond their control .
An abrupt pause to the proposed healthcare changes must occur immediately to avoid burdening and negatively impacting our Albertan patients in crisis .
Now is not the time for restructuring our Healthcare System .
In these uncertain times , there is an ever-growing demand put on Provincial leaders .
Both government and medical professionals provide essential services and our citizens look to us for stability in a world of ambiguity .
As such , now is not the time to implement changes that will negatively impact the province 's ability to deliver accessible care under our already existing and exceptional healthcare system .
Now is not the time to under-resource physicians .
These are unprecedented times that require extraordinary support and flexibility for clinical care .
Physicians and medical support staff are performing beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than 400 community clinics across this province are either closing or laying off staff .
This will overburden and overwhelm community and inpatient physicians to provide services that put patients first .
Virtual options for providing care must be made more readily available and require compensation equivalent to an in-office visit , thereby allowing for crucial time needed to reassure and address our patients ' mounting critical needs .
We must have the necessary resources for these clinics caring for Albertans .
Once the essential health issues of Albertans during the COVID-19 pandemic are addressed , we are committed to ensuring the stability and financial feasibility of our healthcare system today and in the future .
Until then , our immediate need from the Government for stability , support , and resources is vital if we are to put out these wildfires for Albertans .
Your immediate response is critical during this exceptional , historic and life-altering period .
