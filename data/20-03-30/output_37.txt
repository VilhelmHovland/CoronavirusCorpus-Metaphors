Any changes made to loans between March and June to be modifications , not restructuring  The Central Bank yesterday announced a slew of fresh regulatory measures , including allowing banks to draw down their capital buffers by 100 basis points to smoothen credit flows , allowing recovery of foreign currency loans in rupees , permitting borrowers two-month extensions , and delaying capital enhancements by two years .

( b ) Withdraw the requirement to classify all credit facilities extended to a borrower as nonperforming when the aggregate amount of all outstanding non-performing loans granted to such borrower exceed 30% of total credit facilities .
( c ) Allow banks to recover loans in rupees , as the last resort , in circumstances where recovery of loans in foreign currency is remote , subject to banks ensuring certain conditions are met .

( f ) Defer the requirement to enhance capital by banks which are yet to meet the requirement by end 2020 , till end 2022 .
( g ) Reset the timelines for addressing supervisory concerns , if necessary , by prioritizing on the severity/importance of the concerns raised .
