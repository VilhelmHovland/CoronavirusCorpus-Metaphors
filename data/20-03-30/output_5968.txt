How to be a chick : Mumbai can never become a ghost city  As of now , we are all totally bewildered .
A new world order is upon us , and it will take a while for anything to make sense .
Words like ' lockdown ' are striking terror in our lives , as we helplessly wonder : what next ? Nobody knows .
Till then , we comfort ourselves the best we can , and pray fervently : this too shall pass .
Mumbaikars are a magnificent species .
Despite all the doomsday prophecies and worst-case scenarios , here we are cheerfully and philosophically going about our lives , without getting crushed under the most intimidating global calamity that has brought the world to its knees .
A minuscule virus has reduced humanity to a quaking , fearful blob ! No matter what critics and cynics feel , most citizens will agree the Maharashtra government has been pro-active from day one , and taken prompt action to counter and contain the new coronavirus .
Given the magnitude of the problem , the state government has come through , with firm measures and strict directives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives .
The appointment of two senior bureaucrats to head crisis management in the state is a very positive step .
On a personal level , I have been in ' self-isolation ' for 14 days -- and to my great surprise , I have never felt better ! The first time I stepped out , I was prepared to see a transformed , desolate metropolis , with deserted streets and shuttered shops .
This is what my friends had been describing in low , depressed voices , as they trekked to work and cut back on social outings .
Perhaps , I was plain lucky .
Marine Drive was bathed in a gorgeous golden light , the sky was eggshell blue , and there were pale green leaves on all the trees .
More ! The usual , romantic couples were right there -- billing and cooing on the parapet at Marine Drive -- a most heartening sight ( love conquers coronavirus ? ) .
Yes , there were significantly fewer cars on the road , but mercifully , most of the shops were open .
You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why were the couples behaving in such a careless fashion when the whole world is discouraging any form of tactile contact ? How terrible of shopkeepers to conduct business when it is clear it is unhygienic surfaces that are the real culprits in spreading the deadly virus ? Then there will be disgusted people who will shrug and comment that we Indians lack discipline .
We are stupid and dirty and not bothered about maintaining any sort of order .
We deserve what happens to us -- we refuse to follow orders and bring such avoidable devastation on ourselves .
Look at how people are behaving in other countries -- will we never learn ?  The truthful answer is : we don't/wo n't learn .
Yes , this has been a terrifying wake-up call , not just for hard-working Mumbaikars , but the entire world community .
We have woken up to our collective vulnerability .
And it has disoriented us .
What do we do ? The obvious answer is -- follow instructions .
By and large , people are doing just that .
One can see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city that thrives on ingenuity , enterprise , risk and derring-do .
There are millions of daily wage workers ready to risk their lives , since the choice is obvious -- it 's contracting COVID-19 or starvation .
They have families to feed , school fees to pay -- they can not afford to stay home with masks on and watch Netflix .
They are not on Instagram or Facebook posting hand-washing videos .
They are n't joking about hosting masked balls over the weekend or swapping playlists .
They are worried about their next meal .
Not their missed Red Carpet event .
The virus has provided a great perspective by being the most powerful equaliser in history .
We are all equal and at the mercy of a microbe .
The same microbe our doctors , nursing staff and all the others working selflessly for us at public hospitals , are also exposed to far more than anybody else .
They have been rightfully described as heroes -- imagine what would happen to us if they shirked their jobs ? Some of them are putting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
And doing so without any expectations of recognition or rewards .
Which is why I was deeply upset when media colleagues dismissed the hotline initiative put together by a group of doctors , to answer calls 24x7 and reassure citizens seeking much needed information .
" They are doing this for publicity .
and to collect data of callers , " said a friend .
I would like to believe that in a world that is being devastated by what seems to be an unstoppable tsunami of death and disease , there are countless good and noble people , who still put others before self .
Let us salute our co-citizens and thank them from the bottom of our hearts for inspiring us to do what we can to fight -- and win -- this terrible war .
Oh yes , do n't forget to hang out of your balconies at 5 pm on Sunday and clap .
And as good nagriks , do cooperate with the PM 's Janta Curfew .
