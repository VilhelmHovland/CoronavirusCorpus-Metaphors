As scientists boost their efforts in the global battle against Covid-19 , a Malaysian is part of the brightest and most brilliant who are making quite an impact .
Malaysian PhD student , 26-year-old Lim Boon Chuan is part of the team at the University of Oxford 's Engineering Science Departments and the Oxford Suzhou Centre for Advanced Research ( OSCAR ) who were behind the development of a rapid testing technology for Covid-19 .
The Public Service Department ( PSD ) scholarship holder is studying synthetic biology at the university , as according to New Straits Times .
" We can use a single temperature , which is 65 ? C for half an hour to see the results , " said Lim , adding that the new technology produced results faster and could potentially be used in any household .
Lim has won several awards including the 3rd prize at the 2018 Chief Data International Big Data Forum &amp; Competition for Innovation and Entrepreneurship .
" Our goal is to design and produce something that can be sent to households , so people should be able to do the testing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to a hospital , " he added .
Lim , who is from Kuala Lumpur , got involved with the project just last month when the coronavirus was raging in China and there were few cases elsewhere in the world .
He designed and ran all the experiments .
If it all goes well , Lim and his team will keep working on to develop an integrated device so that the tests can also be used at clinics and airports .
It 's refreshing to see that not only so many brave and smart Malaysians are battling this virus on front lines .
