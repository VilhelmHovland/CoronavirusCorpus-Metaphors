Dublin ladies footballer Siobhan Killeen has revealed that she 's tested positive for Covid-19 -- and has urged people to abide by expert advice in the fight against the coronavirus .
Killeen , 27 , who first experienced symptoms last Sunday evening , was tested on Monday and received her result on Tuesday .
She is now self-isolating at home but reports that she 's doing well and is anxious to return to work when she 's given clearance to do so .
Killeen , a former Republic of Ireland soccer international who scored a remarkable individual tally of 5-4 for Clontarf in the 2018 All-Ireland Intermediate club final , is a radiographer at Dublin 's Mater Hospital .
And she said : " I 'm doing fine .
I took a turn on Sunday evening , I got the sweats in the sitting room after working that morning , and a really bad headache .
" Up until that point , I was really well , really busy in work but quite active as well .
I went for a run on the previous Friday , had a training session on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday morning .
" I felt good , it was n't like my energy levels were low .
On Sunday evening , I took a turn for the worse , and became unwell .
That lasted all through the night , aches in my legs that travelled to my back .
" I never really got respiratory symptoms , I did n't have difficulty breathing , a sore throat or cough .
It was the sweats and headache and while , looking back , I may have coughed once or twice over the weekend , it was nothing out of the ordinary .
"  Killeen rang into work on the Monday morning , was swabbed , and the results on Tuesday revealed that she was positive for coronavirus .
And she reflects now : " I 'm not an infectious disease expert , I 'm just listening to what I 'm told .
" I 'm working in a hospital and taking the advice of experts , and following suit .
We will get through it , once we all play our part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to obey the regulations that are being put in place .
"  In her role as a radiographer , Killeen was playing a key role as the health system and the general population battles Covid-19 .
And she says : " Radiography is about diagnostics and we 'd be very much in the front line in terms of diagnosing illnesses .
" One of them is Covid-19 and we were well prepared in terms of information , education , supplies .
We always had the correct PPE ( Personal Protective Equipment ) and we were constantly being updated on what is a new enough illness , with information changing constantly .
" I would n't have considered myself vulnerable but the stats are that 25 per cent of cases are healthcare workers and I was just maybe around it more often .
" I 'm self-isolating for two weeks from when I first showed symptoms but I 'm not thinking too much about that , especially when you 're 24 hours in a room .
I 'm taking it day by day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel healthy and well and the hospital have been great .
" I 've had infectious team doctors , occupational health and the HSE in touch to check on how I am .
And a pulse oximeter checks my oxygen levels and my pulse , feeding electronically into an app on my phone and they can check that remotely , to see how I am over a long period .
"  This is n't the first battle that Killeen , a lethal forward for club and county , has had to face in recent times .
An innocuous training ground twist in April 2019 saw her sustain a hamstring injury so severe that it was ripped from her hip .
For 20 weeks after sustaining the career-threatening setback , Killeen was reliant on crutches , with her right leg in a DonJoy brace for 12 weeks , 24 hours a day .
" I had surgery to reattach it ( hamstring ) , " Killeen explains .
" It was done by a brilliant surgeon , Denis Collins in Santry .
He warned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehab would be the tough part .
" I remember when I got the result of the injury , it felt like my world was crashing down .
That might sound dramatic but football and sport was everything to me .
" But through it all , I had an unbelievable support system and the Dublin team kept me involved , which was huge for my mental health .
"  While Killeen has worked hard to ensure that her hamstring is as good as it can be , her current focus is on getting through this current challenge .
And she says : " It 's a real fight ( for the country ) and people have realised the seriousness of it .
" It does seem to have brought the country together in some way and in the hospital , there 's a real atmosphere of doing it together and fighting it together .
I quickly had to distance myself from everyone and not to put those I love at risk .
"  Killeen admits that while she takes on the virus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration when she goes online and reads stories about those who are not obeying Government guidelines .
She says : " It 's very frustrating when I see people out , groups of young kids on social media out together , the videos we 've seen online .
I 'm stuck in my room feeling very guilty because when I first got diagnosed , the guilt I had was that I could n't go to work .
" I 'm a risk to vulnerable people and then you see people not paying any regard to the fight you 're in .
It 's very frustrating .
