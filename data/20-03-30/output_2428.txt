He 's slim , clean-shaven , in his fifties , with short curly brown hair .
He 's wearing a pale blue shirt and a striped red tie .
Steve says HOW IS ONTARIO 'S ECONOMIC UPDATE LIKELY TO BE RECEIVED ON THE FINANCIAL PAGES OF THIS PROVINCE ? LET US FIND OUT VIA FACETIME IN TORONTO WITH VANMALA SUBRAMANIAM , REPORTER WITH THE FINANCIAL POST .
Vanmala is in her early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing a black sweater .
Daniel is in his late thirties , with short gray hair and a trimmed beard .
He 's wearing a red flannel shirt .
Steve continues HI , YOU TWO .
NICE TO HAVE YOU ON TONIGHT , VIRTUALLY , IF NOT AROUND OUR STUDIO TABLE .
LET 'S START , VANMALA WITH YOU , WHAT 'S THE HEADLINE FROM THE ECONOMIC STATEMENT TODAY IN YOUR VIEW ?  Vanmala says THERE ARE A COUPLE SENSIBLE THINGS I THOUGHT .
SO FOR ONE , JUST BASIC THINGS LIKE MAKING SURE THERE 'S NO PEAK ELECTRICITY RATES FOR THE NEXT 45 DAYS , DEFERRING INTEREST PAYMENTS ON STUDENT LOANS .
THOSE WERE ALL GOOD THINGS .
BUT THE HEADLINE TO ME , I THINK , IS THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THAT 3 .
BILLION DOLLARS FOR HEALTH CARE SPENDING , BECAUSE WE KNOW WITH AN AGING POPULATION IN THIS PROVINCE , POPULATION GROWTH FOR THE LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS , THAT HAS BEEN PRETTY DRAMATIC .
OUR HEALTH CARE HAS BEEN CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED .
THAT 'S A STAT THAT HAS BEEN PUT OUT THERE BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WE SEE A SURGE IN THE NUMBER OF COVID CASES , INSUFFICIENT ICU VENTILATORS AND HOSPITAL BEDS AND THE LENGTH OF TIME THIS WHOLE THING MIGHT GO ON FOR , BEYOND SIX MONTHS , I DO N'T KNOW IF 3 .
BILLION DOLLARS IS SUFFICIENT AND THAT WOULD BE WHAT STANDS OUT FOR ME .
Steve says DANIEL , HOW ABOUT FOR YOU ?  Daniel says WELL , I GUESS IF I COULD EXAGGERATE IN HEADLINES , I WOULD SAY THAT MY HEADLINE HERE IS THAT THE DOUG FORD GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING AT THIS CRISIS THROUGH SOME VERY THICK ROSE-COLOURED GLASSES .
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THIS FISCAL UPDATE ARE PRETTY OPTIMISTIC .
FOR EXAMPLE , THAT WE WILL END THE YEAR WITH AN ECONOMY THE SAME SIZE AS WE HAD AT THE START OF THIS YEAR , ZERO PERCENT GROWTH .
THAT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE .
JUST THIS MORNING , TD BANK PUT OUT A REPORT WHERE THEY SAID THAT THEIR OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO IS WE END THE YEAR 4 .
percent DOWN .
THAT 'S FOR CANADA AS A WHOLE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GET THE ECONOMY GOING ABOUT MID-YEAR AND WE SEE A REALLY STRONG REBOUND AS BUSINESS STARTS TO OPEN UP AGAIN .
THAT 'S A PRETTY BIG ASSUMPTION .
SO FOR THEM TO ASSUME 0 .
IS DEFINITELY ROSE-COLOURED GLASSES .
THERE ARE SOME OTHER PROJECTIONS IN THERE .
FOR EXAMPLE , THEY EXPECT THAT REVENUE WILL BE ABOUT THE SAME THIS YEAR AS LAST YEAR .
THEY WERE INITIALLY EXPECTING A FAIRLY LARGE BUMP IN REVENUE .
NOW THEY 'RE SAYING THAT 'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN .
INSTEAD REVENUE IS GOING TO COME IN AT ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL AS LAST YEAR .
IS THAT LIKELY ? SO THERE 'S A LOT HERE .
AND ALSO , FOR EXAMPLE , THE 10 BILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED TAXES .
THE SCENARIO THEY 'RE GIVING US IS THAT THEY ARE GOING TO COLLECT THIS MONEY IN SEPTEMBER , HALF BAY THROUGH THE FISCAL YEAR , AND PRESUMABLY AT THE SAME TIME THEY 'RE GOING TO START UP REGULAR TAX COLLECTION AGAIN .
SO THEY 'RE GOING TO HIT BUSINESSES WITH A DOUBLE WHAMMY OF TAXES IN SEPTEMBER ? SIX MONTHS OF BACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO PICK UP FROM THIS CRISIS ? I REALLY DO N'T SEE THAT HAPPENING .
SO I WOULD CALL THIS , YOU KNOW , THE OPTIMISTIC SCENARIO FOR HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT .
Steve says OKAY .
LOTS TO FOLLOW UP THERE FROM BOTH OF YOU .
LET ME , VANMALA , LET ME GET YOU TO FOLLOW UP ON THE HEALTH ISSUE .
YOU DID HEAR ROD PHILLIPS , THE FINANCE MINISTER , SAY TODAY : THIS IS OUR FIRST SHOT OUT THE GATE .
THIS IS N'T OUR LAST WORD ON THE SUBJECT .
AND HE 'S PUT TOGETHER I THINK A NEARLY 5 MILLION DOLLAR CONTINGENCY FUNDS ONCE YOU ADD UP THE THREE DIFFERENT RAINY DAY FUNDS HE HAS GOING HERE , WHICH MEANS HE CERTAINLY EXPECTS TO SPEND MORE MONEY DOWN THE ROAD AND IT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE SPENT ON HEALTH CARE .
SO DOES THAT NOT ENCOURAGE YOU A BIT ?  Vanmala says IT 'S SLIGHTLY ENCOURAGING , I SUPPOSE , GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE CRISIS .
HOWEVER , KEEP IN MIND THAT IT TOOK A PANDEMIC FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO COMMIT TO HEALTH CARE , WHEN WE KNOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS , YOU KNOW , EVEN FOR THE FORD GOVERNMENT , HEALTH CARE SPENDING IN THIS PROVINCE HAS BEEN PRETTY INSUFFICIENT .
I THINK IN A YEAR , THERE WAS A PROJECTION PUT OUT BY THE CANADIAN CENTRE FOR POLICY ALTERNATIVES THAT IT TAKES ABOUT , YOU KNOW , WE 'RE LACKING ABOUT 4 .
BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW IN THE SYSTEM .
SO THE 3 .
BILLION DOLLARS , YOU KNOW , YOU KIND OF NEED TO ADD FOUR TO FIVE BILLION DOLLARS MORE TO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THROUGH THE NEXT SIX TO SEVEN MONTHS .
THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT I THINK WAS SEVERELY LACKING IN THE BUDGET THAT PEOPLE WERE REALLY WAITING FOR WAS ANY KIND OF MENTION OF RENT OR MORTGAGE , YOU KNOW , FOR PEOPLE , DEFERMENT OF PAYMENTS OR FORGIVENESS OF PAYMENTS .
MANY PEOPLE MENTIONED THE APRIL 1ST DEADLINE IS COMING UP AND A LOT OF ONTARIANS CAN NOT AND WILL NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY IF THEY HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING FOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOMETHING THAT WAS LACKING AND I AM CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE PROVINCE IS GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE 'RE GOING TO SEE SOME PRETTY , YOU KNOW , DRAMATIC STATISTICS COME APRIL 1ST WHEN IT COMES TO RENT AND LANDLORD-TENANT DISPUTES AND THINGS LIKE THAT .
Steve says WELL , PARENTHETICALLY I GUESS I SHOULD SAY THAT THE PREMIER HAS ALREADY BEEN ON THE RECORD AS SAYING , NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO GET THROWN OUT OF THEIR PLACE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY CA N'T AFFORD THEIR RENT AND THE PEOPLE WHO DO THAT , THE SHERIFFS WHO WORK FOR THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO , HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO EVICT ANYBODY AS LONG AS THIS IS GOING ON .
SO THAT 'S A FAIR POINT , IS N'T IT ?  Vanmala says IT IS .
BUT , YOU KNOW , IT 'S ALWAYS ABOUT ENFORCEMENT .
IT IS VERY , VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT TENANTS ARE NOT EVICTED .
THE OTHER THING IS , I 'VE BEEN SPEAKING FROM MY ARTICLES TO MANY GIG ECONOMY WORKERS , SELF-EMPLOYED PEOPLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOME OF THEM HAVE MORTGAGES .
SO THEY OWN A PLACE .
THEY HAVE MORTGAGES .
THEY CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY THEIR MORTGAGE .
THEY 'VE HAD REDUCED HOURS , FOR INSTANCE , OF WORK .
NOT TOTALLY .
BUT REDUCED HOURS .
BUT THEY GO TO THE BANK .
AND BECAUSE THE BANKS EVALUATE THEM ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS , THE BANKS SAY YOU 'RE STILL EMPLOYED TECHNICALLY .
YOU 'RE STILL GETTING MONEY IN .
I DO N'T KNOW IF WE CAN DEFER YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENT YET .
SO THERE ARE ALL THESE SITUATIONS THAT ARE VERY NUANCED THAT YOU NEED SOMEONE IN A WAY TO COME IN AND SAY , YOU KNOW , GUYS , FOR THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS , DO N'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR RENT AND MORTGAGE , AND I THINK THAT WILL MAKE CANADIANS , ONTARIANS , A LOT MORE REASSURED RIGHT NOW .
Steve says DANIEL , HELP US UNDERSTAND WHO IS IN FACT HURT MORE OR MAYBE MOST WHEN THE KIND OF ECONOMIC CARNAGE WE 'RE SEEING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW KICKS IN ? IS IT THE SMALLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THINK ALMOST CERTAINLY WE 'RE GOING TO SEE THE SMALLER BUSINESSES TAKE AN IMMEDIATE HIT .
SMALL BUSINESSES TEND TO HAVE LOW MARGINS .
THEY OFTEN .
YOU KNOW , THEY OPERATE HAND TO MOUTH , VERY MUCH LIKE HOUSEHOLDS SOMETIMES .
SO FOR A LOT OF THEM , THERE 'S NOT GOING TO BE A LOT OF CUSHION THERE .
THEY 'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF TIME WHERE THE RESTAURANT CAN SIT EMPTY OR WHERE , YOU KNOW , THE GARAGE CAN DO NO REPAIRS OF CARS AND THAT KIND OF THING .
THAT 'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW .
IN TERMS OF THE LARGE CORPORATIONS , WE 'VE SEEN A LOT OF IMPACTS TO SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES .
WE 'VE SEEN A LOT OF IMPACT ON AIRLINES AND HOTELS , TOURISM AND SO FORTH .
OF COURSE , THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE PRACTICALLY SHUT DOWN RIGHT NOW .
BUT THEY ALSO ARE BETTER AT GETTING GOVERNMENT 'S ATTENTION .
YOU KNOW , WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF BAILOUTS OF LARGE CORPORATIONS AND SUBSIDIES FOR MAJOR EXPORTERS AND THAT KIND OF THING .
SO THEY 'VE GOT .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I WONDER ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSES .
THOSE MIGHT HAVE A HARDER TIME GETTING THE GOVERNMENT 'S ATTENTION IN TERMS OF SUPPORT .
FOR EXAMPLE , AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BROUGHT OUT ITS LATEST UPDATE TO THEIR FISCAL PLANS .
Steve says FAIR ENOUGH .
ALL RIGHT .
SORRY .
FINISH YOUR POINT AND THEN I 'LL FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING .
Daniel says WELL , I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT A LOT OF BUSINESS GROUPS , AFTER THAT UPDATE , CAME OUT .
PUT OUT SOME VERY ALARMED PRESS RELEASES BASICALLY SAYING , YOU KNOW , WHAT ABOUT US ? YOU KNOW , THERE 'S THIS ROBUST 2,000 A MONTH SUBSIDY FOR WORKERS , BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BUSINESSES THEMSELVES ? SO , YEAH , THERE 'S SOME TENSION THERE .
Steve says OKAY .
BUT IF YOU LOOK IN THE ECONOMIC STATEMENT TODAY , YOU DO SEE THAT NOW 90 percent OF THE BUSINESSES IN THE PROVINCE OF ONTARIO ARE GOING TO BE FORGIVEN PAYING THEIR EMPLOYER HEALTH TAX OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND THOSE ARE MOSTLY SMALL BUSINESSES .
YOU SEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USED TO CALL THE WORKERS ' COMPENSATION BOARD .
THOSE PREMIUMS ARE GOING TO BE ON HOLD FOR SIX MONTHS .
SMALL BUSINESS HAS GOT TO LIKE THAT .
YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY YOUR TAXES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS , AGAIN A HOLIDAY ON THAT .
I MEAN , THAT 'S REAL RELIEF , IS IT NOT ?  Daniel says IN A SENSE , YES .
BUT IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS AND YOU 'RE SHUT DOWN AND YOU 'RE NOT MAKING ANY REVENUE , IF YOU 'RE NOT MAKING ANY INCOME , YOU WOULD N'T REALLY HAVE BEEN PAYING ANY TAXES ANYWAY .
YOUR PROBLEM MIGHT BE MORE LIKE JUST SURVIVING , MAKING SURE THAT THE BUSINESS IS STILL THERE WHEN THE LOCKDOWN ENDS .
MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAN PAY YOUR RENT AND THAT YOU 'LL HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT YOU 'LL BE ABLE TO RE-HIRE WHEN THE TIME COMES .
SO I THINK , YOU KNOW , FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF BUSINESSES , THERE 'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THERE AS TO HOW THEY 'RE ACTUALLY , LITERALLY PHYSICALLY GOING TO GET FROM HERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN YOUR TRAVELS AND AMONG THE PEOPLE THAT YOU 'VE SPOKEN TO , DO YOU HAVE ANY CONFIDENCE OR HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE DO YOU HAVE THAT THE DECISION-MAKERS RIGHT NOW TRULY GRASP THE NATURE OF THE ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE THAT WE ARE POTENTIALLY SITTING ON RIGHT NOW ? DO YOU THINK SO ?  Vanmala says YOU KNOW , I DO THINK THEY .
I THINK THEY GRASP IT .
I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN .
DRAW A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT .
I WOULD SAY THAT TODAY THE CRIB PLAN , YOU KNOW , PUT FORTH BY TRUDEAU , ET CETERA , THAT SHOWED CANADIANS IN A WAY , AND I THINK IT WAS A VERY STRONG PLAN THAT BASICALLY SAID , WE 'RE GOING TO PUT 2,000 PER MONTH INTO YOUR POCKET IF YOU HAVE IN ANY WAY BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS .
AND I THINK THAT 'S WHAT CANADIANS WANTED TO HEAR .
THEY JUST WANTED TO HEAR SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF A UBI .
YOU KNOW , SOME SORT OF CASH IN THEIR POCKETS .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I THINK FEDERALLY , YES .
PROVINCIALLY , I THINK , YOU KNOW , SOMETIMES IN MESSAGING , WHEN YOU SAY THINGS LIKE .
TO SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE , " WE 'RE GOING TO DEFER YOUR TAXES FOR SIX MONTHS , " THE WORD " DEFER , " THE FACT THAT THEY ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO PAY AT SOME POINT , THE FACT THAT THAT MAYBE FREES UP SOME LIQUIDITY FOR THEM BUT DOES N'T GIVE THEM ANY EXTRA CASH IN THE WAKE OF THIS , DOES NOT REALLY , YOU KNOW , BOOST CONFIDENCE .
FOR INSTANCE , I WAS TALKING TO AN OWNER OF A TRUCKING COMPANY AND HE SAID A LOT OF HIS BUSINESS .
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HIS BUSINESS HAS BEEN WIPED OUT BECAUSE AUTO FACTORIES HAVE SHUT DOWN , SO THERE 'S LESS STUFF FOR HIM TO MOVE .
AND IN THAT CASE , YOU KNOW , HE 'S JUST SAYING , I DO N'T WANT TO HAVE TO LAY OFF MY DRIVERS AND REHIRE THEM , BECAUSE THAT 'S A COST IN ITSELF .
WHAT I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELP SUBSIDIZE THE WAGES BECAUSE I CA N'T AFFORD TO PAY SOME WAGES TO THESE DRIVERS .
I JUST CA N'T AFFORD THE FULL 10 .
I THINK THAT 'S WHAT A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE CALLING FOR .
BUT TO REALLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SUCCINCTLY , I THINK , YES , I WOULD SAY , YOU KNOW , FOR THE MOST PART , GOVERNMENTS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS .
I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF IT .
I JUST DO N'T KNOW IF THEY GET HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO LAST .
SO I THINK WE 'RE GOING TO SEE , YOU KNOW , MUCH MORE MEASURES ROLL OUT THROUGHOUT THE NEXT YEAR IF WE 'RE IN THIS SITUATION WHERE A VACCINE TAKES MAYBE 12 TO 18 MONTHS TO BE FOUND AND BY GOING THROUGH THESE PERIODS OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND SHUTDOWNS AND REOPENINGS AND THEN SOCIAL DISTANCINGS AGAIN THAT WE 'RE SEEING IN TAIWAN , SINGAPORE , AND SOUTH KOREA .
Steve says I GUESS , DANIEL , ONE OF THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS THAT POLICYMAKERS WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THE ANSWER TO RIGHT NOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THIS AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK , PRESUMABLY WHEN THIS THING PASSES , WHICH HOPEFULLY EVENTUALLY IT WILL , YOU KNOW , THE PUBLIC IS EITHER .
THEY ARE GOING TO BE STORMING BACK TO THE SKYDOME OR THE CANADIAN TIRE CENTRE , OR IF YOU 'RE IN WINDSOR , YOU 'RE GOING ACROSS THE BORDER TO LITTLE CAESAR 'S ARENA AND WATCH THE RED WINGS , THAT PENT-UP DEMAND TO GO TO SPORTING EVENTS , CONCERTS , MOVIES , TO DO ALL THESE THINGS , IS EITHER GOING TO BE THERE OR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HUNKER DOWN BECAUSE THE UNCERTAINTY THAT ALL THIS HAS CREATED OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS IS GOING TO MAKE THEM RETRENCH AND THE ECONOMY WO N'T COME BACK AS QUICKLY AS EVERYBODY HOPES .
DO YOU HAVE ANY GUESS AS TO WHICH WAY IT MIGHT GO ?  Daniel says YEAH , THAT 'S SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF MARKET OBSERVERS , ECONOMISTS , AND OTHER EXPERTS HAVE STARTED FOCUSING ON : WHAT IS THE RECOVERY GOING TO LOOK LIKE ? IT IS REALLY HARD TO SAY .
WE DO N'T HAVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A COMPLETELY UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION .
WHAT MAKES SENSE TO ME IS THAT IT 'S GOING TO DEPEND ON HOW THE LOCKDOWN ENDS , HOW WE GO ABOUT ENDING THESE RESTRICTIONS AND RETURNING TO NORMAL LIFE .
IF IT HAPPENS TOO EARLY , FOR EXAMPLE , YOU KNOW , YOU WERE DISCUSSING EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE BY EASTER WE OUGHT TO HAVE , YOU KNOW , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY UP AND RUNNING AGAIN .
IF IT HAPPENS TOO EARLY AND WE SEE ANOTHER OUTBREAK OR WE SEE ANOTHER SPIKE IN CASES , THE NEXT TIME WE GET THAT LOCKDOWN LIFTED , PEOPLE ARE N'T GOING TO TRUST IT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STAY HOME AND IT 'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO GET THE ECONOMY GOING .
AND BUSINESSES TOO .
BUSINESSES ARE WORRIED ABOUT LIABILITY .
THEY DO N'T WANT TO OPEN THEIR DOORS AND BRING PEOPLE INTO THE OFFICE AND THEN HAVE SOMEBODY GET SICK BECAUSE , YOU KNOW , YOU MIGHT END UP WITH LAWSUITS AND , AT THE VERY LEAST , A BAD PUBLIC IMAGE .
SO EVERYBODY IS GOING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO GO .
OBVIOUSLY AT SOME POINT WE 'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH WITH ENDING THE LOCKDOWN AND RETURNING TO NORMAL LIFE .
WE NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL .
YOU KNOW , AS EXPENSIVE AS THIS LOCKDOWN IS BECOMING FOR GOVERNMENTS , IT 'LL BE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE IF WE ENDED UP IN SOME KIND OF DYSFUNCTIONAL SITUATION WHERE WE ACTUALLY CA N'T START UP THE ECONOMY BECAUSE PEOPLE WO N'T LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND BUSINESSES JUST WO N'T OPEN THEIR DOORS .
Steve says VANMALA , I HAVE ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT HERE .
CAN YOU WEIGH IN ON THE PEOPLE YOU 'RE INTERVIEWING AND WHAT INFORMED SPECULATION AT THIS POINT WOULD SUGGEST HOW WE 'RE GOING TO BOUNCE OUT OF THIS WHEN IT 'S ALL OVER EVENTUALLY ?  Vanmala says YEAH .
I THINK THE ONE FACTOR THAT I HAVE N'T SEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT AND WE KEEP FORGETTING IS THAT CANADIANS ARE SOME OF THE MOST MOST INDEBTED PEOPLE IN THE G-7 .
WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SET TO SKYROCKET WITH A VERY , VERY HIGH COST OF LIVING , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IN UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS , YOU WILL SEE PEOPLE DIP EVEN MORE INTO DEBT , IS WHAT I SUSPECT , AND KEEP IN MIND THEY HAVE TO CONTINUE REPAYING .
CONTINUE PAYING CONSUMER DEBT THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE PILED UP , YOU KNOW , MORTGAGE DEBT , THAT KIND OF STUFF .
SO I THINK THE RECOVERY WILL BE SLOWER THAN WE THINK IT IS BECAUSE THERE WILL JUST BE THIS BACKLOG OF PAYMENTS AND BILLS THAT PEOPLE NEED TO MAKE IF THEY 'RE NOT GETTING A SUFFICIENT INCOME AND WE MIGHT EVEN SEE AN UPTICK IN BORROWING , WHICH , YOU KNOW , IN THE SHORT TERM MIGHT BE OKAY BECAUSE INTEREST RATES ARE LOW , BUT IN THE LONG TERM , THE LAST THING THIS ECONOMY NEEDS IS DEBT BALLOONING OUT OF CONTROL , YOU KNOW , BECAUSE OF THIS CRISIS .
Steve says WELL , THE ANSWER TO EVERYTHING , OF COURSE , THESE DAYS IS : WE SHALL SEE .
VANMALA SUBRAMANIAM AND DANIEL TENCER , GOOD OF BOTH OF YOU TO JOIN US ON TVO TONIGHT AND HELP US OUT WITH THIS .
THANKS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
