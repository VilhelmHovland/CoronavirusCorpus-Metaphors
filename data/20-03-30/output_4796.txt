Border , the Bulls and the end of a Shield drought  Twenty-five years after Queensland broke through for their maiden Sheffield Shield title , the legendary Allan Border reflects  AAP  29 March 2020 , 12:01 PM AEST  Allan Border had booked a holiday to the United States just a few days after Queensland broke through for their first Sheffield Shield title .
So the Bulls and Australian batting great missed the extensive state-wide ticker tape celebrations in March 1995 after the Bulls ended a 68-year drought and exorcised the demons of five second-place finishes inside seven seasons in the 1980s .
But those few days were still long enough for Border to appreciate that Queensland cricket fans cherished the win as much as they did .
Twenty-five years on from their dominant win over South Australia , he remembers it well , proud but disappointed a quiet Saturday night beer at home will have to suffice after the COVID-19 pandemic spoiled the Bulls ' celebration plans .
" It was a great moment for Queensland ; we were up against it , copping plenty after being on the wrong end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen away , " Border told AAP .
" It was pretty special times and we celebrated .
" The public outpouring was just phenomenal really ; I missed a lot of it because we pre-booked a trip to the States , that 's how confident I was .
" So I missed the trip up north , but was around long enough to capture the vibe .
"  Border had retired from international cricket the year before , allowing him a rare chance to focus solely on a Shield season .
" We had n't won it , so it was the reason I played on and a good way to wean myself off the game , to go back and have a proper crack at the Shield , " he said .
" It does n't feel like 25 years ; you see some footage and the memories come back so vividly straight away .
"  This season 's Queensland Cricket dinner , set to focus on the side 's watershed 1995 moment , has been cancelled because of the coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still go ahead later this year .
" We 've missed a chance to celebrate the 25 years , so maybe will have to wait until 30 now , " he said .
" I 'm sure a few texts will be sent around today , but I had almost forgotten about it because everything has shut down .
" The coronavirus news is just bombarding us and it 's important , but it will be nice to have a beer for a different reason tonight .
