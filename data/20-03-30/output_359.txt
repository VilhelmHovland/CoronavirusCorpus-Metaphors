Gavin Newsom ordered all Californians on Thursday to stay home and leave only for essential trips , escalating efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus , which state officials estimate could infect more than half the population if drastic steps are not taken .
The order is similar to the shelter-in-place rules that Bay Area residents have been living under since Monday , allowing people to visit the grocery store , seek medical care , walk outside and exercise if they maintain social distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state deemed nonessential to close their doors temporarily .
The order , the most far-reaching in the nation , took effect Thursday evening .
Newsom said he did not know how long it will last , but that compliance is needed to " bend the curve " on the outbreak .
" It 's not my preferred choice .
I know it 's not yours .
But it 's a necessary one , " he said during an evening news conference .
" This is not a permanent state .
This is a moment in time .
"  Although more than 23 million Californians are already living under stay-at-home orders in their cities and counties , Newsom said the " interdependence " of all communities in the vast state required tougher action .
" At the end of the day , we 're one body , " he said .
Newsom said he will rely for now on social pressure , rather than law enforcement , to maintain the order .
The Newsom administration is projecting that , without strong measures to thwart the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected with the coronavirus in eight weeks .
In a letter to President Trump on Wednesday requesting that a U .
Navy hospital ship be ordered to the Port of Los Angeles through Sept .
1 to care for a potential overload of patients , Newsom said California has been " significantly impacted by the rapid increase in COVID-19 cases .
"  " In some parts of our state , our case rate is doubling every four days , " he wrote .
In his news conference , Newsom said that " the numbers we put out today assume that we 're just along for the ride .
We 're not .
We want to manipulate those numbers down .
That 's what this order is all about .
"  Infectious disease experts said Thursday that the projected toll -- which would add up to roughly 22 million people -- is a worst-case scenario and , though possible , unlikely to actually become reality .
The projection was especially alarming given that there were slightly more than 1,000 confirmed cases in California as of Thursday night .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of people infected is presumably much larger , though no one knows by how much .
All coronavirus projections -- including , presumably , the one Newsom referred to -- are based on incomplete and even faulty data , said Dr .
John Swartzberg , a UC Berkeley infectious disease expert .
Newsom 's projection may come from a decent disease model , Swartzberg said , " but it 's based upon not a very strong foundation of data .
"  Newsom said Thursday that his administration is moving aggressively to prevent a strain on the health care system and a potential shortage of 20,000 beds for patients .
He announced that Seton Medical Center in Daly City will soon become one of the locations for treating coronavirus patients , and that the state is also working to lease motel rooms and dormitories at University of California and California State University campuses for additional space .
" Based upon our trendlines , " he said , " we felt it was appropriate to raise the ante .
"  The state will cover the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 beds , including critical care and intensive care beds , said Dr .
Robert Perez , who oversees the physicians at the hospital .
Seton has been operating with a number of empty beds recently as its owner , Verity Health System , has filed for bankruptcy protection .
The governor said he would rather be criticized for acting too aggressively than not going far enough .
" We will look back at these kinds of decisions as pivotal decisions , " he said .
