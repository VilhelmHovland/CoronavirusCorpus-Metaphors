Normally at this time of year , Lavigne 's Canvas would be ramping up to produce boat covers , trailer covers and other materials for summer .
But since Thursday , the small family business in North Bay has been manufacturing masks and face shields to help battle the coronavirus .
" We started Thursday to come up with masks and shields , " Pat Lavigne Sr .
, patriarch of the business , said Monday as he made masks , his son , Pat Jr .
, worked on face shields and another son , Matt , cut material for the masks .
Soon , he says , they will start getting gowns into production , although that , and production of other personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , hinges on the supply of materials .
Lavigne also hopes that , with the PPE demand , he will be able to take on experienced seamstresses , material cutters and others to help the company evolve to help with the crisis .
" We bought up everything we could , " Lavigne says , but it will probably be a few more days before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
makes a face mask , Monday , at Lavigne Canvas in North Bay .
The company which normally manufactures boat covers , trailer covers and awnings has stepped in to manufacture personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 emergency .
Wilson/The Nugget  The entire family was in the Booth Road shop over the weekend to help put things together , while the company website has been modified to help those customers needing PPE to order them online .
" All four sewing machines were going , " Pat Jr .
says .
" We just ca n't cover the number of calls that are coming in , " Pat Sr .
says .
They have n't made any calls to potential customers themselves , Pat Jr .
says .
" They 've been contacting us .
We 've been too busy to make any calls .
"  Meanwhile , suppliers " are flooded with calls " for more material .
Lavigne 's Canvas has been getting tips from other manufacturers from as far away as Alaska for what is needed to produce the masks .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make about 100 masks .
But since Thursday , " we 've had close to 10,000 orders .
"  Most are from local organizations and institutions , but a number of businesses and personal support workers also have put in requests .
Matt Lavigne cuts material to be used in the manufacture of face masks , Monday , at Lavigne Canvas in North Bay .
Wilson/The Nugget  Already , some of the approximately 350 masks have been shipped out as far afield as Belleville , Bancroft , Cobalt and Temiskaming Shores .
" That 's the power of the web , " Pat Sr .
says .
" It 's a slow process , " to go from producing prototypes to getting things made .
They 're all handmade .
" It 's not like China , " Pat Jr .
says .
" We do n't have all those robotics .
"  Lavigne 's Canvas is considering the purchase of an ultrasonic welder to help with manufacturing , but the price tag for the five-year-old business is a bit steep , and Pat Sr .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in normal operations .
" But from all the feedback we 've been seeing , this is going to last a long time , " he says .
" For years , we 've watched people in China wearing face masks in everyday life , " and he wonders if that is what 's in store for North America , as well .
And while they have the time down to about three minutes to manufacture one mask , again , everything hinges on the supply chain .
" What we need now is workers and supplies , " Pat Sr .
says .
The masks are made with a four-layer , non-woven fabric that will resist droplets but is breathable .
The face shields are clear plastic with an elastic headband .
The elastic material is something else that suppliers are having a hard time getting to manufacturers .
Pat Sr .
says the company was easily able to step up to retool and rejig its schedule to help out .
That means boat and trailer covers have been put aside for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
