Last week , after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the country would enter a 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus , more than 20 social justice organisations called for a moratorium on all evictions throughout the country .
An open letter , penned by a number of social justice movements and organisations , addressed to the president 's National Command Council , was sent two weekends ago .
In a directive addressed to all the judges of the country from Judge President John Hlophe , he instructed judges to suspend eviction applications - including the execution against residential immovable property .
This suspension is until April 17 .
Law Centre Ndifuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidency , the National Command Council and the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services for heeding our call and having the courage to urgently issue this nation-wide suspension of evictions , as well as sales in executions .
" We remain deeply concerned that , despite this moratorium , there may be attempts by some unscrupulous landlords or property owners to try to evict people during the lockdown .
Any attempts to evict , or otherwise remove , people from where they live at this time are manifestly unjust and illegal .
Yet , illegal evictions are widespread and many poor and working-class communities across the country are precarious during the lockdown period , with occupiers , informal settlement residents , farmworkers and farm dwellers , and woman and children particularly at risk , " said Shandu .
Some of the organisations that have supported this call include the Socio-Economic Rights Institute of South Africa , Equal Education , Section 27 and the Stellenbosch Backyarders Forum .
Good Party secretary-general Brett Herron said : " We are in extraordinary times , which require us to implement extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to mitigate against the economic fallout .
Banks are already starting to announce loan repayment holidays for small businesses and our government had a small business support plan in the works .
" These drastic measures confirm that we are facing the crisis of our lifetime .
"  Herron said the country can not ignore those who are vulnerable to homelessness , which could be a direct consequence of the virus and its devastation of economic activity .
The DA 's Emma Powell , spokesperson on human settlements , water and sanitation , said : " Now is the time for civil society and the private and public sector to come together to do everything possible to minimise the economic impact of the Covid-19 virus on South Africans .
