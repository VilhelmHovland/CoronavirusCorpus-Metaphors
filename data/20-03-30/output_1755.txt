A glass bubble that starts to crack Monday , March 30th , 2020 at , Opinion  Malaysia is on the verge of a recession that the future looks worse than the hypocentre of a nuclear blast  Pic by RAZAK GHAZALI  THE celebration of the RM250 billion stimulus package has all but come to just backdoor whispers .
Many applauded the government 's move , especially the cash handouts and wide-ranging distributions .
Others see the package as total anathema to the principle of saving enterprises from total annihilation .
While supporters and detractors will continue to throw rocks at each other for some time to come , one thing for sure , " Makcik Kiah " has entered the country 's hall of fame .
But what is next for Malaysia ? The country , for most part of its history , has been blessed and fortunate .
It has been largely free of wars and conflicts .
There were battles and fights like most nations .
But ours could only be traced back to the Portuguese occupation of Melaka , Dutch-Portuguese War and The Brothers War in Pahang and other smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two Allied ships of Penang by a German cruiser .
Our fathers tell us of the sufferings during World War II , the Japanese occupation , the deaths and killings and cruelty .
Subsequently , the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960 , Sarawak Communist Insurgency and the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation had Malaysians on edge .
But there were no massive deaths and destruction .
China for one had its first recorded war dating back to the 26th century BC .
China 's history tells of the thousands of battles , wars and conflicts between emperors , dynasties , rebellions and civil wars , battles against the Japanese , Russia and other countries .
Hundreds of millions fought these battles and millions died .
Compared to China , Malaysia is whiter than Switzerland .
Malaysia is also free of major disasters .
It does not sit on the Pacific Plate , experience rumbling earthquakes , erupting volcanoes , flowing hot lava , deadly gasses and massive earth shifts .
Natural disasters have been few and far between .
The 2004 Boxing Day tsunami was the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the selected lockdown , the fear of infections and spread of the deadly Covid-19 virus have forced 32 million people to stay home .
It is unprecedented in the country 's history .
Malaysians for the longest time have been living in a bubble of comfort , free of catastrophes and disasters , wars and battles and deaths , to a level that the people are more vulnerable than others .
Malaysia never had to rebuild itself from the ruins of war or destruction like Hiroshima or Europe after the Germans were defeated in 1945 or Korea after its civil wars .
Malaysia is , to a larger extent , a pampered society , lavished with subsidies , social protections and safety nets .
Goodies that make even the strong weak , and Hercules and giants vulnerable .
But the country is on the verge of a recession .
Millions of jobs are at stake .
Depending on how fast the world can cut the chain of the infection and bring the cure to billions of people before the next viral eruption , the future looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be no clouds on the horizon .
If and when the country comes out of this calamity , many will realise how vulnerable the country and people are .
We are , for most times , our own Achilles heel , and change we must or we will never survive the next acid test .
