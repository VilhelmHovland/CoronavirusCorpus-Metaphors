( 5 ) comments  Sad to hear what is going on all across the nation .
It 's too bad our country has sporadic testing with less than a good test sensitivity .
Is Douglas County running the 80% test , does anyone know ? That 's still a 20% error rate , and only for those showing symptoms .
The lack of respirators and gear for medical people is really dangerous for all of us .
And what about half the carriers are shedding the virus but do n't show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to stay home .
NRToday published several articles promoting Douglas County 's drive through testing on March 17 and March 27 .
Our County Commissioners proclaimed Douglas County to be leaders in Oregon .
On our March 27 phone call , Commissioner Boice told me " some " of the tests were back from the drive-through testing .
When I asked him how many , he repeated " some .
" Today we find Commissioner Boice 's claim to be false .
The following information was released today :  " Results are not back for either clinic , initially it was hoped we would have them back in 2-4 days , but now it looks like it will be closer to a week for results .
We will announce positives and negative tests as soon as we have them .
"  It 's been 13 days since the first people were tested and our County still does n't have the test results for those people .
Even if those people test negative , how do we know they have n't caught the virus since they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what steps have been taken to quarantine those people while awaiting their results ? Have they been allowed to mingle in the community and possibly infect others ?  I do give kudos to DPHN for correcting their previous statement that test results occur in 2 -- 4 days .
I know it 's hard to publish bad news .
I do n't like that it takes weeks to get test results back .
But I prefer to hear the truth rather than what somebody thinks I want to hear .
To Commissioner Boice , your credibility is horrible .
We expect our leaders to be honest and credible .
You are neither .
Oregon had 36 cases before they experienced their first death .
The U .
had 60 cases before they experienced their first death .
Douglas County is less than a week away from their first death and it is expected to accelerate soon after .
Prepare and isolate yourself .
If our hospitals need additional PPE , now is the time to get it .
Relying on Eugene hospitals like Douglas County Public Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Lane County has already experienced their first coronavirus death and they only have 1 .
licensed hospital beds per 1000 people compared to 1 .
in Douglas County .
" DPHN is tracking the test results from Douglas County residents and will update the chart at noon each day .
"  This is the second time NRToday has published this statement .
I was able to access the website yesterday and can still access the cache , but every time I try to access the Douglas County Public Health Network site today I get the following error message :  " **32;144;TOOLONG server IP address could not be found .
