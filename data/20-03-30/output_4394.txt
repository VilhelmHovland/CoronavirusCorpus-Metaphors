Germany 's COVID-19 Testing Method Could See Thousands Return To Work  It 's fair to say some countries have handled the COVID-19 outbreak much better than others .
While the likes of the UK and USA have had inconsistent approaches to dealing with the virus , nations such as Germany and South Korea have experienced more success in lessening its impact .
Germany have often been pointed to as the European leaders , especially when it comes to areas such as testing .
One thing that immediately stands out is the country has the lowest death rate of all majorly affected nations , with the current figure standing at around 0 .
This is largely down to the amount of tests administered in the country .
By making testing more accessible , they have diagnosed a larger amount of cases .
By also immediately testing close contacts of those who are diagnosed , they can better enforce other measures such as isolations and early treatment .
While they have been pioneers in this part of the pandemic , they now look set to blaze a trail in the first step towards recovery .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people for the presence of potential antibodies to coronavirus .
Those with antibodies present would have already successfully fought off the disease , and would be highly unlikely to be at risk of contracting it .
Thus , they will be given ' immunity certificates ' and allowed to return to work if possible .
Germany has got testing spot on .
They plan to test hundreds of thousands for the presence of the antibodies and issue ' Immunity Certificates ' to those who test positive-allowing their work to be exempt from the lockdown .
