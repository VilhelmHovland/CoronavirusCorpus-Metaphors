Wolverine has one of the most iconic looks in comics even without his mask on , but the character would n't be seen outside of his trademark costume until two years after he made his debut .
Sporting the thickest of sideburns and jet-black pointed hair , Logan 's face and hairstyle are recognizable even in silhouette .
So what if the character had gone in a completely different direction ? Would he have become as popular as he is now if he looked .
more like a regular guy ? Marvel Editor Tom Brevoort shared a version of unmasked Wolverine created by legendary artist John Byrne that is quite different to say the least .
" Before Dave Cockrum has Wolverine take off his mask in Uncanny X-Men #98 , " Brevoort wrote .
" John Byrne had done and pitched this design for what he looked like under there .
What might have been .
"  The caption on the image , which looks Clint Eastwood in his prime and features precisely zero sideburns and what looks like blond hair , reads : " In case The Wolverine should ever decide to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cockrum has Wolverine take off his mask in Uncanny X-Men #98 , John Byrne had done and pitched this design for what he looked like under there .
What might have been .
**26;239;TOOLONG  On the forum for his official website , Byrne wrote about the alternate design back in 2012 when asked by a fan about the image saying : " Ah , yes -- that was my original suggestion for Wolverine 's face .
I sent that to Chris and he responded ' You blew it ! Dave has already designed Wolvie 's face .
' Not sure how that constituted me " blowing it " , but that seemed to be Chris ' favorite phrase at the time .
( When he asked me to draw his mother into an issue of MARVEL TEAM-UP , but sent no reference , I did the best I could based on having met her once before , and his response was " You blew it ! " ) .
"  Byrne continued that this design he created for Wolverine would go on to be used as the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modifications ( like sideburns ) .
The artist also had a note about Dave Cockrum 's design for Wolverine which has a basis in a different comic from Marvel 's Distinguished Competition , writing : " Dave 's design was , of course , based on Timberwolf , who he 'd been drawing for a while in the Legion of Superheroes .
