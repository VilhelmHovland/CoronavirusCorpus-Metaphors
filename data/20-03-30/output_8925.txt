New York Gov .
Andrew Cuomo is threatening to sue Rhode Island for its effort to stop cars with New York license plates to be sure that New Yorkers quarantine for two weeks .
This includes police going door-to-door .
Apparently , the image of some guy with a bell crying " bring out your New Yorkers " in the streets is not appealing to Cuomo .
Yet , this could present a knotty legal issue .
The Supreme Court has long recognized a right to travel and movement as a core constitutional right under the Privileges and Immunities Clause .
In 1869 , the Supreme Court declared in Paul v .
Virginia that citizens have the " right of free ingress into other States , and egress from them .
"  Rhode Island Gov .
Gina Raimondo announced the plan last week to try to prevent the spread of the virus from the hot zone of the Empire State .
Cuomo is irate and declared " there 's a point of absurdity , and I think what Rhode Island did is at that point of absurdity .
"  Raimondo is not backing down : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're coming to Rhode Island from New York you are ordered into quarantine .
The reason for that is because more than half of the cases of coronavirus in America are in New York .
"  However , she recently expanded the policy to include all out of state cars .
This may be in anticipation of such a lawsuit to show that she is not singling out citizens of one state for greater scrutiny .
Of course saying that you will also stop an occasional car from Arkansas may not be much solace for Cuomo or his fellow New Yorkers .
The fact that this is a monitoring regulation for public health in a pandemic may give Rhode Island an upper hand .
Stopping travel to the state would create serious constitutional questions on the restriction of the right to travel as well as interstate commerce issues .
However , in a pandemic , courts tend to be deference -- at least in the short term -- toward state efforts to control the spread of a deadly virus .
If was logical to shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical to shut down entry to anyone coming from New York .
After all , Covid-19 does n't care about your constitutional rights .
As for the Governor of RI , she is enforcing a quarantine .
If martial law needs to be declared , then do it so that this plague can go away and we can all be free .
Any travel restrictions of citizens needs to be short .
The county of Los Angeles has declared a quarantine under penalty of fine or imprisonment .
So , you can steal up to $950 without repercussion , but if you go to a relative 's house , you risk imprisionment .
in a jail that the state has already been emptying because it 's unfair to expose inmates to the virus .
They waited until Covid-19 was already detected in the prisons , and then once all the inmates were exposed , they released them into the general population to do a really good job of robbing and infecting them .
I live in a rural area .
We do n't have the infrastructure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internet to all work from home or have our children learn online .
That 's the downside .
But we 've never had the votes to get taken care of the way the urban areas do , which is why they hog all the resources we are forced to pay in to .
We pay property taxes , plus extra taxes that target us rural folk .
But when the city people dump their trash on our dirt roads , the city wo n't clean it up because dirt roads are private and no county maintained .
On the other hand , we have room to walk around and sunshine out here .
Environmentalists want to force us into cities and mass transit .
In CA , " Road Diets " are an effort to force people , against their will , to use mass transit , which was never designed for the sprawl of CA .
I 've said many times that I 'd never want to on the subway during flu season .
I think this pandemic takes it up to a whole new level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
That 's been true throughout human history .
Environmentalists wanted us all to get rid of our garage refrigerators .
There have been programs in CA to try to get people to discard them as energy hogs .
People need them now to store food .
The elites sneer upon the rural folk with regularity .
But I can go outside on my acres of land , play catch with my kids , ride my horses , and I 've got eggs to eat , while the city folk either break quarantine , or stay trapped in tiny apartments .
The only thing I 'm missing is a Victory Garden , and it might come down to war with the ground squirrels so I can get it .
We are all stuck in quarantine as long as there are those who refuse to follow the rules .
Plus , grocery stores have taken the exact opposite approach that they should have .
Instead of transitioning to delivery only , people crowd into long lines to get basic necessities .
That virtually guarantees the spread of Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you go out and then get into a crowd at the grocery store , you 've wasted your time .
And everyone else 's .
Plus , this assures that there will be sick people in the grocery store , contaminating the food .
And once the grocery store employees get sick , it has to close , and no more food source in that area .
Similarly , the more health care workers get sick , the more there is a shortage when the need is greatest .
Karen , the world 's 7+ billion humans ca n't all live on acreage in the country , or if they do , your gas will be much more costly .
Same goes for our 330 million in America .
I understand your joy in your relatively unique conditions -- I have similar ones -- and hope you continue to enjoy them , but your choice is not an ethical one as you pretend and can not be emulated by all .
No one should be hoarding food at this point , and it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones .
I live in upstate New York .
We have seen several bizarre actions taken by our governor .
One example is the absurd bail reform law which allows individuals to walk away with an appearance ticket rather than having to post bail .
Last week individuals who had been incarcerated in the county jail were ordered to be moved to a suburban hotel .
Governor Cuomo has had lots of photo ops recently as the state grapples with COVID-19 .
Some of us think that he might be angling to replace Joe Biden on the Democrats ticket .
If you can shut down life activities within a state ( retail , schools both private and public , church , personal gatherings , etc ) then you can certainly close down your borders with another state .
I 'm not saying I agree with either one -- but those who support one , ca n't **37;932;TOOLONG not support the other .
Either you prefer a police state to handle the crisis or you do n't .
In Hubei and contiguous province they erected blockades to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here about this a month ago .
It will come here too .
Governors have police powers and courts will stay out of their way  The closing of Interstate highways is perhaps a violation of federal dictates , but governors can and will do what they deem necessary .
It 's how this cookie crumbles  it it gets bad enough you will see private citizens erect their own checkpoints .
sawhorses , shotguns , and " community watch " teams .
perhaps not until the firing starts but that seems to be as much a possibility as ever  I live on an island off the coast of Rhode Island .
All visitors now are monitored by cops as they arrive on the ferry .
Which is unfair in itself because there 's a small airport and i do n't think the surveillance there is anywhere near as strict .
On the one hand , it 's excessive .
On the other , there 's just a small medical center with no hospital bed and only one doctor in the ' off season ' .
Things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple cops .
A Covid 19 outbreak would be a serious threat with such small infrastructure .
Ultimately , Cuomo is right .
, the issue is n't where you 're from , it 's crowd density .
The tendency to shift into ' bring out your dead ' territory is indeed dangerous .
But , as we 'll see when Covid 19 shifts more into rural territory nationally , with small police forces and small hospitals much more susceptible to overwhelm than big metropolitan areas , we 'll all see up close how Covid 19 is going to test the edges there just as in NYC right now .
