In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey and what made him venture into the arena of margarine sculptures  YSW : When did develop an interest in cooking ?  DJ : I used to watch my mother , and my grandmother cook as a child .
My grandmother used to cook some Maharashtrian dishes , which were delicious .
My mother , on the other hand , was a home science lecturer and she used to teach her students how to make a variety of dishes .
I used to watch her and soon I learnt to make those dishes at home .
That was when I developed an interest in cooking .
My father always supported us ( my brother and I ) in our career choices , and told us to follow our hearts .
Today , my elder brother Dr .
Priyadarshan Jategaonkar is a well know gastro-surgeon at Sevagram Hospital , Wardha , and I ended up being a chef .
YSW : How did you learn the art of carving and food sculpture ?  DJ : I did not know that I had an aptitude for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel Management .
My teachers were very supportive , especially my production professor , Manoharan who used to take up many outdoor catering assignments .
I used to carve few basic garnishes during our practice sessions .
I asked him , whether I could make a few sculptures for one of his outdoor catering events .
He agreed and took me along with him for his next event .
Ever since then my friend Prakash Kadam and I started carving sculptures together for wedding functions .
My father ( Shri Anand Vinayak Jategaonkar ) was a writer and artist .
He has written many award-winning books in Marathi .
His painting and drawings were always an inspiration for me .
I guess I have inherited my artistic flair from him .
YSW : What are some of your personal favourite dishes you like to prepare for your customers ?  DJ : I like to experiment with food , and create fusion recipes .
To create a fusion , a balance of flavours and right ingredients is the key .
You learn these techniques only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rich food heritage and culture .
We also have so many varieties of regional Indian flavours .
Some of my favourite dishes which I like to serve to my guests are Mediterranean Mezze , Burmese Khou Suey , Rajasthani specialities like Dal Bati , Churma , Maharashtrian specialities like Puran Poli , Sambarwadi and Solkhadi , and Greek specialities like Spanakopita .
YSW : How did you feel when you made it to the Guinness Book of World Records for your margarine sculptures ?  DJ : I was working on this project for almost 4 years .
Before the Guinness project , I travelled to Germany to participate in the IKA culinary Olympics .
I got a silver medal there for my Margarine sculpture called ' Oh Cinderella ' .
It was the first silver for India .
While attempting for Guinness contest , I wanted to create something , which would portray Indian culture and philosophy .
When I was working on this project my father fell ill and passed away .
During his illness I had told him and promised him that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that effort .
The sculpture was done in 10 days at the Domestic Airport , Mumbai .
I had decided to do the Shiva Trimurti .
While we were creating the sculpture , it collapsed three times due to our techniques and due to the temperature , despite the fact that we were working in air-conditioned surroundings .
Finally , I got it right the fourth time around .
Due to some technical issue , the GWR team did not approve of my sculpture initially .
The whole sculpture had to be weighed once sculpture was done .
We had to create the sculpture again and I had to send the video evidence to the Guinness team .
By then , I had lost all hope .
But suddenly , one evening , I received an e-mail stating that my sculpture had been recognised and approved by GWR and I became a Guinness world record holder ' .
YSW : Who are some of your culinary heroes ?  DJ : My culinary inspiration will always be my mother , I still keep on learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones who inspired me be to be a chef .
I admire and am always inspired by local chefs who know their craft well .
YSW : What are some special cooking tips you have learned in your journey ?  DJ : I believe , more than the recipe , instinct and experience play a larger role in cooking .
Also , while cooking , you need to be fearless and be ready to accept failure .
You keep on learning new things only if you are ready to experiment and go out of your comfort zone .
YSW : What is your advice for other aspiring chefs and people wishing to get into the food sculpting space ?  If it is your dream , it 's your responsibility to fulfill it .
Do not complain about the situation or support from family/colleagues etc .
Find a way to achieve your goals .
You have to work hard , and most importantly believe in your ideas .
Treat failures as learnings and move on .
Do not give up .
As someone once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauty of their dreams '  An intricate watermelon-based fruit sculpture .
YSW : What do you enjoy doing on the weekends when you are not cooking ?  DJ : I like to spend time with my daughter Mira .
I love nature and I like to travel too .
I also love visiting ancient caves and studying sculptures , architectural structures and forts .
