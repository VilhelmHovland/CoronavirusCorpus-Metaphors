Wanaparthy : Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao 's call to the village administration to use the services of youth to volunteer to prevent people from coming on to the roads seems to have percolated to the masses in some villages , as youth could be seen forming groups , announcing on loudspeakers , managing traffic , asking motorists to use masks and asking people to leave the roads to go home and stay indoors .
On Monday , the Village Revenue Assistant of Khilla Ghanpur mandal could be seen along with some local youth , standing near the Gandhi Chowk of the mandal headquarters , with a public address system , making announcements .
The youth were asking the auto drivers not to stop near the chowrastha and were giving directions to pedestrians to cover their faces with masks .
In almost every village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff of village administration could be seen standing on the roads , ensuring people did n't come out of their houses .
Until 10 am , markets were being allowed to operate , but after that , these volunteers have been playing a key role in vacating people , vegetable and fruit vendors from the roads .
However , for villages which are on the main roads located close to mandal headquarters , essential supplies like vegetables have been coming in .
But in remote villages there has been a shortage of these perishables and going to the nearest market has n't been an easy task , as people were being prevented from going around in groups .
For example , in Mohammed Hussainpally village of Moosapet mandal of Mahabubnagar district , vegetable vendors have n't been coming to sell produce in the village .
The weekly village market has been shut-down and the people have been facing severe shortage of vegetables .
The ASHA workers and Anganwadi workers have themselves taken initiative to arrange for some persons to come and sell vegetables at their village , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been that despite Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao 's directions to administration to get thorny barricades removed from roads connecting the villages , it has n't been done at many places .
Mobile vegetable markets were being implemented in Mahabunagar municipality , but in remote villages there is a dire need for mobile markets to reach the people .
In almost every Lambada hamlet inhabited by STs in Ghanpur mandal , people have been eagerly waiting for public distribution items like rice and daal to reach them .
Even NREGS works have n't started in a full-fledged manner across the Palamuru region yet .
In very few villages NREGS works were being implemented .
In those areas where Yasangi harvest time was up , farm labourers would not show immediate interest in NREGS works , as they would all be occupied with farm work .
But in many areas where irrigation has n't reached yet , the only way for people to survive is getting PDS benefits and NREGS works as soon as possible .
