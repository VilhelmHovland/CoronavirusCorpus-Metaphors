York 's black community suffered during the Spanish flu outbreak , WWI  Jim McClure Published 10:17 a .
ET March 30 , 2020  CLOSE  People spread out around the flagpole at St .
John 's Blymire 's United Church Of Christ on Wednesday morning and prayed for the community , nurses and doctors , government leaders and many others during the turmoil from the coronavirus pandemic .
York Daily Record  Brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to celebrate .
Closures of businesses , bars , churches and other gatherings -- social distancing practices of its day -- were relaxed because it appeared the deadly Spanish flu 's tide was receding .
An estimated 100,000 people turned out for a victory parade on Nov .
16 , 1918 , five days after the war 's end .
The parade column stretched 7 .
miles .
The 20,000 people in the parade , marching eight-across along Market Street , and the thousands of shoulder-to-shoulder spectators made it the biggest public celebration in York County history .
George A .
Wood died in fighting in World War I .

Smith )  The four-hour parade was designed to honor those who served and died in the Great War .
But it was also a moment to celebrate the home front efforts -- perseverance in time of war and the deadly Spanish flu that accompanied it .
This should have been a time -- of all times -- that the community would come together .
But the official response to the Spanish flu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps this moment foreshadows what 's ahead for America when COVID-19 appears to run its course .
Just after the parade , city officials said the flu was on the wane .
And then they got this from The York Gazette and Daily : " While the epidemic seems to have worn itself out in most of the towns in the county , in others it just seems to be starting .
"  Still , city and public health leaders made plans to disband its tent hospital at York Fairgrounds and move patients to the children 's isolation ward of West College Avenue 's York Hospital .
Yet four days after the parade , 67 new flu cases were reported .
The next day , officials learned of 89 new cases .
And a month later , 134 new cases of influenza were reported .
Further , this moment , a time when celebration and grief blended into a blur , was marked by a controversy over whether black parade participants would be segregated into their own division or integrated with their counterpart white groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the resting place of many victims of the World War I-era Spanish flu and those who died in uniform in that war .
( Photo : YDR file )  A Spanish flu case study  The black community 's fight with the flu gives us insight into its grief and represents how deeply the entire York County community was suffering from this deadly and disabling disease .
The Union Stone Quarry in York County 's New Holland -- today 's Saginaw in East Manchester Township -- brought workers who needed jobs together .
But they labored and lived too close in those days of the Spanish flu .
Some of those workers were blacks , probably from the South .
Near a sister quarry across the Susquehanna River , the company town of Billmeyer was erected .
Historian and blogger Stephen H .
Smith surfaced a history of Conoy Township , home of Billmeyer and its quarry .
World War I ended America 's supply of magnesite , a mineral used in the steel and chemical industry .
The Billmeyer quarry produced a substitute : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for track ballast , the bed upon which railroad ties are laid .
Faced with a wartime labor shortage , J .
Baker , owner of the Billmeyer and Saginaw quarries , looked for options to quarry the valuable wartime mineral .
" Foreign help from southern Europe and Negro laborers from the South arrived in quantity , " the Conoy history states .
" During the peak over seven hundred men were employed at Billmeyer .
"  It was likely that these practices would extend across the Susquehanna to the smaller New Holland quarry .
The York Dispatch reported on Nov .
13 , three days before the massive parade , that the flu had broken out among New Holland quarrymen .
One worker , Dewitt Austin , had died a week earlier and six more had just arrived at the tent hospital .
" Every effort is being made to stay the progress of the disease among the New Holland quarrymen , " the newspaper reported .
Samantha Dorm , spokesman for the Friends of Lebanon Cemetery research team , found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other black quarrymen buried in the cemetery .
Or maybe one boy and two men .
The boy was Austin 's 13-year-old son , Brittain , who was laid to rest with his father in Lebanon , North York 's historically black burial ground .
The Rev .
Carroll officiated at both services .
Robert Tascoe and Nathan Pierson were the other quarry workers who succumbed to the flu .
They were also was buried in Lebanon Cemetery .
That fall , at least 16 other members of York 's black community died from pneumonia , associated with the flu , and were buried in Lebanon Cemetery .
Three members of one family , the Twymans of 20 W .
Baptist Ave .
, were admitted to the tent hospital on Nov .
Jeannette , the 36-year-old mother , died , as did her 2-year-old daughter , Evelyn , and 1-year-old son , Kenneth .
William , her husband and another young child were listed as survivors .
In another family , Harriet Briscoe , 66 , died from pneumonia as did daughter Mary Smallwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia at that time .
The Lebanon Cemetery research team looked at the deaths and noted two trends :  Funerals were held in the homes of the deceased , places that could have housed unsanitary sickbeds .
Within days , other family members , neighbors and church member were admitted to the hospital and many died .
Further , the deaths often were clustered in neighborhoods , for example , the 200 block of South Newberry Street .
The deaths came so close together that their funeral arrangements were hurried .
" ( M ) any do not have markers , which is not surprising when whole households died over a few days/weeks , " Dorm wrote on the Friends of Lebanon Facebook page .
In an interview , Dorm noted that the 20 deaths involved just those from the African American community who died in the fall of 1918 and early 1919 and were buried in Lebanon .
Other families could have buried their loved ones in black cemeteries in southeastern York County or in family plots in their hometowns in the South .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just those who died .
" There were many that got sick , " she said .
Carroll , who officiated in several of these funerals , survived the crisis .
He left York shortly after the pandemic and served elsewhere for years .
His body was returned to Lebanon Cemetery for burial in 1942 , amid the people he had blessed in death decades earlier .
York 's black community stands up  York County 's black community had been full participants in this excruciating moment -- its terrible flu and a war that sent 200 county residents in uniform to the grave .
At least one of its soldiers , George A .
Wood , serving with a machine gun unit , died in fighting .
Others survived , but soldiered in terrible conditions .
Joseph L .
Penn served in the 808 Pioneer Infantry in the mud of France .
While he was deployed , his brother , Theodore , died from the flu .
York 's Harriet Penn lost one son and the suffered through uncertainty about fate of the other .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other societies had labored on the home front .
There was Amelia Robinson , a young Visiting Nurse Association staffer , who was attending to sick people in their homes .
She would be dead in about a year from a " complication of diseases .
"  So the black community was looking forward to the victory celebration , putting forth two bands .
Grand Army of the Republic Civil War veterans and schoolchildren would march .
Sickness , death , war -- and now discrimination .
The fed up black community stood up .
Members objected to being assigned to their separate parade division .
They sought , for example , that their black Red Cross branch members march with the white American Red Cross chapter .
George Bowles argued to parade officials that the black community did not think it was " exactly democratic " that they march in a segregated division .
The committee did not budge .
Well , maybe a little .
When the parade lineup was prepared , the black groups were integrated into one of 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Harrisburg band and the Greek Society .
