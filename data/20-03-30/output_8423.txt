New York state budget : 9 issues to watch for as the deadline looms for an on-time deal  ALBANY - The state Legislature and Gov .
Andrew Cuomo will be racing to get an on-time budget in advance of the fiscal year that starts Wednesday as they continue to deal with an unprecedented crisis that has wrecked state finances .
The state came into the fiscal year facing a $6 billion budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow to $10 billion to $15 billion by the time the coronavirus runs its course -- which could be months .
" Revenues just stopped , " Cuomo said Friday .
Both the state and federal governments have delayed the income-tax filing dates until July 15 , and though money will still come in , it will be a trickle compared to typically knowing by the April 15 deadline what the state 's fiscal picture looks like .
Couple that with the human , fiscal and economic toll of coronavirus in New York , and the sides entered the final days of budget negotiations with uncertainty .
While New York 's congressional delegation praised the package , saying it will provide money for hospital , schools , state government and municipalities , Cuomo said the roughly $5 billion headed to the state 's coffers ca n't be used to close its budget deficit -- only for coronavirus matters .
That 's fine , but it wo n't balance the books , he continued .
" We have to deal with the numbers as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to pass or sign a phony budget .

billion overall -- by far the most per capita of any state in the nation .
School groups wanted a $2 billion boost .
Now they face the prospect of cuts as districts prepare their budget for a public vote May 19 , which itself might be imperiled due to coronavirus safety concerns .
The federal stimulus package did include about $1 .
billion for New York schools and higher-education institutions , but it may not be enough to fill the gap .
" A state budget that cuts funding to schools would devastate educational opportunities for New York 's 2 million children , " the advocacy group , Alliance for a Quality Education , said .

Will New York legalize marijuana in the budget deal ?  Protesters urging legislators to pass Marijuana legislation lay on the floor outside the Assembly Chamber doors at the state Capitol Wednesday , June 19 , 2019 , in Albany , N .
( Photo : Hans Pennink , AP )  Last year , supporters of legalizing marijuana in New York could n't get a deal in the state budget , then failed to get a bill passed last June before the six-month legislative ended .
This year , there was renewed hope that Cuomo and Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how marijuana crimes have disproportionately impacted communities of color and to give the state a revenue boost .
But whether the complex deal can be reached during such a hectic time and with just a few days before an on-time budget deal is needed is uncertain .

Addressing the controversy over bail reform in New York  Gov .
Andrew Cuomo said bail reforms will be part of the budget negotiations for the fiscal year that starts April 1 , 2020 .
( Photo : Joseph Spector , USA TODAY Network New York )  Last year , lawmakers and Cuomo agreed to end cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felonies in New York , saying keeping people in jail solely because they did n't have money was an unjust system that largely impacted minorities .
But when the law took effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , with law enforcement railing against it as thousands of inmates went free and others who were charged let go without bail until their cases are settled .
Police and prosecutors want the law to be scaled back to exclude some serious charges and to give judges discretion over whether cash bail should be set .
But some Democratic lawmakers say the law should stay as is -- particularly now , as jails have become more unsafe because of the coronavirus .
" This crisis further highlights the need for us to protect the laws we worked so hard to pass last year in order to address mass incarceration and safeguard the presumption of innocence , " 40 Democratic lawmakers wrote last week to Cuomo and legislative leaders .

billion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Medicaid , the health insurance for the poor and disabled in New York that is used by about 20% of the state 's population and has ballooned to more than $60 billion a year .
But now that task is more complicated as more New Yorkers head to Medicaid because of job losses and as hospitals struggle to keep up with the influx of coronavirus patients .
Moreoever , Cuomo wanted to make counties , including New York City , pay for any Medicaid cost increases that exceed 3% each year .
Yet Congress passed a package earlier this month that linked $6 .
billion in federal aid for Medicaid to not moving costs onto local governments in New York -- a deal Cuomo has refused to take .

Andrew Cuomo outlines the latest steps businesses must follow as part of the state 's coronavirus response ; March 18 , 2020 .
New York State Team  The uncertainty over the state 's finances led Cuomo on Thursday to suggest his administration should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year .
Cuomo said he needs the flexibility through the year to provide aid to schools and programs because it is simply unclear how much money the state will have .
He said the state will " have periods through the course of the year where you say to school districts , local governments , etc .
, ' This is how much we actually received .
' "  The suggestion , and taking control away from the Legislature , sent shock waves across school districts and local governments , fearing they would be left at the whim of the powerful governor each quarter .
Whether the Legislature goes along with it this week or not is unclear .
" Allowing the state to alter statutory reimbursement for these state services in any given quarter by double-digit percentages simply places these state costs on the backs of homeowners , small businesses across the state and local taxpayers , " the state Association of Counties said .
