Housing market remains stable as local realtors take steps to reduce COVID-19 outbreaks  Much like other industries around the world , the local real estate industry has put measures in place to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19 .
Lesley Craig , President of the Grande Prairie and Area Association of Realtors , says the coronavirus pandemic is being taken very seriously by the industry , and the provincial body , the Alberta Association of Realtors , has put a ban on all conventional open houses .
" So realtors are kind of coming up with creative solutions , including virtual open houses , more photos , videos and virtual tours on all of their listings .
As well as even opportunities to have face time or video calls with a realtor , while they walk through the house , to limit some of the exposure that people will be at risk with .
"  Craig says they have also implemented new screening protocols to follow before even meeting with the buying and selling public .
" So we have standard questionnaires that have been developed to pre-screen clients before we meet with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ? ' or ' Have you been through airports in the last 14 days ? ' ' Do you have any symptoms of the sickness ? ' and ' Have you had any close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 ? ' "  The outbreak prevention measures extend past this phase , and into the showing of the property .
Clients are required to sanitize their hands and wear gloves , the realtors are limiting the amount of things that are touched , and then the realtors ask the clients to follow up in the coming days if they develop any symptoms of the novel coronavirus .
Following the showing , realtors are also contacting the owners of the houses , to tell them where they were in the house and what to disinfect , and asking them to follow up in the coming days if they fall ill .
Despite all these new safety measures and the fear of the novel coronavirus , compounded by the plummeting price of oil in the past weeks , the housing market in Grande Prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 sales per week , and as of Friday morning , they had just secured their 26th conditional offer for that week .
However , Craig says she will be keeping an eye on future developments , though is hopeful the economic aid from the provincial and federal governments for both businesses and the general public will help minimize any future impacts on the housing market .
" We 've got the government lowering interest rates , income assistance for people , freeing up capital for the banks to continue to lend money .
That should help for sure .
And then as we consider the low price of oil , we 've already seen major oil companies reduce their capital spending plans .
But in our Grande Prairie area , there 's been talk by the government around stimulus to the reclamation of abandoned wells , and that should be a positive move for our local service companies .
"  She adds that Grande Prairie is also a very diverse area , with lots of agriculture , forestry , and retail industries that can help prop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" That one to two per cent that rent has dropped , maybe that 's what we 'll see in our house prices as well , because they are both kind of tied together .
The people are renting from people that own these houses .
So if the rents are going down , prices might have to go down to reflect that as well .
"  Craig adds that there have been fewer people looking to get into the housing market in the past couple weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic , but it 's still in the early stages .
While she expects the industry to slow down more in the coming weeks , she could not speculate on what long term effects the pandemic and the oil price will have on the local real estate market .
She says she will be vigilantly watching announcements made by both the federal and provincial governments , and hopes to see more done to help the buying public maintain their income , along with some form of economic aid aimed to mitigate the negative effects this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident of Grouard has been identified as the North zone 's first fatality related to COVID-19 .
