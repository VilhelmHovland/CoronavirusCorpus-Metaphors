Ministry of Health seeks expressions of interest for COVID-19 response  Ministry seeks expressions of interest from health and care professionals for COVID-19 response .
The Ministry of Health is seeking expressions of interest from health and care professionals who are able and willing to work for a limited amount of time as part of the national strategic approach to managing COVID-19 .
We have already been asking retired health professionals to express their interest in working within the health and disability system .
We have also had interest from other people who are not currently working in clinical roles , for example those on maternity leave .
So far , more than 2500 healthcare workers , including 606 nurses , 587 doctors , 58 midwives and 203 medical laboratory scientists have signed up - and this number continues to grow .
We would now also like to hear from current health and care workers who may now be available as non-essential services are paused .
We are seeking people to work in both general and clinically specialised roles as we scale up the health and care workforce .
People will be matched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight will be provided ( where required ) to ensure safe practice .
The Ministry of Health has put in place a system to nationally coordinate the matching of supply and demand .
This means understanding who is available to work , and matching them to roles that need to be filled in the sector .
Some of these will be patient contact roles , while others will be supporting services such as Healthline and contact tracing , which can be done remotely .
The Ministry of Health is partnering with Accent Health to manage this process on our behalf .
For health workers , they will be collecting information about their availability , co-ordinating re-registration with the relevant regulatory Council where required , and then supporting the process to get into employment quickly .
Employers will be able to log their workforce requests , and then people will be matched to positions .
We are aware that demand may exceed supply , and we are developing a prioritisation process to manage this .
This will be communicated once finalised .
Health or care workers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can register here .
