Published  9 hours ago  on  March 30 , 2020  By  France said on Monday it would pay for hotel rooms for victims of domestic violence and open pop-up counseling centres after figures showed the number of abuse cases had soared during the first week of a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus .
Gender Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said about 20 centres would open in stores around the country so women could drop in for help while getting groceries .

million ) for anti-domestic abuse organisations to help them respond to increased demand for services .
The initiatives were launched after the government late last week said reports of domestic abuse to police had jumped 36% in Paris and 32% elsewhere in France after the restrictions came into force .
The cases included two murders .
France began a nationwide lockdown on March 17 which will remain until at least April 15 .
No one is allowed to leave their home except to buy food or medication , visit a doctor , get exercise or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Activists have said the quarantine measures will lead to a surge in domestic violence and make it harder for victims to seek help .
ADVERTISEMENT  Schiappa , who previously warned that the lockdown would create a " breeding ground for violence " , said France would pay for up to 20,000 hotel nights so that victims can escape abusive partners .
The pop-up centres will initially open across Paris and in Lille in northern France .
" My biggest concern is to multiply the points of contact with women .
As it 's difficult for women to get out , we want to make sure that support systems can go to women , " Schiappa told French newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday .

" Hypermarkets are among the few stores still open today .
We thought it would be good if victims of domestic violence , or people who know a victim , could meet associations near these places , " URW spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  France introduced a separate initiative last week to encourage women to report domestic abuse in pharmacies .
The move follows a similar one in Spain where women can go to their pharmacy and request a " Mask 19 " -- a code word that will alert the pharmacist to contact the authorities .
