The U .
911 system is n't wired for a nationwide emergency like the coronavirus pandemic , call-center officials say .
Public-safety call centers are confronting an unexpected 911 emergency : keeping the people who answer the phone healthy .
As the new coronavirus spreads in communities across the U .
, 911 call centers are grappling with how to ensure their dispatchers do n't get infected -- and what to do if they run short on workers trained to field emergency calls .
When a 911 call taker in the Lake County Sheriff 's Office north of Chicago tested positive for the coronavirus March 20 , the emergency call center had to quickly close for a deep cleaning .
It sent some staff to a neighboring facility , but that town 's system for dispatching first responders was n't compatible with the county sheriff 's 911 call system , which risked prolonging emergency response time and limiting information sharing .

The U .
911 systemis n't wired for a nationwide emergency like the coronavirus pandemic , call-center officials say .
They typically contend with local or regional disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes .
A hodgepodge of dated telephone systems , mismatching radio frequencies and disparate dispatch software mean that call traffic at many centers ca n't easily be redirected from a center that is overloaded with calls or whose call takers have fallen ill .
In a pandemic , a center 's nearby overflow facility could be a town that also is overwhelmed with its own staffing problems .
That could leave callers with long wait times and slow responses .
" One sick employee could take out the whole center , " said Audrey DiManna , communications manager for the Greenwood Village Police Department in Colorado .
" I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lose all of your staff at once .
"  Personnel answering 911 calls ca n't typically work from home and often report to facilities shared with fire , police or emergency medical workers .
In a pandemic , those first responders are often in direct contact with sick people and return to stations where they dine and work together .
Earlier this month , Ms .
DiManna limited which workers could access her center , barring even janitors , and asking workers to wipe down their equipment more often and empty their own trash cans .
Dispatchers sit 10 to 12 feet apart .
Still , she feared people would become infected through their social interactions and movement throughout their communities .
Working with the police chief , she crafted a plan to put specific workers , including 911 call takers , on a standby status .
That newly implemented status means they are paid each day of the week for one hour at their typical overtime rate whether they work or not .
In exchange , they must stay off public transportation , not drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond to work within an hour and a half if they are called in .
The practice is costing the county $16,000 a month .
" It minimizes their risk to illness and incentivizes healthy behavior , " she said .
Most emergency call centers in California have locked down facilities so that only dispatchers and essential 911-related staff can access them , and many are starting to require fever checks at the beginning of each shift , said Lee Ann Magoski , president of the California chapter of the 911 trade body , the National Emergency Number Association .
Last week , Ms .
Magoski had a washer and dryer installed in the building she manages in Monterey in case she is unable to purchase cleansing wipes and has to resort to reusing towels .
The machines may also help if staff have to shelter at the facility and wash their clothes .
" There 's not this great cache of people that can come in and fill in .
At some point there is nobody else , " said Ms .
Magoski , whose department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure those phone lines are always being answered , " she said .
A professional cleaning company sanitizes the center she oversees twice a week in addition to rendering normal janitorial service , covering stations in a mist of sanitizing chemicals as other workers nearby continue to answer 911 calls .
Her staff also has cleaned and locked down a training room , keeping it reserved as a backup location .
Chenango County in upstate New York has 10 emergency dispatchers covering about 900 square miles and 49,000 people .
Some states including New York regularly divert chunks of money that phone customers pay for 911 infrastructure upgrades to other state functions , which can leave emergency call centers with outdated tools .
" If one of the dispatchers became exposed , in the course of three days they would have contact with every other person that they work with , " said A .
Wesley Jones , chief dispatcher there .
Jones , another supervisor and all part-time staff are now barred from the county 's main emergency communications building .
They instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send its calls to another county , but their radio frequencies are n't compatible , which means the neighboring center can take calls but ca n't dispatch first responders for Chenango .
" We 've never planned for the idea that we could lose our entire staff , " Mr .
Jones said .
In New Orleans , dispatchers have their temperatures taken at the start of each shift , the consoles are deep-cleaned every two days and workers wipe down their equipment between shifts .
" Traditionally we would reach out to a neighboring community for help " in an emergency , said Tyrell Morris , executive director of New Orleans 's 911 call operations , adding that those neighbors also are strained .
" We do n't have that available right now .
