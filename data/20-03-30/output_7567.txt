Airbnb allocates $250M to repay hosts who lost business during coronavirus pandemic  Airbnb vowed to distribute $250 million to the platform 's hosts who lost customers after the coronavirus pandemic stunted the travel industry .
The company , which allows homeowners to rent out their property to guests , announced the decision on Monday .
In an email to hosts , CEO Brian Chesky reported that each host would receive 25% of the business they lost due to cancellations .
Airbnb said the policy would cover any reservations that were set to check in between March 14 and May 31 .

Of the total , $1 million will be crowdsourced from other hosts , and the other $9 million will come from the company 's heads , including Chesky and the site 's co-founders Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia .

"  He acknowledged that many hosts were upset when the company decided to halt all reservations after the World Health Organization deemed coronavirus a pandemic .
Chesky added , " While I believe we did the right thing in prioritizing health and safety , I 'm sorry that we communicated this decision to guests without consulting you -- like partners should .
We have heard from you , and we know we could have been better partners .
