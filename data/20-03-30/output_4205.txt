Irishman on life in India : Police beatings , suspicion of foreigners and loudspeaker warnings  People stand on designated areas to maintain social distancing as they queue outside a general store during a government-imposed nationwide lockdown in Bhopal , India .
Photograph : Sanjeev Gupta/EPA  Brian Ingle is a Dublin-born osteopath and teacher of somatic exercise , a system of gentle movements that its practitioners say can reduce physical pain and psychological stress .
( He is also the brother of the Irish Times writer R ? is ? n Ingle .
) He lives in Pondicherry , in India , which has been on a serious lockdown for a week due to the Covid-19 virus .
This is strictly enforced .
Indian police have been filmed beating people found out on the streets .
" It 's a very extraordinary lockdown , because they have n't really given opportunities for people to prepare for it , " Ingle says .
" When people go out to the shops , the police , at least in parts of the country , are beating them .
Foreigners like myself are also seen as suspect , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fishing village nearby , I went to get some fish and as I neared the beach the road had been completely blocked off .
There was no way I could pass on my motorcycle , so I parked and went around the blockage by foot .
I was immediately met by the local villagers freaking out at me and telling me to go away .
"  Is it a complete lockdown ? " Officially , yes , but as I go foraging , I can see locals congregating around their houses playing cards and hanging out .
Also , police cars are going around with loudspeakers saying , " Coronavirus , go inside , go inside .
' But it 's not going to work here , especially in high densely populated areas , like Bihar State and Uttar Pradesh .
"  Has he personally had any interactions with the police ? " I 've been avoiding them , I 've been taking backroads and when I see them , just stay away .
"  Brian Ingle : ' Be grateful for that safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
'  Has he got supplies ? " I managed to score 20 litres of drinking water .
I have potatoes , tomatoes , onions , 1kg of cheese , pasta but I 'm running out of vegetables .
I bought copious amounts of butter before the lockdown to make jars of homemade ghee clarified butter .
Not as nice as pure Irish ghee though , we have the best dairy in the world in Ireland .
My sense is things will calm down very soon and the supply chain will function again properly .
But the question is , how long will it be like this ? I 'll hear that a market is open but then when I get there , it 's often not open .
I 'm adventurous by nature and this environment suits me BUTa lot of people in my building are n't like that .
I met someone on the roof who asked , ' If you get out there , can you get me a bag of rice ? ' I came home through the back streets , it usually takes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour .
Everything just slowed down because I was checking each and every person , ' How are they receiving me ? ' "  What does he do every day ? " I get up early and do a yoga practice , meditation , pranayama .
I 'm in touch with my family and my friends , making video calls and all the online social interaction is very , very important as I live alone .
My perception is that the petty stuff that we used to go on about , is fading and disappearing .
The Irish are lucky .
Even though Ireland has gone into full lockdown the essential shops are open .
You 're safe to walk outside without watching your back every step of the way .
Also , the State is looking after those who are now unemployed .
I have an American friend quarantined in China in a 14x25 foot sealed room for eight days .
My suggestion is be grateful for the country that you 're in .
Be grateful for that safety and security , because for many it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel for his teaching engagements , Ingle is still working over the internet .
" I 'm offering consultations , movement awareness practices and strategies online for clients to come out of pain , " he says .
" The somatic teachings that I am trained in enables me to work very effectively , remotely without a hands-on treatment .
I 'm also preparing for an online Somatic Movement Summit to help people become more embodied , improve their wellbeing and learn tools to manage the anxiety and stress for the current Covid-19 challenges .
My company Living Somatics and a US company called The Shift Network are collaborating together .
"  Ingle has been in touch with the Irish consulate who he says have been very helpful and have put his name down for an emergency flight out of the country .
He alternates between concern and a sense of calm , which he puts down to his practice of somatics and meditation .
" Everything feels so immediate and so present .
I 'm so awake to the process , the experience of living , every morsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit strange though and my dreams are intense .
Sometimes I hit a wall , but it does n't last long .
And then I just get on with it .
What is my strategy for supplies ? How can I maintain social interaction with family and friends online ? How can I work ? It feels like the days are very full .
Life is a series of moments .
How can I be present in each one of those moments ? Everyone is losing everything - income , career , stocks .
We are facing our mortality , the mortality of our elders .
It 's a huge mental strain .
What are we left with ? Our authentic humanness and the question ' How can I help ? How can I contribute ? How can I show up and be present , for myself and others ? And how can I be kind ? ' "  Brian Ingle teaching a somatic class .
The Department of Foreign Affairs , which since India banned scheduled international flights , on March 22nd , has been looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says any Irish citizens who want to leave India urgently should email the Irish Embassy there , at newdelhiembassy@dfa .
, with details of their situation .
" At this point in time , it is not possible to predict if and when such flights might become available , " it says .
" However , we shall endeavour to keep you updated on the situation if you contact us .
"  " We know this is very stressful for those abroad and their families here , but we are leaving no stone unturned in trying to get people home .
Any Irish citizen who believes that an Embassy may not be aware of their presence should register online .
