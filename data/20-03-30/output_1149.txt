Changes to Your Workforce  Whether or not your business is deemed " essential , " you may be considering changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the undeniable economic impact of the pandemic .
Such changes may include furloughing employees , laying off employees , or reducing an employee 's rate of pay/hours .
In Pennsylvania , an employer is only required to advise an employee , in writing , if it is reducing its rate of pay/hours ; an employer does not need to provide an employee notice of a furlough or layoff .
However , some employers may decide to provide written notice to employees of their decision , the reason , and assurance that these measures are only being taken in response to the pandemic and with the ultimate goal of returning to business as usual in the near future .
We suggest you consider all available options carefully before making any decision , and refer to the following chart for an overview .
Furlough  ? Advise employees they must not work during the furlough period and consider keeping employer issued mobile devices and limiting or cutting off email access .

The statewide minimum wage is $7 .
per hour ; however , municipalities may have higher minimum wages ( there are also differently hourly rates for workers in the fast food industry and those who receive tips ) .
? Reduction in exempt salary may result in the loss of the employee 's exempt status .
An employer is not prohibited , however , from prospectively reducing the predetermined salary amount to be paid regularly to an exempt employee during a business or economic slowdown , provided the change is bona fide and not used as a device to evade the salary basis requirements .
Such a predetermined regular salary reduction , not related to the quantity or quality of work performed , will not result in loss of the exemption , as long as the employee still receives on a salary basis at least the minimum amount required by law to be paid to exempt employees .
