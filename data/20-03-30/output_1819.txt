Trump signs $2 trillion recovery plan as US virus cases skyrocket  It triggers the distribution of millions of relief checks of up to $3,400 for an average American family of four .
President Donald Trump signed into law Friday the $2 trillion rescue plan to salvage a US economy crippled by the novel coronavirus , on a day the nation 's total count of COVID-19 cases surpassed 100,000 .
Trump 's signature brings an end to a dramatic , weeklong legislative saga on Capitol Hill and triggers the distribution of millions of relief checks of up to $3,400 for an average American family of four .
Hours earlier lawmakers in the House of Representatives united to green-light the mega-plan as the number of recorded deaths from the virus hit 1,693 .
" I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first , " Trump said .
" This will deliver urgently needed relief to our nation 's families , workers and businesses .
That 's what this is all about .

Nationwide the number of coronavirus cases surpassed 104,000 .
The need for medical supplies is acute in New York state , the US hotbed of the epidemic where 44,635 infections have been confirmed .
The death toll there increased Friday to 519 -- up from 385 the previous day -- but Governor Andrew Cuomo expressed optimism that the increase in the hospitalization rate has slowed .
Cuomo announced the creation of temporary hospitals at large facilities in each borough of New York City -- including at a horse racing track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Javits Center .
The national rescue bill pumps $100 billion into hospitals and health facilities in critical need of medical gear like personal protective equipment and intensive care beds , creates a $500 billion loan reserve for large corporations including airlines , and provides $377 billion in grants to small businesses .
It also dramatically expands unemployment assistance , aid that will cushion the blow for a staggering 3 .

Several lawmakers including top House Republican Kevin McCarthy hailed the bill as a critical lifeline for workers and small businesses .
" Americans need that money now , they ca n't wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we normally do , " Mnuchin said on Fox Business Network , adding he expected direct deposits of the cash to arrive in three weeks .
The vote in the House was notable for the implementation of social distancing rules that prevented lawmakers from all gathering on the floor , leading to unprecedented scenes of members sitting in the upper galleries to allow for sufficient spacing .
With the House in recess this week , leaders had wanted a quick voice vote requiring just a few members present .
But Republican Thomas Massie , who opposed the bill , threatened to stall the measure .
Ultimately the House defeated Massie 's maneuver and passed the legislation but not before Trump savaged his fellow Republican on Twitter as a " third rate Grandstander .
"  Pelosi said the $2 trillion rescue plan -- the third and by far largest coronavirus legislative measure -- will not be the end of government assistance to battered communities .
" We must advance a fourth bill to address continued needs , " she said , noting that state and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address the crisis .
