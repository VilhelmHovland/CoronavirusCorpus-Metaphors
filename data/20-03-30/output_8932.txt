Of America and sacrifice : Is the country ready to step up ?  This Sept .
17 , 1943 file image shows the War Ration Book Four , issued by the Office of Price Administration .
Not since World War II when people carried ration books with stamps that allowed them to purchase meat , sugar , butter , cooking oil and gasoline has the entire nation been asked to truly sacrifice for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- For most Americans alive today , the idea of shared national sacrifice is a collective abstraction , a memory handed down from a grandparent or passed on through a book or movie .
Not since World War II , when people carried ration books with stamps that allowed them to purchase meat , sugar , butter , cooking oil and gasoline , when buying cars , firewood and nylon was restricted , when factories converted from making automobiles to making tanks , Jeeps and torpedoes , when men were drafted and women volunteered in the war effort , has the entire nation been asked to sacrifice for a greater good .
The civil rights era , Vietnam , the Gulf wars , 9/11 and the financial crisis all involved suffering , even death , but no call for universal sacrifice .
President George W .
Bush encouraged people to buy things after the terrorist attacks to help the economy -- " patriots at the mall , " some called it -- before the full war effort was underway .
People lost jobs and homes in the financial crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Now , with the coronavirus , it 's as though a natural disaster has taken place in multiple places at once .
Millions of people will likely lose their jobs .
Businesses will shutter .
Schools have closed .
Thousands will die .
Leaders are ordering citizens into isolation to stop the virus ' march .
Suddenly , in the course of a few weeks , John F .
Kennedy 's " ask what you can do for your country " injunction has come to life .
Will Americans step up ?  " This is a new moment , " said Jon Meacham , a historian and author of " The Soul of America .

" There was a kind of perpetual vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long twilight struggle ' -- but living with the fear of nuclear war is quite abstract compared to living with the fear of a virus and of a possible economic depression .
"  The second world war involved a common enemy and common purpose , with clear sides drawn across the globe .
While President Donald Trump has at times tried to summon that feeling about attacking the coronavirus , he has abruptly changed course , suggesting Monday that restrictions he has sought on American life may be as short-lived as his slogan about " 15 days to slow the spread , " even as others are warning that most of the country is about to be hit by a crush of new cases .
In Congress , some talk of coming together while others excoriate their partisan opposites .
Last week , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky .
, laid the early blame for lack of congressional action entirely at the feet of Democrats .
" A request to do anything becomes a point of attack , and we are always 10 steps back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history at Princeton .
" So intense polarization in a moment of crisis -- with a president who is not interested in time-tested forms of governance and the job of uniting -- make this much more difficult .
"  New Yorkers stand in line Feb .
23 , 1943 , to pick up their latest ration books .

Mike DeWine , R-Ohio , moved swiftly to shut down most activity in his state and he implored Ohioans to help .
" We have not faced an enemy like we are facing today in 102 years , " DeWine said recently .
" You have to go back to the 1918 influenza epidemic .
We are certainly at war .
In the time of war , we must make sacrifices , and I thank all of our Ohio citizens for what they are doing and what they are n't doing .
You are making a huge difference , and this difference will save lives .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country destroyed by hurricanes , floods , wildfires and blizzards .
But there is then a season of rebuilding and renewal .
The coronavirus , with its rapid spread , is giving Americans a public-health Katrina that knows few borders or boundaries , even though some parts of the country are suffering far more than others .
To date , for many , the sacrifices have been mere inconveniences .
No restaurants or movie theaters .
Maybe the need to buy exercise equipment because the gym has closed .
Or to leave the cardboard box from Amazon outside for 24 hours to make sure the virus does n't somehow enter the home .
A week of being told to work from home can resemble a working vacation .
A week of not being able to work at all is frustrating but , potentially , eventually reversible .
But when a week bleeds into a month , or longer , how will we react ?  In this June 26 , 1942 file photo , workers at the St .
Louis Ordnance plant inspect 50-caliber shell casings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had come through the metal shaping machines .
Not since World War II when factories converted from making automobiles to making tanks and torpedoes has the entire nation been asked to truly sacrifice for a greater good .
( Photo : AP )  " We used to tax in times of crisis .
Now we do n't , " Zelizer said .
" We asked people to ration in times of crisis .
Now we do n't .
We asked people to serve in times of crisis .
Now we do n't .
So this is a sea change .
The thing is , Americans might not have a choice .
"  For many , the choices are personal and painful .
Abigail Spanberger , D-Va .
, can not see her parents or her in-laws for the foreseeable future because she may have been exposed to the virus .
But she is also seeing the impact of the virus in many other ways that are far more harmful .
" I think we are at the beginning stages of people understanding what the sacrifice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nursing homes are told they ca n't go visit their loved ones .
That brings it home .
For people who have kids , trying to explain why they ca n't go to school , ca n't have playdates , ca n't see friends , ca n't see family members .
" It is this element of everyone needs to disrupt their lives so that other people wo n't die , " she said .
" It 's different than eating less meat because of war or working in a factory because a husband is overseas .
But you also ca n't engage with the community , so it makes it harder .
You ca n't lean on your social circle , church , or school .
All of those things are taken from us trying to keep people safe .
"  With people being asked to sacrifice their jobs , their children 's education , their ability to commune with family and friends , Spanberger said , " the depth of empathy that that should be available and the strength of concerns over these decisions needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least not from the administration .
"  What the nation 's leaders do or do n't do will shape the course of the pandemic and its lethality .
But it will be Americans ' willingness to sacrifice that may well matter more .
" In the end , this presents a great and compelling test of our national sense of ourselves as exceptional , generous and resilient , " Meacham said .
" Perhaps we are all of those things .
One thing 's for sure : We 're about to find out .
