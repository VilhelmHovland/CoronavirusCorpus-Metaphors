' Badger Shield ' approved to protect medical staff from COVID-19  MADISON , Wis .
-- A group of innovators in Dane County have developed a face shield that will now be used to protect medical staff as they treat patients with COVID-19 .
The mask is approved for use and is now being massed produced , making it one of the first shields to be developed as a result of the pandemic that is being widely embraced .
A few weeks ago officials at UW Hospitals officials frantically contacted Lennon Rodger , the director of the Engineering Design Innovation Lab at UW to make protective masks after UW Hospital 's normal supplier had ran out .
Lennon consulted Jesse Darley , a mechanical engineer at Madison design firm Delve and Brian Ellison , development manager at Midwest prototyping in Blue Mounds , and thus the Badger Shield was born .
" The need is immense .
We are thinking that there may be shortages of over a million face shields a day , " Darley said .
UW hospital quickly approved the device and it is now being worn by staff there .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus through a cough or a sneeze .
" The speed was incredible .
We basically went from identifying the need and trying to get a team together to delivering face shields to the UW hospital in about four to five days , " Darley said .
The mask is made out of lightweight and easy to come by materials .
" UW Hospital is expecting surges to come next week or a little later .
So they want to be a little ahead of the problem .
That 's why we focused on as simple a design as possible so we could get it out there quickly , " Darley said .
The creators have uploaded the design online so others can copy it .
The Ford Motor Company , which halted vehicle production , is manufacturing the masks .
Darley said that he is excited by the fact that the Badger Shield is helping create work for many during the economic slow down .
