" We are living in unprecedented times with the twin battles that we face and that we fight against the virus and against the economic ruin that it can threaten , " Prime Minister Scott Morrison said .
" This calls for unprecedented action , governments making decisions like they never have before .
"  But just how much will the government 's policies help ease the economic burden of the coronavirus pandemic ?  Describing the sheer scale of the package as " incredible " , Commonwealth Bank chief economist Gareth Aird said it should pump the brakes on the number one economic concern right now : rising unemployment .
" The JobKeeper subsidy will limit the rise in unemployment because many firms who could not afford to retain staff due to a drop in sales as a result of COVID-19 will now be able to do so .
In essence , the cost of labour for impacted firms will drop to zero -- or close to zero depending on other arrangements between a worker and their employer , " Aird said in a note issued to Business Insider Australia .
" This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next six months as the economy contracts primarily due to the imposed shutdown or shutdowns , so on that score we can expect less damage done to the labour market than otherwise .
Of course , it will not save all businesses .
Aird concedes " many businesses will struggle financially to remain viable over the next six months " as revenues drop to zero due to shutdown measures and wages only constitute one of many costs for businesses .
On that count , the ability to defer loan repayments for six months combined with a moratorium on evictions will at least help some businesses survive , if not operate .
Many Australians then can still expect to lose their job , according to the Royal Bank of Canada 's ( RBC ) Australian branch .
" We expect a front-loading of job shedding in the next few months with the unemployment rate set to test 9 .
by the third quarter , possibly earlier , " RBC economist Su-Lin Ong said .
" Today 's package may temper this rise .
"  However , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ong said .
" Coupled with the previous two packages -- $17 .
billion and $66 billion , the latter of which was not all new money -- this now puts total Commonwealth fiscal stimulus close to 10% of GDP and on par with the global efforts , " she said .
" We caution against some political spin from the Treasurer yesterday as he included the $105 billion of support from the RBA which are funds set aside to lend and support the economy but not yet deployed to suggest $320 billion of stimulus or 16% of GDP .
"  Cost of Aust wage subsidies $130bn over next 6 mths .
Takes total budgetary stimulus to $200bn or 10% of GDP .
Which will swamp the GFC stimulus .
Absolutely necessary given the hit to the econ from CV .
May not stop recession but will help limit collateral damage &amp; boost recovery **26;138;TOOLONG  " It 's absolutely necessary given the hit to the economy from COVID-19 , " AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said in a tweet .
" It may not stop a recession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  " The economy will still contract sharply from here and the unemployment rate will rise , " Aird said .
" It is inevitable given the enforced shutdown but this incredible stimulus package will limit the rise in unemployment and help the economy to recover faster when restrictions on activity are lifted .
