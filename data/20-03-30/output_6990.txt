Could A Full-Face Snorkeling Mask Help Protect Against COVID-19 ?  In light of the COVID-19 pandemic , full-face snorkeling mask makers Ocean Reef and Mares think they could have a filter attached to the mask to protect against infection .
Earlier this month , Italian company Mestel Safety , part of the OceanReefGroup , who , under the brand OCEAN REEF builds full-face masks for snorkeling and scuba purposes , filed an international Patent for an adapter that would connect Ocean Reef-manufactured snorkeling masks to P3 and other types of filters transforming the snorkeling mask into a personal protection mask .
According to the company :  " We do not want to compare our masks , with the adapter or not , to any , more standard , protective equipment .
We are just offering a possible solution , in a time of dire need , to physically create a barrier , with the possible addition of a filter , to contagious droplets .
"  The adapter would fit in the connection of any OCEAN REEF produced mask .
The filter itself could be of any type and brand , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need to push out the exhalation cover valve of mask , the company claims .
OCEAN REEF says the company has sold more than 1 .
million full-face snorkeling masks globally , and has good inventory through its worldwide dealers and U .
and Italian warehouses .
Not only that , the company says it is ready to be modified to work on other full-face snorkeling mask brands , like Easybreath , Aqualung and many more , increasing the number of possible transformable protection equipment to 2+ million .
As for pricing :  " Consumer pricing for the adapter is planned to be purposely low to help current owners convert their snorkeling masks as inexpensively as possible .
"  The company says all its Aria masks , which are available in four different sizes , including youth , can be easily cleaned and sanitized ( including immersing in boiling water ) , while much of the protection equipment that is now very difficult to purchase is single use .
Ocean Reef says the first 3D-printed prototypes have already been tested over the past three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with initial output at 1,000 units per day .
