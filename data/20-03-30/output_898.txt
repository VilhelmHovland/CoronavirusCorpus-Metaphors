COVID-19 : MPI visiting packhouses and hort operations  The Ministry for Primary Industries ( MPI ) will be visiting packhouses and other horticultural operations across the country from today .
Horticulture New Zealand ( HortNZ ) says that the visits are educational in nature , aiming to help the industry understand its obligations as an essential service and help with compliance to stop the spread of COVID-19 , which is the Government 's chief objective .
HortNZ says MPI appreciates that the horticulture sector has responded positively to the Government 's requirements under Level 4 .
MPI officials will visit singularly , may phone ahead and will be from various MPI services .
They will keep a two-metre distance , are aware of biosecurity issues and the visits will be short .
MPI officials will be able to answer questions verbally and can email information too .
MPI has also undertaken measures to improve the registration process .
Once the process has been improved , those that have registered will receive confirmation and a registration number via email .
