" We have noted the misinformation doing the rounds in social media where a leader in this country is claiming there are over 7000 people in mandatory quarantine .
This is not true .
It is immoral and unethical for anyone , more so a leader in the country , to mislead people for whatever reasons they may have particularly with regard to the fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , symbolizes everything that is wrong in our society noting that while this number can happen at any given time , at the moment it is not true and if it was the case there would be no reason at all why government would hide the truth explaining that currently there are 2050 people in mandatory quarantine in 14 designated places .
Kagwe who was giving an update on the coronavirus situation as of Sunday said that the medical teams had Sunday embarked on mass testing for all those persons who arrived in the country last week based on dates of arrival " It is important that suspects will remain in quarantine for the full duration .

" As government , we have plans to ensure that in the next few weeks , we are able to manufacture some of these materials locally for self-sustainability " he said .
Trade Cabinet Secretary Betty Maina said that within the country , there are 50 companies that are capable of manufacturing ventilators and also personal protective gears and they are working and having a conversation together to ensure there is great capacity to supply goods .

He further asked those companies or even expert individuals who can produce masks or any protective gear to liaise with County Emergency Response team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can manufacture them locally .
During Sunday 's briefing , the CS appealed to employers to release their employees early from their work stations to beat the curfew time .
