More must be done to cushion blow of Covid-19 , experts urge Ramaphosa  Economists say SA 's public health actions to respond to Covid-19 are to be commended , but economic interventions so far have been subject to delay , confusion and incoherence .
Image : GCIS  Economists and business analysts have written an open letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa and his cabinet , calling for decisive action to protect workers and business , as well as the poor , from the Covid-19 pandemic .
Signed by 75 experts and commentators , it states that economic interventions so far have been subject to delay , confusion and incoherence .
Here is the letter , circulated by the Institute for Economic Justice , in full :  Dear President Cyril Ramaphosa ,  We commend you and your government for the bold and decisive public health measures that you have taken in response to the crisis precipitated by the Covid-19 pandemic .
We welcome measures to stem the spread of the virus .
We are writing to you to suggest other measures that are urgently required to support and stabilise the economy and assist those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , these public-health interventions will have significant adverse economic effects , compounding the persistence of inequalities in living conditions , wealth , income , and access to health and other services .
It is widely predicted that the virus will trigger a global recession , due to collapsing demand and the supply shocks this crisis will entail .
It is estimated that South Africa 's GDP could contract by between 1 .
and 7% , with devastating impacts on jobs and livelihoods .
This looming crisis requires large-scale economic interventions .
For example , the UK , France and the US have injected resources totalling 18 .
, 13 .
and 10 .
of GDP into their economies respectively .
To date , the measures announced by the South African government , although welcome , do not match the scale of the challenge .
In the face of this looming crisis , we believe more significant action is required .
To date , the measures announced by the South African government , although welcome , do not match the scale of the challenge .
In the face of this looming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These interventions must protect the most vulnerable .
This response is different from previous attempts to resuscitate ailing economies .
We must both acknowledge that physical distancing and a lockdown will slow economic activity , and that extraordinary measures are needed to cushion the resultant hardship and avoid long-term social and economic harm .
There is a significant risk that millions in poverty will fall into destitution ; millions more , currently in work , will be driven into poverty and become unable to meet their basic needs ; and thousands of businesses will be forced to close due to falling demand as a result of the lockdown , falling incomes and a contraction of economic activity .
The self-employed , atypically employed , informal workers and small businesses are particularly vulnerable , but none will be exempt from its effects .
Traditional social support networks will be disrupted .
The long-term impact on business capacity , and physical , financial , and human capital , could be devastating to our already ailing economy .
In any already deeply unequal society , we know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black women and children .
Economic interventions must therefore aim to :  support households and communities ;  protect workers ;  sustain businesses ;  strengthen public health interventions ; and  strengthen the economy .
While we appreciate efforts already undertaken in each of these areas , we are concerned that they are not comprehensive enough and are not being implemented sufficiently rapidly or on a large enough scale to prevent real hardship for millions of South Africans .
While we recognise that the stringent social isolation measures are unavoidable , we need to commit as a society to ensuring they do not cause unnecessary hardship to our people , and especially to the working poor and other vulnerable groups .
The following measures indicate the kinds of opportunities that are available .
Support households and communities  1 .
Income transfers to lower-income and affected households , in the form of a special Covid-19 grant , a top-up to existing grants , and/or a universal basic income grant .
Creativity is needed to speed up delivery , including income transfers via digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  2 .
Targeted , temporary and compulsory payment holidays from municipal taxes , rent and mortgages , and other debts owed , and a ban on evictions from houses , including on farms .
Undertake measures to relieve women of the burden of care in and outside the home - for example , by the provision of childcare for essential workers and additional income support .
Ensure food security and food sovereignty through a co-ordinated and safe rollout of food packages in food-stressed neighbourhoods , working with community groups to build collective action and solidarity .
Children require special attention .
Protect workers  1 .
Guarantee wage payments so that monthly wages of all workers are secured for the full duration of the lockdown ; the expansion in UIF payments is both welcome and critical in this regard .
Rigorous implementation of leave requirements so that workers are not forced to use annual leave during the furlough period , and ensuring temporary workers are sufficiently accommodated .
Extend unemployment benefits to casual and informal-economy workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income during periods of lockdown .
Ensure additional health and safety provisions are in place for essential workers and for when workers return to work .
Sustain businesses  1 .
Significantly expand access to low-rate emergency loans , including through low-cost liquidity provision by the Reserve Bank .
The current amount of funds available , and the voluntary nature of the " solidarity fund " , fall well short of the expected need .
Moreover , there is some evidence that the solidarity fund has diverted donors from other charities that play a vital role in supporting the most vulnerable .
Other forms of targeted and temporary tax relief if low-cost loans and payment holidays are insufficient .
Strengthen public health interventions  1 .
Increase the additional resources that are being directed to the health system , including for testing , treatment , medicines , community health care , and Covid-19 scientific research .
Strengthen the requirement for resources to be pooled between private and public health-care providers , particularly for free testing and treatment of Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attempts at the local production of critically needed health products , medicine and equipment .
Scale up efforts to ensure greater access to water and sanitation , through the provision of water access points , safe ablution facilities , and removing restrictions on homes with water meters .
The provision of soap and/or sanitiser is important .
Ensure free mobile data and public internet access , to keep the public informed and curb the spread of fake news .
Strengthen the economy  1 .
Monetary policy measures to guard against capital flight and manage the exchange rate , ensure access to affordable credit , and ensure sustainable government bond rates .
A " helicopter drop " of funds to households - for example , R1,000 for each individual for a period of four months - could complement the grants discussed above .
Reviewing the current medium-term expenditure framework which requires considerable budget cuts , including in wages and health care .
We appreciate the Temporary Employment Relief Scheme , which aims to prevent retrenchments while maintaining standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective scaling up of the scheme has proven difficult .
It is crucial that implementation be prioritised in the current crisis .
These measures will require additional government financing .
We appreciate the effort to mobilise funds outside the fiscus - such as the Industrial Development Corporation ( IDC ) , Public Investment Corporation ( PIC ) , Unemployment Insurance Fund ( UIF ) .
However , the scale of interventions required will necessitate additional fiscal and monetary expansion by the Treasury and Reserve Bank respectively , as has been the case worldwide .
A concrete plan for responsibly managing this must be tabled , a number of signatories are working on proposals in this regard .
addition , we support your call for global transfers and action on the international level .
Commitment , implementation and responsiveness remain a major challenge .
While swift action has been taken on health responses , economic interventions have been subject to delay , confusion and incoherence .
We need to accept that as with health policy , some risks will need to be taken in this unprecedented situation .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible the economic interventions should seek to empower communities , promote their mobilisation and build social solidarity , as has been noted by a wide number of civil society organisations .
The presidency must reassure the most vulnerable people and businesses that they will be protected .
This moment calls for all South Africans to contribute .
We are willing to support in advancing these shared objectives .
We would welcome the opportunity to put these proposals before yourself and the appropriate forums and provide additional technical support as needed .
