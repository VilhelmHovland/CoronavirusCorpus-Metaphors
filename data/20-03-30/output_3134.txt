The individual was initially believed to have been exposed at a St .
Patrick 's Day party in Lake Echo .
" Everybody in that event has been tested .
They 're now past their 14 day period and nobody has become sick , " Strang , the province 's chief medical officer of health , said at a news conference in Halifax Monday afternoon .
" We 've also talked to them about where they may have travelled and none of them had any travel history , so our only conclusion can be the individual who attended that event who has been known as the case of COVID-19 must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first identified case of community transmission should n't surprise anyone and he expects to see more .
To date , Nova Scotia has 5,054 negative test results and 127 confirmed cases after five new cases were identified on Sunday .
Strang said four out of the five new cases are travel-related or connected to a known case .
He estimated about a handful of cases are being investigated for community spread .
But with Nova Scotia being two or three weeks behind B .
, Ontario and Quebec 's COVID-19 outbreak , Strang said the province was able to put serious restrictions and measures into place , such as at long-term care facilities , into place .
Following the workers who tested positive for COVID-19 at the R .
MacDonald Nursing Home in Antigonish and private retirement living community in Dartmouth , all test results so far have come back negative .
Two residents and two staff members at the Magnolia long-term care home have tested positive .

" Unfortunately , we are seeing some firsts in Nova Scotia : Our first indication of community spread , the first indication of residents in a long-term care facility who have been infected , " Strang said .
" Again , these highlight the critical importance of all the public health orders and directives that people need to follow .
"  Continued closure of public schools  During Monday 's new conference , Premier Stephen McNeil sympathized with children who are n't able to see their friends at school or play at recess , but said they 're going to have to tough it out a little longer .

Grade 12 students on track to graduate will complete high school .
Students who are on track to move on to the next grade will do so , but those that need this term to graduate or move on " will not be left behind , " he said .
