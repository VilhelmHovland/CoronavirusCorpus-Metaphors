Praying to Saints &amp; Gods during a Pandemic  Posted Mar 31 , 2020 by Martin Armstrong  A German cathedral has its collection of remains of St .
Corona , the little-known Christian martyr who has been purported to be the patron saint of resisting epidemics .
Her name in Latin merely means " crown , " which was an indication that the young saint had achieved the " crown of eternal life " because of the steadfastness of her faith .
There is a connection with the coronaviruses , named because of their crown-like structure .
So the virus is not named after her and there is not really any connection that can be verified that she is the patron saint of epidemics .
One of the excursions I have made in traveling around the world was to a tiny ancient city of Epidaurus in ancient Greece on the Argolid Peninsula at the Saronic Gulf .
This is where people went to pray for their health .
They prayed to Asclepius who was pictured with a staff with a serpent entwined which became our medical symbol still today .
If you wanted to pray for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you went to the temple next door for his daughter , Hygena , whose name is the origin of good hygiene .
