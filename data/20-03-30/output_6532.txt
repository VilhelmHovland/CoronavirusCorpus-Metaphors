Striking Photos Show Empty Landmarks Around The World  Coronavirus has created a new normal , and it 's quieter and far less crowded .
With more than one-third of the world 's population hunkered down indoors , once-bustling international landmarks and attractions are now vacant .
The near-total absence of people has allowed for extraordinary photographs that show some of world 's most celebrated places as quiet shadows of their pre-COVID-19 existences .

But you can marvel at these eerie images as you practice social distancing .
