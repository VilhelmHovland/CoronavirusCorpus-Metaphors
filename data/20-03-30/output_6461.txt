ROME -- Pope Francis offered his daily morning Mass for those who find themselves living in fear of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world .
" Let us pray today for the many people who can not cope , who remain frightened by this pandemic .
May the Lord help them to stand up , to react for the good of all society and the entire community , " the pope said March 30 at the start of his livestreamed Mass .
In his homily , the pope reflected on the day 's first reading and Gospel , which recalled the stories of two women -- one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin -- who faced death sentences .
The first reading from the Book of Daniel , recounted the story of Susanna , a just woman falsely accused of adultery by two corrupt judges .
The Gospel reading from St .
John , however , recalled a woman caught in the act of adultery and sentenced to be stoned by the doctors of the law who " were not corrupt , but hypocrites , " the pope said .
" These women , one fell into the hands of hypocrites and the other into the hands of the corrupt ; there was no way out , " he said .
" The first explicitly trusts God and the Lord intervened .
The second , poor thing , knows that she is guilty , exposed before all the people .
The Gospel does n't say it , but surely she was praying inside , asking for some kind of help .
"  Nevertheless , the pope said that in both instances God intervened , and while he helped the hypocrites convert , he does not forgive the corrupt ones " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiveness .
"  Corrupt people " are sure of themselves , they destroy and continue to exploit people , " the pope said .
" They put themselves in the place of God .
"  Pope Francis said that like the witnesses in both cases , who were able to praise God and discover his mercy , Christians should also reflect on their own lives and how the Lord has intervened .
" Each one of us has our own story , our own sins .
And if you do n't remember them , think about it , you 'll find it .
Thank God if you find them because , if not , you are corrupt , " the pope said .
" Let us look to the Lord who does justice but is also very merciful .
Let us not be ashamed of being in the church ; let us be ashamed of being sinners .
