Trump Said He Was the President of Manufacturing .
Then Disaster Struck .
For a leader who has embraced the language of a wartime president , it is as if the Pentagon asked for missiles and bombers but would n't say how many or where they should be delivered .

He has made a habit of touring factory floors and promising a prosperous new era for manufacturing .
Erin Schaff/The New York Times  When President Trump came to office , he promised a new day with America 's manufacturers , casting himself as the first president who understood their needs .
He toured factory floors , often handing out his signature " Make America Great Again " hats .
Yet in the first national crisis that required harnessing American manufacturing ingenuity and ramping up production of ventilators , perhaps the most crucial piece of equipment for patients in crisis , the White House 's ability to gather the power of American industry crumpled .
It was unable to communicate how many ventilators it would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set states off on a mad scramble to find their own , leading to bidding wars against one another .
Even today it is unclear who is deciding where the new American production will be directed -- to the highest bidders or to the cities that need them most .
A week after praising General Motors and a small ventilator manufacturer , Ventec Life Systems , for their voluntary efforts to combine cutting-edge technology with G .
's expertise at supply chains and mass production , the president blew up at thelargest carmaker in America , accusing its chief executive , Mary T .
Barra , of moving too slowly and trying to " rip off " the federal government .
In fact , G .
and Ventec had already signed a partnership -- without government help -- to ramp up production .
Interviews with White House officials , industry executives and outsiders who tried to intervene make two problems clear .
Trump 's first mistake was recognizing the problem far too late , even though his own medical experts had identified a probable shortage of ventilators as a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus was headed to the United States .
Had the president acted sooner , thousands of new ventilators would probably be coming off production lines next month , when they are likely to be desperately needed .
And even after the problem was recognized , and the president 's son-in-law and senior adviser , Jared Kushner , took over the process , both the White House and the Federal Emergency Management Agency struggled to define what was needed , who would pay for it and how to solve the problem of supply chains that stretched across more than a dozen countries .
" We 're going to have plenty , " Mr .
Trump said Friday afternoon , declaring that he was invoking the Defense Production Act , a Korean War-era law , to force the companies to make more .
But he gave no numbers -- and glided past the complexities of getting between 700 and 1,500 components from more than a dozen nations .
" It 's terrific that the administration is now beginning to use the D .
, " said Joshua Gotbaum , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the Defense Production Act .
" Had they started two months ago , we would already have ventilators , masks and other critical equipment in mass production .
"  " It is one thing to know that there should be a central national effort , " Mr .
Gotbaum added .
" It is quite another to accept the responsibility for the shortcomings and mistakes that will inevitably occur with it .
"  " If we do n't flatten the curve , we 're on a trajectory currently to exceed our capacity in the New Orleans area for ventilators by about April the 4th , and all beds available in hospitals by about April the 10th , " Gov .
John Bel Edwards , Democrat of Louisiana , said Sunday on " Meet the Press on NBC .
" So we 're doing everything we can to surge capacity .
It 's very difficult .
"  Industry executives made the point that while the Defense Production Act enabled the White House to create the illusion of decisive executive action , it did not solve the nuts-and-bolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production lines where few exist .
That is the problem G .
and Ventec , and other companies involved in the effort like Ford and Medtronic , are facing -- often seeking parts from the same suppliers .
" We are moving full steam ahead on ventilators because they know there is an immediate need for increased production , " said Chris Brooks , Ventec 's chief strategy officer , even if it is still unclear whether the customers are hospitals , states or the Federal Emergency Management Agency , which the White House has delegated to take charge of the effort .
Trump came to this crisis belatedly , but once he did he has tried to portray himself as a wartime president , one who is making use of all of America 's talents to fight an invisible but devastating enemy .
And in that regard , the best analogy may be Franklin D .
Roosevelt 's " arsenal of democracy , " the phrase he used in a Dec .
29 , 1940 , fireside chat , as he tried to get American industry to support Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States into the war .
But in this case , Mr .
Trump sought the language of wartime action without the responsibility for making it happen .
He welcomed voluntary efforts that were already underway , as manufacturers like Medtronic and the Dutch manufacturing giant Philips promised to ramp up production .
The problem was that it was uncoordinated -- as if the Pentagon had announced it needed more missiles , more artillery shells and more nuclear weapons but left unclear how many or where they should be delivered .
That was the situation Mr .
Kushner found when he entered the effort , at the request of Vice President Mike Pence .
He moved the authority to deal with the issue from the Department of Health and Human Services to FEMA , saying that the latter agency knew how to act in a " battle rhythm .
" But still , no one knew how many ventilators were already in the market , where they would be needed first or how many more companies could be expected to make .
And it was complicated by the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ireland , Switzerland and , of course , China .
Along came G .
and Ventec , a partnership Mr .
Trump celebrated in a tweet a week ago .
But all week the details languished .
Early hopes that the company could produce 20,000 ventilators quickly began to fade ; in the first few weeks , the figure was more like 5,000 .
And that production would not begin until late April , if everything went perfectly .
Still , a small group of White House officials briefed on the discussion anticipated that it would go ahead , a welcome announcement after weeks of headlines about the administration 's halting response to the spread of the coronavirus .
One administration official said that Mr .
Trump had not been briefed on the details of the G .
deal , and that he was caught by surprise when he read a New York Times article about how the announcement was being held up while FEMA examined competing offers .
Instead of focusing on why the deal had been abruptly stopped , officials said , the president was enraged about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcontractor -- trying to get money upfront from the government to fund suppliers .
And aides told him that the company 's estimates of how many ventilators could be made in a relatively short period of time had shifted when G .
officials were pressed .
So the president posted a series of tweets denouncing the company and its chief executive , urging them to build ventilators at a Lordstown , Ohio , plant that had been closed .
sold the plant last year and will be making ventilators in Kokomo , Ind .
, an electronics plant that has the clean rooms needed for manufacturing medical parts .
)  Mr .
Trump decided to go ahead and compel G .
to manufacture the ventilators , but far fewer than the original deal envisioned .
His attitude , officials said , was that since reporters had been pushing him on deploying the Defense Production Act , he would give them what they wanted -- without giving G .
the full deal .
And then he named other firms that would also be tapped by FEMA .
But by the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production targets were or even if FEMA had issued any contracts .
The companies did not know if Washington would take responsibility for distributing the ventilators .
In the Rose Garden on Sunday afternoon , Mr .
Trump for the first time began to acknowledge the complexity of the undertaking American industry was just now beginning .
" They are very complex , " he said of the machines .
" You know , this is like building a car .
"  Answers to Your Frequently Asked Questions  Updated March 24 , 2020  How does coronavirus spread ?  It seems to spread very easily from person to person , especially in homes , hospitals and other confined spaces .
The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out .
It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face .
What makes this outbreak so different ?  Unlike the flu , there is no known treatment or vaccine , and little is known about this particular virus so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the numbers are still uncertain .
And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard .
What should I do if I feel sick ?  If you 've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have , and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing , call a doctor .
They should give you advice on whether you should be tested , how to get tested , and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others .
What if somebody in my family gets sick ?  If the family member does n't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home , you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms , while also keeping as much distance as possible , according to guidelines issued by the C .
If there 's space , the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom .
If masks are available , both the sick person and the caregiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters , doorknobs , toilets and tables .
Do n't forget to wash your hands frequently .
Should I wear a mask ?  Experts are divided on how much protection a regular surgical mask , or even a scarf , can provide for people who are n't yet sick .
The W .
and C .
say that unless you 're already sick , or caring for someone who is , wearing a face mask is n't necessary .
And stockpiling high-grade N95 masks will make it harder for nurses and other workers to access the resources they need .
But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic .
And a few experts say that masks could offer some protection in crowded places where it is not possible to stay 6 feet away from other people .
Masks do n't replace hand-washing and social distancing .
Should I stock up on groceries ?  Plan two weeks of meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies .
Despite the empty shelves , the supply chain remains strong .
And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home .
Should I pull my money from the markets ?  That 's not a good idea .
Even if you 're retired , having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation , or even grows , makes sense .
But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year 's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years .
