, March 29 , 2020  ( photo credit : REUTERS )  The East Meadow lawn in New York 's Central Park is to be the new location of an emergency field hospital intended to house coronavirus patients , according to local media reports .
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the 68-bed field hospital complete with 10 intensive care units , each fitted with its own ventilator , will be up and running by Tuesday .
The field hospital will serve solely as a special respiratory care unit in order to combat the influx of coronavirus patients currently filling up hospitals .
The assembly of the hospital is being carried by New York 's Mount Sinai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization presided over by Franklin Graham , son of prominent Evangelist Billy Graham .
Samaritan 's Purse constructed similar special field respiratory units in Italy earlier this month .
The city of New York provided the project with emergency construction permits as New York state on Sunday reported nearly 60,000 cases and a total of 965 deaths , up 237 in the past 24 hours .
The number of hospitalized patients was slowing , however , Governor Andrew Cuomo said .
However , even with the new emergency field hospital , New York City will need hundreds more ventilators in a few days and more masks , gowns and other supplies by April 5 , de Blasio told CNN .
Reuters has documented shortages of vital protective equipment in hospitals in hard-hit New York , where healthcare workers are hiding supplies such as face masks from colleagues in other departments .

" We are scared .
We 're trying to fight for everyone else 's life , but we also fight for our lives as well .
"  The strict stay-at-home rules meant that usually bustling New York , like many major cities in the United States , was largely quiet on Sunday except for the sound of ambulance sirens .
