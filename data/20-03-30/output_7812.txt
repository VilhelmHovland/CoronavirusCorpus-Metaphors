Cinema Coronavirus : Will self-isolation change the way people watch movies ?  At least for a while , the coronavirus has the world hunkered down at home .
" Social distancing " creates a lot of time to fill and worries to escape from .
We 're already seeing dramatic upticks in things people do at home , like watching TV and gaming .
But there is also evidence it may trigger lasting changes in how people consume entertainment they usually get *outside* the home , like movies .
This week we learned that Universal will shorten the theatrical window for movies like " Emma " and " The Hunt " ( in theaters now ) , and skip it completely for the release of " Troll 's World Tour " next month .
How will consumers react ?  In June 2019 , we asked consumers if they 'd pay to stream popular movies at the same time that they are available in theaters .
A lot were interested :  Many are willing to pay to see theatrical releases at home : 29% of all respondents said they would definitely or probably pay ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay a lot : a quarter of all respondents , and more than a third of younger viewers , would consider paying as much as fifty dollars  This is how people felt when movie theaters were still open .
It seems reasonable to suspect that with the prospect of hours to fill at home , and with so many of the outlets for their disposable cash closed indefinitely , people 's interest is even higher now .
In the immediate future , direct-to-streaming may be a way for studios to stay engaged with consumers and defray some of its losses at the box office .
But we wo n't be cooped up forever .
The real question is whether consumers will form new habits in the meantime -- with the implicit help of the studios -- that change the value proposition of going to the movies when theaters reopen .
