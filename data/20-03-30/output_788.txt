There 's a pandemic and people are dying and what if I get sick and my grandma dies and I lose my job and I start hating my kids and I run out of toilet paper and the economy tanks and I never see my friends and the hospitals shut down and this all goes on for months ?  Clients sitting across from therapists -- or now , looking at them through a computer or phone screen -- are asking these questions and more as they navigate a health crisis that 's reached every corner of society and has no end date .
Couples ca n't get a break from one another .
Parents have new roles as home-school providers .
Seniors find themselves falling into greater isolation .
It 's an unprecedented time for therapists , too , as they and their clients experience something never seen in most people 's lifetimes .
As one Seattle-area therapist said , providers " do n't get training in Pandemic 101 .
"  " This is new for all of us , " said Nathaniel Amos , another therapist with clients in Seattle and Burien .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions , it 's also changed how therapist and client communicate , with laptops on tables replacing therapy couches .
Amid a stay-at-home order and social distancing directive , many mental health services have moved to telehealth , in the form of video chats that come with their own set of pros and cons .
Clients describe a changing form of anxiety related to the outbreak .
Michael Archer , a psychologist at Eastside Psychological Associates , explains the difference by comparing the pandemic with an earthquake .
It 's easier , psychologically , to accept that an earthquake is coming , and that it could shake the region tomorrow , or in 100 years .
The pandemic is more like an asteroid , Archer said , that everyone knows is hurtling toward Earth .
Advertising  " That asteroid we have identified , in four weeks , will hit us , and there 's nothing we can do about it , " said Archer , who is also the director of clinical training at Fairfax Behavioral Health .
" That kind of anxiety is different .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seattle-area therapists say , is acknowledging to clients that this is horrible for everyone , to varying degrees .
A pandemic and lockdown are not what most people planned on or thought about .
And with that , reassuring patients they 're not overreacting .
" You need to validate that this is a big deal and it 's not going away , " Archer said .
" People do n't want to be perceived as overreacting .
"  Clients come in with fears about the worldwide outbreak , listing off the newest stats they saw on Facebook just minutes ago and recounting what they read on Twitter about the deaths in Italy .
With an overwhelming amount of information , the brain senses danger , producing stress hormones that never give the body reprieve .
So what are therapists to do when faced with clients ' anxiety about the pandemic ? Focus on what the client can do that day .
Advertising  " People are understandably focused on too much of the big picture , " said Kira Mauseth , a psychology senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really trying to emphasize is concentric circles of care .
Focus on yourself and family , then neighbors , then community .
Reach out only in those circles , because that 's what you have the energy and bandwidth for .
It allows you to focus on what you can control .
Anxiety is the lack of control .
"  With other news events that have round-the-clock updates -- say , a presidential election -- therapists might recommend significantly curbing consumption to help with information overload .
They ca n't do the same with a pandemic , where orders from leaders and recommendations from health officials affect day-to-day life and change rapidly .
Jaya Ramesh reminds her clients they do n't need to consume news all the time .
Ramesh is a counselor with Catalyst Counseling in Woodinville , where she works with individuals and couples .
" How do we let go of this shock to the system ? How do we practice a media diet ? These are conversations we are having across the board , " Ramesh said .
" I 've talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to pause how much information you are taking so your body does n't always feel like it 's in danger ? Go for a walk , dance it out , do something .
' "  Seeing images that are familiar but changed -- like an empty Pike Place Market -- contributes to anxiousness for those who live or are connected to the region .
It was hard for Molly Sanderson , who grew up in Seattle and is a sophomore at Amherst College , to see news footage of abandoned Seattle landmarks , and then photos of parks filled with people not adhering to social distancing recommendations .
" It 's frustrating because I know that 's happening and friends , and would like to be with my family right now but know that 's not the right thing to do , " she said .
" That 's the hardest part .
"  Isolation can be an accelerant for people with mental health disorders or other conditions .
Therapists have emphasized trying to maintain connections , even if it 's just a single phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience of the people she met during her trips to Haiti , where she trained earthquake survivors , and Jordan , where she worked with Syrian refugees .
" People want to be heard , feel supported and be listened to , " Mauseth said .
" Resilience is made up of flexibility , connection and purpose .
You have to be connected to someone who is n't you .
"  Other therapists have found similar factors in how their clients are coping with the pandemic .
The first is whether someone 's normal coping strategies have been disrupted , or if they 've remained intact .
" The introverts are saying ' are you telling me it 's now socially sanctioned to stay home and talk to my cat ? This is doable , ' " Catalyst Counseling owner Katherine Walter said .
" The extroverts are hurting .
"  Perception of threats , to health , finances or something else also play a significant role .
Stress is generally lower among those who feel relatively safe because they 're isolating or generally healthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter 's clients are seniors and those with chronic illnesses , so stress is high .
Advertising  The last is purpose and structure -- either too little or too much .
" For some people , COVID-19 hits and it 's a complete lack of structure and perhaps work has been interrupted , " Walter said .
" On the other end of the spectrum , it might be simultaneously home-schooling children and working from home and it 's too much purpose , too much structure , completely overwhelming .
Folks who hit that happy medium are doing quite well .
"  Therapy by video  Megan Brodsky , 23 , has seen the same therapist since she was in the third grade .
But last week was the first of what likely will be a regular routine of speaking to her through video .
" I was surprised that the talking portion of it was n't that bad , " said Brodsky , who is working from her Burien home .
" I much prefer in person , but because I 've been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting used to that form of communication .
"  Mental health service providers are considered essential workers , which means they can continue to operate amid Gov .
Jay Inslee 's stay-at-home order .
But officials for large organizations like the American Psychological Association say therapists can , and often should , work remotely .
" It is critically important that psychologists are able to meet the needs of their patients and communities during this difficult time , without further increasing the risk of contagion , " Arthur C .
Evans Jr .
, APA 's chief executive officer , said in a media release calling on states and insurers to move quickly in allowing clients and providers access to telehealth .
Advertising  Some insurance companies bill the same amount for a telehealth session as an in-office session , but nationally that varies depending on the insurance company , provider and type of session .
A telehealth session must have a video component , for example , and a phone call is billed differently .
Virtual sessions allow provider and client to continue their sessions without an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to speak in their own home .
But for others , video takes away the intimate setting of a small office that 's considered a safe space .
For that reason , Amos was still seeing a few patients in his office before Inslee 's order but planned to move to telehealth once the directive was issued .
" To give a blanket directive , while useful for containing something that is deadly , radically misunderstands that home is not a safe place for all of us , " Amos said .
Some clients may be more inclined to share more during a video session because they feel there 's distance between the client and therapist , which feels safer .
But therapists often rely on body language , which is harder to ascertain in a video chat .
For couples , the dynamic changes when they 're on one side of the screen and the therapist is on the other .
Ramesh likes to ask couples to turn toward each other and speak and track their body language  Advertising  " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be lost , " Ramesh said .
" It 's an interesting time , because we 're so distanced from so many people but so close to the person we have chosen to partner with .
It will highlight the patterns that are entrenched more starkly than ever .
"  As those patterns are highlighted , the therapists are aware the outbreak will be brought up in sessions even after people are allowed to return to work and businesses reopen .
" Talks about the pandemic will take up the majority of our time , if not all , " Brodsky said .
" There are so many facets that this has affected me and my life .
It will come up in different conversations , but will all relate to coronavirus .
