Coronavirus Kent : Waitrose banning couples and family members from shopping together at supermarket  Couples and families have been banned from shopping together at Waitrose as the supermarket ups its efforts against coronavirus .
The upmarket retailer , which has more than a dozen stores across Kent , says only one member of any household is permitted to enter the supermarket to buy essentials .
Families should only send one person per household to Waitrose  The move is in a bid to crackdown on crowds in aisles and at the checkouts .
Queueing two metres apart outside supermarkets has become the norm across the UK , but other retailers are currently not enforcing stringent limits on couples .
Waitrose does however realise that not everyone will be able to adhere to the ruling .
A spokesman said : " In line with the government 's guidance on social distancing we 're asking customers to help us manage the number of people in our shops - by sending only one member of the household to do their shopping , if they possibly can .
" While this wo n't be possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' support in this difficult situation .
"  It 's hoped aisles will be quieter as a result  To protect staff from " infected moisture droplets " , new checkout screens have been ordered , and , where two checkouts are back to back , one will close .
Meanwhile , Gibsons farm shop in Wingham has also introduced the same rule of ' one shopper per household ' .
