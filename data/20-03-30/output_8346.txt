Patty Tomasetti , an interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person .
Although Tomasetti does n't sew , she is recruiting people who do in order to make 220 masks for staff members at the Wilton Meadows rehabilitation and nursing center in Wilton .
At this time , personal protective equipment , such as surgical masks , are in limited supply , so the fabric masks Tomasetti is collecting are designed to fit over surgical masks , allowing them to be used more than once to extend their useful life .
Tomasetti said she was asked by her friend , Robynne Quinn , a social worker at Wilton Meadows , if she would be willing to help collect homemade masks because the facility was running low on surgical masks .
" We are trying to do whatever we can , but we ca n't do much .
What can we do ? I have a lot of connections in the Wilton community , so I figured I could do this , " she said .
A friend of Tomasetti 's , who is down in Florida , recently shipped her 20 masks .
Tomasetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 220 goal and is reaching out to the community for help .
" I have a pattern for the masks , so people can see how they are made .
I have some fabric , but it 's limited .
It would help if people had their own fabric , " she said .
The best fabric to use for the masks is tightly woven , 100-percent cotton from things like denim , bed sheets , and heavyweight shirts .
Knit fabrics are not good because they create holes when they are stretched .
Tomasetti is collecting the homemade masks in a bin in front of the office , Tomasetti Architects , 27 Cricket Lane , which is across from Wilton Town Hall .
If she exceeds the 220 masks that Wilton Meadows needs , she will distribute the others to Norwalk Hospital or another medical facility that can use them .
She said she will gladly pick up masks from seniors who can not leave their homes .
