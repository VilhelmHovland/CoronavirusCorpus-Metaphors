The equity sell-off amid the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has been remarkable for its speed and severity , with all sectors negatively impacted .
But as in previous downturns , healthcare is showing some resilience .
For example in the US , the S&amp;P 500 Index was down 32% from its February peak , while the S&amp;P 500 Health Care sector declined only 24% , as at 20 March 2020 .
Conventional wisdom says healthcare stocks tend to act more defensively during an economic contraction , as individuals continue to seek and/or need medical care .
This time , it is not a steady stream of surgeries or doctor 's visits that are helping prop up healthcare companies .
On the contrary , social distancing and preparations for a surge of coronavirus patients have sidelined many of these routine activities .
Rather , investors are rewarding those companies using innovation to aggressively develop vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 , while firms helping to facilitate remote medical care are also gaining favour .
Investor focus on these trends has accelerated due to the crisis but could last long after the pandemic ends , in our view  Healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S&amp;P 500 Index and S&amp;P 500 sub-sector indices daily data from 19 February 2020 to 20 March 2020 .
Past performance is not a guide to future performance .
Using new technology to repurpose old drugs  The scramble to develop treatments for SARS-CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 , has been remarkable for both its speed and global scale .
So far , dozens of companies , scientific groups and institutions in the US , Europe , China and Japan have announced efforts to address the novel coronavirus .
One approach is to identify whether existing drugs could be effective against COVID-19 .
One candidate gathering significant attention is hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , a generic compound used since the 1940s for malaria .
In a small clinical study in France , HCQ significantly shortened the course of the disease in coronavirus patients who received the drug .
China and South Korea have also included HCQ in their COVID-19 treatment guidelines .
Clinical trials are now underway to see whether the drug can deliver results consistently and safely .
If the data are borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the death rate for patients with severe cases , eliminate the virus more rapidly ( and reduce its spread ) and potentially work as a preventative agent for high-risk populations , such as doctors on the front lines .
Clinical trials are also underway for select antiviral drugs .
One , Remdesivir , was originally developed by US biotechnology firm Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola .
So far , a handful of compassionate-use cases have delivered promising results , with larger clinical trials expected to report in April .
Favipiravir , an influenza drug developed by FUJIFILM Toyama Chemical in Japan , showed an improvement in virus clearance during clinical trials -- though results were most meaningful if the drug was administered soon after the onset of symptoms ( data from trials using an existing HIV therapy , which showed no material improvement for severely sick coronavirus patients , also suggest that timing could be critical ) .
Vaccine development accelerates  Meanwhile , the hunt for a vaccine is advancing at a breakneck pace .
In February , US biotechnology firm Moderna announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for testing .
The compound was developed in record time -- six weeks -- using the firm 's messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) technology platform , which directs a cell 's mRNA to produce disease-fighting proteins .
Germany-based BioNTech is also pursuing a similar mRNA-based strategy in partnership with Pfizer .
Meanwhile , several other biopharmaceuticals are quickly advancing vaccine research and/or initiating clinical trials .
It is important to remember that should a drug or vaccine get regulatory approval , the impact to a firm 's bottom line will depend on several factors , including the persistence of COVID-19 .
Will the virus fade away , as SARS did , or will it recur each year like the flu ? The influenza virus has two key proteins on its cell surface that tend to re-assort each year , making it difficult for our immune systems to fully recognise them , resulting in annual outbreaks .
In contrast , the coronavirus has one key surface protein and , so far , has not mutated meaningfully .
For this reason , we believe the coronavirus is more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain sceptical of the rapid surge that some biotechnology stocks have experienced lately on news that they are pursuing the virus .
Longer term , however , the COVID-19 crisis could help bring attention to innovative drug platforms , which , in our view , could amplify investor interest in these areas .
Telemedicine shines  Meanwhile , telemedicine services are taking off .
Both government and insurers are encouraging the technology 's use as an efficient and safe means to treat influenza and potential COVID-19 infections , easing the burden on the healthcare system .
To that end , the Trump administration recently announced that Medicare would cover the cost of telemedicine services for the duration of the COVID-19 national emergency declaration .
Similarly , health insurers are offering zero-dollar co-payments for telehealth visits whereby beneficiaries do not have to pay any of the upfront cost for treatment .
These steps should help drive up the number of telemedicine users and could change how consumers and insurers approach telehealth in the long term .
Headwinds remain  As encouraging as these advances are , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , human clinical testing can not be rushed .
A vaccine must be tested in thousands of patients to prove that it can be safe and effective for potentially millions of patients .
Thus , it is likely that we will not have a vaccine for the general population for at least 12 to 18 months .
Meanwhile , the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is rising rapidly , with strict social distancing and aggressive testing the best near-term solutions to slow the spread of infection .
The US has conducted nearly 290,000 diagnostic tests , but we think this is still inadequate .
In our opinion , we need to be testing the population widely for surveillance ( not just highly symptomatic patients ) , and we need faster response times -- most exposed patients are still waiting days for results .
A rapid-response test developed by Danaher-owned Cepheid , which can deliver a diagnosis at the point of care in 45 minutes , was recently approved and this should help .
Social distancing , for its part , is having significant economic ramifications , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Although somewhat resilient , healthcare companies will not be completely spared .
For example , elective procedures are increasingly being cancelled , weighing on the bottom lines of hospitals and medical technology companies .
For biopharmaceutical companies , new drug launches will be slowed as sales reps can not make direct contact with physicians .
Finally , steps to curtail the spread of the virus could have a near-term impact on clinical trial enrolment and delay some drug approvals .
In other words , we think investors should expect continued volatility in the coming months .
However , we believe the rapid pullback of equity prices has created some compelling opportunities .
Longer term , we feel that the sector 's unprecedented innovation addressing unmet medical needs will lead to attractive growth -- a point we think is now being driven home by the global race for a coronavirus cure .
