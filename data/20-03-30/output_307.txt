Cleared by Mass Dept of Health .
Thanks for everyone 's thoughts and prayers and I 'm doing the same for everyone that 's been effected by this .
Stay safe and stay together- apart ! Much love ! "  Smart recently joined Chris Cuomo on CNN to discuss his diagnosis , which he said surprised him because he was asymptomatic .
" For me , it was like a surprise , " he said .
" I feel fine .
I do n't have any symptoms , have n't had any symptoms .
For me when they told me I had it I was like , oh , wow .
It definitely really makes you alert to what 's going on .
"  The worldwide pandemic has caused the NBA to shut down with no real target for restarting in sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asymptomatic and not show symptoms it 's really hard for anyone to know they have the virus , " Smart said .
" You can spread the virus around without even knowing it .
That 's the biggest key because you ca n't tell just by looking at someone whether they have it or not because they can still look healthy and normal and still have it and spread it and that 's when we have the problem that we have .
"  Smart has been in constant contact with the team , and in a Friday conference call with the media , Coach Brad Stevens said Smart has been his usual self .
" Joking as always , " Stevens said .
" We had a Zoom conference with the team , told the team we were going to give them their own space to hang out and have fun .
And he told us to get off .
So he 's great .
