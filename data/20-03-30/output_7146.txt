Slowly but surely , access to coronavirus testing in the state of Illinois is becoming more readily available , but there are still some limits on who can receive the tests .
In suburban Norridge , a COVID-19 testing facility has been opened to serve first responders and health care workers , but now those individuals age 60 and older who are showing symptoms of the virus can also be tested .
The process itself is simple enough , with a nasal swab being used to conduct the test , but wait times can be long , and the facility is limited to 250 tests per day .
The Illinois National Guard is helping to conduct the tests .
" You 'll be directed by local law enforcement , and you 'll have some paperwork you 'll have to fill out , " Major A .
Ruggieri said .
" All of our soldiers are in protective gear , and they will give you directions .
They may have you keep your window rolled up , or may ask you to crack it open so they can hear what you 're saying .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state to help conduct more coronavirus tests in the days and weeks to come .
While Governor J .
Pritzker says that the state is conducting roughly 4,000 tests a day , a massive increase from the beginning of the pandemic , his goal is to ratchet that up to at least 10,000 tests per day in coming weeks .
To that end , the governor recruited north suburban-based Abbot Labs , who is developing a newer , quicker coronavirus test .
First responders are grateful for the increased access to testing , saying it 's helping give them peace of mind amidst the crisis .
" We are serving the community , but we have families as well , " CPD Sgt .
Anthony Varchetto said .
" There is a concern that after your tour of duty that ( you 're ) bringing that home to your family .
