The US tried to build a new fleet of ventilators .
The mission failed .
Thirteen years ago , a group of U .
public health officials came up with a plan to address what they regarded as one of the medical system 's crucial vulnerabilities : a shortage of ventilators .
The breathing-assistance machines tended to be bulky , expensive and limited in number .
The plan was to build a large fleet of inexpensive portable devices to deploy in a flu pandemic or another crisis .
Advertisement  Money was budgeted .
A federal contract was signed .
Work got underway .
And then things suddenly veered off course .
A multibillion-dollar maker of medical devices bought the small California company that had been hired to design the new machines .
The project ultimately produced zero ventilators .
That failure delayed the development of an affordable ventilator by at least half a decade , depriving hospitals , states and the federal government of the ability to stock up .
The federal government started over in 2014 with another company , whose ventilator was approved only last year and whose products have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ravaging the U .
health care system , the nation 's emergency response stockpile is still waiting on its first shipment .
The scarcity of ventilators has become an emergency , forcing doctors to make life-or-death decisions about who gets to breathe and who does not .
The stalled efforts to create a new class of cheap , easy-to-use ventilators highlight the perils of outsourcing projects with critical public health implications to private companies ; their focus on maximizing profits is not always consistent with the government 's goal of preparing for a future crisis .
" We definitely saw the problem , " said Dr .
Thomas Frieden , who ran the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017 .
" We innovated to try and get a solution .
We made really good progress , but it does n't appear to have resulted in the volume that we needed .
"  The project -- code-named Aura -- came in the wake of a parade of near-miss pandemics : SARS , MERS , bird flu and swine flu .
Federal officials decided to reevaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered vaccines , antiviral drugs , protective gear and ventilators , the last line of defense for patients suffering respiratory failure .
The federal government 's Strategic National Stockpile had full-service ventilators in its warehouses , but not in the quantities that would be needed to combat a major pandemic .
Advertisement  In 2006 , the Department of Health and Human Services established a new division , the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , with a mandate to prepare medical responses to chemical , biological and nuclear attacks as well as infectious diseases .
In its first year in operation , the research agency considered how to expand the number of ventilators .
It estimated that an additional 70,000 machines would be required in a moderate influenza pandemic .
The ventilators in the national stockpile were not ideal .
In addition to being big and expensive , they required a lot of training to use .
The research agency convened a panel of experts in November 2007 to devise a set of requirements for a new generation of mobile , easy-to-use ventilators .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in designing and building the ventilators .
The goal was for the machines to be approved by regulators for mass development by 2010 or 2011 , according to budget documents that the Department of Health and Human Services submitted to Congress in 2008 .
After that , the government would buy as many as 40,000 new ventilators and add them to the national stockpile .
The ventilators were to cost less than $3,000 each .
The lower the price , the more machines the government would be able to buy .
Advertisement  Companies submitted bids for the Project Aura job .
The research agency opted not to go with a large , established device-maker .
Instead it chose Newport Medical Instruments , a small outfit in Costa Mesa , California .
Newport , which was owned by a Japanese medical device company , only made ventilators .
Being a small , nimble company , Newport executives said , would help it efficiently fulfill the government 's needs .
Ventilators at the time typically went for about $10,000 each , and getting the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives bet they would be able to make up for any losses by selling the ventilators around the world .
" It would be very prestigious to be recognized as a supplier to the federal government , " said Richard Crawford , who was Newport 's head of research and development at the time .
" We thought the international market would be strong , and there is where Newport would have a good profit on the product .
"  Federal officials were pleased .
In addition to replenishing the national stockpile , " we also thought they 'd be so attractive that the commercial market would want to buy them , too , " said Nicole Lurie , who was then the assistant secretary for preparedness and response inside the Department of Health and Human Services .
With luck , the new generation of ventilators would become ubiquitous , helping hospitals nationwide better prepare for a crisis .
The contract was officially awarded a few months after the H1N1 outbreak , which the CDC estimated infected 60 million and killed 12,000 in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for Newport to receive $6 .
million upfront , with the expectation that the government would pay millions more as it bought thousands of machines to fortify the stockpile .
Project Aura was Newport 's first job for the federal government .
Things moved quickly and smoothly , employees and federal officials said in interviews .
Every three months , officials with the biomedical research agency would visit Newport 's headquarters .
Crawford submitted monthly reports detailing the company 's spending and progress .
The federal officials " would check everything , " he said .
" If we said we were buying equipment , they would want to know what it was used for .
There were scheduled visits , scheduled requirements and deliverables each month .
"  In 2011 , Newport shipped three working prototypes from the company 's California plant to Washington for federal officials to review .
Frieden , who ran the CDC at the time , got a demonstration in a small conference room attached to his office .
" I got all excited , " he said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that was going to be really useful .
"  In April 2012 , a senior Health and Human Services official testified before Congress that the program was " on schedule to file for market approval in September 2013 .
" After that , the machines would go into production .
Then everything changed .
The medical device industry was undergoing rapid consolidation , with one company after another merging with or acquiring other makers .
Manufacturers wanted to pitch themselves as one-stop shops for hospitals , which were getting bigger , and that meant offering a broader suite of products .
In May 2012 , Covidien , a large medical device manufacturer , agreed to buy Newport for just over $100 million .
Advertisement  Covidien -- a publicly traded company with sales of $12 billion that year -- already sold traditional ventilators , but that was only a small part of its multifaceted businesses .
In 2012 alone , Covidien bought five other medical device companies in addition to Newport .
Newport executives and government officials working on the ventilator contract said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexpensive portable ventilators no longer seemed like a top priority .
Newport applied in June 2012 for clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market the device , but two former federal officials said Covidien had demanded additional funding and a higher sales price for the ventilators .
The government gave the company an additional $1 .
million , a drop in the bucket for a company of Covidien 's size .
Government officials and executives at rival ventilator companies said they suspected that Covidien had acquired Newport to prevent it from building a cheaper product that would undermine Covidien 's profits from its existing ventilator business .
Some Newport executives who worked on the project were reassigned to other roles .
Others decided to leave the company .
" Up until the time the company sold , I was really happy and excited about the project , " said Hong-Lin Du , Newport 's president at the time of its sale .
" Then I was assigned to a different job .
"  In 2014 , with no ventilators having been delivered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency that they wanted to get out of the contract , according to three former federal officials .
The executives complained that it was not sufficiently profitable for the company .
The government agreed to cancel the contract .
The world was focused at the time on the Ebola outbreak in West Africa .
The research agency started over , awarding a new contract for $13 .
million to the giant Dutch company Philips .
In 2015 , Covidien was sold for $50 billion to another huge medical device company , Medtronic .
Charles Dockendorff , Covidien 's former chief financial officer , said he did not know why the contract had fallen apart .
" I am not aware of that issue , " he said in a text message .
Robert White , president of the minimally invasive therapies group at Medtronic who worked at Covidien during the Newport acquisition , initially said he had no recollection of the Project Aura contract .
A Medtronic spokeswoman later said that White was under the impression that the contract had been winding down before Covidien bought Newport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get updates on the coronavirus pandemic and other news as it happens with our breaking email alerts  In a statement Sunday night , after the article was published , Medtronic said , " The prototype ventilator , developed by Newport Medical , would not have been able to meet the specifications required by the government , nor at the price required .
" Medtronic said that one problem was that the machine was not going to be usable with newborns .
It was n't until July 2019 that the FDA signed off on the new Philips ventilator , the Trilogy Evo .
The government ordered 10,000 units in December , setting a delivery date in mid-2020 .
As the extent of the spread of the new coronavirus in the United States became clear , Dr .
Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , revealed March 15 that the stockpile had 12,700 ventilators ready to deploy .
The government has since sped up maintenance to increase the number available to 16,660 -- still fewer than one-quarter of what officials years earlier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Last week , the Health and Human Services Department contacted ventilator-makers to see how soon they could produce thousands of machines .
And it began pressing Philips to speed up its planned shipments .
The stockpile is " still awaiting delivery of the Trilogy Evo , " a Health and Human Services spokeswoman said .
" We do not currently have any in inventory , though we are expecting them soon .
