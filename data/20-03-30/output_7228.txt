Captured CO2 used to make hand sanitiser  Work &amp; Lifestyle  Air Co .
, which launched a carbon-negative vodka last year , is using the same approach to make hand sanitiser during the coronavirus outbreak  Spotted : After launching its carbon-negative vodka last year , New York City-based technology and lifestyle company , Air Co .
, has shifted its production to hand sanitiser , in response to the COVID-19 crisis .
The company captures CO2 pollution , combines it with water to make alcohol , and then distils the final product using solar-powered equipment .
Hand sanitiser needs to be made up of at least 60 per cent alcohol to work properly , and most are usually comprised of 70 per cent ethanol , which is the main output of Air Co .
' s technology .
The process of creating the alcohol is inspired by photosynthesis ; heated water splits into hydrogen and oxygen , which is then combined with the CO2 .
This mixture creates alcohol and water , which is then distilled to the point where the alcohol reaches the desired strength .
This method ensures that the entire fermentation process can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saving all agricultural-related expenditures .
The company aims to produce " goods that do good " , and so , in response to the current health crisis , is working with local officials to donate its bottles of hand sanitiser to the industries most in need of it .
Takeaway :  We 've seen several examples of alcohol producers shifting to the production of hand sanitiser in response to the coronavirus pandemic , but this is the first carbon-negative approach .
Air Co .
' s methods are unique , not only because of the environmental benefits of removing pollution from the air but also because they save water , time and other agricultural-related expenditures .
