The unit could accept patients as early as Tuesday .
" As this outbreak progresses , we could see patients ready to leave the hospital for a facility like ours , but they have n't been tested for COVID-19 , " said James Lin , D .
, the institute 's president .
" We ca n't expose them to our general population , so building a dedicated unit like this was important .
"  No patients at any of the institute 's three skilled-nursing centers had COVID-19 as of Monday morning , Lin said .
It took three weeks and about $30,000 to prepare the unit .
It now has its own entrance and exit , and a screening station .

Nurses and other staff will wear personal protective equipment and remain in the unit during their shifts .
They will remove their scrubs and shower at a designated trailer in the center 's parking lot .
" Some of us had a difficult time dealing with all of this at first , but as time has gone on , they have embraced the situation , " said Trisha Santos , R .
, the center 's director of nursing .
" Some of them are even volunteering to work on this unit .
"  Lin and his staff chose to place the designated unit at the center because it already had the most equipment to treat patients with severe lung problems .
The institute 's other skilled nursing centers are the LECOM Senior Living Center and LECOM at Village Square .
