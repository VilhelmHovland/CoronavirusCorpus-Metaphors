The Government only set up that system because snitches had been so busy there was a danger of overloading 111 call centres , which is less than ideal considering the country is currently facing the greatest emergency since the Second World War .
There 's nothing wrong or unusual with any of this .
The police force has always relied on tips from the community to sniff out ill doings of all sorts , but there 's something unseemly about the busybody nation that 's emerging from the Covid-19 crisis : there 's a reason no one likes a nark , after all .
NETFLIX  The Government wants to know if your mates have been naughty , and it 's counting on you to tell them .
It 's that holier-than-thou aspect to it that I personally ca n't abide -- the dirty look one gets whilst enjoying state-sanctioned exercise from others doing exactly the same thing .
If I 'm breaking the rules , so are you .
Despite my natural aversion to the practice ( I must acknowledge an obvious conflict of interest , narking being not just necessary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can understand the current fixation .
In ordinary times overcrowded footpaths and overzealous seaside mirthmaking are merely noisome , but in the age of Covid-19 , they 're potentially deadly .
Scenes like those seen in Wellington on Oriental Bay on Sunday ( outrageous -- and I should know , I was there ) could have spread the disease to untold numbers of people , putting thousands of lives at risk .
Now drunken wedding antics are ill-advised at the best of times ( you 'll never hear the end of it ) , but their current treatment as a quasi-capital offence is probably overblown and let 's be honest , for most of us that particular high horse has well and truly bolted .
Apologies for the mixed metaphor ( do n't report me ) .
The Government has subtly changed is messaging on narking too .
Announcing the lockdown last week , the prime minister urged kindness , and asked people to leave enforcement to the enforcers .
The messaging was important .
The embarrassing tale of the family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fever of wanton vigilantism when faced with an imagined threat : there was no telling what we 'd do were the threat real .
Fortunately , vigilantism has been in short supply -- potentially thanks to the outbreak of narking .
When faced with enforcing the law oneself of calling someone to do it for you , it seems most people are still content to do the latter .
The websites and email addresses have something of a placebo effect , giving people a sense of control over a world that 's rapidly descending into chaos .
Who can blame people for being nervous : if we cock-up the lockdown 80,000 people could die and even if we succeed we 're still left with the worst economic shock since the Great Depression .
Grandma might be spared , but your job might not .
Those other problems like climate change and nuclear war have n't gone away either -- nor have drug-resistant bacteria , which could prove to be more unstoppable than Covid-19 .
There is some comfort in asserting even a hollow control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger .
