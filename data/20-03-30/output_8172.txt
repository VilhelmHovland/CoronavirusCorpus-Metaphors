Casey Martin , who championed rights of golfers with disabilities , fights to save leg  EUGENE , Ore .
-- Golf often has been described as a good walk spoiled , usually by those without a sweet swing like Casey Martin 's .
The Eugene native has experienced great joy during a lifetime of golf , whether it was winning a state title at South Eugene High , winning an NCAA championship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods , making the PGA Tour , competing in the U .
Open or coaching the Oregon men 's team to its 2016 national title on the Eugene Country Club course Martin grew up playing .
It 's always been the walking that spoiled the fun .
Martin has suffered from a debilitating condition called Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome since birth .
That 's the reason Martin successfully sued the PGA Tour , citing the Americans with Disabilities Act , for the right to use a cart when he played in events .
Following the ruling , Connecticut 's PGA Tour event , then the Canon Greater Hartford Open , welcomed Martin with a sponsor 's exemption .
He arrived two weeks after finishing in a tie for 23rd at the U .
Open , but failed to make the cut after rounds of 71 and 73 at the TPC River Highlands in Cromwell .
" I knew this day was coming , " Martin said , " and it 's here .
"  Nightmare becomes reality : Martin always feared one misstep on a fairway could lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a reality when he fractured his right tibia in October after misjudging a step onto his street , which was under construction , while retrieving the garbage can from the curb .
" This was the reason , " Martin said of his famous lawsuit , in which the Supreme Court ruled in his favor with a 7-2 decision .
" I remember when I was in my 20s talking to doctors that had looked at my leg , they were like , ' Look , you need to really guard against this happening .
'  " I was grateful that I was able to hold it off for a long time .
I thought it would happen at 27 not 47 .
But it has happened .
I 'm just going to do everything in my power to save my leg .
"  Martin was perhaps more adaptable to the social isolation and shuttering in the coronavirus battle after being bedridden for a month following the accident .
" I feel like I 've been in quarantine for six months , " Martin quipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of the fall schedule .
He did manage to return : Even though Martin 's leg has not mended , he returned to campus on crutches and accompanied the Ducks to tournaments in Hawaii and California before the NCAA canceled the spring season due to the ongoing pandemic .
" It was frustrating , but I did the best I could , " Martin said .
" Brad 's been awesome .
He did so much of the work and really freed me up to just kind of do what I can do physically .
So I 'm very grateful for that .
The department 's been great .
They 've given me a lot of leeway and support .
" Now with the season ending , I mean , if ever you 're going to have this happen , I guess this was the year to have it happen for me .
"  Oregon a strong program : In 2017 , Oregon followed up its national title by winning the Pac-12 men 's golf championship outright for the first time since 1959 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Martin , who earned national coach of the year honors , has helped develop Aaron Wise , Wyndham Clark and Norman Xiong into promising young professional players .
Before the COVID-19 cancellations , Oregon was scheduled to host the annual Duck Invitational last week .
The current players will have to wait until 2021 to atone for the program 's rare NCAA Tournament miss under Martin in 2019 .
" We had a bunch of struggles this year , just learning and trying to quiet our minds and just play golf , " Martin said .
" I think the guys felt a lot of pressure to keep things going and not be the team that had things slip a bit .
We were trying to deal with some of those mental issues , but we were making headway .
" We had our home tournament here that we could have really made some noise in .
We were very bummed to hear the news , but understanding why , obviously .
"  Fracture not healing : Martin still has n't been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preventing the fracture from healing .
Walking relatively pain free with a prosthetic is something Martin has thought about , but amputation could be a perilous procedure in his case .
" If I lose my leg , it would be an above-the-knee deal , and it 's pretty risky for my situation anyway , " Martin said .
" It 's something that I 've recognized could happen , but I would really rather not , if I could save it , because of the risks .
"  Will try brace : Martin will travel to Washington in the coming weeks to get fitted for an ExoSym brace .
The expensive carbon-fiber leg support , which is not covered by insurance , could help redirect the weight to allow for the fracture to finally heal .
" Hopefully , it can give me some relief , but it 's certainly been a big struggle , " Martin said .
" It was the most pain I 've ever dealt with in my leg .
That 's why I took a golf cart , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
