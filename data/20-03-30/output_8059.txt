Ten plagues  Passover , or Pesach , combines prayers , songs and stories with an evening meal that celebrates the freeing of Jewish slaves by Pharaoh after the 10th in a series of plagues visited on Eqypt , Kaplan said .
During the Death of the Firstborn , the Angel of Death spared , or " passed over , " the firstborn in Jewish homes .
This finally persuaded Pharaoh to obey the command of God through Moses to " let my people go , that they might serve me .
"  Passover begins at 8:20 p .
or sundown on April 8 .
Kaplan encourages afternoon meals and naps so children and adults can stay up longer to participate without discomfort , but discourages early starts or shortening the service .
" Judaism is for adults , " Kaplan said .
" If Judaism is for 5-year-olds , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb it down ; do n't lower the standards .
Kids should always aspire to be lifted up .

He also demonstrates a " Bag of Plagues " with small toys representing the various plagues , including the Plague of Frogs .
" You can put frogs on the table as a decoration , " Kaplan advises .
" Just do n't eat them , because they are n't kosher .
"  Kaplan cautions leaders to check the alcohol content of the kosher wines they consume , because four 3 ? -ounce glasses must be drunk at various times during the meal .
" You drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Kaplan said of wine with a high alcohol content .
" You drink four cups of that and you 're a little happier and much better suited to be leading the Seder .
"  For those reluctant to venture to the stores , Chabad offers Seder-to-Go kits and a wide-ranging Passover page .
