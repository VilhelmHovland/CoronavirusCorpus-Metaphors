Toni Payne Calls Out Men Sliding In Her DM Amid COVID-19 Pandemic  Tony Payne has some words for the men who ca n't quit trying to get her attention in her DM .
The Los Angeles-based poet thought it would have been nicer if the men cared at all about her welfare in the time of the coronavirus pandemic .
But , no .
The men only care about ' shooting their shot ' , which is why she is calling them out .
" All these men sliding in my DM to shoot their shot .
it 's the same ol tired lines .
Funny thing is , not one has asked if I 'm ok or need anything , " she wrote .
She continued , " Not that I do but it ; s the thought that counts .
You wan na date someone but can ; t be bothered by how they are faring during these times ? Not even ' if you need anything , let me know or if you just need to talk holla ' and they expect a reply ? " .
