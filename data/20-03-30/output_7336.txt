Belov Engenharia to Build Two Robert Allan-Designed Dive Boats  A renewed wave of investments in the Brazilian offshore industry has appeared on the horizon kindling the demand for new highly specialized vessels such as a new Robert Allan Ltd .
design of the RAlly family .
Underwater service providers play a major role in maintaining offshore assets , especially in deep water , by performing diving operations and ROV ( Remotely Operated Vehicles ) surveys .
In the plethora of Brazilian operators , a company stands out from the crowd , having performed work for the Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras for several years : Belov Engenharia Ltda .
Understanding this new demand , and preparing for the tenders to come , Belov had decided to build ( at their own fabrication facility in Salvador ) and operate two new Dive Support Vessels ( DSV ) , engaging Robert Allan Ltd .
to prepare the Contract Design package of the vessel .
Both vessels ( Belov Amaralina and Belov Humait ? ) have completed the construction and class commissioning and are currently performing client acceptance testing .
Belov Engenharia Ltda .
developed the detailed design , construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months .
This is an outstanding feat for a newly built shipyard , which includes the construction of a new floating dock .
These interesting new vessels are of the RAlly 4000 's Class design , fitted with Dynamic Positioning System ( DP2 ) , four diesel generators , three water jet propulsors and triple bow thrusters for redundancy .
The propulsion system is diesel-electric to improve efficiency when operating in lower power DP modes .
The vessel is certified as a Special Diving Support vessel suitable for Unrestricted Navigation by RINA .
The RAlly 4000 was designed by Robert Allan Ltd .
to be fitted with an ROV LARS ( Launch and Recovery System ) , an aft mounted A-Frame to operate the diving bell , a decompression chamber to support the divers , and more spacious crew quarters .
All of this is incorporated within a gross tonnage under 500 GRT .
Waterjets are used to ensure diver safety .
Because waterjets are typically used on higher speed vessels , extensive self-propelled CFD analysis ( including waterjet tunnel flow ) was performed in-house by Robert Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this design will operate at when on station .
The new RAlly 4000 SDSV has the following particulars :  Length overall : 40 .
