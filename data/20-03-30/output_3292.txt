Tipperary GAA have extended the shut down of all on field related activity until April 26th at the earliest .
In an advisory notice to all GAA clubs in the county on Monday night , it confirmed an extension to the date for the re-commencement of games , training and all on field and off field related activities by four weeks from March 29th up to and including April 26th .

COACHING &amp; GAMES DEVELOPMENT  Tipperary County Board have also confirmed the cancellation of all Easter Camps which were scheduled to operate from April 7th-16th and also , all Academy and Development Squad activity has been deferred until further notice .
This is following guidance from the National Games Development Executive Operations Committee who said : " there was a strong commitment from Croke Park and Munster GAA to our staff and a genuine recognition of their efforts ( often above the call of duty ) on behalf of the Association down through the years .

PUBLIC LIABILITY / PROPERTY INSURANCE  Over the next few weeks Tipperary County Board will be sending out invoices for 2020 P&amp;L/Property Insurance premiums .
Most clubs can budget for a similar figure to 2019 unless any new developments have altered their premium .
CLUB LOTTOS  A few clubs have looked for clarification on weekly local lotto draws etc .
Some have a high percentage of online sales which involves no physical contact so we feel it 's entirely a club executive decision but they must be conscious of the restrictions involved in the interest of personal and public safety .
