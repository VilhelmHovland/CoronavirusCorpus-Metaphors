A Twitter debate has been raging over the first township case which was announced on Sunday 29 March .
The Western Cape government has reminded the public that no one is immune to contracting the infectious virus .
Debate over the first township case of the coronavirus has been raging on Twitter less than a day after Western Cape Premier Alan Winde announced that Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain had reported one and five cases respectively .
' Serious concern ' to Western Cape government  " Each and every one these cases -- from Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain to Mossel Bay -- is of very serious concern for my government .
" Our response teams are treating the development of cases in our informal areas with the urgency and seriousness it deserves , following up with every contact and ensuring isolation , " said Winde .
" We appeal to the public to not stigmatise this virus -- no one is immune , and we ask for understanding and assistance to those in need of help .
Mostly , if we are to break its spread , we need to be open about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Khayelitsha and Mitchells Plain have been released although weekend reports stated that police had arrested residents who violated lockdown rules .
Mixed Twitter reactions  On Twitter , some users angrily commented that it was unfair for the townships to be named while the other areas that had been affected by the virus went nameless .
Some , however , said that by publicising the case in Khayelitsha , this would lead to more awareness as some had mistakenly thought that they were immune from contracting the disease .
@KayMantanga said : " Why are people angry about the reported Khayelitsha #Covid19inSA case ? It is a big , highly populated , congested area and the virus can easily spread .
It 's important to spread awareness of the possible danger the people living there are facing so they can protect themselves .
"  The lack of ablution facilities , space and informal housing were pin-pointed as limiting factors that could set townships back from battling the disease .
Another Twitter user said adhering to the lockdown was important as the virus could infect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perish because they lack knowledge .
This thing of blaks and whites do n't make sense at this point and time .
Corona virus does not care whether you are white or black , rich or poor , stay in Sandton or khayelitsha etc .
Stay home or else you 'll regret  You guys complaining for everything , personally I think it was a good thing they mention Khayelitsha .
Ppl still think the virus is not in townships , hope this will be a lesson for someone and realise this is serious .
Khayelitsha residents were going up and down not long ago .
