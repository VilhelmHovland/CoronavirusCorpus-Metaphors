Restoring consumer confidence critical , says Concepcion  Bringing back consumer confidence is the other critical issue that businesses , especially the micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) , are facing as they try to get back to work once the month-long lockdown is over .

This was pointed out by Jose Ma .
Concepcion III , presidential adviser for entrepreneurship , as he called for mass testing against the pandemic-causing COVID-19 disease to help improve confidence among consumers .
" The other issue is confidence of the consumer that it is safe to go out .
Actually , at this time people are aware of the gravity that they will take precaution and even not go out this will make MSME especially in the retail side have a more challenging time .
Testing brings confidence , " he urged .
" We will have to build confidence back again .
The moment clarity is there , then confidence comes back and that is why I am a firm advocate of getting more testing done .
You 've seen countries that were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I urge Secretary Duque to consider the testing kits that are faster .
In our case , since many of us have distributors that lend to the MSMEs , definitely , we are extending that because there 's no way that they can pay .
We are going to plan it so everybody will be able to ride this crisis , " Concepcion told the Manila Bulletin .
In fact , the founder of Go Negosyo said that the recovery of the MSMEs from the impact of the health crisis will largely depend on their business model , but in general they can not recoup their losses this year .
" Depending on the business model of the MSME but in general no , " said Concepcion when asked if MSMEs can recover this year from the adverse impact of the month-long lockdown due to COVID-19 on their businesses .
Initial impact assessment on the four week-lockdown on MSMEs was not good , Concepcion said , but would be manageable with the additional working capital that the government is extending through the " Bayanihan Heal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be harder if the quarantine is extended because that would mean paying interest rate on loans and letting people go .
" Right now , if they are in retail we do n't know if they will be able to operate their stores , " he added .
Concepcion said that enterprises need to refinance their loss for one-month stoppage .
" If this goes longer the bigger the question will they be able to pay the loan back .
Banks might not lend them if they do n't see a chance of collecting , " he added .
That is why , he stressed the importance of making this one-month Enhanced Community Quarantine ( ECQ ) becomes successful .
" The more the business stops , you ca n't keep paying your workers because you will bleed .
You have to stop to bleed .
So , they 've stopped the rental , they 've stopped paying salaries .
Of course , maybe this month everybody is covered with their emergency leave , sick leave , vacation leave but some sectors like the contractuals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe they two weeks , some are lucky to have one month , so this is the sector that was challenged .
Basically , the working class , and/or the micro , and small that are at the bottom of the pyramid .
The medium enterprises are still doing much better , but everybody is not spared , from large corporations to medium sized corporations , everybody is affected , " he added .
Concepcion came out with a paid-ad over the weekend , urging Filipinos to cooperate with what the government is doing because the economy can not afford an extended lockdown .
" It is very important for us that the last two weeks of the lockdown should be really enforced well .
If we do n't cooperate , lockdown might happen again .
We need this to help our frontliners -- doctors , and nurses who are manning the hospitals .
This will also help our MSMEs and the Filipino working-class , get back their jobs again thus relieving the economy , " he said .
