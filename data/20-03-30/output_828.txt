As hospitals around the country desperately seek N95 respirator masks to protect health care workers treating COVID-19 patients , the federal government has blocked imports of what might be the world 's most abundant alternative .
That mask is designed to filter out at least 95% of particles that are 0 .
microns or larger in size -- the same measure used for the scarce N95 mask .
Like the N95 , it fits closely around the nose and mouth , creating a seal that decreases the risk of infection .
And the Centers for Disease Control has said it 's as effective as N95 , which is certified under US testing standards .
But this second type of mask , called the KN95 , complies with slightly different norms and is made in factories that have not been certified by the US government .
By law , masks , along with most medical devices , ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Drug Administration 's say-so .
Last week , to ease the national shortfall of protective gear , the FDA issued an emergency authorization for non-N95 respirators that had been certified by five foreign countries as well as the European Union .
It conspicuously left the KN95 masks out of the emergency authorization .
A significant majority of all respirator masks , including both the N95 and KN95 , are manufactured in China .
During the height of that country 's outbreak , China restricted exports of virtually all respirator masks , keeping them for domestic use .
As that country 's infection numbers have slowed it has eased those restrictions , but now the US must compete with dozens of other countries desperate to acquire masks .
Allowing the importation and use of KN95 could help to greatly alleviate the scarcity .
" The KN95 masks are far more readily available , " said Bob Tilton , who owns a New Jersey -- based cosmetics packaging importer and earlier this month decided to use his familiarity with Chinese supply chains to bring in masks and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N95s are much harder to grab .
"  Yet without the FDA 's seal of approval , importers are hesitant to order KN95 masks because they worry they 'll get held up at customs .
Many hospitals are refusing to accept them , even as free donations , because they fear legal liability should a health care worker get ill while using a nonpermitted device .
Under ordinary circumstances , N95 masks -- which are certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health -- are abundant , available at hardware stores and pharmacies for around $1 apiece and for as little as 35 cents apiece wholesale .
But in just two months , the coronavirus pandemic has depleted the world 's supply , creating a gray market that has driven prices for a single mask as high as $12 or more .
That , in turn , has opened the door to unscrupulous actors running internet scams that take payment for N95 masks they never deliver , and to others selling counterfeit or mislabeled N95 masks , which could put health care workers at serious risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newly permitted US standards -- Australia , Brazil , Japan , Korea , Mexico , and the EU -- are not made in as great quantities as the N95 or KN95 , according to industry experts .

Tilton is one of a growing number of entrepreneurs and do-gooders who have rushed to find ways to bring respirators into the country to meet the urgent national need .
The federal government recently estimated that the US would require 3 .
billion masks over the next year to address COVID-19 .
Earlier this month Tilton applied for and received a medical device importer 's license from the FDA and soon thereafter inked a deal to sell 111,000 masks to a large hospital group in New Jersey .
Because of the scarcity and high cost of the N95 masks , he split the order between those and KN95 masks and worries that some may get held up .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 million on a shipment of masks in hopes the customs people look away , " said Tilton .
" I 'm not going to take any more orders until I know we can get everything through .
"  A spokesperson for Customs and Border Patrol , which oversees all imports , said that the agency had recently intercepted various COVID-19-related products coming into the country because they were either counterfeit or not permitted , but could not elaborate on whether any were KN95 masks .
An advisory paper published by law firm Covington and Burling last week predicted " increased screening , examination , and sampling at ports " of medical devices .

Earlier this month , President Donald Trump made a point of referring to the pathogen as the " Chinese virus , " while last week Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's insistence on calling it the " Wuhan virus " led to the spiking of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems like this is happening for political reasons , " said Byron Walker , who owns SurivalFrog .
, an online store that focuses on survival gear .
After noticing a month ago that his own small inventory of N95 masks had sold out overnight , he decided to try to import many more .
He reached out to the Colorado Department of Human Services and agreed to sell it 50,000 masks at cost , and plans to donate an additional 10,000 masks to hospitals in Denver , where he lives .
After considerable effort , Walker was able to source the masks at a cost of more than $3 and is awaiting the first shipments early this week .
But he says he could have ordered at least twice as many KN95 masks if they were permitted .
Vernessa Pollard , an attorney at McDermott Will &amp; Emery whose practice focuses on FDA law and who formerly worked at the agency , dismisses such concerns .
She said she was aware of several health care providers that had been inquiring about authorization from the FDA to import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific data to determine that the respirators were truly equivalent .
" My belief is the FDA is looking at the KN95 to be allowed to be imported , " Pollard said .
" It 's science-based .
I do n't believe there is anything political at all .
"  In the meantime , however , prices for the US-approved N95 masks continue to surge .
One survey of offers from China on Friday showed KN95 masks averaged significantly less than half the price -- roughly $1 .
compared to $3 .
apiece .
Although some hospitals flat-out reject KN95 masks at any price on advice of their lawyers , people rounding up masks to give to hospitals have found that individual doctors or nurses will often accept the donations , given the dire need .
On March 17 , the CDC issued guidance saying that health care personnel could use bandanas , scarves , or other " homemade masks " as " a last resort .
"  Despite the import restrictions , some KN95 masks are trickling through .
The FDA has set up several special email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prior to the EUA issued last week , they had received guidance from agency officials that small shipments of KN95 would likely not be stopped at the border .

Some of those masks are already working their way into the consumer marketplace .
Although N95 masks have been sold out for at least a month , KN95s have begun appearing in retail stores .
The Farms , a neighborhood market in Santa Monica , California , had masks labeled " KN95 " for sale at $8 .
for a two-pack , or close to $5 apiece with tax , on Saturday evening .
According to an employee who answered the phone , they were sold out by the next morning .
