Shashi Tharoor Compared The Present Situation With The Demonetisation By Sharing Two Pictures On The Micro-blogging Site .
At a time when the nation is trying to stand united in the fight against coronavirus , Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for announcing a 21-day nationwide lockdown to fight the spread of the COVID-19 .
The Congress leader has accused the prime minister of not giving people enough time to prepare before the lockdown was imposed .
" Na Hee Tab Taiyari Thee Na Hee Ab Taiyari Hai , Tab Bhi Janata Haari Thi , Ab Bhi Janata Haari Hai ( Neither there was a preparation then ( apparently referring to demonetization ) , nor now .
That time also the common man was at the receiving end , so is today ) , " Tharoor wrote on Twitter .
He compared the present situation with the demonetisation by sharing two pictures on the micro-blogging site .
While one picture showed a long queue outside banks after the demonetisation in 2016 and the other showed a huge crowd of migrant workers at a bus terminal .
On one picture he wrote Notebandi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Lockdown ' .
Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi too has written to PM Modi saying the sudden lockout has created immense panic and confusion .
" It is critical for us to understand that India 's conditions are unique .
We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy , " Gandhi said .
A 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced by PM Modi as a measure to tackle the outbreak of the highly contagious COVID-19 .
Following this , thousands of migrant labourers started leaving Delhi by walking in the absence of any mode of transport .
Several pictures of these daily wagers walking barefoot towards their native places have gone viral on the internet .
