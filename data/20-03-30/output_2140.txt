Nurses in Spain Are ' Suffering ' and Worried They 're Infecting Patients  " We do n't know where it came from .
"  MADRID -- As the coronavirus death toll rapidly climbs in Spain to make it a grim new hotspot of the global pandemic , healthcare workers like Alfonso Molina Moreno are struggling without proper gear and worried about their patients as well as themselves .
Spain 's health ministry says health workers currently make up about 14 percent of country 's positive COVID-19 cases .
When the outbreak started hitting Madrid , Moreno figured the small palliative-care hospital he works in would be safer than others because no new patients were being admitted .
But then an elderly patient with cervical cancer died , and a postmortem X-ray showed her lungs had advanced , bilateral pneumonia .
" It could have been coronavirus , right ? She was n't tested , " he said .
" We do n't know whether we , the staff , brought it here .
We do n't know whether it was due to the patients ' visitors .
We do n't know the source .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients who have tested positive -- putting on protective equipment they dispose of in contaminated rooms and washing their hands on both sides of the door .
When we spoke , Morena had n't been tested .
He may be able to soon , though : Spain has ordered 640,000 test kits from China and Korea in an effort to screen health workers and the most vulnerable , to help identify people who need to self-isolate .
Morena is n't just thinking of the patients he 's now caring for .
He 's worried about infecting his loved ones .
" I told this to my colleagues , and we have this kind of sharing moment .
We 're all going through this bad phase , this suffering .
" But he is n't thinking about quitting .
" I really find myself fortunate to be able to work because I have the chance to go and feel useful , " he says .
He 's even volunteered to take on more shifts .
" The healthcare providers , at this moment , we have to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who will it be then ? There is no one else .
