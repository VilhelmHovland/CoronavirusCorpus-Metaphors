JobKeeper Payment a gun to the heads of over one million temporary entrants  Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a new JobKeeper payment but there is no assistance for one million temporary residents ( ScreenShot via YouTube )  The JobKeeper Payment is a massive tourniquet for the Australian economy and society .
But for over one million temporary entrants , the allowance is a gun to their head .
While this allowance comes weeks late and represents possibly the biggest policy backflip in Australian history , it is desperately needed .
Precisely because it encourages employers to maintain their Australian and New Zealand citizen workforce , very few employers will have an incentive to retain any employee who is the holder of a temporary entry visa other than NZ citizens .
over 200,000 bridging visa holders , most of whom are either partner visa applicants or asylum seekers ; and  over 16,000 temporary protection visa holders .
In addition , there are around 60,000 overstayers as well as an unknown number of people on visitor visas -- as we do not know how many of the 600,000 visitors in Australia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia will get access to the $1500 Jobkeeper payment , PM says , after discussions with @jacindaardern .
But PM does n't say if it applies to other visa holders .
@paulsakkal on how NZers and visa holders have been going .

How can a humanitarian crisis be avoided ?  First , the immigration minister should announce regulations implementing a blanket rule automatically providing all temporary entrants in Australia -- including visitors currently in Australia -- whose visas will expire before 30 June 2019 , with a new visa of the same type they currently hold , with validity until 31 August 2019 .
This assumes we will have passed the peak of the crisis by then and people will be able to more readily get home .
It would significantly reduce the number of temporary entrants going into Home Affairs offices , thus helping to reduce the risk of spreading the virus .
Second , the health minister should create a new Medicare item enabling all temporary entrants and overstayers to attend a doctor -- including by telehealth if appropriate -- at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in contact with someone who has recently returned from overseas .
This provision should also cover -- if needed -- the costs of a coronavirus test and hospital treatment .
Overstayers would be given an assurance that they would not be reported to Home Affairs or Borderforce if they come forward to a doctor .
Third , the social services minister should issue regulations enabling all temporary entrants with work rights currently in Australia -- including NZ citizens and visitors if they must self-isolate -- with access to special benefits until 31 July 2020 , given many will lose their jobs and will find it difficult to get home .
Note access to special benefit requires applicants to establish financial hardship and hence that will limit take up .
Nevertheless , it is important applicants can undertake this process online and/or over the telephone to minimise risks of further queues at Centrelink offices .
Centrelink staff should be able to undertake identity checks in conjunction with the Department of Home Affairs .
Fourth , the social services minister should issue regulations providing a once-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary entrants ( including visitors , overstayers and unsuccessful asylum seekers ) without the financial capacity to get home .
The objective would be to prevent these people from becoming destitute .
Arrangements with relevant foreign governments to compensate the Australian Government for these payments should be negotiated .
The treasurer should extend the job keeper allowance to any temporary entrant currently working in critical occupations such as health and aged care .
Steps 6 and 7 .
( and 1 .
) Immigration Minister David Coleman  Sixth , the immigration minister should then introduce a regulation enabling any temporary entrant working in these occupations to be able to secure a further 12-month visa of the type they are currently on by applying entirely online or over the telephone and on a no-application-fee basis .
This would ensure Australia has the staff it needs in these key occupations as the current health crisis escalates .
At the end of the 12 months , these temporary entrants should also be provided with a clear pathway to permanent residence recognising the role they will have played in supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister should increase places available for partners of Australian citizens and permanent residents in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 migration program .
This should be possible without increasing the overall program as there will likely be a large shortfall in the overall program due to the coronavirus .
Australian citizens and permanent residents should not have to live separated from their partners at this difficult time .
Finally , noting it will not be possible to deliver the Offshore Humanitarian Program in 2019-20 or likely in 2020-21 , the immigration minister should fast track permanent protection visas for the over 16,000 long-term temporary protection visa holders in Australia to take up the places freed up .
It is well beyond time that the Coalition Government recognised there is zero chance these people will ever be able to go home , so there is no point keeping them on temporary protection visas .
The Morrison Government needs to act on the above urgently to avoid a humanitarian disaster .
