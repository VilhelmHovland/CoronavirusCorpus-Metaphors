The Ahoy concert hall in Rotterdam should have hosted the glitter and glamour of the Eurovision song contest in May , but instead is now being turned into an emergency hospital to help the Netherlands battle its coronavirus outbreak .
On Monday , work began on installing the first 88 of a possible 680 hospital beds in the halls of Ahoy , normally used for big concerts , trade fairs and international sports events .
Instead of its usual crowd of pop music and sports fans , Ahoy will open its doors from mid-April to people suffering from the coronavirus or other illnesses who need care but do not have to be admitted to a hospital .
This should help alleviate the pressure on hospitals in the Netherlands , where the number of coronavirus infections has risen rapidly since the first case was reported on Feb .
As of Monday , there were 11,750 confirmed coronavirus infections in the country , with 864 deaths .
The Dutch National Institute for Public Health said on Sunday that intensive care units in Dutch hospitals could reach peak capacity in the coming two weeks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from overflowing , emergency wards for coronavirus and other patients are also being installed in hotels across the country of 17 million people .
Only last month , Ahoy drew more than 100,000 spectators to the ABN Amro World Tennis Tournament and in recent months has hosted concerts by international stars such as Pink and 50 Cents .
However , Ahoy saw its most anticipated event of the year scrapped two weeks ago , when the coronavirus pandemic forced the Eurovision song contest organizers to cancel an event that would have drawn tens of thousands of spectators in mid-May .

Speaking in a hearing of the Knesset committee for tackling the coronavirus epidemic , Babad noted that enforcement of social-distancing orders in the ultra-Orthodox sector has been difficult .
" We have no small amount of problems with ultra-Orthodox society , in places like Bnei Brak , " said Babad .
" Part of the discussion is about how we can succeed in imposing a closure and quarantine those places , " he added .
Such measures are now being considered in light of worryingly high rates of infection in the ultra-Orthodox sector , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community comprise 40 to 60 percent of coronavirus patients in major hospitals such Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan , Shaare Tzedek in Jerusalem and Hadassah Ein Karem in Jerusalem .
During cabinet discussions on Sunday , Health Minister Ya'acov Litzman supported the idea of quarantining the entire city of Bnei Brak , although according to Bnei Brak municipal council member Yaakov Veeder there are as yet no concrete plans to carry this out .
The option of quarantining ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods in other cities is also being considered , although there are no immediate plans to do so .
Because of the growing crisis in the ultra-Orthodox sector , the government decided to appoint Interior Minister Aryeh Deri as the coordinator of government efforts to halt the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in the ultra-Orthodox community .
A quarantine center has now been established in Bnei Brak on the campus of an educational institution , while Deri has ordered that a site outside of major urban areas be found for treating those sick with the coronavirus .
Following the release of data over the weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-Orthodox populations , the most senior rabbinic leader of the ultra-Orthodox world , Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky , gave an order to the community to cease praying in prayer quorums of at least ten men , as is customary .
Earlier on Sunday , Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan described the staging of an ultra-Orthodox mass funeral in Bnei Brak on Saturday night as " an extremely severe incident which endangers life and harms the public , " saying that he would be holding an " urgent meeting " with senior police officials to discuss enforcement of Health Ministry orders in the ultra-Orthodox sector later in the day .
" I demand from the Israel Police determined and equal enforcement of the Health Ministry instructions in every part of the country without exception , " wrote Erdan on Twitter .
He said that " the decisive majority of the ultra-Orthodox community " is complying with Health Ministry orders regarding social-distancing because of the coronavirus epidemic , but said that " the police needs to do what is necessary " to prevent extremist elements in the ultra-Orthodox public from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF members of the haredi community attended the funeral of Rabbi Tzvi Shinker , a senior rabbi associated with the extremist Jerusalem Faction grouping within the ultra-Orthodox public .
Shinker , who was 80-years-old when he died , was the head of the Beit David Yeshiva .
The mass gathering was in direct violation of Health Ministry directives , which forbids gatherings of more than 10 people -- including prayers , weddings and funerals -- in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus .
Police officers were at the funeral , but no attempts were made to fine the mourners or to stop the event , Walla reported .
The police allegedly tried to reach an understanding with haredi leaders , but nothing came of it .
The Jerusalem Faction is an especially radical community which broke away from mainstream ultra-Orthodoxy and has become extremely antagonistic to state authority , staging numerous mass demonstrations over efforts to increase haredi enlistment to the army .
The Health Ministry is printing out information about the regulations in Yiddish , the language mainly used in haredi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guidelines .
However , it wants the printed document not to indicate that it is a government document in order to ensure that it will not be rejected by the strict haredi communities .
On Sunday morning , the police found some 30 ultra-Orthodox men praying in a synagogue apparently connected to the extremist Jerusalem Faction in the ultra-Orthodox city of Modiin Ilit , in violation of Health Ministry orders that no more than 10 people be gathered in one place .
According to the police , police officers at the synagogue called on the men several times to disperse but the worshipers ignored them , so they acted to disperse the prayer service themselves , arresting seven of the men in the process .
In a statement to the press , the police said that if " dialogue " with the leadership of extremists elements of the ultra-Orthodox sector is not successful , " enforcement will be determined and less tolerant .

He said however that grades eight and nine for boys have been kept open because of the spiritual danger of closing down schools where children study the Torah .
