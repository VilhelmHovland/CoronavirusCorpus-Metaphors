" COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus , which means that there is a lot that we do not know about it .
Extensive monitoring and health surveillance systems need to be undertaken to build the knowledge base , so that prevention , management and treatment can be improved .
LGUs can help in the conduct of these systems .
Smart LGUs can contribute even more .
Now is the time for these LGUs to brainstorm on ways that they can contribute to this effort , " said Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M .
Pernia .

To contain the spread of the disease , NEDA said it is important for LGUs outside of the capital to be much better prepared .

The country is currently at Phase 1 of the mitigating measures to minimize the duration and contain the spread of the virus .
Phase 1a consists of interventions for early detection and testing , effective quarantine systems and management and treatment of cases .
" Many of the interventions on management and treatment of cases are within the domain of medical institutions .
But with the LGUs working closely with the regional health offices to set up systems for contact tracing and develop protocols for referrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus during this critical phase .
Regular transport services , or even temporary accommodation , can also be arranged for healthcare workers , " said Pernia .
He also added that LGUs can help in explaining the guidelines issued by the Department of Health , and the Interagency Task Force , and perhaps translate the guidelines into the local dialect .
Phase 1b , meanwhile , consists of public health measures such as ban on travel and crowded gatherings , school closures , flexible work arrangements , limits on business operations , and work suspension .
" It is imperative that proper sanitation is maintained in all public places .
LGUs need to inform all establishments of the proper disinfection protocols and other measures to curb the spread of the disease , " Pernia said .

NEDA also encouraged LGUs to set up a system to manage the receiving and deploying of donations and resources coming from well-meaning individuals and organizations .
Phase 1c calls for the short-term augmentation of health facilities , and human resources for health .
Thus , Pernia urged the LGUs to put up temporary outpatient consultation facilities outside of hospitals .

" Consultations for respiratory problems and fever should be done at these temporary facilities .
If the LGU is able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to biosafety standards , " the Cabinet official said .
Pernia added that public school facilities , especially those that are accessible , but not situated in high-density areas , can be an option , subject to the guidelines set by the Department of Education .
" We count on all LGUs , especially the Smart LGUs , to help us in brainstorming innovative ideas , and in implementing these interventions , to curb the spread of the disease in the regions , " he said .
