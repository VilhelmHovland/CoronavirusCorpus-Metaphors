I kept up lots of water , and ate food , even though I had no appetite , because I knew my body needed it to help to fight anything .
I already suspected I might have the coronavirus , and had seen the posts warning against Ibuprofen , so I did n't take any of that or anything else .
On Wednesday , coughing was added to my symptoms , but no sore throat , no shortness of breath .
Thursday my temperature seemed fine .
No more headaches .
I was still fatigued and my body ached , but no sore throat , no shortness of breath .
I woke up feeling much better on Friday .
I coughed occasionally , but the other symptoms seemed to be gone and I was feeling a bit stronger .
How to get tested for coronavirus ?  Now that I had my wits about me , I investigated getting tested even though I felt fine .
I thought I may still be infected and so may have infected other people , so I called the number on the sheet given to me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
I encountered what seemed a convoluted call tree with a long wait time , but they did recommend going to a symptom checker website so I went there instead .
There were lots of warnings on the website for people with serious symptoms to call for an ambulance immediately , none of which applied to me .
Instead , I went through the questions , thinking I perhaps may not qualify , and then got this message :  " You or the person you 're with needs to see a GP today ( within the next 12 hours ) .
If your GP 's surgery is closed , follow their instructions for contacting the emergency doctor , or attend the nearest emergency department ( ED ) .
If you ca n't find a GP or are n't well enough to get to ED safely , call triple zero ( 000 ) .
Do n't drive yourself .
"  I used their search service to look up my nearest GP and gave them a call but the receptionist said GPs were n't doing the tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why they were being listed as a place to be tested .
Heading to the coronavirus clinic  I looked up the Alfred Hospital website which said to call them on 03 9076 2000 before turning up , to check if you qualify for a test .
So I called , and they said I did need to come in .
The hospital is a few suburbs away , and so I asked what they recommended regarding transport ( I sold my car a few years ago ) .
I said I was feeling better today , so I could walk but the lady said some people were still taking taxis and Ubers .
I decided to get an Uber , so I would n't exhaust myself with the walk .
I cleaned my hands , and put on my mask ( I still have some N95 masks I bought during the fires ) but realised that because Uber does n't show the driver the destination until after they accept the job , the driver does n't have the opportunity to give informed consent .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than just a street number , and I had on my mask , so I took that as consent .
I used my sleeve to open the door and kept on the other side away from the driver .
I wish I did ask for overt consent though .
Waiting for the big test  I arrived at the Alfred and there were lots of signs showing where to get tested .
Security guards were there to direct people , and they were all wearing masks and gloves .
We had to stand outside , about 2 metres apart from each other .
Some people had masks on , some did not .
Some were coughing , some were not .
There were marks on the ground indicating where to stand .
We are moved up along the path with maximum three people at a time .
Once I got close , which did n't take long , I could see all the health workers inside had full gear on , including eye coverage .
The first step was to stand at the entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ahead of me were sent away , as they did n't qualify for a test .
I recommend people do n't go unnecessarily and risk being exposed and taking up space .
People should call first before going to the hospital .
The doctor , Hannah , asked me questions to check if I qualified for a test and I did .
I was informed that it would take three to five days for the test to come back and that if the result was negative I would receive a text .
If it was positive I would be contacted and told what to do next .
Even if the results were negative , I would still have to keep up my self-isolation for the 14 days .
If I was positive , then anyone I had been in contact with would have to self-isolate for 14 days , even if they did n't have symptoms .
They could get tested only if they had symptoms .
I was asked to clean my hands with the gel and to proceed .
What it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another person in full protective gear to stand on another marker , this time in front of a person sitting at a desk .
There were five of these desks , with the whole space covered in plastic .
The person at the desk -- who had no protective gear -- asked me my name , age , address , and mobile number and if I was a health worker .
He printed it out on a sheet and handed it to me to check if it was accurate .
My name was spelt incorrectly and so I let him know .
He put his hand out to take it back , and then pulled his hand back and directed me to put it in the bin in front of me .
He was friendly , but seemed to be shaking .
He apologised for getting it wrong and went through the process again .
Once confirmed , I was handed the sheet , to keep for my records , and the testing kit .
A lady in full gear directed me to the next section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all still covered in plastic ) , with a laminated sign with instructions on how to self-test and a television screen showing an instructional video .
There was a bin , and no table .
I had to do the throat swab first .
I recalled that gagging was a good sign and so kept going while I gagged .
Then I placed the swab into the tube , and broke off the tip and sealed it .
The lady next door to me was having trouble , and so the helper assisted , saying not to worry as we were trying to do this while sick and jetlagged .
I repeated the process for the nose swab .
It did n't say anywhere whether it needed to be both nostrils and so I asked .
It does .
I wriggled it around for a bit , and repeated the snapping and sealing .
By then my eyes were watering .
Your questions on coronavirus answered :  I was directed to the next marker and another lady in full gear directed me to throw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my details were correct on the kit , to pass her the test kit , and then to use the gel to clean my hands and to go to the next marker .
The final lady in full gear reminded me that it would take three to five days for my results , that I would be texted if negative and contacted if not , and that I needed to keep up my self-isolation even if negative .
I said I understood and thanked her .
Upon leaving I got out my phone and realised I needed to walk home .
I could n't risk being positive and having to contact another driver to self-isolate .
I walked , swerving around people on the foot path and taking back streets and it ended up taking nearly an hour to get home .
Getting the results  Saturday night -- the night after I took the coronavirus test -- I received a call from a doctor at the Alfred Hospital letting me know I had tested positive for the virus .
We presumed I would be OK because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me the test results straight away , and did n't even say he was calling about the results .
Instead , he just began by asking questions confirming information I 'd already provided such as about my recent trip and what symptoms I had .
The thought went through my mind that maybe he was just calling to get data but he did say that I had tested positive for virus , and that they expected my condition to keep getting better as it is .
What the experts are saying about coronavirus :  He suggested calling the Infectious Diseases Registrar if I did start to get worse , and to let them know I tested positive and also , if I needed to , to call an ambulance and to let them know I tested positive .
He said I would receive a call from the Department of Health , who would go through what I would need to do , including who to contact and so on .
They would give me more information and record my details .
We also spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said it was good , the effort I had gone to reduce the risk .
The following day -- on Sunday -- I received the call from a lady at the Department of Health who confirmed my details and those of my GP and said they would be sending my test results to them .
She also once again went through questions about my contacts 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms , movements throughout the week and so on .
She said the airlines I was on were being notified and also made it clear that neither of my taxi/Uber drivers were at serious risk .
Phew !  Today ( Tuesday ) I do n't have any headaches or body aches .
I am still fatigued , have an occasional cough , and need to take big breaths but I 'm feeling optimistic about recovery .
