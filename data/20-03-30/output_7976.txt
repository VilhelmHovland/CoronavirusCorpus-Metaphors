John Oliver Rips Trump 's ' Irresponsible ' Coronavirus Leadership : ' Failed to Give This Crisis The Seriousness It Requires '  John Oliver came out of Last Week Tonight 's coronavirus hiatus by slamming President Donald Trump 's leadership throughout the health crisis .
A week after Oliver 's show was temporarily suspended amid Covid-19 concerns , he returned with another stripped-down show that focused on how the disease continues to impact the planet .
He focused particularly on Trump , starting with how the president dismissed the virus before taking it seriously and calling himself a " wartime president " for a " different kind of a war than we 've ever had .
"  " Yeah , I guess it is different , is n't it ? " Oliver sarcastically remarked .
" It 's like World War II , only the enemy is invisible ; or like the Vietnam War , only this time , Trump is actually taking part .
"  Oliver continued to blame Trump 's " irresponsible " attitude for allowing the pandemic to worsen , plus he tore into all of the Trump-backing pundits who 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain is worse than the health concerns of the deadly virus .
Eventually , Oliver turned his attention to how the disease has put a tremendous strain on hospitals and vital resources , which Trump dismissed before finally invoking the Defense Production Act last week .
" Again and again , Trump has failed to give this crisis the seriousness it requires , " Oliver said .
" This was always going to be hard , but it did n't have to be this hard .
That is why it is so profoundly disheartening that we are being led through this crisis by a man who may be less equipped to deal with this historical moment than anyone in recorded history .
