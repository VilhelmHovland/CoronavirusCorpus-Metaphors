Main menu  Working From Home : Phone Trick That Has Made Life Easier  A man working using a laptop .
Following the Covid-19 outbreak , working from home is the new normal  File  The last couple of days have been frantic , to put it mildly .
From the moment our eloquent President announced the very first Covid-19 case , life simply took a movie-like theme .
And I 'm not talking about the feel-good warm and cushy movies .
It all started with an emergency meeting at my workplace .
My boss ( Veronica ) , who brings a whole new meaning to the word detached , was looking a tad bit concerned .
President Uhuru Kenyatta addressing the nation regarding new measures by the government to combat the Covid-19 virus , on March 25 at Statehouse , Nairobi .
PSCU  I said a silent prayer as we convened ' God please God , do n't let these things come anywhere near me or my loved ones , I still need to write a book , visit Anfield for a live match and make some babies .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Veronica asked while interrupting my earnest request to the man upstairs .
" Yes , yes I am " I responded .
She then went on to announce that we would all be taking compulsory leave following the pandemic .
You could hear a pin drop as everyone was waiting to hear the most important bit of the emergency briefing - was this the end ? Would we be getting full salaries ?  Sensing this , Veronica eased our fears by announcing that everything would remain as it was , but that we would be asked to do some work from home .
Jumping for joy .
This was the general mood in the office after Veronica made the announcement .
File  My phone started lighting up the moment the meeting was adjourned .
Mum : Hi .
are you guys working from home yet ? Hii Co-something ni serious  Me : Not yet mum but we have just .
Mum : Ati no , do they want you to die in the office  Me : hahaha I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten news that we 'll be on compulsory leave moving forward .
At least until this thing clears out .
Mum : Oooh that 's good , talk to your sister when you can .
I ca n't seem to get a hold of her .
Me : Ok mum , bye .
She had a tendency of being extra but then again , I guess that 's a common trait among mothers .
I quickly cleared out my desk as I mapped out my plans for the foreseeable future in my head .
Heading up-country was a definite no , following recent orders to steer clear of the elderly .
I realised I needed to stock up on my house supplies .
I quickly hailed a cab using one of those popular apps and within no time we were cruising along Red Hill Road on our way to the mall .
The stories the cab driver narrated warrant a story of their own- trying to squeeze an instance in which he almost jumped out of his car after his passenger started coughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi operator pictured driving while donning a face mask .
Twitter  As he was airing out his slightly exaggerated stories , it hit me .
my mum called to ask for some money I had promised her for one of her farming projects , but she was just too decent to ask .
How could I forget ! ! ! Sidenote : I need to start writing stuff down .
Luckily , thanks to my significant other , I now knew how to send money straight from my MCo-op Cash to her M-Pesa account .
Once we got to the mall I used the same app to pay for the trip , I was hell-bent on following Uhuru 's directive of avoiding cash transactions at all costs .
That 's when I noticed the line at the entry to the supermarket- social distancing was a term that had somehow eluded this area .
Kate ( the significant other I mentioned earlier on ) was somewhere in among the crowd I was looking at- we were supposed to meet up but she texted earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried calling her but it just kept going straight to voicemail .
was she ok ? Had some hapless opportunists made away with her phone ? Why had n't we just ordered for the necessary items online and used Co-op Visa Card we were so used to , to sort it out ?  These questions were running through my mind when all of a sudden , the crowd started running in all directions , with a sizeable section coming straight at me .
As it turns out , some lady had collapsed while standing in line , and that was enough to spark mass panic .
In the middle of all the mayhem that looked like a scene right from a movie , I spotted Kate .
She was standing next to a security guard with a fearful expression on her face .
I hurriedly made my way to her -while trying my best to avoid coming into contact with the frantic runners - all those late nights watching kung fu movies finally paid off , as I slalomed my way with zero contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me .
she almost hugged me but I assumed she remembered the whole social distancing thing .
Kate : Let 's not be reckless .
I ca n't believe you found me .
my phone died and then everything just seemed to go downhill from there .
Me : Sorry about all this .
Let 's just get out of here .
I said as I hailed a cab on my phone app once again .
Kate : We still need to get supplies .
We ca n't be sure when we 'll get this chance again .
she said in a panicky tone .
Me : Do n't worry Kate .
I have it all figured out .
I responded in a Superman-Esque tone .
we have Co-op Visa Card .
that 's all we need .
we can just pick out items in the comfort of our sanitised apartment and have it delivered .
She gave me the ' why on earth did n't we do that in the first place look ' .
We were soon back home , where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenience of going cashless proved to be a lifesaver - quite literally .
It 's now day 3 since the mandatory curfew was imposed .
everything was going well until I remembered that my internet subscription was due .
Kate is always on my neck about forgetting stuff .
I just need to MCo-op Cash my way out of a potential argument .
heaven knows we ca n't afford to miss the next Maria episode .
