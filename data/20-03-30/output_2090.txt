Dozens of retired N .
doctors looking to practise again for COVID-19  Dr .
Chris Randall is ready to come out of retirement for the second time in less than three years .
This time , it 's to help his mostly younger colleagues in Nova Scotia face the COVID-19 pandemic .
The 62-year-old 's paperwork is done and he 's just waiting for the call .
Although he 's unclear what work he will be doing , Randall is approaching it with the confidence that comes with a long and varied medical career .
" When HIV started back in the ' 80s , we knew nothing about it , " he said .
" I had no training about that .
"  " And yet I had cases back in Newfoundland and did n't know what the risks were to myself .
A lot was n't known .
It 's no different .
I just use that as one example , but there are a multitude of examples like that throughout my career .

CBC  Health officials preparing for the arrival of COVID-19 to Nova Scotia called Randall this month to ask if he 'd be willing to lend a hand if needed .
" Whatever role they want for me , I 'm here to do it , " he said .
Although he has n't been " deployed , " Randall has offered to work in what will be called secondary assessment units , areas set aside for people suspected of having the virus and confirmed cases .
People over the age of 60 are at a higher risk of getting seriously ill from the virus , but Randall , who considers himself a fit 62-year-old , does n't believe he 's putting himself at risk .
And he 's not the only doctor considering practising again .

But he said he 's not shocked to see so many of his colleagues exploring that possibility .
" There 's rarely a day in my life that I 'm not proud to be part of the medical profession , " said Grant .
" The pandemic has given rise to a call and physicians , by their very nature , even when they 're retired , are hardwired to want to help .
"  In anticipation , the college has fast-tracked the licensing process for doctors who want to practise again .
" These retired physicians are known to us , their history is known to us , their training is known to us , their competence and character is known to us , so it 's an extremely quick process , " said Grant .

Todd Watkins , managing director of physician services for the Canadian Medical Protective Association , said 326 doctors have applied so far this month to have their protection reinstated .
Of those doctors , 51 are from Nova Scotia .
" That 's tremendously out of the normal , " said Watkins .
He said the association has offered protection to the 51 Nova Scotian doctors who have requested it .
The association saw a number of physicians return to service during the SARS outbreak in 2003 , but Watkins characterized that as " a bit of a blip " in comparison to the number of doctors coming forward in recent weeks .
