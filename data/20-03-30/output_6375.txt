We see and we can relate to the pain and fear and the denial that is pressing forward outward and around all of the populace about the viral outbreak .
We can tell you that it wo n't be long lived .
It is not going to hit nearly as hard as the over hyped media want you to believe .
But nonetheless , take the precautions that you know to take .
Those who have signed off to leave will do so .
Those who want to believe they are safer and can survive will for the most part survive .
The others will be ambivalent and not care one way or the other .
Some do care if they go or stay and some are fully in fear and others are resigned they are in the twilight days of their lives .
Be assured nobody is up for grabs and no one is set to leave unless they want to .
There are many good things coming out of this insanity but most ca n't see it because of the disheveled state of the media and the supply lines .
Take precautions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense and STAY out of fear .
Just be still and sense the shifting sands and the bewilderment of the group that is trying to make sense out of things they can not .
In regards to the awaited changes , there will be a slip up and the cat will be out of the bag .
The troops will be receiving and the bankers wo n't be able to stop it .
It appears that funds will be coming within the month .
It is on the table right now !  Poof ? SUSAN SAYS  Dear Community ,  I do n't know why things are happening in the world as they are right now .
But I do know this .
If you look at everything that happens in your life from the outside , things are often going to look really bad .
However , if you look at life from the inside , things can look very , very good .
You and I can not do anything to change what 's going on outside of us .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling what 's going on inside of us .
You and I are God 's highest form of creation , and we have the power to change anything .
We can transform something that most people perceive as bad into something spectacular .
I could n't agree more with this quote from Nicole Reed :  " Sometimes , bad things that happen in our lives put us directly on a path to the most wonderful thing that will ever happen to us .
"  That 's a beautiful quote , and what she is saying happens all the time to people who refuse to let barriers break them .
Kris Carr is a remarkable example of this .
In 2003 , Carr was a 32-year-old New Yorker enjoying life .
But then , a regular checkup at her doctor 's office resulted in a diagnosis of a rare and incurable Stage IV cancer in her liver and lungs .
Instead of perceiving the news as a death sentence , Kris Carr decided to change her life from the inside out .
She started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scary diagnosis .
Carr then turned her experience into a series of successful self-help books and documentaries before eventually launching a wellness enterprise .
* Today , Karr has been " thriving with cancer " for 17 years and is revered as one of the most prominent experts on healthy living .
Do n't let the fact that we 're living in a new world , scare you .
Step into your God-given power to create any life you want .
Start thinking from the inside out .
That 's how you can see and create the really " good " stuff-a life and a world that 's vastly different than what the masses are reacting to .
It 's how you improve every aspect of your life .
And , you better believe , it 's how you put yourself in the position that Nicole Reed referred to-a path to the most wonderful thing that will ever happen to you .
" As of 28 March 2020 at 12:34 hrs GMT +3 : United States total of 104,837 coronavirus ill patients and around 1,500+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 million flu infected patients and 16,000 flu deaths from a month and a half ago .
"  The Hydroxy treatment appears to be working so far ! In an exclusive interview , Dr .
Vladmir Zelenko shares with us a preliminary study outlining that out of his 699 patients treated , he has had ZERO deaths , ZERO intubations , and four hospitalizations .
In today 's episode of Common Sense , Dr .
Zelenko breaks it down and gives a lucid explanation of the rationale behind his treatment .
If you have been following the COVID-19 outbreak , this is a do not miss !  Turning off your phone still tracks you if you have it with you .
Do this test , turn off your phone go drive a couple miles with it in your car .
Do a few things a couple stops .

So turNing off phone will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or reinvented global financial system has morphed beyond just a " good " idea , to now a necessity .
Being faced with the economic turmoil wrought from the world pandemic has only emphasized the need for monetary stability .
The deployment of efficient un-corruptible financial mechanisms will be like delivering water to a drought .
Across the planet , countries are embracing decoupling from the central banking system and migrating to the efficiency of financial technologies as a means of insuring monetary stability and curbing the interruption of supply chains .
Right now Zimbabwe is looking to partner up with ' fintech ' for a gold-backed digital currency .
" Fintech " is the intersection of finance and technology that seeks to " improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services " and it is rapidly transforming the financial services sector as we know it .
In the most recent effort to embrace the fintech revolution , that country has set out to partner up with local fintech professionals to create its first-ever gold-backed digital crypto currency .
Some predict that all that crypto needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) such as tier one assets ie : gold , platinum , silver etc .
A crypto currency is a digital currency that is created and managed through the use of " advanced encryption techniques " known as cryptography .
It uses peer-to-peer technology , which enables all functions such as currency issuance , transaction processing and verification to be carried out collectively by the network .
The problem is , while this decentralization renders crypto free from government manipulation or interference , the flip side is that there is no central authority to ensure that things run smoothly or to back the value of a crypto .
Crypto currencies are created digitally through a " mining " process that requires powerful computers to solve complex algorithms and crunch numbers .
Certain characteristics make crypto fundamentally different from a fiat currency , which is backed by the full faith and credit of its government .
Fiat currency issuance is a highly centralized activity supervised by a nation 's central bank .
While the bank regulates the amount of currency issued in accordance with its monetary policy objectives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency that can be issued .
In addition , local currency deposits are generally insured against bank failures by a government body .
Crypto , on the other hand , has no such support mechanisms .
The value of a crypto is wholly dependent on what investors are willing to pay for it at a point in time .
Also if a crypto exchange folds up and goes bust , clients with crypto balances have no recourse to get their investments back .
Fintech opens the door to opportunity for those who have been excluded from the financial system .
Fintech advances are made possible through data and efficiency .
Platforms use alternative data sources , such as utility bills and predictive information , to understand their customer 's ' financial lives and assess their ability to repay .
Relying on this data , they can create products tailored to their customers , for example providing loans based on cash flow instead of collateral .
This enables borrowers without significant wealth or assets such as a home or land to get a loan .
And as operational efficiencies increase with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work harder to reach customers who need small loans , something that traditional banks ca n't or wo n't do .
But we have to keep in mind the same data and efficiency advances that allow new customers to be included can just as easily allow them to be exploited .
Predatory lenders can target a larger , often less financially savvy audience , providing easy access to capital that comes with lots of strings attached like hidden fees and high interest rates that can lead to a cycle of over-indebtedness .
But if we take the time to come together , to learn and listen , we can leverage the reinvention of the financial sector that is already underway to create a system that is more inclusive and equitable for everyone which theoretically would be the chosen outcome of a GCR/RV .
This pandemic will flat-line economies globally , a fact that has become obvious to even the most stringent of economists .
Based on the turbulent current financial systems , the recovery process will be a daunting and time consuming operation .
Just regaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing and economic growth scenario .
Creating alternatives for how currencies are valued , a means to secure and deliver funds , open accesses to more of the public , undeveloped or otherwise untapped markets and fix the economic landslides all points to a GCR .
( see the article below )  As the markets continue to drop and the U .
looks to Congress for agreement on a massive stimulus package to save the economy from impacts of the coronavirus pandemic , the newest offer by House Democrats includes a very forward-looking kind of stimulus : the creation of a ' digital dollar ' and the establishment of ' digital dollar wallets .
' In what will send shock waves through the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry , particularly for those following central bank digital currencies around the world , this signals the U .
is serious in establishing infrastructure for a central bank digital currency .
