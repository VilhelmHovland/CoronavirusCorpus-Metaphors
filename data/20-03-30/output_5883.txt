Thanks !  Quarantine forces people into a lot of strange situations : one of which is the amusing way people are fighting off boredom .
The trademark of 2020 invariably lies in technology and the ingenious ways in which people are utilising it .
Everything from basic needs to entertainment and socialisation are now just a click of a button away for those of us fortunate enough to be at home .
At a time as strange as this , we list down some of the funniest , zaniest , most amusing things people have been doing to keep themselves occupied online .
Facebook Groups  Back in college , Facebook groups were simply used as a way for overworked class beadles to remind everyone of homework and tests .
In the 2020 pandemic , Facebook groups are now being used as a way to entertain , to connect to others , to grow passions , even to date .
With the growing popularity of very niche Facebook groups comes the advent of a whole new use for these social media tools .
Mostly , it 's a way for people of similar interests or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and content .
Sometimes , it 's a useful tool for people who share the same hobbies : culinary enthusiasts sharing recipes online , bookworms offering literary recommendations , music lovers posting personal playlists .
And other times , such as in trash talk groups , members rib at each other and joke about collective experiences and ideologies .
In total , it 's an interesting online community of sorts that brings together people that have -- in one way or another -- some kind of shared experience .
TikTok  Story continues below  TikTok 's always been a little polarising .
With a mixed bag of reviews -- you either love it or you hate it -- it 's undoubtedly become a social media giant .
So big in fact , that the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) has partnered up with them to create a public page that provides people with trustworthy information during the COVID-19 pandemic .
This only goes to show the versatility of this video platform and its millions of users .
From content that ranges from interactive dances to duets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising that TikTok has thrived during a time of quarantine .
E-Parties  From Netflix parties to Zoom meetings , this quarantine has proven that social distancing does not mean social isolation .
Some people have chosen to participate in online " e-numan " sessions , taking sips of wine or beer while talking to friends from further away .
Others simply spend time talking online or watch movies .
Dalgona Coffee  Cooking is the Internet 's latest flex during quarantine .
You 'll find loads of handy online recipes for food that do n't require plenty of ingredients .
One such example is dalgona coffee , a layer of foamy coffee mixture topped over milk .
It 's a South Korean trend that 's exploded worldwide on Facebook , on Instagram , and -- you guessed it -- on TikTok .
With only four ingredients -- hot water , sugar , instant coffee , and milk -- it 's a fun and easy way to pass some time over breakfast .
