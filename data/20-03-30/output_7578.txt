Long-sought bill that will allow alcohol shipment to Kentucky passes General Assembly  Kentuckians will be able to order direct shipments of wine , beer and spirits under a law approved by the General Assembly .

-- For years , Kentucky bourbon distillers , winemakers and breweries have pushed for a change in state law so they can ship goods directly to consumers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentuckians on vacation have tried to order products such as a case of wine from a California winery only to discover they ca n't because Kentucky 's law makes it a " no ship " state , one of just a few with such restrictions .
Now , concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on such Kentucky businesses have helped push the law over the finish line .
Last week , the state Senate gave final approval to House Bill 415 to change Kentucky 's law to allow direct shipments amid discussion about the many state businesses hurt by the pandemic and how this might help them sell their products -- including the signature industry , bourbon .
" Right now , the bourbon tourism industry is flat on its back , closed because of COVID-19 , " Sen .
Damon Thayer , the Republican majority leader , told the Senate .
" The same goes for tours of small-farm wineries and our craft brew locations around the state .
This will create a new revenue stream for those producers on the other side of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible time , but we have a lot of corporate citizens who have stepped up to aid and assist , " said Senate President Robert Stivers , R-Manchester .
Bills to ease restrictions on alcohol have had a tough time winning over conservative lawmakers in the General Assembly , but Whitney Westerfield , R-Hopkinsville , said he was willing to vote for HB 415 , in part because distilleries in his district had joined in producing hand sanitizer .
HB 415 passed 21-11 .
The change in the law is welcome and much needed , said Ted Mitzlaff , CEO of Goodwood Brewing Co .
, which has a craft beer brewery and taproom in Louisville and a brew pub in Frankfort .
" It 's long overdue , " said Mitzlaff , whose company also produces bourbon it finishes in used beer barrels .
The Kentucky Bourbon Trail , a statewide tour of Kentucky 's many distilleries and breweries steers many visitors to Goodwood 's Louisville operation , Mitzlaff said .
Support local journalism  " About 80% of our traffic in the Louisville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bourbon Trail , " he said .
" We are constantly asked , ' Can we send a case home ? ' We 're not allowed to do so .
"  Meanwhile , Kentucky tourists in other states face the same obstacle , he said .
" If you 've ever been in California and tried to ship wine back yourself , you ca n't in Kentucky , " he said .
Mitzlaff said the change will help Goodwood promote its business in other states by being able to send samples directly to distributors interested in the product .
Current law bars him from direct shipping of such samples though breweries have been known to send products labeled " yeast samples .
"  " You ca n't mail any alcohol directly out of here , " he said .
" It 's crazy .
"  Mitzlaff said any relief is welcome at a time when he and many other such operations have been forced to cancel tours and close restaurants or pubs because of concerns about the coronavirus spread .
Currently , 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on furlough , and beer and bourbon sales are down because restaurants and bars are closed statewide under one of several executive orders by Gov .
Andy Beshear aimed at limiting exposure to the virus .
While the new law allowing direct shipping wo n't mean a big increase in revenue , it will help , Mitzlaff said .
" It 's a nice benefit , " he said .
" It 's not going to be significant from a revenue standpoint but from a marketing branding and customer service standpoint , we 're very excited to see the legislation passed .
"  HB 415 would allow distilleries , wineries and breweries in or outside Kentucky to get a license to ship directly to customers .
It does not apply to retail outlets or distributors .
It limits shipments to 10 liters of distilled spirits , 10 cases of wine and 10 cases of malt beverages per month .
Such shipments must be clearly marked as alcohol products , and someone over age 21 would have to sign for the product when delivered .
