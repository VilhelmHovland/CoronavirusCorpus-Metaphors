The new coronavirus , called SARS-CoV2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over 30,000 people have died from it , according to a Reuters tally .
Doctors have seen that many of those who become critically ill from SARS-CoV2 are experiencing a so-called cytokine storm , which happens when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body 's organs .
Some researchers think drugs that can suppress the immune system , including monoclonal antibodies , might be useful for limiting this autoimmune response .
The United States has the most reported cases of any country in the world , with more than 130,000 cases of COVID-19 .
Italy and Spain have been two of the worst-hit countries in Europe , recording the highest and the second highest death toll from coronavirus of any country in the world , respectively .
Regeneron is leading the U .
trials , while Sanofi is leading trials outside the U .
