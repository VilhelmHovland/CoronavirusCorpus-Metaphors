From environmental recovery to a flicker of hope for the Zaghari-Ratcliffe family  The warning from England 's deputy chief medical officer this weekend that it could be another six months before life in the UK returns to " normal " served as a stark reminder of the upcoming battle against the new coronavirus .
Hope for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe  Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe , the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence in Tehran , has been told that she is under formal consideration for clemency .
Zaghari-Ratcliffe , 42 , was found guilty in September 2016 of attempting to stage a " soft overthrow " of the Islamic republic -- a charge she denies .
She was given a temporary two-week release from Evin prison in the Iranian capital earlier this month as part of a wider scheme to reduce the spread of coronavirus .
However , she has now been formally told that she is under consideration for permanent clemency .
Her husband , Richard Ratcliffe , told The Guardian : " I spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat .

Monitoring sensors have recorded a substantial drop in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) pollution since January - a fall believed to be " at least partly related to the economic slowdown following the outbreak of coronavirus " , says Nasa .
