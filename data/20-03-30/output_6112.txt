Nalzaro : Lack of coordination during crisis  " WE ALL have different perspectives in life .
We all take different decisions in life each day based on our convictions .
We may take wrong or right decisions knowingly and or unknowingly .
We may regard the decisions of others right or wrong reasons to judge others .
We have a choice to condemn or uplift others regardless of their situation .
May we , instead of finding reasons to condemn , find reasons to uplift others , " said book author Ernest Agyemang Yeboah .
We are facing this health emergency crisis because of this coronavirus disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) pandemic .
It 's not time to play the " blame game " or finger-point against some inept and inutile political leaders who are handling this crisis .
Instead , it 's time for unity , support and understanding to combat this dreaded disease .
As they say : The most successful leaders are able to see their role in the blame game , admit .
There is no question that the blame game can be painful for all of us at times .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hoard credit .
I am not a fault finder .
But being an outsider looking in , these are my observations as to some loopholes in the implementation and execution of the " enhanced community quarantine " ( ECQ ) , or lockdown , by our local chief executives .
First , why was the implementation of the ECQ in Cebu City and Lapu-Lapu City , both independent cities , and the Provincial Government not simultaneously implemented ? Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella placed the entire city under ECQ last Saturday noon .
Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard Chan last March 27 and Gov .
Gwen Garcia came up with her " lockdown " effective immediately past midnight on Monday .
Why did our local chief executives not coordinate for a simultaneous implementation so that there would be a harmonious coordination in the execution .
As a result of the separate dates of the implementation , there was confusion , disorder and chaos .
People rushed to the groceries , supermarkets and pharmacies to buy basic commodities .
Passengers going to the towns trooped to bus terminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not blame the people for panicking and being anxious .
I watched the Facebook live of Superbalita last Saturday night , where Governor Garcia was fuming mad as she confronted and scolded one of the policemen manning the checkpoint somewhere in Barangay Bulacao , Cebu City .
Gwen rushed to the area after receiving reports that the policeman , a certain Escobar , prohibited buses carrying passengers to the towns from leaving the city .
The policeman ordered the passengers to disembark and walk back to the city proper .
Gwen claimed she already asked exemption from Cebu City Councilor Raymund Garcia to allow buses to ferry passengers for the province as Capitol 's lockdown would still take effect today .
You see that ? Was Gwen 's request properly relayed to the police commander and down to the last element manning the various checkpoints ? I doubt .
I pitied that policeman for being the recipient of Gwen 's " acid tongue " when he was just following orders form his superior .
I know there was a similar confusion as to the implementation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program , I urged Mayor Labella to provide copies to all policemen and soldiers manning the checkpoints of his executive order for their reference .
Even in the term , they seem not to agree .
Labella uses " enhanced community quarantine " while Gwen uses " lockdown .
" According to an LGBT , " Mabayot ko , boang .
" I compared the EOs of Gwen and Labella , especially on people who are given exemptions in the ECQ .
The Capitol allows more leeway .
Earlier , Gwen vowed to close the borders between the city and the province .
Those who will enter the city can no longer go back to the province and vice versa .
She even urged employers based in the city to provide temporary shelter for their employees during the duration of the lockdown .
But it seems she is inconsistent in her stand to close the borders when she is giving exemptions to almost all sectors in the community , especially the phrase : " All other employees of other businesses may be exempted as determined and approved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loopholes in Cebu City 's version is the issuance of quarantine passes .
Labella implemented the ECQ even without preparing the quarantine passes .
What made the confusion more complicated is that there is a Q pass for residents ' mobility in the barangay and for the city , in general , to be exclusively issued by City Hall .
Why not delegate that matter to the barangays when barangay officials know their residents better ?  As to members of the media being given exemption , this should not be limited to broadcast personalities and print reporters .
There are other media workers like production people in the newspapers and TV shows and technical personnel for TV and radio .
We can not broadcast without these people .
A certification of employment and company ID would suffice their exemption .
Do we need to create a " superbody " like the Metro Manila Development Authority so there will be close coordination among local government units in times of crisis ?  SunStar website welcomes friendly debate , but comments posted on this site do not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
