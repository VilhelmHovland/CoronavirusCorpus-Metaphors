Two more cases of COVID-19 in the Porcupine Health Unit area were confirmed Monday night , bringing the total of local cases to 12 .
Both were women -- one in her 30s , the other in her 60s .
But , at least one resident who says she has exhibited symptoms of coronavirus believes the Porcupine Health Unit would discover there are actually more people infected if they tested everyone who is symptomatic .
Alison Kirkpatrick , a city resident , does n't believe there are only 10 cases in this district and questions how many people who may have the coronavirus are not being tested because they have n't been out of the country or been in direct contact with a confirmed case .
Kirkpatrick believes she has COVID-19 symptoms but she said the PHU told her they will only test her if she has travelled internationally or if she has been in contact with a person who 's been tested positive for the virus .
At this point , she does n't know if she has it or not .
On the weekend before the March break , Kirkpatrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to the Prospectors &amp; Developers Association of Canada ( PDAC ) 2020 Convention in Toronto where the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Northern Ontario is believed to have originated .
While neither of her friends showed ill effects , Kirkpatrick started to develop a dry cough on Wednesday , March 18 .
So , to be on safe side she called the health unit to report about it .
Around that time , as concerns of a spreading pandemic were growing , Dr .
Lianne Catton , the Porcupine Health Unit 's medical officer of health , told The Daily Press , " At this time , as a precautionary measure , we are recommending individuals who attended the PDAC to monitor for symptoms ( fever , cough or difficulty breathing ) for 14 days .
"  Catton advised that if symptoms develop within 14 days of the event , individuals are to self-isolate as quickly as possible and call their health-care providers or the PHU to make arrangements to be assessed for testing .
Kirkpatrick said she followed the direction .
She called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  However , she said she was told , " If you have n't been out of the country and do n't have a fever or direct contact with someone who has tested positive , they wo n't do the testing .
"  She said the person she spoke with at PHU suggested it would be fine for her to continue her activities as normal .
As , Kirkpatrick is a music teacher who instructs young vocalists , she did n't want to take the risk of infecting her students so she suspended all her singing classes .
Kirkpatrick explained she had to go to London , Ont .
, to pick up her daughter from university .
While travelling , she made stops only to fuel up while making sure to wear latex gloves while handling any gas pumps .
She said she returned home the same day without coming in contact with anyone else other than her daughter .
" My daughter now has the same symptoms as I do but we are grateful they are n't getting worse , " said Kirkpatrick .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the health unit for the second time .
They told me that I have n't had contact with anyone out of the country but I have all the symptoms now .
They will not test if you have n't been out of the country or in direct contact with someone who has been out of the country .
" So , I was told now not to do activities as normal but to assume I could have it and stay quarantined for two weeks .
The PHU told me not to call them back but to call emergency if I am having trouble breathing , " said Kirkpatrick .
The Daily Press contacted the health unit on Monday in an effort to find out the PHU 's policy on testing people who report exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 and to explain circumstances in which they would they be denied .
