ONTARIO : Gatherings of more than 5 now banned across province  TORONTO -- Ontario has introduced steep fines for price gouging and reduced the maximum size of gatherings as it works to curb the economic impact of COVID-19 while stemming its spread .
Premier Doug Ford announced Saturday that he was slashing the number of people allowed to gather at a time from 50 to five , and introduced major fines for companies involved in price gouging .
" There 's very few bad apples in companies , but they 're out there .
And I think it 's disgusting , " Ford said .
" How can you take advantage of people in this time ? Times that we 've never seen in our province or around the world .
And there 's actually opportunists out there , trying to gouge the people ? I 'm coming after them with a vengeance .
"  He made the announcement as Ontario 's Ministry of Health reported 151 more cases of COVID-19 , bringing the provincial total to 1,144 .
Another patient with the virus died on Saturday , bringing the total number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not confirmed to have had the virus but are linked to an outbreak at a long-term care home .
Medical officials say 63 people are currently in intensive care in hospital .
Ford said his efforts to prevent the artificial inflation of prices for products such as hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes include fines for company heads as high as $500,000 and a year in jail .
Corporations involved in gouging could face fines as high as $10 million , Ford said .
He urged Ontarians to report any cases of price gouging to a provincial hotline , saying each report would be looked at on a case-by-case basis , and that the focus would be on products sold at five or six times the normal price , rather than a few dollars more .
The measures come days after Ford took specific aim at specialty foods store Pusateri 's , which had been charging $30 for Lysol disinfecting wipes .

Meanwhile , the province 's top public health official said they 're making steady progress in the number of tests they 're able to complete per day .
David Williams , chief medical officer of health , said the province was able to complete about 4,100 tests per day , just shy of a goal for 5,000 tests which was set for the end of this week .
" We 're getting close to that number , " Williams said .
Barbara Yaffe , deputy medical officer of health , said they 're aiming to have the capacity for close to 19,000 tests per day by mid-April as new testing centres open .
