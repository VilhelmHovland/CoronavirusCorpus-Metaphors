OPINION  Opinion : Do n't neglect prisoners during pandemic  Understanding the epidemiology of the coronavirus is important .
But it is equally important to ask these challenging questions : Who is disproportionally affected by the pandemic and how must we , as a collective , support vulnerable populations at this time ?  A vulnerable group we can not afford to disregard is the incarcerated population .
If we ignore the them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 pandemic .

How can social distancing and proper handwashing occur in prisons when people are confined in small spaces and can not afford soap from the commissary ? There are more than 130,000 incarcerated people in the U .

During this time of social distancing , as citizens , we can collectively join forces through the use of our phones , social media platforms and letter writing to support grassroots organizations that are fighting prison overcrowding , donating bar soaps , working with stakeholders for early release of elderly inmates and providing test kits for inmates or working to create medical care centers to safely quarantine infected inmates .
It is imperative that ordinary concerned citizens join grassroots efforts to ensure the protection and safety of incarcerated populations during this pandemic .
In part , it involves resisting the temptation to see this pandemic in self-centered and ego-driven concerns .
Now more than ever , we need to act together to ensure that the most vulnerable among us are not forgotten .
