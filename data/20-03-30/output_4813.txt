A key member of an expert panel advising the Government 's response to COVID-19 has voiced her frustrations at Australia 's staged shutdown approach , warning the death toll could potentially rise if the Government did not take a " go hard , go now approach " .
Raina MacIntyre from the UNSW 's Biosecurity Program is part of an expert panel from Australia 's leading universities , which recommended an immediate but short lockdown to curb cases , an approach the Government did not take .
" I was hoping we 'd see a more comprehensive lockdown for a short period of time , but that is not the approach we 're taking , " Professor MacIntyre said .
" It 's more a trickle sort of approach , a little bit by bit , which wo n't be as effective at stopping the transmission in the community .
"  Professor MacIntyre said the majority of panellists -- including specialists from the fields of epidemiology , bio-ethics and medicine -- urged the Government to act within a short and vital window .
" The majority of people on the panel did agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said .
Trump 's fuckwit friends from Fox have come up with this " the cure 's worse than the problem " , and he 's swallowed it , HOOK , LINE AND SINKER ! Whatever happens to our American friends in the next few months could be both very tragic , and quite avoidable if sensible policies had 've been adopted .
About now .

lol , do you actually think Trump is going to jeopardise his re-election chances by gambling with the lives of his voter base ? He 's spent the last 4 years manipulating the stock markets with his tariff talk , now he 's doing the same with the ' open for business ' talk .
Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of lockdown and Trump will be talking about being open for business next month .
Saying outlandish shit , getting coverage for it , and then not acting on it is his MO .

Give it 3 months and the US will still be in some sort of lockdown and Trump will be talking about being open for business next month .

If they ai nt in lockdown in 3 days , they 're fucked .
Actually , less than 3 .
Two Victorians have died from coronavirus .
The Victorians - both men - were aged in their 70s .
other Victorians - one aged in their 30s and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensive care .
Really ? The difference between 29 minutes and 43 minutes was going to make a difference ?  Realistically if the hairdresser or the client has COVID19 they 're going to infect each other regardless of the length of time the haircut takes .
So if you 're happy with that then you may as well remove the restriction .
The changing circumstances here seems to be that Peta Credlin interviewed a hairdresser on Sky News last night complaining about the 30 minute restriction .

Do you really think that Sky News and specifically Peta Credlin is driving the government 's agendas at the moment ?  The UK are gearing up to mass distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in your system at all .
Only then we will start to get real data on infection/death rates .
Until then everyone is completely flying blind .
