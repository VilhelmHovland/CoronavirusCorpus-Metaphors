20 phrases that should be banished from Covid-19 briefings  Another day , after another night waking just after 3 , and another idea for another 20-point list whirling around my head .
This one was partly inspired by the weekend briefing by Business Secretary Alok Sharma , who scored very highly on the clich ? -ometer .
He clocked up a fair few of the phrases below .
Clich ? s are best avoided at the best of times , which these most certainly are n't .
These are times in which clear straight talking is highly recommended .
This is best done accompanied by hard fact and detail .
I remain baffled as to why the government briefings are so light on fact , though Michael Gove and Robert Jenrick gave us a few more in theirs in recent days .
I still believe every briefing should start with a clear factual demonstration , supported by graphics , of cases , deaths , and issues of capacity such as beds , masks and protective clothing , ventilators etc .
Provided he is in reasonable good health , Boris Johnson could do these from self-isolation .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all citizens is a good use of public money .
I understand why he wants to communicate directly to people .
But he can always be heard in a crisis and the money spent on a letter to everyone in the country could buy a lot of protective equipment and tests for NHS staff .
As for the phrases that it would be nice not to hear , whoever does the briefings , here we go .
We 're leaving no stone unturned .
( Show do n't tell )  We 're working round the clock .
( Show do n't tell )  We 're ramping up .
( Show do n't tell )  We 're straining every sinew .
( Show do n't tell )  We 're moving heaven and earth .
( Impossible )  100 percent focused .
( Should go without saying )  110 percent focused .
( Even worse )  Whatever it takes .
whether on tests , masks , protective clothing , ventilators , support for new small businesses , charities , Brits stranded abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly not done whatever it takes .
So drop it .
( This will be a major problem for them at the public inquiry .
)  We 're following the science .
say this only if you share the science which you are following .
( This could be a major problem for them at the public inquiry .
)  We 're putting our arms around you .
( Odd thing to say when the message is social distancing .
)  Shoulder to shoulder .
( ditto )  This is unprecedented .
( A Rishi Sunak favourite )  We have been clear all along .
The Prime Minister has been very clear .
Let me make this absolutely clear .
( Only to be used if followed by genuine clarity .
)  What we have said from the start .
Nobody is pretending .
I must level with you .
( suggests you do n't normally )  Absolute top priority .
( There can only be one , so if you use this , make sure it is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There we go .
Hope some of it is helpful to the government comms team .
And watch out later today for my piece for GQ online on 20 good things that would not have happened without Covid-19 .
The GQ Interviews  My Latest Book  Better To Live  How I Learnt To Survive Depression  by  Alastair Campbell  " Superbly readable , supremely useful .
Unflinching , clear-eyed , honest , raw and revealing , it may be the most important achievement of Alastair Campbell 's vivid and varied life .
This book could save lives .
" -- STEPHEN FRY  BETTER TO LIVE is Alastair Campbell 's honest , moving and life affirming account of his lifelong struggle with depression .
It is an autobiographical , psychological and psychiatric study , which explores his own childhood , family and other relationships , and examines the impact of his professional and political life on himself and those around him .
But it also lays bare his relentless quest to understand depression not just through his own life but through different treatments .
Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is , this is a book filled with pain , but also hope - he examines how his successes have been in part because of rather than despite his mental health problems - and love .
His partner of forty years , Fiona Millar , writes a moving afterword on how she too has learned to live with his depression .
Depression is the predominant mental health problem worldwide - it is estimated that 1 in 6 people in the past week experienced a common mental health problem and major depression is thought to be the second leading cause of disability worldwide .
BETTER TO LIVE is a call to arms and an extraordinary memoir in one compelling and inspiring narrative .
This is a book that really could save lives .
" One can only hope that BETTER TO LIVE provokes a far wider and more honest understanding of the condition " -- JON SNOW .
