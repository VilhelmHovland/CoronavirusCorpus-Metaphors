Why Are n't COVID-19 Recoveries Reported Yet By State ?  As the numbers of people with COVID-19 continues to rise , many have been asking why the number of people who have recovered have n't been included .
Michigan 's chief medical officer Dr .
Joneigh Khaldun says it 's due to accuracy at this point .
" As we get more people tested and they recover , we will incorporate that .
But it 's really so early , we do n't have an accurate number of people who have recovered , " said Khaldun .
" We want that data to get out .
We want to be transparent .
But we also want to be accurate .
So we 've been working with our hospitals .
"  Khaldun says the director of Health and Human Services has ordered hospitals to give that information to the state so it can be accurately reported .
She says they are hoping to be able to start releasing those numbers soon .
She made the comments at her and Governor Whitmer 's most recent joint press conference late last week .
As of now , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths .
