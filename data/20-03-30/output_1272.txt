All Premiership rugby clubs apart from Exeter Chiefs have announced pay cuts : 10 opted for a 25 per cent deduction , while Bristol Bears chose not disclose the amount .
Birmingham City have asked the players on more than ? 6,000 per week to defer half of their wages for the next four months , while Hearts have asked all staff to take a 50 per cent cut .
On the face of it this may appear an understandable response to an unprecedented situation , but behind the scenes a storm is brewing .
Complicated truth  Although these measures seem to present a united front , the truth is far more complicated .
While Hearts can point to clause 12 in player contracts , which gives them the right to postpone salaries if the Scottish Football Association suspends the season , the picture is different south of the border .
" Now that a number of clubs in England have done so , it 's highly likely that other clubs follow suit , but any such wage deferral arrangement requires the player 's agreement , " explains Dan Lowen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not contain a contractual right for the employer to impose a wage deferral or reduction .
"  Exeter Chiefs are the only Premiership club yet to impose wage reductions ( Getty Images )  Clubs can ask players to take pay cuts and hope the collective pressure is enough to persuade them .
But despite the statements giving the impression of unity , not all players are accepting .
" I know lots of rugby clubs have come out and said : ' Everyone has got to take a pay cut .
' But it 's not as simple as that , " one agent told City A .
" We had a player who had been offered a two-year contract .
That has been removed and then he 's had an email saying that for the long-term sustainability of the club they 've got to cut wages by 25 per cent .
Well , there 's no chance he 's taking it , because he 's got to think about his long-term future .
" I think it 's going to continue for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things like that where guys have n't agreed to the amendments to their contracts .
"  Avalanche of claims  If clubs impose a blanket wage reduction despite some players not agreeing then they are leaving themselves open to later litigation .
Players will be able to claim for unpaid wages , or could even use the incident to walk away from clubs because Fifa rules class a change in terms as grounds for termination .
Hearts have asked staff to take a drop in salary of up to 50 per cent ( Getty Images )  With no clear guidance from the Premier League , English Football League or Professional Footballers ' Association , clubs and players have been left to fend for themselves .
The PFA told City A .
they will hold further meetings this week " with a view to formulating a joint plan to deal with the difficult circumstances " , but for the time being confusion continues .
" Without further clarification , there 's certainly a possibility for an avalanche of potential claims coming from players who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pasricha , head of sport at Mackrell Solicitors .
" I anticipate a huge amount of conversations are going to happen between clubs and their players .
We 're going to start a big negotiating period .
"  Universal acceptance  These problems are currently mainly being experienced in Premiership rugby , Scottish football and the lower leagues of English football , but the stronger financial position of the higher tiers will not hold for long .
Pasricha believes that although there is no contractual obligation for players to accept pay cuts , a " universal acceptance " that they are necessary to get through a crisis -- and potentially save clubs from insolvency -- may hold for a few months .
" Six months , however ? We may start to see the relationship between the player and club significantly tested , " he adds .
Fifa is reportedly working on some " guiding principles " on the subject , but with 211 member associations to govern , Lowen says it is not an easy task .
Instead , Pasricha believes the guidance needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We may see a wave of potential claims unless there is a collective agreement involving the player unions such as the PFA and Fifpro on a global scale , which can seek to support players during these unprecedented times .
