' There 's no blueprint ' - Virus upends college recruiting  After Michigan lost to Ohio State in the semifinals of the women 's Big Ten Tournament , coach Kim Barnes Arico and her staff immediately hit the road .
They intended to take advantage of a full week off before the NCAA Tournament by making visiting as many potential recruits as possible .
" That was our window .
You get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build relationships .
Helps build so many things , " Barnes Arico said .
" We had all these things scheduled until we went to see high school championships .
"  Those championships were canceled , of course .
So was the NCAA Tournament , and just about everything else across sports because of the coronavirus .
That includes the crucial recruiting period for college coaches who were putting the finishing touches on the 2020 class and laying the all-important groundwork for next year .
The NCAA has barred in-person recruiting until at least April 15 .
The Collegiate Commissioner 's Association , which administers the letters of intent used by Division I and II athletes , followed with a suspension on all letters through the same date .
The result ? No college coaches packed into suffocating high school gyms .
No coaches milling around airport terminals , waiting for the next flight to some out-of-the-way place .
No chance to shake hands with mom and dad and make a pitch that ultimately hold the fate of your career in their hands .
" March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April and May had recruiting weekends .
Home visits are all gone , " Barnes Arico said .
" When the calendar comes back , June is n't a home-visit month .
What will happen ? "  It 's a similar story for college football , baseball and a myriad other sports .
There is a pervasive sense of uncertainty that has coaches on edge as they try to navigate recruiting amid a pandemic .
" I think recruiting is more of an inexact science right now than it ever has been , " Kansas coach Bill Self said .
" Just knowing your own numbers and how to attack that -- how can you commit to something now that you do n't know what will exist , and the rules behind that existence ? I think there 's a lot of programs up in the air .
"  The Jayhawks are one of them .
Like most programs , they are largely done with their 2020 recruiting class .
But they 're also awaiting the decision of leading scorer Devon Dotson , who is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could potentially open up a late scholarship for Self and his staff to fill .
" What you do , " Self said , " is you recruit like you 're going to have more scholarships when you do n't end in the end .
"  What does that recruiting look like , though ? How do coaches that so value in-person visits , whether they happen on their own campus or in the homes of a prospect , build the same kind of relationships when face-to-face contact is impossible ?  After all , there is only so much video that a coach can watch .
So many text messages they can send .
Just like many businesses these days , technology is helping to fill the void .
FaceTime and Zoom video conferences allow coaches to see athletes as they talk , and kids are increasingly posting workouts on YouTube for coaches to see .
Throw in the rapidly expanding transfer portal , where dozens of experienced college players are searching for new homes , and the recruiting landscape is more challenging and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on being really organized , " Connecticut coach Danny Hurley said .
" We 're just going to have to be a little creative in the way that we 're able to present information to potential recruits , without the ability to get them on campus and without the ability to meet them for the foreseeable future .
There 's no blueprint for this one .
"  For coaches who prefer a decidedly old-school approach to recruiting , such as Miami 's Jim Larranaga , the loss of face-to-face opportunities is a difficult hurdle to overcome .
" I think social media has too much misinformation , " Larranaga explained , " and I feel like one-on-one is better .
I want to talk to a young man .
I want to have a conversation .
I do n't want to be posting , tweeting , Instagramming .
"  Eventually , the coronavirus lock-downs will be lifted , travel will resume and life will return to some semblance of normal .
High school athletes and college transfers will be allowed to visit campuses , coaches will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-round recruiting grind will begin anew .
Or will it ? Kentucky coach John Calipari is n't so sure .
In fact , he hopes the disruption caused by the pandemic will help to reshape the recruiting calendar , leaving a lasting change that could benefit coaches and athletes alike .
" I 've been saying since I was at UMass , ' Eliminate summer recruiting , ' and everyone thought I was crazy , " Calipari said .
" How about we spend time on our campus with our players ? How about this thought ? The coaches right now , like , have a normal life .
We 're like , bored -- cleaning garages .
We 're reading books .
We 're in the backyard breathing for the first time .
We 're sleeping good at night .
Why do n't we do this in the summer so we can have normal lives in what we do ?  " We 're not taking three months off , " he continued , " it 's just you 're on campus , you 'll have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
How about this ? This is a crazy thought : Let 's take a two-week vacation where we can just go with your family , leave your phone at home .
There 's things that I 'm hoping come out of this .
