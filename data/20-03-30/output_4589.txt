Cochlear could be first crack in deluge of emergency equity raisings  Over the past week , fund managers and investment banks have been compiling lists of companies that will likely be lining up for emergency equity raisings to deal with the financial devastation wrought by COVID-19 .
The ear implant maker 's move to fortify its balance sheet will spook some investors who see it as one of the sturdier companies in Australia , and one whose business will rebound when the COVID-19 crisis is over .
( Cochlear said the cost of adverse litigation was also a factor in debt levels rising beyond the board 's comfort level .
It estimates it will be forced to pay out $483 million in damages , and potentially as much as $238 million in pre-judgement and interest costs .

During the GFC , there was a tendency for companies to hold off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make it through .
Cochlear could be the first crack ahead of a deluge of companies seeking equity capital .
Go in early , get a better deal  But if there are lessons to be learned from the 2008-2009 period , when businesses raised more than $160 billion in equity , it was that those who went to sharemarket investors early got a better deal .
As share prices continued to fall , companies had to increase the number of new shares offered during rights issues and placements , and the discounts of their offers to the prevailing share price got steeper .
Those that went to equity markets early received a better reception from fund managers , despite the fact that the first round of GFC raisings came from heavily-indebted property companies .
According to an ASX study during 2009 , over half of all ASX-listed companies raised some additional equity capital .
" Of the top companies , around 80 per cent of S&amp;P/ASX 200 index companies raised capital , and they accounted for around 90 per cent of the total amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that " issue discounts required to attract investor interest did widen in 2008 and 2009 to counteract reduced investor risk tolerance and reduced market liquidity " .
As the GFC became more prolonged , fund managers became more discerning about which equity issues to support .
' It all comes down to price '  At this point , fund managers say the door will be open to equity raisings , but as one senior operative said , " it all comes down to price " .
Cochlear is looking to get its issue away at a 16 .
per cent discount to the last trading price - which in this environment is not especially steep .
Cochlear may have opened the floodgates to a wave of capital raisings .
Braig  The additional problem for investors when deciding whether to support a capital raising is the inability to estimate valuation .
One commented that he had never seen such a deluge of companies walking away from their profit targets , noting that when this is thrown in with an oil shock it makes forecasting very tricky .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of coronavirus casualties it may be too late to access the markets .
Others will hope that the range of government measures to flood the system with cheap debt and support workers will be enough to tide them over until demand recovers .
Where the GFC was more a financial crisis , coronavirus has created a financial , economic and health crisis .
As such it has spread beyond the first wave of corporate casualties in areas like education , travel and leisure .
Loading  Retail , services , manufacturing , construction media and even mining companies are now scaling back operations in response to government distancing rules .
The companies most stretched will be those with high fixed costs and shrinking revenues .
And plenty fit that description .
To date , Cochlear is the first of the large cap companies to hold out its cap .
Ooh Media and Webjet are taking the temperature of investors in the hope of securing funds , but neither seems to have yet sealed a deal .
For fund managers , more so than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding losers .
