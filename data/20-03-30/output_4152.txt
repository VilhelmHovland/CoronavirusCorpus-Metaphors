Court in Limerick during Covid-19 crisis : If only we could lock it up .
Reporter :  Donal O'Regan  21 Mar 2020  Email :  **30;2191;TOOLONG  0  Reporter , Donal O'Regan describes what a day in court was like this week  A SURREAL day in Limerick Courthouse began with an application for the transfer of a pub licence and ended with a defendant telling the judge he liked the colour of her hair .
Monday morning in the modern Mulgrave Street building is normally teeming with people but this week it was eerily quiet .
This is law and order during the coronavirus crisis .
My footsteps echoed as I climbed the stairs .
Gardai were vetting those going in to court number six .
It was like a queue for a nightclub albeit with a two metre gap between patrons .
Only people before the court were being left in .
The female garda politely asked a man to wait outside because he was accompanying his partner during her matter .
My turn .
" I 'm a reporter with the Limerick Leader , " I mumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked .
Believe it or not I have never been asked for identification before in almost 15 years in this game .
I never bothered getting a National Union of Journalists card .
" No , " I said .
I had a flashback of being a 17-year-old trying to get into The Venue in Charleville many moons ago .
" Who is the normal court reporter ? " asked the garda .
I knew this one - David Hurley , I said .
It was like being ushered into the VIP section of a club after dropping a celebrity 's name .
Thanks Dave .
Once inside people were dotted around the courtroom like pieces in a bad game of chess .
I took my place on an empty bench .
Prison officers were n't as lucky as they had to keep bringing defendants in and out of the cells .
Gardai too had close contact with members of the public as they were handed insurance documentation and the like , and answered queries .
Solicitors could n't obey the two metre distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients .
You ca n't really shout " I 'm guilty as sin but do your best for me " in a courtroom .
" Going forward all non-urgent matters will be adjourned .
Keep your distance from each other .
When your business finishes please leave the room  " We 're in unchartered waters .
We will take it as it comes .
We will do our best to work together , " said Judge O'Leary .
The first case was a successful application for the transfer of a pub licence .
" It 's not a great time to be starting , " said Judge O'Leary , who wished them well in the future .
Sergeant Sean Murray asked for dozens of adjournments .
" Similar application , " he uttered again and again .
The court clerk put some back to July and others as far out as September .
Let 's hope for all our sakes - if not for the defendants - that they do go ahead in July .
At one point there were three men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for health reasons , " said Judge O'Leary .
It was a reminder of the times we live in .
At this point I had an overwhelming surge to sneeze .
Through sheer willpower I suppressed it .
I felt like an alarm would have gone off if I did sneeze .
Even being held in contempt , perhaps .
One man was up for picking up a crutch and striking the security glass in a part of University Hospital Limerick on March 3 .
His solicitor said he was brought to hospital due to his deteriorating mental health .
They added that the man has a history of alcohol and drug misuse , had recently been made homeless and his partner was pregnant .
" He apologises to the hospital staff and gardai .
His mental health was in such a bad state he was n't aware what he was doing , " said the solicitor .
Judge O'Leary said this is the " last thing the hospital needs " before fining him ? 300 .
A number of lengthy bail applications meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the last case was called it was just the judge , court clerk , gardai , prison officers , the defendant , his solicitor and this reporter .
The strange day ended when the defendant told the judge , " I like the colour of your hair " .
" Thank you , " smiled a startled Judge O'Leary as she wished a Happy St Patrick 's Day to one and all .
Under very stressful conditions and at a very trying time - the judge , court clerk , gardai , prison staff and solicitors got on with business professionally , efficiently and cordially .
If only we could lock up Covid-19 .
