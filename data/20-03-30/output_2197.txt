The Quebec government began restricting travel to and from eight remote regions of the province and began posting police along the province 's border with the United States to track returning travellers as four more deaths from COVID-19 were reported for the province on Saturday .
Deputy Premier Genevi ? ve Guilbault announced the latest measures at the government 's daily briefing on the evolution of the crisis as the latest figures showed a further increase in cases of the new coronavirus in the province .
The four latest deaths bring the number of fatalities in Quebec to 22 , while the number of confirmed cases jumped by 477 from Friday to Saturday .
Quebec now has 2,498 confirmed cases of COVID-19 .
Another 6,757 cases were under investigation as of Saturday .
The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 also rose from Friday to Saturday , to 164 .
Of those , 57 patients are in intensive care .
With a local state of emergency already declared in Montreal , one of the province 's " hot spots " for the coronavirus , Guilbault said the government was now introducing measures to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a vulnerable population , she said .
As of 4 p .
Saturday , police installed checkpoints on major roads to restrict travel to and from eight regions : Bas -- Saint-Laurent , Abitibi -- T ? miscamingue , C ? te-Nord , Nord-du-Qu ? bec , Saguenay -- Lac-Saint-Jean , Gasp ? sie -- ? les-de-la-Madeleine , Nunavik and **29;271;TOOLONG .
The police will stop travellers at the checkpoints and allow only people who are travelling for essential services and for emergencies to get through , Guilbault said .
Emergencies could include humanitarian workers , such as from the Red Cross , in the event of a flood , she said , offering an example .
Quebec public health director Horacio Arruda , who accompanied Guilbault at the briefing , called the restriction on travel a " filter " that 's aimed at delaying the spread of COVID-19 to the eight regions .
" They 're regions with more vulnerable people , older , more problems with diabetes and other ( conditions ) , more at risk than the population in general , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 were in different regions of the province , and all of the victims were over 60 years old .
Most were in their 80s , he said , while two were in their 90s .
Another three were in their 70s .
Most of them with chronic diseases , such as cancer .
The second measure announced by Guilbault 's Coalition Avenir Qu ? bec government concerns Quebec 's " snowbirds " who are driving across the province 's border with the U .
Border crossings are the jurisdiction of the federal government , however the provincial government is taking additional steps to ensure travellers understand its directives to self-quarantine for 14 days upon returning to Quebec , Guilbault said .
The provincial government dispatched police to the Quebec-U .
border as of 9 a .
Saturday , Guilbault said .
Part of their role is to inform returning Quebecers of their obligation to remain isolated at home for 14 days in case they 're infected with the coronavirus , she said .
That means no excuses for leaving their homes , such as to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
At the same time , the police are also collecting information on the travellers to allow for subsequent follow-ups to ensure they 're obeying the quarantine period , Guilbault said .
" Right now , our objective is the U .
border , " she said , when asked by reporters why Quebec was not setting up similar checkpoints at inter-provincial borders .
Guilbault did n't rule out a similar measure for provincial crossings at a later point .
But , she added , the public has been worried about returning ' snowbirds ' , or Quebecers who spend winter months in warm places like Florida .
News media have reported isolated incidents of snowbirds who have violated the 14-day self-quarantine order to visit grocery stores .
" We 've noticed there are perhaps people who are not familiar with the precise directives that must be applied , " Guilbault said .
She added : " we want to do as much as possible to say to a maximum number of people who cross the border " that there are directives requiring them to self-isolate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a reason not to apply them .
"  Guilbault led the daily briefing while Premier Fran ? ois Legault had what his deputy called " a well-deserved day off .
"  The Parti Qu ? b ? cois endorsed the CAQ government 's decision to ban non-essential travel in the eight regions .
In a press release , the PQ 's interim leader , Pascal B ? rub ? , said the ban was in the interest of people living in the regions , far from urban centres , notably because they have less access to medical personnel and equipment than cities like Montreal and Quebec City .
Also on Saturday , the PQ announced the immediate suspension of its leadership campaign because of the pandemic .
The party also announced it would suspend fundraising as of Monday .
The party was to choose a new leader in June .
