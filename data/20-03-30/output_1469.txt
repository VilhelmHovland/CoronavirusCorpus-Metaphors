Will the trend of live streaming live well past the pandemic ?  Details  Janice Tan  30 March 2020  Virtual events and streaming is fast becoming the new norm as the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic continues .
Major marketing events have turned their attention to the world of digital .
Adobe , for example , has taken its annual Summit online , while Microsoft 's Build developer conference was also turned into a digital event earlier this month .
One medium that goes hand in hand with virtual events is live video .
Facebook , for example , saw the number of views for Instagram and Facebook Live in Italy double within a week , Alex Schultz , VP of analytics , and Jay Parikh , VP of engineering said in a recent blog post .
Meanwhile , Cisco 's Webex is experiencing an " all-time high " when it comes to monthly , weekly and daily active users , CNBC reported .
Quoting App Annie , CNBC also said that Zoom is currently the most popular free app in dozens of countries .
As of 21 March , its stock also rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand of virtual technologies soar sky high now , it is worth wondering that if and when the virus clears , will these companies still thrive ?  In a statement to Marketing , CEO of Dentsu Aegis Network ( DAN ) Singapore Prakash Kamdar , said the trend that is currently unfolding is " likely not one-off " .
Therefore , it will fundamentally change the way the live events industry operates and de-risks its business in the future .
When it comes to live streaming sports and gaming , in particular , Kamdar said the idea of watching and interacting with athletes and talent as a whole through live streaming platforms is only gaining more traction , especially with younger audience segments .
" If online gamers can stream their games for others to watch , so can physical world gamers those who play on gaming consoles , " Kamdar said .
Even musicians have turned to live streaming during these trying times , from well-known artists such as Diplo , John Legend and Charlie XCX on Instagram , to indie musicians such as Marc Rebillet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal for live events , sporting or otherwise , will without doubt be heavily influenced by the events and circumstances of the last two months .
" This is because the events have just about brought the industry to its knees , thus forcing it to rethink its future business model , " Kamdar explained .
Like Kamdar , Thanendran Thanesvaran , head of sports marketing , Reprise Digital Malaysia also agreed that digital platforms will garner the most engagement , especially with more consumers staying at home .
" This is already in motion with many events offering a pay-per-view experience .
It will be interesting to observe this trend once restrictions are lifted as consumer behaviour will likely adapt towards this new norm , " he added .
Marketing will be bringing back Content 360 for another year following a hugely successful conference in 2019 .
This time we are going virtual ! The event will bring together industry leaders to discuss challenges and share insights on future content marketing trends , as well as successful strategies to help tackle the complex marketing landscape .
Sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the multi-sensorial experience of physically attending a live event , Kamdar said in this volatile , uncertain , complex and ambiguous world , recent events will led event organisers and sponsors to rethink their business model to include a strong live streaming format component .
The most obvious advantage of live streaming is the convenience of making audiences attend their events with little effort required .
Live streaming also offers a greater reach .
Quoting Adobe Analytics , Kamdar said this year 's Super Bowl in February was the most live-streamed Super Bowl in history , delivering an average per minute audience of 3 .
million , up 30% over last year and up 103% over FOX 's last Super Bowl stream in 2017 .
Live streaming also allows for greater engagement and interactivity through features such as providing trivia or real-time stats during the broadcast .
Such resources are normally not available right at consumers ' fingertips and Kamdar said it will allow audiences to feel more connected to event , or a team should it be a sporting event .
Another crucial about live streaming is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase tickets to the next live stream and player biographies or merchandise , can entice people to take the next steps to support their team , and bring in more revenue , " he explained .
Drawbacks of live streaming  However , live streaming events will still require extensive consideration of practicalities - especially when it comes to sporting events .
Ian Loon , CEO , Publicis Media Singapore said these include considerations such as the health safety of individuals behind the scenes , and whether millions of dollars should go into facilitating an F1 race without live ticket fans , for example .
" There seems to be more health and commercial risks than returns for most , " he added .
What these event brands can do , especially for those who have painstakingly archived and curated years and decades of content from past events , is to consider how to release and engage their fans with their legacy , digitally , Loon explained .
For example , the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and Turner Sports can offer all fans a free preview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 April .
The complimentary offering will provide consumers with all games from the 2019 to 2020 season , as well as an expansive archive of classic games and content .
Similarly , the National Football League ( NFL ) in the US is offering its NFL Game Pass free of charge to US and international fans until 31 May and 31 July respectively .
The complimentary access offers game replays , as well as NFL game archives and shows .
" Stories of how sporting nations , events , celebrities and fans picked up after previous global or regional crises would go far to show that even during such painful times , there is hope and optimism that things will get better , " Loon added .
Meanwhile , DAN 's Kamdar said technical errors such as slow internet connection can be frustrating and ruin a viewing experience .
Live streaming can be a double-edge sword for monetisation too , as some platforms do not offer pay-per-view sales , subscriptions or ads , he said .
As with all live events , it is the multi-sensorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Since this is an area that live streaming would not be able to replicate , Kamdar said event organisers would need to think hard in order to achieve an " as close enough " experience .
Additionally , since live streaming is unlikely to replace the multi-sensorial experience of physically attending a live event , event organisers would need to think hard about  Agreeing with him is Reprise Digital 's Thanesvaran who said watching sports , in particular , is an experience of its own .
Athletes are averse to playing in an empty stadium .
Similarly , fans also wish to witness the drama in-person at the venue .
" A sport is only as great as the fans , and in American football , it 's said that the 12th man takes the team over the line .
So , no amount of cheering at your screen will help your team , " he added .
