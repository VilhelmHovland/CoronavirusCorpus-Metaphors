Nancy Pelosi took politics to a new low over the weekend by blaming President Trump for coronavirus deaths .
CNN 's Chris " Do n't call me Fredo " Cuomo is spinning a narrative that Trump wants to sacrifice old people to help the economy , and leftwing pundits actually seem happy about the latest coronavirus numbers .
All that and more on today 's show !  Speaking with CNN , Nancy Pelosi blamed President Trump for coronavirus deaths .
Despite all the actions that are being taken , Pelosi said that Trump " fiddles while people are dying .
"  CNN 's Chris Cuomo attacked President Trump by claiming the president wants to sacrifice the elderly in order to get the economy going again .
All of a sudden , " every life matters " is the new slogan for the left .

So the real question is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the Left plays the obstructionist they are handicapping those who believe both can be done , if we use our energy and resources to accomplish it rather than having to waste time and money fighting a rear guard action from individuals who are already so sick from a mental disease it appears they are incurable , even when faced with their own destruction .
Seeing how heavy handed cops have ALREADY been with just red-flag law Raids on folk , i 'd rather NOT GIVE THEM MORE power .

backpacker on 12:26 pm March 30 , 2020 at 12:26 pm  Hey FREDO Cuomo , How would opening up the economy kill the " old " people , since the people in their 70 's are retired and not working and the younger people are not supposed to visit them ? But , that is to be expected from you , Fredo Cuomo , since you liberals do not think , because there is nothing between your ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so irresponsible .
cuoma .
Go back 20 or 30 years .
Do you not remember these comments about rationing of care in an epidemic ? Are you a total idiot ? Has a virus taken control of your brain ? I believe something has .
Maybe it is just the Democratic party that has warped you .
That 's why she was on an extended vacation , then took Thursday off for her birthday .
Ooops , did I spill it that the media was only told they were waiting on people returning to the Capitol ? Let 's not forget she tore up the Senate 's bill and put out her own , without a flying chance of passing because she understands people need to buy food .
She is now calling for an inquiry into when Trump first heard about COVID-19 and when he first acted .
Guess she can put Nadler and Schiff in charge of it since they do warrantless searches of phone records .
Texas Lt Governor Dan Patrick said -- " are you willing to take a chance on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves for your children and grandchildren And if that 's the exchange , I 'm all in .
So , my message is that , let 's get back to work , let 's get back to living , let 's be smart about it , and those of us who are 70 plus , we will take care of ourselves but do n't sacrifice the country .
Do n't do that .
Do n't ruin this great American dream .
"  So if Pelosi suggests that 's the President 's view ( and remember Trump wants everyone at church on Easter ) , it 's " OUTRAGEOUS " , but if good ol ' conservative Dan Patrick says that , he 's just being patriotic and supporting Trump and the American dream .
But while the numbers infected and dying keep rising , the supplies keep getting smaller and our ability to manage this keeps getting overwhelmed , at least Donald is there to remind us how GREAT his TV ratings are .
That speaks volumes about the narcissistic side of our president -- in the midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brag about his TV ratings -- just as long as there are lots of eyes on him .
The ignorance and utter contempt for the American people is truly beyond compare from Pelosi .
The willingness to allow Americans lives to be ruined while attempting to smear trump is mind boggling .
How does she not understand that the typical American who is not an elite D .
or hollywood type actually cares about the economy and working again as our lives actually do depend on the economy ? This is why Trump 's approval continues to improve while Pelosi , and the democrats , continue to plummet .
Trump is showing he has the ability for critical thinking and wants to keep American 's safe while at the same time giving us the opportunity to survive after this passes .
On the other hand , all Pelosi and the dems have is a pathetic attempt at smearing the man who is showing he actually does desire the best for Americans .
Any American who votes democrat is voting against the well being and success of the American people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party that is speaking out of the side of their mouths and are the champions of abortion at 9 months have all of a sudden become the champions to save the elderly population ; when is their hypocrisy going to end ! ! These people do not get it ! !  The rhetoric that is coming from the left and the media tells me that this COVD-19 move is nothing more than a hyped flu season hoax orchestrated by the billionaires ( Gates , Soros , Clinton , Styer , Chinese Communist Government , and Russia ) and the rest of the Sewer Creatures in order to make President Trump look bad , but little do they know it is backfiring on them once again ! !  Pelosi and the democrats were elated when the corona virus pandemic began to harm America .
They are beside themselves that Trump 's approval has not gone down .
Rather , it has improved .
They saw this as the opportunity they were waiting for to take trump out .
They did not see this as a time for helping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was past we would still have the means to survive .
So they are instead concentrating on attempting to harm The president by any means necessary .
Democrats never let the suffering and death of Americans go to waste .
Common sense would do more to prevent the spread of the virus than all of these draconian rules .
If people would wash their hands often , practice social distancing , stay home when ill and stop hoarding we would be fine .
Those with underlying conditions need to take more precautions but most people could go to work and get the economy going .
Stop treating grown people like children and grown people need to start thinking and being considerate .
Unfortunately , people are NOT obeying the stay-at-home orders .
I 'm in Massachusetts .
My upstairs neighbors ( in their 20s ) were having a Coronavirus party Saturday night !  Rate this item :  No votes yet .

jmotte3 on 4:12 pm March 30 , 2020 at 4:12 pm  Yes we do n't need any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stay home when ill " , we would n't have any problems .
It 's obvious that the " draconian rules " are overkill -- I mean even with them , we have the most cases in the world .
so let 's just ask people to " Stay home when ill " because the medical experts have pointed out that you are infected long before symptoms show .
The problem is that no matter what we write here it will not make any difference regarding her being in office .
And the people that can make a difference must think she is just great because they keep voting her in .
It is the voters in her district in California that need to have a change of mind , if they have one that is .
We all know how Pelosi is a detriment to the USA , the message is not reaching in any fashion to the voters .
Ole saggy bags never misses an opportunity to show her unmitigated stupidity .
I truly wonder if this woman is as completely clueless as her comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinnacle of the evil self serving politician ? Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in between .
Perhaps she is an evil statist collectivist left wing pig in the same vein as her predecessors Ted Kennedy , Harry Reed , etc .
but is too dumb to be able to disguise her ultimate ideology and intentions .
This pathetic libturd " thing " needs to listen to her daughter , who stated she wished all conservatives get the current virus , and die .
Well then , I wish all ******** get the virus and die .
Then and only then , will America survive .
This woman is despicable .
She 's worried about old people , really ? She does n't give a whit about the homeless on her streets in CA , nor does she give a whit about all the babies lost to abortion and all of a sudden we 're supposed to believe her when she makes these outlandish statements .
She needs to retire or be retired by the voters in her district .
What a disgrace she is as a woman , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be me , but I notice that Democrats in general root for bad things to happen in this country when not in power or trying to get elected .
When the crash of 2008 happened just before the election , Obama 's campaign cheered .
Why get elated over bad things .
Of course when he was elected there was only one way for the economy to go -- that is up .
Took longer than it should have .
Now with Trump they are looking at the calendar to see if this can continue for a while .
I guess if one is named Cuomo in NY politics or the press , one must be fully qualified to be a jerk .
As far as Nancy goes , she is one truly rotten person .
I lived in her district in SF for awhile and never saw her there .
Now she is too busy getting drunk at her winery .
President Trump is doing a great job in trying to fight this virus while Nancy and Chuckie were trying to impeach him and then they put pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their ilk .
After years of listening to the filth being spewed by the left , I do not dislike the National Democratic Socialist Party , I detest them .
Nancy Pelosi , Joe Biden , all the democrats in Congress , and all the state run media folks at CNN and MSNBC are acutely feeling the weight of President Trump 's unparalleled success since his election .
They are at a complete loss as to what to do .
They fear there will never be another democrat elected to the highest office in the land so they have jointly decided upon a strategy of acting like five year olds who had their candy taken away .
They cry , whine , act like victims , need therapy counseling , and fabricate stories that , they hope , will negatively impact Trump .
When these children realize a story backfires on them because Trump is lightyears ahead of them in intelligence , they just fabricate another one -- hoping for a different outcome .
It 's very sad .
but mostly , it 's very funny and entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run media folks .
PLEASE , keep talking !  Clearly the commucrats do n't want the brilliantly planned trashed economy to recover -- EVER .
It 's the same old scene over &amp; over &amp; over .
They create a crisis so they can call the repubs murders , racists , zenophobs while their " solutions " further destroy America and the repubs fall for it over &amp; over &amp; over instead of growing conjones to STOP them .
Even Trump got rolled by evil Pelosi .
She deserves the worst death possible .
WE HAVE TO TAKE BACK THE HOUSE and rid our world of that ***** .
