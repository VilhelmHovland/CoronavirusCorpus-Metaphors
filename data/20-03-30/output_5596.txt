AA Edit : Centre must plan for Lakshman Rekha  The Lakshman Rekha poses no hazard to those who have an assured income but what about the 50 crore daily-wage earners ?  A homeless woman sleeps on a deserted platform of the Lokmanya Tilak train terminus in Mumbai .
( File photo : AP )  Finally , India has got into a lockdown fighting the Covid-19 pandemic .
About 130 crore people have been advised not to get out of their homes except for essentials , as part of a mammoth effort to break the chain of infection .
Prime minister Narendra Modi , announcing the decision in a televised address to the nation on Wednesday , advised people not to breach the ' Lakshman Rekha ' for the next 21 days , lest we set the nation back by 21 years .
The prime minister has also announced a Rs 15,000 crore package to boost the healthcare sector .
Modi has assured the nation that the Union government is working with the states to ensure that the supply of essential commodities is not disrupted .
The home ministry has followed up on the prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockdown .
While whatever the government has announced is welcome , what has been left out is worrying .
The Lakshman Rekha poses no hazard to those who have an assured income but what about the 50 crore daily-wage earners India has ? The prime mnister was silent on them .
Several states , including Kerala , Tamil Nadu , Uttar Pradesh and Punjab have announced schemes to ensure that marginalised people do n't go hungry .
But we see no national effort to put in place a comprehensive plan , backed by the Union government with its financial muscle , for their well-being during the lockdown period .
There are thousands of migrant labourers who have set out for their homes anticipating the lockdown but are stranded en route with no food , money or transport .
We do n't know who will take care of them as the prime minister 's advice to people is to remain wherever they are .
The industrial sector has been asked not to cut down on salaries or wages but has been given no assurance on a help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcements on easing statutory filings have come as a disappointment ; her assurance to come up with plans later are less than reassuring for the economy .
All that we have seen till now from the Union government are pieces of advice to the people on their conduct .
Now , the Centre must come up with its own action plan .
Nations have already done it : The United States has prepared a $2 trillion economic stimulus package .
Britain , another big casualty , has announced a 330 billion pound programme while France has come up with a 45 billion euro booster dose for the economy .
Various estimates say Covid-19 could bring down India 's GDP by about 0 .
per cent to 0 .
per cent , which could impact people at the lowest level of the economic ladder the most .
The states which are in the forefront of the fight against the pandemic have been given no assurance on Central support ; many are asking the Centre to at least clear the GST arrears that are due to them .
It is time that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that more people will die of hunger than of Covid-19 during the lockdown and to handhold the economy out of the tough times .
