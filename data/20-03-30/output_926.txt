Twitter confirmed the company locked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's daughter out of her account for a short period of time due to a tweet she sent about Republican Sen .
Rand Paul that it said amounted to an endorsement of violence .
" The account owner was temporarily locked out for violating the Twitter rules against glorification of violence , " a Twitter spokesperson told the Washington Examiner on Tuesday .
Christine Pelosi tweeted Sunday that the man who allegedly attacked the Kentucky senator in 2018 was " right " for doing so .
Pelosi was reacting to news that Paul had been in contact with members of Congress after being tested for the coronavirus but before he got his test results .
He ultimately tested positive .
Pelosi 's tweet appears to have been taken down when her account was suspended .
Twitter rules state , " You ca n't glorify , celebrate , praise or condone violent crimes , violent events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group , or the perpetrators of such acts .
"  This includes , the company says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious physical injury .
"  Paul 's Bowling Green neighbor , Rene Boucher , was charged with assaulting a member of Congress after tackling Paul while he was mowing his lawn , according to prosecutors .
The Kentucky Republican suffered six broken ribs and a bruised lung as a result of the attack .
Paul has come under scrutiny for how he handled his now-confirmed coronavirus case .
" The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined , " Paul said in a statement Monday .
" It was my extra precaution , out of concern for my damaged lung , that led me to get tested .
"  Pelosi 's account appears to be active as of Tuesday afternoon , retweeting California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and criticizing President Trump .
Keep in mind that Trump has CANCELLED the White House Easter Egg Roll which is always the Monday after Easter .
If he puts it back on , we will know he is serious about his deadline .
