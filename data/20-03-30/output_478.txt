" I think they do .
They are siding with China .
They are doing things that they should n't be doing .
They 're siding with many others .
China 's the least of it , " Trump said during a White House briefing on the coronavirus in response to a question from One America News ( OAN ) .
" So why they 're doing this , you 'll have to ask them , " he added .
" If we had an honest media in this country our country would be an even greater place .
"  The president spoke to reporters for roughly an hour during a briefing on the virus .
The focus was intended to be on efforts to fast-track antiviral treatments and therapeutics for those suffering from the novel coronavirus .
ADVERTISEMENT  But remarks about those efforts , as well as remedies for a slumping economy and the push to increase testing capacity , were overshadowed by Trump 's exchange with OAN , which tends to be favorable to the president .
" Thank you very much , " Trump said as he called on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  OAN 's Chanel Rion then claimed that major media outlets who " work right here at the White House " are " consistently siding with foreign state propaganda , Islamic radicals and Latin gangs and cartels .
"  " It amazes me when i read the things that I read , " Trump said , launching into a lengthy diatribe against The Wall Street Journal , The New York Times and other major media groups that he took questions from just moments earlier .
Those same outlets had reporters expelled from China this week as the country cracks down on critical coverage .
He accused the press of inaccurately reporting on chaos within the administration , even as top administration officials have had their roles in combating the virus reshuffled and the White House press shop has not pushed back on those reports .
" I hope I came up with the term , but it 's fake news , " Trump said .
" It 's more than fake news , it 's corrupt news .
"  " Someday , hopefully in five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , " he continued .
" I will have done a great job .
Because I do n't think anyone 's done as much in three-and-a-half years as I 've done .
"  The White House is relying on many of the same media organizations Trump attacked on Thursday to get out critical information about the virus .
The administration announced Wednesday a partnership with NBCUniversal , ViacomCBS and ABC/Walt Disney Television to broadcast public service announcements about how to slow the spread of the disease .
Trump -- who has earned praise in recent days for taking a more serious tone toward the virus -- frequently veered off topic on Thursday .
He opened his remarks with an often rambling 20-minute statement in which he touted " Right to Try " legislation , boasted about the strength of the economy prior to the recent swoon and struggled to pronounce drug names as he laid out therapeutics in the works .
The president chided the press throughout the briefing , quipping at one point that " 75 percent " of journalists should leave the room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been diagnosed with the coronavirus , and the disease has killed roughly 150 people in the U .
as of Thursday morning .
