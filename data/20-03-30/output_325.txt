Infected man had associated with more than 50 people : Minister  Health Minister Pavithradevi Wanniarachchi today expressed her utmost disappointment and anger when the Police and Health authorities detected a 67-year-old COVID 19 infected individual who had dodged quarantine for more than a week and suspected of having infected over 50 other Sri Lankans in the last few days .
The patient from the East has come back to Sri Lanka after a two week stay in India on March 18 and travelled to many parts of the country and associated with more than 50 other persons .
" After he realized that he had fever and breathing difficulties , he had gone to a famous private hospital in Colombo where he was diagnosed for viral infection .
When he sought inbound treatment , the doctors and private hospital authorities refused and asked him to enter a government hospital .
But he had not done so and until last Monday has travelled widely and associated with many people , probably infecting dozens of people , " Minister Wanniarachchi said .
The action of this man is unacceptable and highly irresponsible .
He may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad and unfortunate if people behave like this ignoring the facilities provided by then government to protect the people from this viral infection and ignore the advice of health officials , the Police , the Army an the media , she stressed .
Minister Wanniarachchi said the man who has been admitted to the IDH - Angoda would be charged under the Criminal Procedure code and Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance .

Banish him to the boossa prison .
Wijayananda Jayaweera Friday , 27 March 2020 07:56 PM  Why the private hospitals have not been asked to contact the health authorities immediately in the instant of finding someone infected with Covid-19 .
It should be the responsibility of the private hospital to hand over the patient to health authorities .
Nihal Friday , 27 March 2020 07:58 PM  North Korean type punishment is the best option , and lesson for others too , social justice for rest of the people of the country .

Its sad these are happening in the Colombo in areas close to temple trees .
These medical officers should n't PP at their homes and put other neighbors in danger .
The so called closest police station officers frequent this places and oversea such practices .
Terrence Thambyrajah Friday , 27 March 2020 08:24 PM  Why did n't the Doctors in the Pvt Hospital contact the Govt Hospital directly and transfer the individual .
He is a layman , who would not have taken the illness seriously .
Doctors should have known better .
Sam Lesha Friday , 27 March 2020 08:31 PM  authorities should publish the name details and the photograph of the perpetrators here after  Gp Friday , 27 March 2020 08:31 PM  This person must and should be prosecuted .

of Health ?  wimal ellepola Friday , 27 March 2020 08:46 PM  Why did not the private hospital immediately notify the proper authorities ?  R .
Friday , 27 March 2020 08:48 PM  Action Needs to be taken against Private hospital as well .
They should directly handover the patient to Government authorities or informed them .
irresponsible work by private hospital authorities .
RIkzy Jezuli Friday , 27 March 2020 08:56 PM  It is clear that the man willingly avoided quarantine procedures .
This should be treated as an act of terrorism .
IT is the fault of immigration authorities Friday , 27 March 2020 09:00 PM  Problem starts with the integration authorities for not notifying his arrival from India .
From now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev Wetara Mahinda Friday , 27 March 2020 09:01 PM  If this piece of in formation was correctly and responsibly published , it implies that the private hospital that involved in the diagnose of his disease allowed him to leave and act freely .
Practically and above all legally this private hospital must have taken prompt action to hand over him direct to a government hospital rather than simply asking him to enter such a hospital .
the Government should have made it legally compulsory for all private hospitals to act like that in the case of patients affected with corona virus , in particular , at this crucial hour .
By 18th all arrivals were quarantined .
So how come this criminal escaped from Airport .
raza Friday , 27 March 2020 10:30 PM  Why treat him when he has no confidence in State Hospitals .
Sajith Friday , 27 March 2020 10:50 PM  Typical behaviour of minority communities , always think they are above the law and demand special treatment , then play the victim when things go wrong .
After knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well .
Don Friday , 27 March 2020 10:53 PM  The doctor in the private hospital also equally liable .
why he did not call the police or health inspectors and handover him  suren Friday , 27 March 2020 10:57 PM  They also held a gathering for 70 .
Punish as hard as you can legally  Ranjith Pathirage Friday , 27 March 2020 10:58 PM  I suspect that this man from East purposely did it .
He may be belonging to the same terrorist gang who did the Easter Sunday attacks .
So check his background and you may uncover more insight onto it .
Put him under lock and 24 hour CCTV .
Otherwise he might infect the health care workers as well .
Dee Friday , 27 March 2020 11:30 PM  Much publicity was given to other patients where they were who they are etc .
Why the silence ? No point in comments !  Chanakya Friday , 27 March 2020 11:44 PM  This criminal who returned to the island on March 18th was lucky to dodge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport to slip this devil and how many were able to avoid screening on that day at the airport .
These airport screeners are traitors .
They should be punished for treason ; the maximum punishment .
No bailout waiting for trial and no early release if imprisoned .
