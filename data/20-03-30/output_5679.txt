FOCUS : Silver 's path ahead unclear in COVID-19 crisis  Monday , Mar 30  By Rituparna Ghosh and Roshni Devi  NEW DELHI/MUMBAI -- As the world grapples with the spread of the coronavirus and fears of a global recession , silver is the metal stuck in the middle .
A rush-to-cash-or-gold situation has weighed on the argent metal due to a slowdown in industrial activity across the globe amid the rapid spread of the coronavirus globally , with most countries currently in lockdown .
Industry experts remain divided over their outlook on silver as some believe that a rise in gold prices may help silver gain , while others think the rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic situation may weigh on demand and prices of the metal .
According to some optimistic views , silver prices may remain under pressure in the near term , but staying invested should be the right call as other asset classes may be in for worse days .
" Let the market stabilise and we may see silver prices rebounding .
The strategy for investing in silver would be to get it at a cheap valuation price and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year to see silver prices rallying gradually , " Tata Asset Management Head of Commodities and Strategies Aurobindo Prasad Gayan said .

The historical average for the gold-to-silver ratio is around 50 .
" Silver is getting a bigger lift than gold currently because of the arbitrage opportunity .
Investment demand and long-term hedgers will also come in because these price levels are attractive .
As silver is seen as an alternative to gold , and gold is already at elevated levels , people are finding it cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money Senior Manager Research of Commodities and Currency Pranav Mer said , adding that silver exchange-traded funds are rising sharply than gold .

Globally , 60% of the demand for silver is from industrial fabrication as it is widely used in catalytic converters , thermal and electronic conductors , and is ideal for electrical applications .
The lockdown in many countries to contain the spread of COVID-19 has prompted many industries to suspend operations , weighing on the demand for silver .
As analysts point out , a revival in industrial activity , despite stimulus by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given the current backdrop , the established co-relation between gold and silver has gone for a toss .
So , it is very difficult to project what market is actually pricing in , " YES Securities Lead Analyst Hitesh Jain said .
" The only element that can support silver is that if things deteriorate further and gold spikes higher than the gold-silver ratio can catch up .
Otherwise , the industrial side of the equation is not very rosy .
"  In a risk-averse scenario such as this , investors feel that an upward trend in gold will help silver prices rise to some extent .
" Once we see gold resuming its upward momentum , silver prices may also recover .
Silver has slumped to multi-year lows and while some recovery is likely owing to a general upbeat outlook for gold , overall sentiment will remain weak unless economic activity picks up or we see significant ETF inflows .
Either scenario looks less likely in the near term as virus outbreak threatens economic activity , " Kotak Securities Head of Commodity Research Ravindra Rao said .
