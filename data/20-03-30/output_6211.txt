It unclogged a five-point starter pistol to prevent us from getting sucked into what Governor Shaktikanta Das called a ' black hole .
' The raft of measures were akin to surprises hidden like raisins in a fruit cake .
From a 75 basis points repo rate cut taking repo rate to a 11-yearlow of 4 .
per cent to 3 .
lakh crore liquidity boost to regulatory forbearance , Das pulled an all-rounder making the week long wait for monetary stimulus worth its while .
Just as dawn follows dusk , SBI sprung into action reducing rates by full 75 bps effective April 1 .
Interestingly , repolinked home loan rates will touch an all-time low of 7 .
per cent as against 7 .
earlier .
However , a decision on MCLR-based rates for both existing borrowers and fresh loans will have to wait till next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all term loans such as home , auto loans and even credit card dues .
For companies getting knocked down due to the 21-day lockdown , he offered both deferral of interest payments and flexible working capital financing for better credit flow .
The reduced repo rate will lower interest rates and monthly EMIs , while the 100 bps reduction in Cash Reserve Ratio will free up 1 .
lakh crore liquidity .
As it is , the banking system is flush with funds , yet Das decided to inject another 2 lakh crore via targeted longterm repo operations and easing the marginal standing facility for banks .
In essence , for banks capital is as unlimited as sunshine , but the only thing that 's missing are borrowers .
Amid the prevailing demand slump , fewer customers are taking out loans resulting in an anemic 8 per cent credit growth till February But Crisil expects that Fri .
day 's measures will tur n growth-supportive once the economy starts humming , though no one knows when that will be .
As for growth , expectations of a global recovery in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves fell by a whopping $11 .
billion to $469 .
billion last week as the RBI pumped dollars into the market to stem the slide of the rupee , which hit an alltimelow of 76 .
against the dollar on March 23 from a decade-low have been uncermoniously dashed , while chances of large parts of the global economy slipping into recession appears certain .
For now , Das confirmed that India 's estimated 5 per cent GDP growth for FY20 is clearly at risk , but he offered no clues where we are headed next .
The unprecedented uncertainty scared our central bank so much that it even refrained from looking into the middledistance .
Inflation , in which RBI has a record of missing its own estimates , will likely sof- ten in summer , but again Das gave no forward guidance .
Rough translation : we do n't have the power over economic forecasts that you think we do during such crises .
That said , RBI stands battleready and Friday 's measures appear to be a first in its war efforts to combat the virus .
The central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but kept all of its conventional and unconventional policy arsenal very much on the table , which means , it 's yet to shoots its bolts .
