The upcoming National Prescription Drug Take Back Day scheduled for April 25 is postponed due to the ongoing coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
DEA will reschedule Take Back Day for a date shortly after the health crisis recedes and national emergency guidelines are lifted .
The health and safety of our communities is a top priority for DEA .
Given the overwhelming public response to past Take Back events and the anticipated large turnout for April 's event , DEA determined it would be prudent to suspend the event until safety concerns are mitigated .
During this time , those seeking safe drug disposal options are encouraged to visit the DEA Diversion Control Division locator page .
