The body trucks arrived last week .
If you did n't know what you were looking at , you might not have taken a second glance at the unmarked white trailers parked outside some of New York City 's largest medical centers .
But in the city that has become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in America , the non-descript trucks are just one more reminder of the grisly reality we are all facing .
As bad as it is right now , the situation is expected to worsen over the next few weeks , as hospitals hit their capacity and cases continue to rise .
Over the weekend , morbid videos emerged showing hospital employees in full protective gear , loading bodies into the refrigerated trucks .
In one viral video , a bystander can be heard breaking down as he filmed the scene outside Brooklyn Hospital , where a forklift was being used to move what appears to be bodies from the hospital to the truck parked outside .
" Please pray for us , " the man pleaded .

On Saturday , an average of one person died every nine minutes in New York City .
On Sunday alone , 98 people died within a span of just seven hours .
As of Monday morning , New York City had more than 36,200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , including nearly 800 deaths .
The entire city only has enough capacity for 900 bodies to be stored , so officials asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) for help setting up makeshift morgues .
The city has reportedly purchased 45 refrigerated truck trailers , each capable of storing up to 44 bodies .
Those , combined with tents set up as makeshift morgues , will give the city capacity to hold up to 3,600 bodies .
The last time New York City faced a mass casualty event of this scale was on September 11 , 2001 .
Steve Kasspidis , of Mount Sinai Queens hospital in Astoria , Queens , described the situation as " biblical " and said it feels like being in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get intubated , they die , the cycle repeats , " he told Global News .
" The system is overwhelmed all over the place .
"  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has warned that half the city 's 8 .
million residents should expect to get #COVID19 before the deadly pandemic comes to an end .
" 9/11 was nothing compared to this , " he added .
" We were open waiting for patients to come who never came , OK ? Now they just keep coming .
"  Calls to the city 's 911 medical services have reached more than 6,500 per day -- the highest volume on record , surpassing even 9/11 .
Medical professionals are n't the only ones bearing the brunt of the deadly pandemic .
More than 500 members of the NYPD have tested positive for COVID-19 , and three have died .
On Sunday , nearly 5,000 of the department 's nearly 24,000 officers called out sick , leaving the police department operating without 14 per cent of its workforce .
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 among NYPD officers to surpass 900 on Monday .
With an estimated 28,000 residents per square mile , New York City is by far the most densely populated city in the United States .
Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week that half the city 's 8 .
million residents should expect to get COVID-19 before the pandemic comes to an end .
The peak of the pandemic is projected to hit New York City within a matter of weeks , according to Gov .
Andrew Cuomo , but even with thousands of additional beds at field hospitals and emergency shipments of medical supplies , the sheer volume of severely ill patients is expected to far exceed capacity at the city 's hospitals .
At hospitals across the city , doctors are preparing to confront a grim new reality , as many will likely soon be forced to make decisions about rationing life-saving medical equipment .
" The deluge is here .
Our ICU is completely full with intubated COVID patients .
We are rapidly moving to expand capacity .
We are nearly out of PPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meredith Case , an internal medicine resident at Columbia/New York-Presbyterian Hospital , wrote in a March 25 Twitter thread .
Case said hospitals are having trouble discharging stable COVID patients because they are being refused by nursing homes and other long-term care facilities -- a problem that is greatly exacerbating existing shortages .
" The only beds we 've been able to free up are people who have died , " said one doctor at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens .
With city morgues reaching capacity , hospitals across New York City are turning to refrigerated trailers to store the bodies of deceased COVID patients .

The tragedy that is unfolding here is compounded by the nature of the virus .
Because of the high risk of infection , family members are prohibited from visiting their loved ones in the hospital , so most COVID-19 patients are dying alone .
In some hospitals , even non-COVID-19 patients are affected by the restrictions .
" Imagine being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality for more than just #COVID19 patients as hospitals ban visitors for everyone , " Stanford physician Roxana Daneshjou wrote on Twitter last week .
Chinazo Cunningham , a faculty member at Albert Einstein School of Medicine and internist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx , said on Twitter that the current crisis is the worst she 's seen in more than 25 years of practicing medicine .
" COVID19 is decimating our health care system .
PPE is so scarce .
Physicians are scared .
Patients are scared and dying alone .
We have so little to offer , " she wrote .
Funeral services are also affected , with restrictions placed on who can attend private ceremonies and burials .
In most cases , only immediate family members are allowed to attend funeral services , and gatherings are limited to 10 or fewer people .
Some funeral homes are even requiring attendees to stay in their cars .
" This is going to be one of those moments they 're going to write and they 're going to talk about for generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a moment that is going to change this nation .
"  For the nation 's largest city , it already has .
Everyone knows someone who is sick .
Most of us know someone who has died .
And all of us are just trying not .
