You 're scared , I 'm scared too : A nurse on life on the Covid-19 frontline  Nurses are the first people you 'll meet if you think you have Covid-19 .
Here , one of our frontline workers describes the rapid changes both healthcare workers and the public are facing .
As told to Josie Adams .
I was working at an urgent care clinic in East Auckland when the first reports of Covid-19 came out of Wuhan .
A couple of coworkers and I did some basic calculations based on the reports , and we came up with a mortality rate of around 2% .
We thought it would all be OK .
We were wrong .
Within a week , we were testing possible cases in the car park .
Everyone was on alert , and there were patients who already thought they might have it .
One man who worked for border control presented three times .
We assessed his symptoms , took his recordings , a history , and provided advice and reassurance each time .
He was not sick .
I had one guy ring me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get swabbed -- now ! " I ran him through the checklist and he was negative for everything .
He had a headache and had vomited .
Once .
You get a lot of people who have one symptom and think they 've got it .
That in no way means we do n't have compassion for the worried .
People like to maintain any control they have , real or imagined , over their lives .
They think if they stock up on toilet paper they 've got it sussed , and they 're in control .
The reality is : absolutely not .
People will do a lot of things to make themselves feel better .
That 's why some turn to homeopathy , or similar practices .
They want to believe it offers assurance .
Some others think that if they eat broccoli every day they 'll never get breast cancer .
The likelihood might be reduced , but it 's never eliminated .
You do n't have absolute control over what happens to you .
As an essential worker , I control what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm at risk .
I come home and take my shoes off outside the door , I put all my clothes in the laundry , and I get in the shower .
I do n't touch anything else until this is done .
When the government announced we were moving to level three and then four , I was in a break room with four other nurses .
Most of them paused , and then wept , quietly .
There was a stunned silence and fear , which I imagine was pretty much the universal reaction .
There 's something called the R0 number , and that basically tells you how contagious an infectious disease is .
If you 've seen the movie Contagion you might be familiar with it .
We do n't know exactly what Covid-19 's R0 number is , but it 's obviously really high .
If this were n't so contagious , we would n't be so worried .
If you get a small group of people who are infected with the disease , and they 're locked down , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we 're trying to achieve with alert level four .
But if you cast that net wide and get a whole lot of people infected , then you 're going to see what happened in Italy .
A lot of infection , and a lot of death .
Italy has an excellent healthcare system .
They have 12 .
intensive care beds per 100,000 people .
That 's great .
In New Zealand , there are about 4 .
That 's what scares me .
If things get bad , and lots of people get sick , you 're going to see a bottleneck .
I 'm also losing work .
I was scheduled to do flu vaccination work at educational institutions and offices over the next couple of weeks , but that 's out .
I 've heard people compare Covid-19 to the flu .
In some ways it 's a poor comparison , but they do both kill people .
At the GP clinic I worked in last week we were doing drive-by flu shots , which is novel .
I 'm thinking of offering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on .
Please call ahead .
( Photo : Getty Images )  I 'm an agency nurse , which means I go where I 'm needed .
Every day my income changes .
I 'm worried I wo n't have one at all .
At this point , I do n't even know where I 'm working in two days ' time , let alone next week .
Clinics all over the country are condensing their services .
Many are no longer doing vaccinations , booked , or routine procedures .
Hours are reducing for doctors , nurses , and lab techs , many of whom are contractors like myself and not salaried .
There was a woman who called asking if she could still get an ultrasound of her shoulder -- no .
Not now .
It 's not essential .
There was a baby due for its six-week vaccinations , and we told the parents not to come in that morning .
There was a cluster of sick people outside , and you do n't want that baby caught in that .
On that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bad idea .
The Ministry of Health is encouraging people to stick to their vaccination schedules .
You 'll get your shot , in the safest way we can manage .
People need to hold off , which scares them , but they need to know that 's not forever .
The point is that they need to hold off for now .
We 're just getting new processes and protocols in place .
Everyone is doing their best .
I have seen so much compassion from doctors and nurses .
The prime minister and her government are putting emphasis on the need for kindness and compassion at the moment -- shit yeah .
When could that be wrong ?  People expect us to be on their side , and we are .
We do get tiresome questions , but you know what ? No-one 's asking them to be a pain in the neck .
They 're asking it because they 're scared , and you have to bear that in mind .
These people ringing Healthline and their GP , asking " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to feel like they have a handle on things .
When patients tell me they rang Healthline and they were " bloody useless " , I tell them exactly what Healthline said with a little extra kindness and give them a bit more time to talk ( I can afford to -- Healthline ca n't ) .
You have to make people feel they 're on the right track if you want them to have any hope .
Doctors are , sometimes , available for a face-to-face .
There are illnesses that still require seeing a doctor , things like strep throat ; you need to be seen , you need to be swabbed , and you need antibiotics .
There 's no way around that .
You will need to call ahead , be met at the door , and given a mask .
Every patient needs to be asked the Covid-19 screening questions .
This is , as they say , the new normal .
I understand you 're scared .
I 'm scared too .
I ca n't control much ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit me .
