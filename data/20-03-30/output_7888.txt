Adapt and overcome : reflections on life during the COVID-19 pandemic  Before our headlines and newsfeeds contained almost exclusively COVID-19 news , who could have imagined the transformation our daily lives would undergo at both work and home ?  Dr .
Leff and her daughters before distance learning ever entered their minds .
Just when you feel you have a handle on work and family life ( or are getting there .
) , the bottom falls out .
I 've been working in a private small animal hospital for just under 13 years and am a mom of two girls , ages 7 and 11 .
I have always considered myself fortunate to have a job I love and a wonderful family to come home to at the end of the day .
But like billions of people throughout the world , my life has taken an unexpected and drastic twist in recent weeks .
With the world at the mercy of a pandemic , we have had to make major adjustments in every aspect of our lives .
Life at home  With 10 years of higher education and three degrees under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be put into the position of having to teach common core fractions to my 11-year-old .
Yet we have been catapulted into just this scenario as schools throughout the country close their doors .
While each family is unique in how they have approached this time , I have found that providing my girls with a schedule has helped them maintain a sense of normalcy and allowed them to motivate themselves to accomplish their daily required studies .
Many type A personalities ( me included ) are forced to navigate a scary time when we are not in control .
I have found comfort in giving myself permission to be a little less than my perceived ' perfect .
' Things may not be ideal right now , but we have learned as a family that there is more than one way to accomplish a task .
A walk or bike ride around the block is a wonderful way to relieve stress and get some exercise , but it can be considered physical education .
Baking a batch of brownies incorporates math and science ( and provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
While these approaches are not used in classrooms , they prove effective when used in the home by parents , most of whom are not professionally trained teachers .

Life at work  Veterinarians provide care for those without a voice , we work with clients who are concerned about their pet 's wellbeing and we make accommodations for every possible situation .
If only these were our sole worries .
Unfortunately , this stressful time is teaching us also to be jugglers performing a balancing act , dealing with new stressors at both home and work .
As new challenges pop up on a daily basis , and we must find ways to keep both staff and clients safe while still providing the best possible veterinary care .
While practice protocols are tweaked daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly stronger than ever and the flexibility of our staff is admirable .
Our client interactions are for the most part curbside and over the phone .
Physical exams are no longer done in the presence of the owner and we have stepped away from the pleasantries of a handshake or pat on the back .
One thing is for sure : At the end of the day our focus is still on providing the best medical services possible to keep our patients healthy and our clients happy .
Worries about payroll and keeping the lights on are ubiquitous as we are forced to limit appointments .
One good thing about our veterinary community is that we stand strong .
We have been educated to be problem solvers and contributing members of our communities .
Add to those responsibilities the need to be the model of stability at home , and you have the life of many veterinarians .
We are not alone  I think it is important to step back and revisit the situation from a bird 's eye view .
My intent is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shed light on the fact that we are not in this alone .
We have a strong veterinary community that is pulling together to make things better .
People will continue to love and provide for their pets during and after this pandemic .
Our days may look different , but we are resilient and we will come through this stronger .
I hope that this forced change in our " used to be " everyday life will permit us time to slow down and appreciate just how lucky we really are as a society .
I know that I will be sending an email to my girls ' teachers to thank them for everything they do to create a positive learning environment for children .
Life and work during the COVID-19 pandemic are unusual , uncertain and unpredictable , it is now more apparent than ever that we must work together to get through it .
