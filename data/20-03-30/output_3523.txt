Home births stopped after coronavirus hits maternity staff  Hospital shake up also sees all hospitals ' children 's emergency services moved to Whittington  EXPECTANT mothers have been told to rule-out home births after NHS hospitals suspended the service .
Whittington , Royal Free and University College hospitals have introduced a range of " temporary changes " to ensure maternity services remain safe during the coronavirus outbreak .
A statement from the Whittington said : " Due to the impact of the pandemic on maternity staffing , alongside the other trusts in North Central London we are temporarily suspending home birth services .
" We know that these are extremely difficult times and we want to do whatever we can to reassure women due to give birth and support them to have a safe delivery in line with their birth choices .
Are you pregnant or a new parent during the coronavirus crisis ? Tell us how you are managing by emailing **32;153;TOOLONG  " This has been an extremely tough decision for us and the other hospitals involved , given the importance of respecting and honouring the birth plans that women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labour ward through the entrance on Highgate Hill , rather than the main entrance in Magdala Avenue .
The hospital wants to " reduce the number of people walking through the hospital and make it easier for people to remain two metres apart " .
There has also been a major change to children 's services as part of the shake-up that is designed to ensure patients without the virus can be cared for without fear of infection .
The idea is to free up space in designated hospitals for coronavirus patients .
As part of this , UCLH is moving all emergency services for children to the Whittington , entrance in Mandala Avenue , from this morning ( Monday ) .
Any children requiring admission will then be transferred by London Ambulance Service to Great Ormond Street Hospital for on-going care .
All children inpatients services will be carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital .
