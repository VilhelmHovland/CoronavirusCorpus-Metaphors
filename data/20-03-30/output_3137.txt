Britain 's biggest rent-to-own retailer will next week become the latest corporate casualty of the coronavirus outbreak when it collapses into administration , putting 2,400 jobs at risk .
Sky News has learnt that BrightHouse is to appoint Grant Thornton , the accountancy firm , as administrator within days after its investors withdrew support for a proposed restructuring .
The insolvency will reinforce fears of a cataclysm on the high street as non-food retailers close their stores - potentially for a period lasting several months .
BrightHouse , which provides loans to consumers to purchase electrical items such as televisions and washing machines , trades from 240 stores across the UK and has roughly 200,000 customers .
Sources said an announcement was likely to be made on Monday .
Its administration is likely to mean that customers with outstanding mis-selling complaints will receive only a fraction of the sums they are seeking .
A spokesman told Sky News on Friday : " The national response to the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our staff and customers , in particular by closing all stores in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively engage with our stakeholders , these developments have made the task of finding a future for BrightHouse more challenging .
"  Although BrightHouse 's problems are long-standing , insiders said that discussions with regulators and other stakeholders about restructuring its liabilities had evaporated after the COVID-19 outbreak .
Administrators are expected to put the business into effective run-off by continuing to collect outstanding loans from customers .
Some new lending activity may also continue for a limited period , sources indicated .
BrightHouse has been hit a surge in customer compensation claims in recent months , continuing a trend which has seen other short-term lenders including Wonga and QuickQuid disappear .
A previous restructuring in 2017 was designed to put the business on a more stable footing .
That deal resulted in two big US-based investors , Apollo and Highbridge Capital , and retail turnaround specialist Alteri Investors becoming the largest shareholders in BrightHouse .
One of the options which had been explored in recent months was a scheme of arrangement to deal with mis-selling claims , although discussions with the Financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconclusive .
Separate conversations also took place with the Financial Ombudsman Service ( FOS ) , which adjudicates on complaints .
Claims have been costing BrightHouse about ? 1m every month , although executives are understood to believe that the eventual toll will be far greater as claims management companies deluge it with complaints .
In results issued to bondholders last month , BrightHouse said it was conducting a strategic review to maximise value for stakeholders .
This included a shift away from rent-to-own activity and towards cash loans .
" We have disclosed a contingent liability with respect to the uncertainty around the future volume of claims and the potential outcome of the test cases under discussion with FOS , " the company said .
" The level of redress claims from customers is putting increasing pressure on the available liquidity in the group .
"  The entire rent-to-own sector has been struggling since the imposition of a price cap by the FCA last year .
This means customers can not end up repaying more than double the cost of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British consumers up to ? 22 .
annually .
Christopher Woolard , the acting boss of the City watchdog , said in his role as executive director of strategy and competition last year that rent-to-own firms were frequently overcharging their customers .
" We will review the impact of the price cap in 2020 and if further work is needed to protect these customers we are prepared to intervene again , " he said .
In 2017 , the FCA ordered BrightHouse to repay nearly 250,000 customers for failing to act as a " responsible lender " .
More than 80,000 people had not been properly assessed by BrightHouse for their ability to repay their loans , which accrue interest at such a rate that the cheapest washing machine available to customers ended up costing them more than ? 1,000 .
Anth Mooney recently stepped down as BrightHouse 's chief executive , and was replaced by Alan Gullan , an experienced turnaround executive .
