' Social distancing ' in the times of a pandemic became a farce as state governments struggled to cope with the exodus even on the fourth day of the lockdown .
Thousands of migrant workers from northern states were seen scrambling to board buses to get home at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border on Saturday as a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus stripped them of livelihoods and shelter .
The nationwide lockdown entered its fifth day on Sunday .
The Uttar Pradesh government had arranged for nearly 1,200 special buses after distressing images emerged of exhausted workers marching home in the absence of public transport .
However , the buses made available on Saturday were too few -- there were 10,000 to 15,000 people at the Anand Vihar bus depot at 9 .
pm , and only 60 to 70 buses , Shahdara Deputy Commissioner of Police Dinesh Kumar Gupta told PTI .
More than 500 more buses were due to reach by midnight , he said .
Anand Vihar is a major interstate bus terminal close to Delhi 's border with Ghaziabad district of Uttar Pradesh .

There was a stampede-like situation at some points , with Delhi Police officers on standby carrying lathis and loudspeakers .
