Unprecedented social distancing measures used to combat the coronavirus have kept Jack Eichel inside his Buffalo home since the Sabres ' season was suspended March 12 .
Eichel 's workouts are limited to his personal gym and instructions are delivered by his various trainers on video conference calls .
The 23-year-old captain has spent his down time listening to his collection of vinyl records , reading informative books or magazines and , like the rest of us , sitting on the couch watching television .
" Just trying to stay busy is the biggest thing , " Eichel said during a conference call Monday .
It 's unclear how long Eichel 's new routine will last .
The National Hockey League 's initial return-to-play plan was altered after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended against gatherings of more than 50 people .
The longer the pause lasts , the less likely the Sabres will be able to play their final 13 games .
Eichel , like Sabres coach Ralph Krueger , is holding out hope that he and his teammates can achieve some closure .
However , even the hockey-obsessed Eichel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
For once , Eichel is having trouble focusing on the sport in which he 's become a superstar .
" Yeah , I mean , I think you can always run through a million different possibilities and scenarios in your head , " Eichel said .
" You always want to try and have yourself included in the mix , in the playoffs .
But I think at this moment , everyone 's just sort of , I think their minds are off of hockey and just kind of trying to figure out how to control this pandemic the best we can and just figure out a way to be safe and stay healthy through the situation .
In my mind , obviously I love hockey and it means so much to me , but I think right now it 's kind of been put on the back burner .
A lot of my thoughts go toward my family and health and the people I care about and all the people that are dealing with this .
There 's so much more at stake right now than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Eichel was forced to talk hockey Monday when he was one of eight Atlantic Division players to address the media in a video conference call .
He expressed well wishes to his fans in Buffalo and his hometown , Boston , while providing a glimpse into his life that , in some ways , has been turned upside down .
Eichel spoke about the importance of everyone doing their part in combating the spread of the pandemic , which has overwhelmed health care systems and halted sports across the globe .
He also revealed that his mother , Anne , who works in ambulatory surgery at Boston Medical Center , is home while his father , Bob , recovers from shoulder surgery .
" Obviously , you would n't want her going in , " Eichel said .
" It 's such a high risk and credit to all the medical professionals that have been on the front lines and really taking this thing head-on .
When you have a loved one in that situation , you just want them to be as safe as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom is at home right now and doing her part in self-quarantining .
"  Eichel has resisted the urge to make the six-and-a-half hour drive to visit his family in Boston .
Text messages have served as his line of communication with teammates , coaches , team trainers and General Manager Jason Botterill .
The Sabres have n't been together since March 12 , when their plane arrived in Buffalo following an unusual series of events in Montreal .
Eichel was at a team dinner the previous night when news broke that the NBA was suspending its season after Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for the coronavirus .
Buffalo 's coaching staff , including Krueger , arrived at Bell Centre the following morning , only to be told to return to their hotel .
Each of the league 's 31 teams were awaiting word on next steps , though the Sabres were n't expecting to play their scheduled game in Montreal that night .
Eichel explained the situation became " a lot more real " that weekend when the NHL and Sabres provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The league has since had four players test positive for Covid-19 : two from the Ottawa Senators and two from the Colorado Avalanche .
It 's uncertain when team facilities can reopen to players , many of whom returned to their permanent residences overseas .
Travel restrictions , including border closures , remain in place around the globe and the coronavirus has spread rapidly in North America over the past two weeks .
If hockey 's return does not include finishing the regular season , many NHL players , Eichel included , face the possibility of not competing in a game for seven to eight months .
The IIHF World Championship , which typically features NHL players on nonplayoff teams , has been canceled .
While other superstars have provided their own return-to-play scenarios -- New Jersey 's P .
Subban envisioned a 31-team tournament to determine the Stanley Cup champion -- Eichel was not eager to offer his thoughts on the topic .
" I think it 's tough to say what the rest of the season might look like because , to be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows much right now about what the future holds for us just because of the fact that I really do n't think the world knows what 's going to happen , " Eichel said .
" I think with just that , you know , obviously we do n't want to have that much time off .
I really just do n't know how to go about predicting what 's going to happen over the next few weeks because it 's so unknown .
"  The unknown affects the Sabres differently than other teams .
Buffalo 's 30-31-8 record had it on track to miss the playoffs for a ninth consecutive season , despite the Sabres receiving a career-high 36 goals from Eichel .
It 's possible they wo n't be able to finish a first season under Krueger and pending free agents might be impacted financially .
Eichel is maintaining hope he 'll return to the ice soon .
There are more lessons to be learned for a team that played its way out of the playoff picture in the weeks leading up to the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excel when intensity increased in March games .
But Eichel sat in his home on the second-to-last day in March , talking about the double-platinum Marvin Gaye record hanging on his wall and how much he enjoyed George Mumford 's book , " The Mindful Athlete .
"  The effectiveness of the measures that halted the Sabres ' season will determine when Eichel 's life , and the life of others around the globe , will return to normal .
" I do n't think you ever want to have your season end abruptly as it did , " said Eichel .
" When you look at our group in a team setting , I think we 've taken a lot of strides this year .
I think we definitely looked at these last 13 games as an opportunity to continue to build our culture and build our team identity and to build towards the future .
It 's never easy to have the season just kind of stop and have that unknown like it did .
There 's a lot of hope that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
