Ferguson said a third or even 40 per cent of people with Covid-19 do not get any symptoms , and that two to three per cent of the United Kingdom 's population may have been infected , but added that the data was not yet good enough to make extrapolations .
The scientist said that antibody tests , which would determine whether people had had coronavirus in the past rather than just if they were currently infected , were in the final stage of validation .
The tests could be ready to use " days rather than weeks " , Ferguson said .
When asked whether the test would be ready in days , junior health minister Helen Whately told the BBC : " I am not going to confirm when that 's going to arrive .
"  Britain has begun rolling out antigen tests -- which are different to antibody tests , and determine if a person is currently infected with the virus -- for healthcare workers but the numbers being tested are far below the levels of Germany , Europe 's largest economy .
