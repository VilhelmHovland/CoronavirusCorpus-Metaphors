The language of the 2020 pandemic Expert column  By Bob Stowers  Inside Business  Mar 30 , 2020 5:16 PM  The recent semi-imposed isolation caused by the coronavirus has given me time to think and to reflect on how language shapes our world .
The recent crisis also has introduced words and expressions never heard or spoken before .
Some of the words and phrases have been used before -- just not with the current meaning or sense of urgency .
The recent coronavirus pandemic has created the need to communicate unfamiliar meaning or urgency that did not exist before public health was put at risk by the virus .
Advertisement  The term " social distancing " is a combination of common words that was never used before .
The new meaning came about because of the risk of people being too close to each other and being exposed to the virus through coughs , sneezes , or through voluntary or involuntary personal contact .
What is an appropriate " social distance " ? We are told 6 feet ( at least ) .
My guess is that an appropriate social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a distance that one may use when one does not want to encourage communication or contact with another party .
Another expression that I have recently heard was " shelter at home .
" It does not include the severe restrictions that the word " quarantine " may connote .
California and the Bay Area were the first states in the United States to order sheltering at home .
Other states have been added to the sheltering-at-home states .
Up to now , people have been allowed in these places to go to their doctor 's appointments or shop for necessary supplies .
I have also heard the term " shelter in place " as well .
It may mean something much more restrictive than " shelter at home .
" Denoting a public lockdown , " shelter in place " may be something that is enforced and have some surprising restrictions in place .
Most people refer to this last term as something enforced because of a public threat .
For example , in Colorado , it was legally ordered that gatherings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people consider " shelter at home " and " shelter in place " as synonymous .
Like most things in the English language , only time will tell if the meanings merge or diverge in meaning and/or usage .
One more term that I have heard is " covidiot .
" This is a brand new word that I suspect you will not find in Merriam-Webster 's dictionary .
Words come into usage because a language does n't have a word that can describe something .
In this case , covidiot describes people being jerks , particularly during the coronavirus pandemic .
Instead of waiting in line at the store , a covidiot cuts in line to lessen his wait time .
This person also takes more than his share of toilet paper , bread , or Lysol wipes with no concern that other people may need them .
There 's probably no end to describe a covidiot 's actions of rudeness or just being a jerk .
