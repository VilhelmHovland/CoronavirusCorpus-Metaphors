Northam issues ' stay-at-home ' order for Virginians to help slow spread of coronavirus  Virginians should not leave their homes for anything other than food , medical care , outdoor exercise , essential work or a few other exceptions , Gov .
Ralph Northam said Monday as he issued a new stay-at-home order to help limit the spread of the coronavirus .
He also ordered a crackdown on crowds at public beaches and parks , where -- as the weather turned nice over the weekend -- hundreds gathered in Hampton Roads .

What had been a " suggestion " is now an " order , " the governor said .
" Do not go out unless you need to go out , " he said at a press conference in Richmond .
" This is very different from wanting to go out .
Do n't go to the store just for one thing .
"  He added : " It is clear more people need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Northam said Virginia 's beaches will be closed to any activity except for exercising or fishing .
The governor said he spoke Monday morning with mayors from Hampton Roads about the crowds that gathered on beaches and elsewhere over the weekend .
" They realized there were people in Hampton Roads who were not complying with our guidelines , " Northam said .
" We agreed that this was the most efficient step to take .
"  The new order goes into effect immediately and is valid through June 10 unless rescinded before then .
Restaurants are still allowed to offer takeout and delivery , and essential businesses such as grocery stores , pharmacies and banks will remain open .
People will also still be allowed to volunteer with charitable or social service organizations such as food drives .
The governor 's order last week mandating entertainment and recreational businesses such as gyms and movie theaters close is still in effect , and Northam reiterated that other non-essential businesses must continue to follow the 10-patrons-or-less rule or close .
Daycares can remain open but should prioritize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Northam 's chief of staff Clark Mercer said .
This weekend , Virginia passed 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases .
Health officials predict cases will continue to rise in the coming weeks , and capacity at hospitals -- both for bed space and medical supplies -- will dwindle .
Hospitals in Virginia have about 18,500 licensed beds , 2,000 of which are for ICU patients , Northam said .
He said capacity will be an issue if people do n't comply with the order to stay home .

The governor said he is working with the Army Corps of Engineers to find spaces to build temporary makeshift hospitals , and should be identifying those in the next few days .
And on Friday night , President Donald Trump 's administration approved Northam 's request for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover the costs of deploying the Virginia National Guard .
On Friday , when asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northam said the differences between what states have done to keep people home -- some have called it a " lockdown " or " shutdown " -- are mainly semantics .
The governors of neighboring Maryland and North Carolina have issued similar stay-at-home orders .
North Carolina 's went into effect at 5 p .
Monday , and Maryland 's at 8 p .
Monday .
Northam said Monday that Virginia is n't looking to put people in jail , but that anyone gathering in groups larger than 10 could be charged with a class 1 misdemeanor , which carries up to a year in jail and a $2,500 fine .
Mercer said local police are being encouraged to first give warnings and order groups of more than 10 people to disband , then arrest and charge people if they refuse to cooperate .

Chris Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw groups of 40 and 50 college- and high school-aged students on the beach .
He estimated there were " well over a thousand people " between 5:30 and 6 p .
" It looked like a summer day , " he said .
Others said they saw Ocean View beaches crowded .
Tim and Katie Anderson said they saw parking lots near the beaches full of cars .
" It seems like a good portion of the nation has not gotten the word on what this means , " said Tim Anderson .
But it was n't just parks and beaches that were crowded .
At Route 58 Delicatessen in Virginia Beach on Saturday , scores of diners lined up in tight proximity to get half-off Reuben sandwiches advertised at the shop that weekend .
Route 58 had asked diners to receive food in their cars .
" We thought this was gon na be maybe 250-item day , " owner Jeff Goldberg said .
" But people started showing up at 10:45 instead of noon .
It got out of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear traffic , more than a hundred people got out of their cars to wait for food ; photographs show them on the sidewalk standing close enough to touch .
Health department officials arrived to encourage appropriate social distancing .
The Virginia Beach Department of Public Health confirmed that it got a higher number of complaints about restaurants this weekend than prior weekends .
When it gets complaints , the department sends out someone to investigate and typically gives warnings and focuses on education , said Tamara Hartless , an environmental health supervisor .
She said it 's not always the business that 's the problem ; sometimes it 's the patrons .
So far , Hartless said , the department has not had to revoke any licenses .
Unlike Maryland 's stay-at-home order , Virginia 's order does n't explicitly include restrictions on traveling outside of the state and riding public transportation , but Northam said anyone traveling from an area with a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases should self-quarantine for 14 days .
Northam 's order also bans in-person teaching at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily .
All reservations for overnight stays of less than 14 nights at privately-owned campgrounds are also banned starting Wednesday at 11:59 p .
Northam said he understands that this will be a difficult time for Virginians .
