' God is a refuge .
some doors have to be open ' : Churches face decision amid coronavirus  Willie Broadnax describes himself as a country preacher .
The 78-year-old retired history teacher pastors New Birth Missionary Baptist , a church with about 40 or so active members , located a couple streets east of Norman Bridge Road , where the scarred out remains of Floyd Elementary School appear like a specter .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 29 , two days after state officials stepped up restrictions on public gatherings due to coronavirus , a few cars pulled into the modest parking lot and their passengers filed into the church where the preacher awaited them ; ministering to those who had arrived early .
Some minutes after 11 more cars came .
People entered the Baptist sanctuary one-by-one for Sunday 's service , their faces steady and resolute .
The church has been vital to many who are seeking guidance amid the panic and uncertainty of the novel coronavirus pandemic .
For some congregants , physical separation or social distance from the church at a time like this is unthinkable , as if they 're being asked step away from the greatest power in their lives .
" God is a refuge , he 's a shelter .
I honestly believe that some doors have to be open , " Broadnax said .

, on Sunday , March 29 , 2020 .
( Photo : Jake Crandall/ Advertiser )  In absence of a direct order prohibiting in-person worship , he has decided that New Birth will continue to hold weekly services on Wednesday and Sunday .
He wonders , if the church does n't step forward now in this time of crisis , then when ?  " You ca n't close all the churches down .
That 's just like saying God is not enough God to do what we preach about .
In the midst of the chaos and panic , the church has a role to play .
" We seem to be going toward fear instead of faith , " Broadnax cautioned .
" We ca n't back up .
We 've got to stand on the word .
"  But the risks are tangible .

" The last public setting for a sizable number of them was at church .
Not at one church , or churches in one town , but at church in general .
"  Houses of worship have been increasingly documented as vector sites for the virus .
What makes them so vulnerable is that they are by nature places where people gather in close contact , often greeting one another with hugs and handshakes .
In Illinois , 10 members of the Life Church of Glenview have tested positive for COVID-19 since the church 's last service on March 15 , though more than 40 have come down with symptoms .

( Photo : Jake Crandall/ Advertiser )  Small congregations , like New Birth , where members are extremely tight knit and may have stronger personal ties to their physical churches may be difficult to convince .
The unprecedented nature of the crisis has presented a moral quandary for faith leaders and their followers , challenging them to examine what role they may play in the virus 's spread and containment .
While some remain reluctant to close their doors , a number of churches have chosen to temporarily suspend face-to-face services since Alabama 's first coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has since climbed exponentially in the past week .

Farrell Duncombe of First Congregational Christian Church in Centennial Hill is one of them .
Duncombe cancelled services on March 22 , moving instead to a teleconference platform .
He did not hold services this past Sunday on March 29 , though he is adamant it was n't due to a lack of devotion .
" There 's nothing wrong with my faith , " Duncombe said .
" My faith is a committed faith , but God also gave us five senses .
This thing is serious .
"  His congregation is particularly at-risk due to their age .
Duncombe himself is 79 years old and like many churches across the U .
, his most dedicated attendees are often seniors who have been with their congregations for decades .
As fewer young people fill the rolls and church memberships across the country continue to dwindle , what will the future hold for these churches if their members contract this extremely contagious virus and fall ill or die ?  There is also the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not collect offerings that are used to fund their programs , staff salaries and activities .

Christopher Hamlin of Tabernacle Baptist Church in Birmingham , who also serves as Chaplin for the University of Birmingham 's HIV clinic , said this was a particularly concerning issue for small and mid-sized congregations that may not have a surplus of funds .
" This is very risky financially to be out of worship for three maybe four weeks or longer .
If you do n't have the mechanisms in place to receive offerings electronically or digitally -- to a certain extent I can understand why people are holding out as long as they can .
But you have to weigh the health risk over every everything else .
"  Jefferson County is currently leading Alabama 's number of coronavirus cases in the triple digits , prompting Birmingham Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 24 .
By that time , Hamlin had already suspended church gatherings , at one point even offering a drive-through prayer service .
All services are now conducted online .

Mickey Welsh / Advertiser  Interested in this topic ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Some large Montgomery churches such as True Divine on Troy Highway , which has more than 4,000 members , and the Lilly Baptist Church in west Montgomery , which has a capacity of about 2,000 , had continued to hold face-to-face worship services until March 22 , despite local and national warnings against large gatherings .
It is unclear why these churches , which are well-equipped and already broadcast or stream services regularly , had chosen to allay health warnings .
Multiple requests for comment to both churches went unanswered .
But 71-year-old Lilly Baptist member Annie Webb was n't willing to take any chances .
Webb said she was advised by her physician and cardiologist to stay away .
She 's had open-heart surgery and lung problems and is extremely vulnerable to infection .
" Let them keep on , " she said .
" I 'm going to be more than six feet away , I 'm going to be at my house .
"  For some pastors and worshipers , there 's a belief that their call to God supersedes all -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when many feel they need God 's power the most and they feel it strongest in church , among their friends and family led by a pastor they trust .
No matter the risk .
It 's the one place Susie Shuford is sure to go , she said , no matter what public officials might suggest .
She 's been doing it every Wednesday for Bible study and Sunday for services for seven decades .
At 78 years old , she 's not about to socially distance from God .
" Church is the best place to be right now , " Shuford said .
" God is everywhere and he will take care of us .
