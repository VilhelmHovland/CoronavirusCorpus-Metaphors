Most Read  Most Read  Covid-19  City of Cape Town 's refusal to offer rates reprieve stirs discontent within DA  The Cape Chamber of Commerce has also weighed on the matter , saying small businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic  29 March 2020 - 19:30 Bekezela Phakathi  Cape Town .
Picture : THINKSTOCK  There is growing discontent within the DA after the City of Cape Town , which it controls , flatly rejected calls for it to grant residents a rates payment holiday to cushion them against the Covid-19 economic fallout .
City officials are not accountable to the DA as a political party , but must answer to the council .
But senior party members have been calling on the city to follow Stellenbosch 's example and offer a rates payment holiday to property owners as the country battles to contain the rapidly spreading pandemic which has rattled the global economy .
Last week , the DA-run Stellenbosch council approved a payment holiday to ratepayers who can prove that their income has been hit by the coronavirus crisis .
" Why ca n't Cape Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist residents during this coronavirus crisis ? The city has about R8bn cash reserves , " said one DA MP .
Senior party members are said to be lobbying the city to reconsider its position .
The Cape Chamber of Commerce also weighed on the matter saying with small businesses already hit hard by the effect of the pandemic , and especially the imposition of a national lockdown , it is time municipalities and landlords granted property owners and tenants some breathing space by suspending payments for the duration of the lockdown .
" Rates and rents are a substantial cost of doing business .
With all non-essential businesses being forced to close during the lockdown , continuing to pay them will be the nail in the coffin of many small enterprises , " Geoff Jacobs , the president of the Cape Chamber .
Cape Town 's deputy mayor and mayoral committee member for finance , Ian Neilson , said it is a very " simplistic approach to claim that the city has ' x ' in the bank and therefore has cash to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully allocated in the city 's budget .
They could not be used for a new purpose without cutting expenditure in already committed budget , " he said .
He said the city is facing a significant risk in the current crisis , in that its income streams could fall sharply over the next months .
With the significant shutting down and fall in bus passenger numbers , the MyCiTi bus fare income is falling away .
There is also risk of a fall off in payments given the forced closure of the city 's cash offices .
" At the same time there is very significant additional expenditure that the city now faces that was not previously anticipated before the crisis .
The full additional costs of further support to the health system are as yet unquantifiable , but could be significant .
"  Neilson said the city 's cash flow is likely to turn negative by between R1bn to R3bn a month , depending on how it is managed and the bank balance could be quickly worked away in these circumstances .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we can not pay salaries or pay Eskom for bulk electricity supply .
The city 's primary responsibility is to ensure that the basic services -- water , sanitation , electricity , cleansing -- are secured .
Even payment holidays to our customers will risk this service provision , because it is at first a cash-flow issue .
"  Neilson said there are other ways that the city can assist business continuity and these are being pursued .
But , he said , the city can not take on the task of significant economic support beyond its mandate , when that is the task of the national government , which sits on the national fiscus income of R1 .
compared with the city 's R50bn .
The city 's draft budget comprises a R44bn operating allocation and a R8 .
for capital expenditure .
" Importantly , one of the key messages during this year 's public participation process is the absolute necessity for residents and businesses to continue to pay rates and services , " Neilson said .
He said the draft budget proposes smaller increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the inflation rate .
A social assistance package for rates and services of more than R3bn is also proposed , and the city does not plan to make a surplus on the sale of services or the income from rates .
Income is used for service provision , Neilson said .
