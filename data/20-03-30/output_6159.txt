Australia now has " whole of population " telehealth , with the government making bulk-billed phone and video consults available to all citizens in an effort to protect patients and health workers from COVID-19 .
As of March 30 , Australians will have free telehealth access to GPs , as well as some medical specialists , mental health treatment , and chronic disease management , thanks to changes rushed through to combat the coronavirus .
How telehealth works  Telehealth allows patients that do n't require a physical examination to talk to their doctor from their home over the phone or via video platforms such as FaceTime .
A telehealth doctor appointment can be made in the same way as a face-to-face appointment , by contacting your local GP 's office online or by phone .
Telehealth is expected to become the new normal as the coronavirus pandemic restricts the capacity of doctors to see patients face-to-face .
It has been used " for years " for consulting with patients in rural and remote areas , but the Medicare subsidies mean that all Australians will now be able to benefit from it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telehealth app Medinet .
It is a great service for everybody , but particularly in light of the coronavirus pandemic , ' ' Dr Qidwai said .
" It 's very , very helpful when you ca n't physically go into the doctor .
"  Telehealth allows doctors to screen patients for COVID-19 and treat mild symptoms or refer them for testing if required , reducing the risks associated with a face-to-face consultation , Dr Qidwai explained .
It can be used in many different circumstances , from treatment of minor ailments such as skin conditions and urinary infections to prescriptions , medical certificates and referrals , she said .
Telehealth is often similar to a face-to-face consultation , although there are some exceptions , " Dr Qidwai said .
" That 's why GPs are still open for business as usual because there are , for example , patients who are pregnant who need regular checkups , or babies who need their routine immunisations , and we obviously ca n't see those physical things over the phone .
"  " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are psychologists who are doing remote consulting for anxiety and depression and isolation issues at the moment , " she said .
" If you just contact your GP , they can arrange for that to be implemented .
"  ' We 'll need to constantly monitor the mental health of the nation '  Of the $1 .
billion package , an initial $74 million will be spent to address the mental health impact of the coronavirus .
This includes $14 million for existing mental health support lines that are experiencing an unprecedented surge in calls , including the Kids Helpline and Lifeline , and a dedicated coronavirus wellbeing support line that is being set up by BeyondBlue with $10 million from the government and $5 million from Medibank .
The government said its digital health portal , Head to Health , will be a source of authoritative information on how to maintain good mental health during the pandemic and in self-isolation , and how to support children and others .
Health workers will get dedicated mental health support , the government said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainty of COVID-19 " means " we 'll need to constantly monitor the mental health of the nation and provide further support as it becomes needed " .
' A great win for patients and frontline health workers '  Doctors praised the telehealth expansion , with the AMA declaring it a " breakthrough agreement " .
The move will not only enable patients to consult doctors without leaving home , but will allow for " the continuation of normal patient care " , and crucially , " reduce the need for scarce Personal Protective Equipment " , the AMA said .
It will also alleviate some of the stress on public hospitals by reducing presentations that " could have occurred without telehealth access " , Dr Bartone said .
Telehealth will help to protect doctors from infection and keep them in the workforce by allowing them to " conduct telehealth consultations from their practices or while they themselves may be in home isolation " , he said .
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Dr Harry Nespolon described the telehealth expansion as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including GPs " .
