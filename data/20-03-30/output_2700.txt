" Scott Moe  Priority is to be given to parents of school-aged children who work in hospitals , testing sites , primary care areas and labs .

The school daycares will be properly sanitized , he said .
" We want to minimize the risk as much as possible , " said Wyant .

So there 'll be lots of opportunity to further distance kids from each other to maintain the smallest groups that they possibly can .
"  Civil liberties at risk if no compliance : Hadju  Federal Health Minister Patty Hajdu warned Saturday that if Canadians choose to ignore the pleas from health authorities , the government will take more draconian measures .
" When people are playing loose and hard with the rules like this it does actually put our civil liberties at jeopardy , " Hajdu said .
" It makes governments have to look at more and more stringent measures to actually contain people in their own homes .
" Politicians and governments will be pushed to a place to take more and stringent measures when people violate them and do n't take this seriously .
So I would encourage Canadians to think about that and to think about their obligation to act collectively right now .

Horacio Arruda , the province 's chief medical officer , told reporters Saturday that regional health directors across the province " will have no problem " ordering police to make arrests and ensure people carrying the virus are isolated .
" Starting now , it 's clear that we will restrict people who are n't respecting the orders , ? Arruda said .
Especially if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have information that they are walking around .
It 's a question of respect .
