Governor Mike Dewine had argued that voting Tuesday " does not conform and can not conform with these CDC guidelines .

Matt Dietrich , spokesman for the Illinois State Board of Elections , said in a memo to reporters that Illinois would proceed with voting on Tuesday as scheduled .

As the novel coronavirus pandemic is dramatically changing American life , so too has it dominated the final days before tomorrow 's key contests .
voters went to cast ballots from Michigan to Washington state less than a week ago , door-knocking has ground to a halt as campaign staff hole up at home .
The outbreak took center stage at the 11th debate of the cycle on Sunday , consuming much of the first one-on-one between the two candidates .
And both campaigns have shifted to holding only remote events .
Biden surrogates urged Ohio supporters at " tele-town halls " over the weekend to cast ballots at polling sites they said would be " clean , safe , sanitized .
" A Sanders campaign co-chair called on Arizona to push back its primary .

"  CONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE  IN THE SENATE  Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill is requesting a postponement of the March 31st Republican primary runoff between Tommy Tuberville and Jeff Sessions because of coronavirus concerns , reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson .
Merrill has requested emergency opinion from the attorney general 's Office on whether or not the governor can postpone the election under emergency powers .
Governor Kay Ivey declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in Alabama does not allow for the suspension , delay , or postponement of an election once the date is set , according to a statement from the secretary of state 's office .

Last week , he said any person in the state is able to apply for an absentee ballot .
Voters normally are only allowed to vote absentee if they are out of town or have a physical illness .

IN THE HOUSE  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic , both House campaign arms have been issuing guidance to members and candidates on how to campaign without person-to-person contact , reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro .
The National Republican Congressional Committee released a memo Monday morning urging candidates , among other things , to not fundraise off the pandemic and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times like this you need to ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste .
If you share information on the coronavirus , do it from trusted sources like the Center for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services , " the memo said .
The NRCC 's guidance comes after public comments and actions from some Republicans that contrast from federal recommendations on going out to bars or restaurants .
" If you 're healthy , you and your family , it 's a great time to go out and go to a local restaurant , likely you can get in easily .
Let 's not hurt the working people in this country that are relying on wages and tips to keep their small business going , " Representative Devin Nunes said on Fox News on Sunday .
" Just do n't run to the grocery store and buy $4,000 worth of groceries , you know , go to your local pub .
"  A Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson told Navarro they 've been urging candidates and members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to think outside the box when it comes to campaigning through telethon and virtual town halls on Facebook .
" This is an rapidly-developing public health emergency , and we 're asking campaigns to keep the safety of their staffs , volunteers , and voters in mind , " a spokesperson said .
Both campaign arms have told staff to work from home , and are encouraging members and candidates to limit in-person grassroots events .
Following the vote on the House coronavirus relief bill , the DCCC issued press releases slamming House Republicans who voted no .
The NRCC criticized this type of messaging , and said in its memo , " Democrats are shamelessly politicizing this pandemic , and it has gone largely unchecked by the cable news talking heads .
"  In Illinois ' 3rd District , Democrat challenger Marie Newman hit hard on incumbent Congressman Dan Lipinski over the weekend for not voting on the House coronavirus relief bill , and for holding campaign events back in the Chicago suburbs .
" He was politicking at home in Chicago , and lobbing nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundraising email said .
" For Dan Lipinski , it seems like keeping his job is more important than doing his job .
