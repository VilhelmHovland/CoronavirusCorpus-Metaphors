Facebook 's next investment in India may be Mark Zuckerberg 's most important -- in Asia 's richest man Mukesh Ambani  The Facebook-Jio deal is reportedly sized in " multi-billion dollars " while some analysts estimate the value of Reliance Jio at $60 billion , which suggests that the Facebook deal could be worth $6 billion .
This is not the first time that Zuckerberg has tried for a larger footprint in India but the last time , he had partnered with Anil Ambani whose fortunes have been diminished significantly since then .
However , investing in a firm owned by the country 's richest man now , Mukesh Ambani , may give Facebook the best bang for the buck without the operational and regulatory challenges that come with setting up new businesses in another country .
Facebook is reportedly looking to acquire a 10% stake in the Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio .
This would allow the social media giant to expand its digital presence in the Indian market by tapping into Jio 's subscriber base of over 370 million , which is bigger than the entire population of the US .
However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come knocking on India 's door .
His maiden attempt in 2013 was a grand promise of free internet and a 10-page plan , called Internet .
and Free Basics , in partnership with Mukesh 's brother Anil Ambani , whose telecom venture , incidentally , declared bankruptcy earlier this year .
It was curtains for the first Ambani-Zuckerberg tie-up after the Indian government bowed in front of the massive backlash from those who sought ' net neutrality ' .
Since then , in 2014 , Facebook acquired Little Eye Labs -- a startup based out of Bengaluru that was working on a software tool to analyse the performance of apps on Android phones .
It has also invested in Indian startup Meesho , an e-commerce company that leverages social media to connect customers with resellers last year .
In February 2020 , it made its third investment in edtech startup Unacademy .
None of them compare to the scale and potential of the proposed deal talks with Reliance Jio , a unit of Reliance Industries , one of India 's biggest conglomerates owned by Asia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has knocked on the doors of the right Ambani .

The Mark Zuckerberg-led company was close to signing a preliminary deal , but the Coronavirus pandemic has stalled it .
Launched in 2016 , the **25;3203;TOOLONG Reliance Jio is valued at $60 billion by analysts at financial services firm Bernstein .
A 10% stake would fetch the company $6 billion ( approx .

Jio is also reportedly in talks with Google , although details in this regard are not known yet .
The deal talks may also be scuttled by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic but if and when they resume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shares are clear .
Here 's why Facebook may want a stake in Reliance Jio  What Zuckerberg and the younger Ambani sibling aimed ? -- provide internet access to all , as per their own stated goals ? -- Jio has already achieved in less than three years of existence by just driving down the cost of data so low that millions of India 's poor could afford it .
In a little over three years , Jio has gone from zero to capturing nearly 35% of the total subscribers in India .
After offering free data and voice services to its users for six months , Jio changed the telecom landscape in India by offering high-speed 4G data at throwaway prices along with free voice calls .
While Mukesh Ambani may claim altruistic intentions , just like Zuckerberg and Anil Ambani did in 2013 , Jio 's aggression was intended to capture market share from incumbent players like Airtel and Vodafone-Idea who have been entrenched in the market for decades .
Apart from telecom services , Jio also offers a suite of apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foot in the e-commerce business via JioMart , which was soft-launched earlier this year in partnership with Reliance Retail .
Facebook 's next few millions  Although Facebook has a huge user base in India , 740 million in all , via its social media services and WhatsApp , this is one of the few markets in the world with a big enough headroom for growth , given the sheer size of the population .
India 's internet users are estimated to increase by more than 70% in the next four years , according to a Cisco report .
And Jio , with its entire array of services from telecom to e-commerce to music , movies , and content , may be a holistic way of tapping into the market without having to face the operational challenges that come with it .
Not just big , India is also a tough market both in terms of competition and regulation , something Zuckerberg may have learnt while trying to launch WhatsApp Pay services in the country .
Being friends with the country 's richest man may prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
