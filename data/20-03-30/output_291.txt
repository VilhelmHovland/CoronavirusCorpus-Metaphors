Despite a government stay-at-home request to contain the spread of the coronavirus , plenty of people .

Photo by Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the International Olympic Committee announced that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games would be postponed until the summer of 2021 , after weeks of seemingly avoiding the more devastating impact the coronavirus pandemic has made in harder-hit countries .
In a nation that has been reticent to practice the kind of lockdown and self-quarantine orders being implemented in many countries and localities around the world , Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike raised the government 's response level by making a stay-at-home request on Wednesday , March 25 , the day after the Olympics announcement .
A similar request from Yuji Kuroiwa , governor of neighboring Kanagawa Prefecture , was issued the next day .
Both requests were voluntary rather than enforced , and were limited in scope to Saturday and Sunday of the following weekend , with an eye on deterring Tokyo and Kanagawa residents from attending traditional cherry blossom viewing parties in parks and other public locations as the cherry trees began flowering into full bloom .
For nearly a decade since Tokyo won its bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics , preparation and anticipation for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decade have been steadily growing in Japan .
With expectations and the financial stakes both sky high , and a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in Tokyo that seems less than coincidental , some have questioned whether the timing of the stay-at-home requests -- delayed compared with much of the world until after the Olympics postponement announcement -- was motivated more by politics or the public health interest .
One such critic is former prime minister Yukio Hatoyama , who suggested on Twitter ( as translated by Google ) that the number of reported cases has been downplayed by the government in order to preserve the Olympics as scheduled and " to avoid the harsh demands of keeping the coronavirus under control .
" Governor Koike 's actions , Hatoyama said , showed that she has been " Olympics first rather than Tokyo people first .
"  Whether or not Japan 's reluctance has been politically motivated , or its actual COVID-19 cases have been accurately reported , anecdotal evidence from those of us living in the stay-at-home request areas confirms that these measures are falling well short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown orders are creating in other countries .

Some individuals and businesses have been relatively compliant .
Starbucks , for example , completely shut down its Tokyo and Kanagawa stores on Saturday and Sunday , and from Monday has instated a seating policy with tables strategically designated off limits in order to put distance between customers .
In the four-floor Aeon shopping center where I took the above photo on Saturday , however , Starbucks was the only shop among approximately 70 stores and restaurants which was closed .
Prior to dropping by Aeon I took a walk up to nearby Shomyouji Temple , a spot famous locally for cherry blossom viewing .

Photo by Joel Rush  Unlike the typical springtime situation , however , no cherry blossom viewing parties were being held on the lawn of the temple grounds , a sign perhaps that people were at least making marginal efforts at social distancing .
Though people in Japan on the whole are not making as drastic of lifestyle changes as elsewhere , that is not to say that fear , worry and anxiety over the coronavirus have n't ratcheted up .
When Prime Minister Shinzo Abe first announced in late February that schools would be closed all month from the beginning of March , there was a rush of panic shopping similar to that which has been seen around the world , with toilet and tissue paper , along with masks and non-perishable food items disappearing from the shelves for a week or longer .

, just as many commuters were returning home to Kanazawa Bunko Station in suburban Yokohama after putting in a regular day 's work on their usual schedules .
Many of those who did n't go directly home proceeded to various local bars and restaurants , nearly all of which remain open .
Familiar concerns over the potentially devastating economic impact a lockdown could have , possibly combined with a government eager to save face and keep up appearances for the Olympics , and certainly fused with the desire shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue , has formed a kind of perfect storm in Japan .
It could charitably be described as a reluctance to act , or more critically be called out as denial of the reality of how bad things could actually become without more severe social distancing and lockdown measures being put into effect .
But that may be starting to finally change .
Earlier today , 70-year-old comedian Ken Shimura , a legendary TV celebrity of Johnny Carson proportions here in Japan who was diagnosed as having contracted the coronavirus just before the IOC 's announcement was issued , became this country 's highest-profile victim to die of COVID-19 .
It is difficult to exaggerate how strongly his death has hit home with the Japanese people , and reified the immediacy of the coronavirus threat .
In addition to political and public pressure on the government , an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association and other health experts here have called on Abe to declare a state of emergency , which would trigger a three-week lockdown in most of the country 's more heavily populated areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent , today 's drop of over 800 points in the Nikkei over fears that a lockdown could soon go into effect may be the most concrete harbinger yet that Japan could soon join the ever-growing list of countries issuing more rigidly enforced stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of the virus .
