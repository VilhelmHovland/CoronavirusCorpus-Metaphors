NEW DELHI -- When H .
received an urgent message from the hospital on Monday night asking her to come in to work , she knew it would be bad .
The world was in the grips of a pandemic , and her home state in south India had discovered 22 positive cases of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus .
For weeks , the hospital where she worked had been all hands on deck -- even doctors not treating coronavirus patients were required to take throat and nose swabs , check symptoms , and decide who needed medical assistance .
What she never imagined was that she -- a doctor -- would be stopped by police on her way to work , abused , assaulted , hauled into a police station , and then work a 12-hour-shift with bruises all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister Narendra Modi asked citizens to come out on their balconies and literally applaud the courage and sacrifice of health care professionals , but across the country doctors , nurses and ambulance drivers are under attack .
is one among many examples of medics being assaulted or driven out of their homes .
Medical professionals are being stigmatized as suspected carriers of the novel coronavirus , or accused of flouting a national lockdown .
BuzzFeed News has seen a copy of H .
's complaint to the police about the events of Monday night but has agreed not to publish her full name because she fears retaliation from the officers involved .
, who is in her thirties , lives and works in the state of Telangana , where on March 23 the state 's chief minister requested all citizens stay indoors for 24 hours .
Health care professionals were exempt , but the state also placed into effect a colonial-era law from 1897 , known as the Epidemic Disease Act .
Introduced by the British in India to combat the bubonic plague , the law allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease , while giving full protection to authorities from any legal action .
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus , the law has been brought into effect in multiple Indian states , even as the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics has warned that it can be misused to trample on the rights of citizens .
At 8:45 p .
on Monday , H .
finally found a ride to work , there being no public transport that day .
She and a fellow doctor were making their way to the hospital on a scooter , both women exhilarated and unsettled by the empty streets .
That 's when they were stopped by the police .
" The officer on duty asked me why I was out during curfew , so I showed him my ID and explained that I was a doctor on my way to work , " H .
said .
" He snatched my ID , looked at it and said , ' But how do I know whether you 're a doctor or just going to meet some man at this time of the night ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return her ID .
Simultaneously , she took out her phone and began trying to call the hospital for help .
At this point , she said , the officer snatched her phone , slapped her across the face , and called her a " bloody bitch .
"  " I was so shocked when he hit me that I hit him back , almost as a defensive reflex , " she said .
" At that point , he lost it .
He grabbed my hair and dragged me into the Jeep , his fellow officers began hitting me across the thighs and legs with their batons .
They groped me all over , including my private parts .
"  H .
and her colleague were then taken to a police station .
According to Indian law , a woman can only be stopped and interrogated by the police if a woman police officer is present , and all police stations are required to have a woman police officer present on duty as well .
But the station the doctors were taken to was full of men .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officer who had started the violence said , ' Why are these women on chairs ? Make them kneel on the ground , ' " H .
said .
" I was terrified of what was going to happen .

At this point , H .
said , a senior police official at the station heard the women insisting that they were doctors and stepped in to help .
" He asked the officer who had brought us there to apologize and let us go , " she said .
" The officer looked at him and said , ' I 'm sorry , sir .
' He never even looked at us , leave alone apologize to us .
"  H .
and her colleague asked the police to drop them at their hospital , where they proceeded to work 12-hour shifts .
At the end of her shift , H .
finally called her sister , also a doctor at the same hospital , and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe my ears , I could n't believe that this happened just a few hundred meters from where I was , " her sister told BuzzFeed News .
" We are four siblings , all doctors .
Our father is a policeman .
Duty is something we take very seriously .
I teared up in anger as she told me what happened to her .
"  Together , both women informed the head of H .
's department about the assault and went back to the police station where H .
had been taken the night before to file an official complaint .
's sister asked the police to provide them with the CCTV footage from the intersection where the assault had taken place .
" I have absolutely no doubt that the footage will never be made available to us , " she said .
On their way home , the women learned the assault had been filmed by witnesses and posted on social media -- cross-posted on the Instagram and Facebook pages of groups of medical students and young doctors before making its way to Twitter .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day , when the sisters went to work , they were met by a contingent of police officers and a senior member of the hospital administration .
The men asked H .
to retract her complaint and forgive the officer who had assaulted her , " They told me , ' We are all fighting something much bigger together .
Let 's fight coronavirus , not each other , ' " she said .
, her sister said , was outraged at the patronizing tone of the conversation .
" It was n't a fight -- he assaulted my sister , " she said .
" But people told us , ' You will spend years in court .
Her life will be ruined .
' " The women agreed on the condition that the police officer would have to apologize to them in front of the press .
The officer refused , but the complaint was still dropped .
" Finally , all we got was a ' sorry , madam .
' My sister will carry this trauma of being publicly beaten for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , but the powerful can get away with anything .

Confirmed COVID-19 cases have remained surprisingly low in India , although there are concerns that the real rates are much higher , thanks to the fact that India also has some of the lowest rates of testing in the world .
By Wednesday , India had recorded just over 600 positive cases and 10 deaths .
Still , the country 's government has taken aggressive measures to slow down the spread of the virus .
Last week , India stopped train and flight services nationwide , right before large swathes of the country were put under lockdown .
's story is only one among a multitude of horrors Indian professionals on the front line of the coronavirus outbreak are facing .
Over the last few days , the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have faced harassment from law enforcement and the general public for supposedly breaking curfews and being potential coronavirus carriers because of the public nature of their work .
But health care workers have had it particularly bad due to their perceived proximity to people infected with the coronavirus .
Dozens of India 's doctors have taken to social media to complain about discrimination from landlords who have asked them to vacate their homes , several doing so anonymously because they feared professional retaliation .
" One owner said that we were DIRTY , " a house surgeon from Telangana , the state where H .
lives , wrote in a viral Facebook post .
Earlier this week , doctors across the country sought government intervention .
" We wanted the entire country to know that we were being harassed , " said Adarsh Pratap Singh , president of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences ( AIIMS ) Resident Doctors Association .
On Tuesday , Singh and the AIIMS wrote a letter to Amit Shah , India 's home minister and Modi 's righthand man .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luggage , nowhere to go , across the country , " the letter said .
" We condemn such attitude and request an order to stop this .
"  In response , India 's health ministry released an order saying that the government would penalize homeowners who asked doctors and other health care professionals to vacate their houses .
" Such behaviour amounts to obstructing public servant sic in discharging their duties , " it said .
On Wednesday , Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said he was " deeply anguished " to see what was happening .
" Any harsh steps will demoralise doctors .
"  But for some doctors , the government 's action came too late .
Salma Khan had just returned home to New Delhi on March 16 after a two-week trip to Japan , where she was visiting her husband , when she heard a commotion below her building .
It was her neighbors , demanding she leave the building right away and find somewhere else to live .
Khan , who works as a pathologist at the AIIMS , India 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for symptoms at Indira Gandhi International Airport when she landed , where she was cleared by authorities to go home and self-quarantine .
But her neighbors did n't care .
" They panicked and thought I could be a carrier , " Khan told BuzzFeed News .
" Everyone knew I was a doctor .
I was wearing a mask and about to quarantine myself .
I told them I would n't come into contact with any of them .
But I still could n't convince anybody there .
"  Khan called up her landlord , who said he could n't do anything about the situation .
Nearly three hours later , Khan realized that the seething crowd was n't going to give in .
Ten people had gathered below the building , and more people were jumping into the fracas from their doorsteps without actually coming out of their apartments .
Khan felt she had no choice but to book a flight leaving that evening for Kerala in southwest India to stay with her parents .
" I was lucky tickets were still available , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could go to in Delhi .
"  Khan said that fear of the coronavirus had gripped everyone .
" We 're humans , " she said .
" When fear strikes someone , they do n't care if you are a doctor .
"  Referring to the 10 minutes when Indians across the country banged their pots and pans , rang bells , and applauded health care professionals from their balconies on Sunday , Khan laughed and said , " It does n't make any difference .
There needs to be something practical .
We all know there 's a scarcity of personal protective equipment right now .
We should be diverting everything to that .
