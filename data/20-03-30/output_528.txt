, thousands of flights have been canceled -- but on Sunday , there were still 2,800 planes in the air , according to aviation site Flightradar .

)  Millions of Americans are currently under stay-at-home orders , part of a wider effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 , causing international air travel to plummet .
But within the U .
, thousands of domestic passenger flights are still taking off each day .
A look at U .
air traffic finds thousands of planes in the air -- a sight that could be jarring to anyone practicing social distancing , or living under stay-at-home orders that have now been issued in more than 10 states .
" It would be accurate to say that transatlantic traffic has fallen sharply , " says Ian Petchenik , of the tracking site Flightradar24 .
domestic traffic has also fallen significantly , about 40% .
"  It has been two weeks since President Trump recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups -- guidance that has now been extended through the end of April .
But the nation 's aviation system is under no such restrictions .
And despite customers ' falling demand and airlines canceling thousands of flights , aviation-tracking websites show the U .
is still covered with thousands of airplane-shaped icons .
" The U .
domestic market is so large that even a substantial decrease leaves a lot of traffic in the sky , " Petchenik says .
" For instance , at 10 a .
ET , we 're tracking 2,800 flights over the U .
as compared to 7,800 at the beginning of March .
"  Flightradar24 illustrates the point in a pair of before-and-after images , showing a distinct drop in U .
domestic traffic from Sunday , March 1 to Sunday , March 29 .
There were 4,000 fewer planes in the air on the later date -- but that still meant some 2,800 flights were airborne .
Petchenik also notes that the site 's tracking maps do n't differentiate between cargo and passenger flights -- an important point at a time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might otherwise buy in person .
In a blog post , Petchenik wrote that worldwide , the rate of flight cancellations is higher than in the U .
" Commercial flights decreased 55% in the final week of March 2020 compared to 2019 , " he wrote .
" We expect this trend to continue as airlines remove additional flights from their schedules .
"  U .
flights are still common despite the Federal Aviation Administration 's move on March 11 to waive " slot use " requirements that might have forced airlines to fly some routes for the sole purpose of meeting minimum-use rules at some of the nation 's most congested airports .
As of now , no U .
states have issued orders that forbid air travel .
One of the most aggressive policies within the U .
is in Puerto Rico , which is requiring commercial flights from outside the island to land at airports where passengers can undergo health screenings .
Other U .
officials are considering similar moves .
Late last week , the FAA issued a guidance letter for agencies at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel restrictions .
Air travel restrictions are often controversial , and in the context of fighting a pandemic , the practice can spur fierce debates .
The World Health Organization , for instance , says international travel bans generally do n't work well .
In its most recent guidance , the WHO says it " continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks .
"  " In general , evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions , " the WHO said in late February .
" Furthermore , restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support , may disrupt businesses , and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries .
"  Such limits can be helpful on a temporary basis , the organization said , in situations such as " in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities .
" The WHO guidance did not mention travel limitations within a single country .
