Once they clarified that the Games would take place in 2021 , organisers effectively had three options -- a risky re-staging in the Japanese spring , by which the coronavirus crisis is far from guaranteed to be over ; what is ostensibly a straight shift-back of a year ; or a longer delay until the cooler Japanese autumn .
