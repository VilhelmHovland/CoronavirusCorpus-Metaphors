Full scale of damage to Air NZ becoming clear  National carrier Air New Zealand has been shattered by Covid-19 , and it will likely be years before it recovers .
Alex Braae reports on a sobering letter from the CEO .
What 's the latest ?  Air New Zealand CEO Greg Foran has been in the job for a matter of months , but already he is being forced to preside over by far the greatest crisis the national carrier has ever faced .
In a message sent out last night , he outlined just how bad things have got .
How bad are we talking ?  The losses in revenue are taking place on a colossal scale .
Previously Air New Zealand had been one of the country 's biggest companies , with revenues of almost $6bn a year .
Last year 's profit was a very healthy $374 million , and they had cash reserves of about a billion dollars in case of a rainy day .
But the rainy day has turned out to be a monsoon , and even those large buffers wo n't come close to covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global reduction in air travel has hit Air New Zealand hard and we are earning less than $500 million revenue annually based on the current booking patterns .
This means we are dealing with a significant reduction of over $5 billion in revenue per year .
" Those are losses of around 90% of revenue , which would be catastrophic to even the most secure businesses in the world .
How can they have gone so low , so quickly ?  The age of international travel is basically over for now , and may well not really return for years to come .
Travel bans have been put in place all over the world , with each individual country doing their utmost to stamp out Covid-19 domestically .
That includes New Zealand , where the vast majority of the cases so far are connected to international travel .
It 's not at all clear what could possibly result in those bans being lifted , short of a vaccine being developed -- a process that could take up to two years .
Foran said for the foreseeable future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " limited international services to keep supply lines open " .

But even then , there will be pressure on the company .
" It is clear that the Air New Zealand which emerges from Covid-19 will be a much smaller and largely domestic airline , " said Foran .
Flights pretty much are n't happening anywhere in the country right now , and some regions may still be under level four lockdown for longer than others , hampering the opportunity to plan ahead .
How many jobs are going ?  One of the biggest negative outcomes of this will be the loss of thousands of jobs , both in the immediate term and over the coming months .
Before Covid-19 hit , Air NZ 's workforce numbered around 12,500 people .
Foran expects that in a year 's time , the workforce will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone in what is likely to be the best-case scenario .
" Many Air New Zealanders have offered to take leave without pay , reduce their hours or explore voluntary exits .
We have also made savings from voluntary pay cuts by the board of directors , myself as CEO and my executive team , and cancelling all incentive payments for staff on individual employment agreements , " said Foran .
Is the government helping ?  It is , for several reasons .
The New Zealand government is the majority shareholder in Air New Zealand , so would be hurt by it going under .
Their is also the sheer logistical value in having an airline service in an island nation -- particularly if we need to move further towards a command economy model to fight the Covid-19 crisis .
Having Air NZ planes flying overseas will be crucial for maintaining essential supplies like medicine .
The wage subsidy scheme is in place , but does n't much help Air New Zealand , given they must reduce the workforce .
Foran said the company was grateful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting the package exactly right for the airline .
But he also noted that " the subsidy is , however , a short-term measure and does n't right-size the business for the future " .
What about the other flow-on effects of this ?  Foran wrote in his email a note of regret for Air NZ 's suppliers , which will be hit by the changes and may also have to reduce their workforces .
But a wider impact will be felt most catastrophically by the tourism industry .
Up until a month ago , Air New Zealand had been by far the most important organisation in the world for delivering tourists from overseas to destinations up and down the country .
In a typical year , like 2017 , international tourists put more than $10bn into the wider economy .
For the foreseeable future , that 's just gone .
It 's possible that some of the slack in this area could be picked up by domestic tourism .
And New Zealanders wo n't be taking their tourism spending overseas in the near future either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But enthusiasm should be tempered by the fact that the country as a whole will be going through a big economic downturn , making discretionary spending far tighter for a lot of people .
