Migoya 's own test came back positive last week , he said in a statement .
He said he has felt no symptoms but decided to take the test at the request of physician leaders because of his exposure to patients with the virus .
" I chose to keep this private because I did not want to take any focus away from the nurses , doctors , technicians , environmental workers , food-service staff , and others who are putting themselves on the front lines of this crisis every day , " Migoya said .
Migoya will be able to do his job fully from home while self-isolating .
As of 4 p .
