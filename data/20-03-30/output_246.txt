Our 17 .
rescue kitty died last December , and the first thing my husband said was , " Well now we can travel and not have to feel bad about her leaving her for a weekend or freaking out that there 's a strange person in her space when a pet sitter comes over .
"  We currently have two rescue dogs and they are a wonderful addition to our home .
If we had more space and additional financial resources that number would double .
I 'm glad that so many people are fostering and adopting during this crisis .
Without them many of these animals would be euthanized .
Our second pup was scheduled to be put down later in the day that we took him home simply because the shelter did n't have the funds available to properly care for his needs .
Sadly , there were other dogs and cats who were n't as fortunate as our little guy .
AS you can see by my avatar .
that is my little rescue .
Her name is Mouse .
When I got her she was 1 year four months old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loves and takes care of the cats and the chickens .
They are the nuttiest buddies .
Dog and cats all chasing each other through the house and then in a split second turning on a dime and then they all go into reverse .
I start laughing so hard .
It 's all I can do to get enough air to breath .
There is no discipline and if she can she will jump into my lap and stick her tongue in my mouth .
YUCK ! EEEEEK ! How does she do that ! ! ! .
