Last Thursday , Putin told G20 leaders during a conference call that he wanted a moratorium on sanctions as a " matter of life and death " during the global coronavirus outbreak .
In the comments he did not specify which countries he was talking about but Russia is being hit hard by the economic fallout from coronavirus and a parallel price war with Saudi Arabia on the oil market .
Trump said he would be discussing the collapse in oil prices , which he said is " really hurting " the US energy industry .
Another point of contention could be Venezuela , where Washington , supported by dozens of other countries , has been trying unsuccessfully to promote the toppling of leftist strongman Nicholas Maduro .
Russia is one of the few countries propping up his government .

Russian state oil company Rosneft said Saturday it is pulling out of Venezuela and argued that US sanctions on a Rosneft subsidiary -- imposed as part of Washington 's attempt to cripple the Maduro government 's revenue sources -- should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key partner to Caracas .

-- ' Every country does it ' --  ADVERTISEMENT  Trump has resisted punishing Moscow , which denies meddling in US politics , but his hand was forced by his own Republican party in Congress , which sees the Putin government as hostile .
The warm relationship between Trump and Putin -- seen by many Western capitals as an increasingly authoritarian leader responsible for assassinations of opponents at home and abroad -- has been a constant source of controversy in the United States .
In his Fox interview on Monday , Trump dismissed reports that Russia and China are seeking to exploit the coronavirus disruption by planting disinformation aimed at putting the United States in a bad light .

Trump then questioned why Russia was considered an enemy by many in the West .
As he has often in the past , he again also cast doubt on what was for decades the rock solid transatlantic alliance between the United States and Germany .
" I 'm not saying they 're babies , I 'm not saying they 're perfect , " he said of the Russians .

They were our partner , " he said .
" Germany was the enemy and Germany is like this wonderful thing .
Well , Germany takes advantage of us on trade for years .
They pay far too little in NATO .

" State leaders and doctors are cautiously optimistic that the Bay Area 's early moves to lock down residents two weeks ago have prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region 's health care capacity thus far , " Politico reported Monday .
" Six Bay Area counties were first in the country to adopt aggressive tactics with an enforceable March 16 order requiring residents to stay at home , " Politico noted .
" After 14 days -- the outermost period at which symptoms are believed to emerge post-infection -- doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected to see at this point , and officials credit the lockdown with stemming the tide of patients they feared would flood into emergency rooms .
