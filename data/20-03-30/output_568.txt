Cleveland Museum of Art Director William Griswold spoke to staff members Wednesday in a recorded video message about temporary pay cuts and staffing adjustments necessitated by the revenue reductions caused by the coronavirus pandemic .
Litt , The Plain Dealer  CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Anticipating lost revenues of more than $5 million because of the coronavirus pandemic , the Cleveland Museum of Art announced it will immediately furlough all part-time staff and temporarily lay off a portion of its unionized staff , which includes security guards .
In addition , the museum mandated a five-hour-a-week reduction in salary for all nonunion employees , effectively reducing pay by about 11% to 15% .
It also suspended all projects undertaken by contractors .
The new policies follow the museum 's announcement Wednesday that it would close indefinitely because of the pandemic , and that it has canceled all programs through June 30 , the end of its 2019-2020 fiscal year .
The museum previously announced it would remain closed through March 31 , but on Wednesday it extended the closure " until further notice .
"  In making financial adjustments , " the goal that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can , " William Griswold , the museum 's director , said in a telephone interview Wednesday .
Opting for a pay cut instead of layoffs is a way to retain full-time staff with full health benefits , he said .
" We determined it is far preferable at this point to share the pain in order to keep the team together , " he said .
Griswold stressed in the interview and in a private video announcement recorded for the museum staff that the institution 's goal is to reassemble the staff as soon as possible .
" We hope that we will be able to reopen sooner rather than later , and I look forward to being physically reunited with our whole staff and to bringing back to the museum also those members of the staff to whom we 've temporarily said goodbye , " he said .
The museum 's part-time staff members account for about a third of its 500 employees , working in visitor services , the museum store and security .
Jobs among full-time staff include curators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and security .
Michael Schisler , a security guard and steward with the Service Employees International Union , Local 1 , said layoffs could affect roughly 10 of 70 members .
The union represents employees working in security , building services , special events and groundskeeping .
" Under another circumstance there would be a lot more protest from the union members , ' ' Schisler said .
" But because the situation is this extraordinary , it 's something everybody is trying to deal with one day at a time .
"  " We 're basically front line workers , ' ' he said .
" We are there when the museum is open because we deal with the public the most .
When the museum is closed , it 's difficult to be given any kind of a work load .
"  Admission at the well-endowed museum is free , a fact enabled by the annual draw from its operating endowment fund , and by annual donations from members , foundations and philanthropists .
The museum earns revenue through its parking garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special exhibitions .
That category will fall to zero in the final quarter of the fiscal year , Griswold said .
However , the museum will save money through reduced operating expenses .
The net loss for the quarter will fall somewhere between $2 million and $3 million , Griswold said .
He called that amount a significant drop for a single quarter on an operating budget of nearly $60 million .
He said he anticipated a drop in donations as museum supporters assess their capacity to give during a sharp drop in the stock market .
" I would imagine that individual giving , corporate giving , membership and possibly also foundation giving will be severely curtailed , " he said .
The museum 's endowment , valued at $826 million before the stock market decline , has taken a " big hit , " Griswold said .
The museum did n't provide an updated figure ; values are fluctuating daily .
The museum draws on roughly half of the endowment for operations ; income from the rest is reserved for art purchases .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , on the duration of the downturn in the general economy and the resulting impact on the museum 's portfolio .
The museum bases its annual draw on the endowment on the five-year average value of its investments .
This practice means that the downturn wo n't have a drastic immediate impact .
A short decline and rapid recovery would have less of an impact than a longer decline , Griswold said .
In the meantime , the museum 's staff is working hard from home , benefiting from computer technology that enables networking and research .
" Curators are still organizing exhibitions and writing catalogs and developing checklists , " Griswold said .
These have been difficult days for Griswold and the museum , he said .
" It 's not often that one enters a tunnel and there 's no light at the other end , but we 'll get through it somehow , " he said .
