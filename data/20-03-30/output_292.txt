Cape May , NJ , March 24 , 2020 -- Cape May Brewing beertender and private events coordinator Jake .
+ Hauser readies a van to make home deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic .
Ryan Krill  In what may set a precedent for states across the nation , New Jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow small alcoholic beverage producers to deliver directly to customers ' homes .
But while New Jersey beer , spirits , cider and mead lovers deride his edict as one that capriciously attacks the state 's burgeoning artisanal beverage industry , the reason behind the reversal appears more complicated .
" The governor is doing what he can within the current statutory craft beverage laws , and his team is working to see what they can do and ca n't do within a state of emergency , " says Alexis Degan , executive director for the New Jersey Brewers Association .
What that means is this : Before the coronavirus outbreak , only brewpubs , wineries , bars and liquor stores could deliver direct to consumers .
Last week , Murphy temporarily lifted the restriction on breweries , distilleries , cideries and meaderies and then realized Wednesday existing law does n't allow him to do that .
Brewers Guild of New Jersey executive director Eric Orlando says : " With breweries being deemed as both essential manufacturing businesses and essential retailers in New Jersey and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their beer directly to consumers , we were surprised when we got the word from the state that we would no longer be able to do what other essential businesses of a similar ilk were doing .
While we understand that this current delay may be based on a miscommunication or misinterpretation of what rights craft beverage producers were supposed to have according to the state 's recent executive orders , we feel that a temporary administrative fix is the easiest way to rectify this now , and could be strengthened by further legislative action in the coming weeks .
"  According to Degan , Murphy has shown himself as a friend to small businesses , including these , and is likely working in good faith to find a way to permit delivery during the current state of emergency , which does keep open liquor stores ( which sell all categories of alcohol ) and let breweries continue to sell beer to-go from forcibly closed taprooms .
She adds that the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control , as well as many state lawmakers , have also shown great support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to help if it needs a legislative solution , " she says .
" It was definitely helping to move the needle and allowing us to keep some of our team members employed , " says Alicia Grasso , marketing director for Cape May Brewing , one of the state 's larger craft breweries , who adds management is asking employees to send letters to the governor .
" Taking it away has been disruptive and disappointing .
"  The situation presents as bleaker for smaller breweries that rely more on taproom sales than distribution .
" Pickup and at-home delivery has been the only thing that 's kept us alive , " Hackensack Brewing owner Mike Jones toldNJ .
" The fact that the state of New Jersey is allowing us to do pickups and deliveries is the only reason that we 're still in business right now .
And the only reason I had that have n't had to layoff any employees so far .
If we ca n't deliver , we 're going to be shutting our doors .
"  Brewers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent Gov .
Murphy a letter asking him to allow breweries to deliver during the pandemic .
According to Acacia Coast , brewers guilds manager for the BA trade group , production breweries in 22 states can deliver right now , along with brewpubs in 21 states .
Breweries and brewpubs in four states can deliver only with a food order , while businesses in 18 states have asked for permission and await a reply and four states prohibit it altogether .
Breweries that can sell to-go and/or to grocery and liquor stores are seeing sales of packaged beer spike as customers in most states are being mandated to stay home when they 're not shopping for necessities or performing tasks deemed essential .
BA chief economist Bart Watson reports that craft beer sales in grocery and convenience store channels increased by almost a quarter in volume and dollars the week of March 15 .
Some consumers switched from six-packs to 12-packs .
" March 15 .
was indeed a big week , " writes Watson on the BA 's website .
" The week did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like a normal summer week as opposed to one in mid-March .
"  The governor 's office did not respond to a request for an on-the-record comment .
