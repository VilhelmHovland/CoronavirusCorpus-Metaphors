? ? WOW ? ? Bruce Aylward/@WHO did an interview with HK 's @rthknews &amp; when asked about #Taiwan he pretended not to hear the question .
The journalist asks again &amp; he hangs up !  China claims sovereignty over the island , although Taiwan has its own government and refers to itself as the Republic of China .
Taiwan is not a member state of the WHO , which is what prompted the reporter to ask if the organization would " reconsider Taiwan 's membership " in light of the coronavirus pandemic .
Aylward stares into the camera and does n't answer the question before saying , " I 'm sorry , I could n't hear your question , " he eventually said .
The reporter continues to press and said she is " curious " about " Taiwan 's case .

" I just want to see if you can comment a bit on how Taiwan has done so far in terms of containing the virus , " she asks .
" Well , we 've already talked about China , " Aylward responds .
" And you know , when you look across all the different areas of China , they 've actually all done quite a good job .
So , with that , I 'd like to thank you very much for inviting us to participate , and good luck as you go forward with the battle in Hong Kong .
