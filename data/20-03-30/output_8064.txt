@ @ @  5 hours ago  on  March 30 , 2020  By  A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked Texas ' ban on abortions , a prohibition state officials said was necessary to preserve medical resources during the coronavirus pandemic .
The ruling came less than a week after Texas abortion providers announced a lawsuit against top state officials , challenging Attorney General Ken Paxton 's assertion that Gov .
Greg Abbott 's executive order banning all procedures deemed to be not medically necessary should be interpreted to include abortions .
ADVERTISEMENT  The court granted the abortion providers ' motion to temporarily block the state from enforcing the order , which was set to expire April 21 , as it relates to abortions .
The temporary restraining order will expire April 13 .
" Regarding a woman 's right to a pre-fetal-viability abortion , the Supreme Court has spoken clearly , " wrote U .
District Judge Lee Yeakel .
" There can be no outright ban on such a procedure .
"  Yeakel also wrote that people seeking abortions would " suffer serious and irreparable harm " if the ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not disserve the public interest .
"  " The attorney general 's interpretation of the Executive Order prevents Texas women from exercising what the Supreme Court has declared is their fundamental constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is viable , " Yeakel wrote .
Progressive groups applauded the judge for ruling in favor of the abortion providers .
ADVERTISEMENT  " All patients accessing abortion deserve their care without delay , " said Tara Pohlmeyer , communications manager at Progress Texas .
" Access to reproductive health care is especially important during a public health crisis , and this ruling means Texans have access to much-needed care .
Instead of trying to distract with ideology , state lawmakers like Gov .
Greg Abbott and indicted-Attorney General Ken Paxton can now focus on prioritizing public health and safety measures for the state .
"  Yeakel also set a hearing for a more permanent injunction on April 13 .
