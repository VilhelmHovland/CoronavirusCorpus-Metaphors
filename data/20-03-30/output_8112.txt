Ralph Northam on Monday ordered all Virginians to stay at home until June 10 unless they need -- not just want -- to go out for food , work , medical care or fresh air .
" To date , this has been a suggestion to Virginians .
Today , it is an order , " Northam said during a news briefing , adding that those who flout the order can face a criminal misdemeanor charge .
This latest directive comes on reports that 1,020 Virginians tested positive for COVID-19 , including six in Roanoke .
These are the first cases in the city .
The virus on Saturday killed an elderly Botetourt County woman , who had been the area 's first confirmed case .
She is among 25 Virginians who have died from the disease .
And the governor 's order comes as hundreds of local people await test results , including 22 at LewisGale hospitals .
Salem on Monday said an employee who works in the streets and general maintenance department has tested positive .
The city is not saying whether the employee lives in Salem but the worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that LewisGale has one patient with a positive test , but that it is treating 14 others at the Salem hospital , three each at LewisGale Alleghany and Montgomery , and two at LewisGale Hospital Pulaski who are presumed to have the virus but have yet to receive lab results .
Carilion Clinic spokeswoman Hannah Curtis on Monday said Carilion has received 22 positive test results , and two patients are in the hospital .
Carilion does not release the number of patients in its hospitals who are thought to have the virus until the test results are known , which can take a week .
Salem City Manager Jay Taliaferro said in a letter to employees that staggered start times and social distancing procedures were in place before the city employee became ill , so few others were affected .
The employee 's coworkers are now self-quarantined .
" This positive test shows each of us that no community or workplace is immune to the virus , " Taliaferro wrote .
" We ask that you keep this employee in your thoughts and prayers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daily life .
"  Also Monday , the Mount Rogers Health District reported an employee at the Southwestern Virginia Mental Health Institute in Smyth County had tested positive .
The psychiatric hospital and health department are tracing patients and coworkers and having them quarantine .
The Virginia Department of Health on Monday reported another four cases for Botetourt County .
There are now six in Roanoke , three in Roanoke County , five in Franklin County , and one each in Alleghany County , Montgomery County and Radford .
Northam said the numbers will continue to rise .
" What we are seeing now is the result of how people interacted two or three weeks ago .
What we will see two to three weeks from now is determined by how people behave today and the following days , " he said .
Virginia health officials said they are working with academic centers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to do modeling , but do not have information yet to share .
They said they now have enough data on the virus in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many more beds and intensive care units would be needed to care for the critically ill .
" How many more we need depends on the actions we all take right now , " he said .
Some places in Virginia are seeing signs of community spread of the virus , in which it is no longer possible to know where a person contracted it .
Molly O'Dell , who heads up the COVID-19 response for the Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts , said she was not certain yet about the new cases in the valley , but until now each case could be linked to another .
As of 8:30 a .
Monday , there were 14 active cases and one death in the combined district .
Most of the people infected are isolated at home .
" If you look at the bell curve , we are on the left side .
We know that Virginia to date has been increasing about 20% cases a day , " she said .
" I see that we are behind the state curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , and hopefully that will be a positive thing .
"  That 's why social distancing and staying at home is necessary , she said .
Northam 's stay-at-home order does not differ much from the one he issued last week that closed all personal care businesses and fitness centers , but allowed other nonessential businesses to remain open as long as they had fewer than 10 people in their establishments and could accommodate distance between each person .
Last week , Northam had said a stay-at-home order , such as ones issued in neighboring states , differed only semantically from his order .
He was asked what changed over the weekend .
" I know what it 's like to be working in the hospital in the emergency rooms on the front line , and I have seen heroes , literally , across Virginia over the past couple of weeks : doctors , nurses , respiratory therapists , you could go right down the list .
They are sacrificing their time .
They are sacrificing perhaps their health , the health of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also see people congregating on the beach that are completely ignoring what we are doing .
And I will remind those folks : You are being very , very selfish because you are putting all of us , especially our health care providers , at risk .

( 2 ) comments  Given that 70% of Americans will have asymptomatic coronovirus , it is likely that thousands of people in Roanoke have already had the disease and are now immune .
This will be revealed as people get the quick antibody test this month , confirming that they were in the lucky 70% who never have any symptoms .
