All travellers from mainland China , Macau and Taiwan will be barred from entry if they have been to a foreign country in the past 14 days , Lam announced .
The measure will be effective for a fortnight .
The government will also extend its compulsory 14-day quarantine requirement to visitors from Macau and Taiwan .
The measure has been effective for travellers from mainland China since February 8 , and for those arriving from all other countries since last Thursday .
The decision came amid growing pressure from both sides of the political aisle to close entry to non-Hong Kong residents .
' Restrain yourself '  During Wednesday 's press conference , Lam appeared to become emotional as she expressed her respect for frontline medical workers , saying that they had " fought persistently for more than two months .
"  She urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic : " If a community outbreak occurs due to a small group of people who deliberately violate our home quarantine rules to go out to play and eat , I ask how can these people face our frontline medics ? "  Photo : inmediahk .
Lam said the government is willing to bring back overseas Hongkongers , including students studying in the UK , the US , passengers on the Diamond Princess Cruise in Japan , and those stranded in Hubei province .
But returnees should abide by the government 's compulsory home quarantine rules , she added .
" I urge anyone who plans to violate the home quarantine rules and anyone who insists on going out , to please think seriously .
Can you not wait and restrain yourself for a longer period of time ? Please let Hong Kong have a chance at conquering this battle .

Affected journalists have been ordered to return their press cards which expire at the end of this year within 10 days .
HKFP rounds up of reactions to the news .
Foreign governments , agencies and politicians  United States National Security Council  The United States National Security Council said in a tweet the decision to expel journalists from China and Hong Kong was another step towards depriving Chinese people and the world of access to " true " information about the country .

" Under the Basic Law , all decisions about employment visas for foreign nationals in Hong Kong , including journalists , have been made independently by the Immigration Department .

Authorities already exercise near-total control over the domestic media , such that the foreign press has been vital in enhancing the world 's understanding of China .
"  " In the midst of a global health crisis -- when accurate and timely information is needed more than ever -- Beijing 's decision only seals its image as an enemy of a free press .
"  " The Chinese government should immediately withdraw the ban and allow free reporting by domestic and foreign reporters .
"  Amnesty International  Joshua Rosenzweig , head of Amnesty International 's China team , called the expulsions disturbing : " This shameful assault on freedom of expression targets journalists who have uncovered the reality of numerous human rights violations in China , from Xinjiang to Hong Kong .

" It 's particularly disturbing that these journalists are also being summarily denied the right to work in Hong Kong and Macau -- a decision that should be left to the respective governments .
This appears to be yet another example of how the territories ' purported autonomy and freedoms under the ' One Country , Two Systems ' model are gradually being eroded .
The Hong Kong government must urgently clarify the implications of this announcement for its autonomy under the Basic Law .
"  Reporters Without Borders ( RSF )  RSF 's East Asia Bureau Head C ? dric Alviani called on Beijing to immediately reverse its decision : " This is not a ' media war ' between the US and China , as it is sometimes incorrectly called , but rather the latest episode of China 's aggressive moves against press freedom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare the restrictions taken by Beijing with the ones taken by Washington earlier this month .

"  " The purpose of press freedom is not to let authoritarian regimes freely disseminate contents that suit their interests .

" Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's success .

A spokesperson for the Chinese Commissioner 's office in Hong Kong hit back , saying Beijing was compelled to take reciprocal countermeasures against US " oppression " of its overseas media : " Instead of confounding right with wrong and making groundless accusations against China , the FCC should address its complaints to the US administration , urging the latter to immediately change course , undo the damage , and stop its political oppression of and arbitrary restrictions on Chinese media organisations .
"  Speaking at the Legislative Council on Wednesday , pro-democracy legislator Claudia Mo said the Chinese government was attempting to choke the free flow of information in Hong Kong .

" The fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move , pretending , of course , that Hong Kong is just collateral damage , " she said .
" They could n't care less about ' One Country , Two Systems ' in Hong Kong anymore because this is in clear violation of the Basic Law , which says under ' Two Systems , ' we are supposed to be able to look after our immigration matters .
"  Civic Party leader Alvin Yeung said that anyone who wished to work in Hong Kong , including journalists , must obtain a work permit from the Immigration Department without the need for approval from the Chinese Foreign Ministry .
" It is unprecedented , " he said .
" It is as if Beijing is directly imposing its authority on Hong Kong 's Immigration Department and prohibiting the issuance of work permits .
"  Civic Party lawmaker Jeremy Tam criticised the use of the term " foreign missions " to characterisation the three newspapers as arbitrary .
" Is opening a supermarket a diplomatic matter then ? Does the Bank of America count ? What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomatic ' matter once they started with US media outlets , " he said .
" I do n't see the fundamental logic .
It is worrying how Beijing has distorted ' One Country , Two Systems ' and the definitions of foreign affairs and defence .
"  Affected journalists have been ordered to return their press cards which expire at the end of this year within 10 days .

The team analysed more than 300 specimens including sputum , nasopharyngeal swabs , deep throat saliva , blood , urine and stool .
Sputum -- coughed-up mucus -- had the highest concentration of the coronavirus , with more than 300 times more than saliva .
All urine samples , meanwhile , tested negative .
The findings highlighted the potential risk of environmental contamination by virus shedding in stool , the team said .
Chairman of the Department of Microbiology at CUHK Professor Francis Chan said the study had various public health implications : " First , stool may serve as an alternative screening tool in people without respiratory symptoms .
Second , virus shedding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food handlers should be particularly vigilant about their hand hygiene .

Chairman of the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics at CUHK Professor David Hui said that faecal matter could contaminate the environment , leading to virus transmission through mucosal surfaces such as the eyes or mouth .
" The public are reminded of filling enough water into U-shaped water traps connected to bathroom floor drains and to close the toilet lid when they flush .
All these measures help reduce the risk of infection , " Hui added .
During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong , more than 300 people at Amoy Gardens were infected with the deadly virus probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CUHK team said they will test 100 asymptomatic close contacts in quarantine centres around Hong Kong to determine whether stool tests can effectively detect Covid-19 .

&gt;Hong Kong authorities have announced plans to deploy a second round of charter flights to evacuate stranded residents in China 's coronavirus-hit Hubei province as early as next Tuesday .
Mainland affairs minister Patrick Nip said at a press conference on Monday that the flights will collect Hong Kong residents from cities including Wuhan , where Covid-19 was first detected , as well as Xiaogan , Xianning and Huangshi .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of flights and days of operation for the second evacuation , saying that the figures will be decided upon at the end of the registration process .
Those with urgent needs such as serious illnesses will be given priority , he added .
The announcement came weeks after the first batch of four charter flights ferried 469 Hongkongers from Hubei , the epicentre of the pandemic .
Nip said that more than 3,400 Hongkongers are currently stranded in 37 cities in Hubei , of whom 14 were confirmed to be infected with Covid-19 .
Ten of those cases have been discharged , three remain in hospital -- one in a serious condition -- and one man who lived in Wuhan has died .
" Based on the experience of the first batch operation , we 've come to the conclusion that using the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport as the base is the most operationally feasible , efficient and also in terms of managing risk , " he said .
More than 169,000 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded across at least 157 countries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong has recorded 148 cases of infection with four deaths , while China has reported more than 80,000 cases with over 3,200 deaths .
The World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak a global pandemic last Wednesday .
As with the first batch , evacuees from China will be placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon return to Hong Kong .
There are around 700 quarantine facilities available across the city , the secretary for constitutional and mainland affairs said .
Asked whether it was necessary to quarantine all returnees including those who have not been confirmed to be infected , Nip replied saying it was a precautionary measure to avoid further transmission .
" Hubei , and particularly Wuhan , have been infected areas and these returnees have been staying there for a considerable period of time , " he said .
" For prudence sake and also for controlling the public health risk , I think it 's appropriate to make such an arrangement .
