WE 'LL START WITH the phone calls .
They never came after a win .
The Netherlands in 1980 , France in ' 81 , the USSR in ' 84 .
Everyone wanted to be his friend then .
But when results went south , the dring-dring-dring of the cream-coloured phone at the back of his Firhouse-based sports shop had a haunting sound .
Eoin Hand knew what was coming .
People threatened to kneecap me for ' picking these English bastards ' , " Hand , the former manager of Ireland , says .
" That disgusted me because the men they were claiming were n't Irish , Tony Grealish and Seamus McDonagh , were as committed as anyone .
Michael Robinson ? He was a great guy .
Chris Hughton ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunatic fringe around Irish football then .
At games , when I was managing St Pat 's , I 'd get spat at .
If I was out for a drink with the missus , some yob would come up and say , ' Hand , you are a useless bollix ' .
" It was awful stuff and was directly related to the last result .
Like , whenever we beat the USSR or France , you were a hero .
Then , you 'd lose away to Norway , and it was hell .
" What disgusted me was the fact players got stick .
They were getting ? 50 or something like that to play for their country and here they were being abused .
They did n't deserve it .
"  Nor did he merit death threats on another job , this time in South Africa with AmaZulu FC .
" It was like apartheid in reverse , " he said of his term in charge of the Durban club in 1994 .
" These men came to the training ground one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would kill me .
I asked the police if I should take the matter seriously .
They told me these men were not to be messed around with .
To this day it annoys me , because I 'm not a political man , I am a football man .
I never discriminated against anyone .
Racism is an appalling thing .
"  So is pancreatitis .
Hand was 51 when he was rushed to the Mater Hospital with the illness , placed in ICU , administered the last rites .
" Thought I was a goner , " he says .
Not this fella .
Twenty-three years on , he has made the most of this second chance life has given him , to the degree that he can contextualise this awful period Ireland and the world is going through with the wisdom of someone with 74 candles on his birthday cake .
" Look , it 's a frightening time for so many , " he said earlier this afternoon .
" Homeless people , how traumatic must this be for them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that , your heart goes out to them .
" People getting ill with this thing ; it 's horrendous .
You feel for them , for their families .
A friend of mine passed away the other day and we could n't go to the funeral .
You wanted to pay your respects .
It 's desperately sad the family did n't have people there to commiserate with them .
" But we 've been told to self-isolate and that 's what we 're doing .
We 're following advice , doing what we are supposed to do .
If I still get this bloody thing ( Covid-19 ) then so be it .
I wo n't complain .
I 've been blessed with the life I 've had .
All I can do now is follow the guidelines and be grateful for what I 've got .
"  He has his memories , the 20 caps he won as a player , the five years he spent as Ireland manager , the debuts he handed out to Paul McGrath , Ronnie Whelan , Mick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RTE 's nostalgic two-part programme about the Jack Charlton years recently , he listened to Cascarino suggest it was Charlton who asked him to declare for Ireland and wondered how the facts got in the way of a good story .
" I capped him when he was still at Gillingham , " Hand says of Cascarino .
Hand during his reign as Ireland manager Source : Billy Stickland/INPHO  " The stick I got for that at the time .
The Ice Cream Man was the headline in one of the papers .
It kind of pissed me off what he ( Cascarino ) said on the documentary but what can you do ? You ca n't change it .
Mick , now Mick is different class .
First thing this morning , the phone buzzed , Mick wishing me a happy birthday .
A great fella .
"  If the world was a different place , he 'd have been on the phone to McCarthy himself this month , wishing him well for the play-off in Slovakia , sitting down in his favourite armchair to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch on TV .
The pubs and the golf courses around his Kerry home are also closed .
Instead this 74-year-old son of Dublin is filling his days by painting his house , weeding his garden , thinking back to how he ended up here .
His home is in north Kerry , next to the house he used to holiday in as a child .
Hidden away down a quiet boreen , where grass grows down the middle of the road , he sits in the sunroom looking down the valley below and thinks back to a time when he was 12-years-old and he and his big brother got embroiled in a row , which ended with Eoin kicking his elder sibling in the shin .
Anticipating the hiding he would inevitably receive when his brother got back up , the only place Hand felt he would be safe was here , next door to his home now , in Moyvane .
So he ran all the way from Drumcondra out to Inchicore , from where he thumbed a lift down to Kerry , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he walked for another 12 miles , in the dark , to his holiday home .
" And scared the living daylights out of everyone in the house when I knocked on the door , " he said .
The next morning , his mother was called .
" Eoin 's safe , " she was told .
So , in a way , it 's no surprise that after the harrowing events of the 1990s , when his marriage and business collapsed , he 'd seek this little place out once again as a refuge .
He has been here since ' 97 , when he recovered from his life-threatening illness .
Now he sees the world threatened with a new disease .
" This is a trying time for so , so many people , " Hand says , teasing your correspondent for bringing the subject up .
" Most people who have called today have said ' happy birthday ' , " he says , laughing .
" So thank you for reminding me that , as a 74-year-old male , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my age , you have to be able to laugh at yourself .
" You also have to just get on with things .
You know that out of something as awful as this , there will be some good .
" There may well be an economic disaster and the accompanying stress will be awful for people .
I 'm not going to downplay that .
But if people use this time to re-evaluate what 's important , see the value of their health , of spending time with their family , there are positives in that .
" Put it this way , I 've spent my life in sport where the word hero was bandied around , sometimes fairly , sometimes loosely .
" But nurses , doctors , medical people , they 're all heroes .
People looking after the elderly and the sick in care homes , as a nation we should be saying thanks to them .
They 're risking their health for us .
That 's beyond heroic .
We should all be so proud of them .
