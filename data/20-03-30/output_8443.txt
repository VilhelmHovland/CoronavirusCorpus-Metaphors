Philip Randolph Institute and four individual voters filed a federal lawsuit Monday alleging the plan violates the National Voter Registration Act and the First and Fourteenth amendments of the U .

Among the remedies they are seeking is to push the completion of the election to a later date .
" Under the General Assembly 's undemocratic election scheme , thousands , if not millions , of Ohioans will not get to vote through no fault of their own , " said Jen Miller , executive director of the League of Women Voters of Ohio , in a prepared statement .
" Ohio 's inefficient absentee voting system was n't designed for this massive scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the justice system to ensure that Ohio 's primary is constitutional and accessible .
"  The Ohio General Assembly last week unanimously adopted a bipartisan plan to extend absentee voting until April 28 , with limited opportunities for in-person voting that day .
The first sheet of the 26-page lawsuit says lawmakers " ignored the pleas of bipartisan state and local elections officials , and imposed a cumbersome multi-step , multi-mailing process that will be impossible for elections officials and voters to complete in the time left before the election concludes .
"  Research indicates that these changes " may hit Black and brown voters the hardest , " the lawsuit said .
Lawmakers passed their plan after Ohio Health Director Dr .
Amy Acton closed the polls March 16 , hours before they were scheduled to open on primary Election Day .
Secretary of State Frank LaRose followed Acton 's order with a directive to local boards of elections telling them to comply with the order and to prepare for in-person voting on June 2 .
LaRose initially said his office could n't complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation that would have put that date into law for the 2020 primary .
But legislators from both parties decided they wanted the election to be earlier over the objections of voter advocates , who last week said the election should n't be completed before mid-May .
LaRose has since said he would implement the General Assembly 's plan .
Although the legislature was singled out for criticism , LaRose is the sole defendant .
Spokeswoman Maggie Sheehan said , " While Secretary LaRose is the named defendant in today 's action , it is ultimately ( House Bill ) 197 -- which passed the Ohio General Assembly with unanimous , bipartisan votes in both the Ohio House and the Ohio Senate -- that is being challenged .
" His sworn duty as secretary of state is to carry out the law as the legislature crafts it on behalf of Ohio voters and to give them confidence in Ohio 's elections .
"  The state 's plan cuts off voter registrations on Feb .
18 , one month before polls originally were to open for primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new April 28 date to finish the election violates the National Voting Rights Act , which requires voter registrations be allowed up to 30 days before Election Day .
" Many historically disenfranchised communities are not ( accustomed ) to voting by mail and may have difficulty navigating the process in this extremely short timeline .
The right to vote is sacred and should be treated as such , " said Andre Washington , state president of the Ohio A .
Philip Randolph Institute .
The individual voters are all in similar circumstances .
Lashunda Lee has never voted by mail , only in person , and thus is in danger of being disenfranchised for an election in which only the disabled are allowed to cast in-person ballots .
Others have to print out an absentee ballot application or obtain one by mail and put sufficient postage on the ballot to get it back to the elections board for counting .
Lee " does not own a printer , does not have one reasonably available to her , and the places she normally goes to access a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " She is concerned that going out to try to print the ballot application and mail it in could expose her or her family to COVID-19 and is worried that she will not be able to exercise her fundamental right to vote in the upcoming primary if she is required to follow the procedures required by the state .
"  Plaintiff Munia Mostafa has two children and " she is concerned that the process of submitting an absentee ballot application -- which could require her to go to a post office and office supply store or printing location -- could place the health of her family at risk .
