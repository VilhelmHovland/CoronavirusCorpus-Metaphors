Peter Ackerman  Statewide  Officials also announced 37 new deaths across the state on Monday , bringing New Jersey 's death toll to almost 200 by day 's end .
Modeling the curve  Officials revealed for the first time on Monday detailed projections about how the pandemic may play out in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to daily life in the state , New Jersey would see a peak of nearly 80,000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients , a number that far exceeds the roughly 20,000 beds available at New Jersey hospitals , officials said .
With what officials consider an average level of social distancing , as determined by past epidemics , health officials estimate a peak of about 35,000 patients hospitalized with the virus .
That is the " flattening the curve " effect that officials have empathized for weeks .
Phil Murphy said the models illustrate how vital it is for the state 's 9 million residents to stay in their homes whenever possible and avoid in-person interactions .
" You can see the mismatch before us unless we succeed at social distancing , " Murphy said , later adding , " this is the fight of our lives , let there be no doubt about it .
"  That number would still exceed existing capacity , but it is why , Persichilli said , the health department has been scrambling to put more hospital beds into service .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention centers across the state and reopen at least one previously closed acute care hospital .
Additionally , hospitals have already been asked to double the capacity of their intensive care units , Persichilli said .
The state 's decision to suspend elective surgeries has also freed up space for coronavirus patients .
Officials are considering whether dormitories and hotels can be converted into makeshift hospitals , she said .
Persichilli said she was confident that hospitals would ultimately have the beds needed to care for patients at the height of the pandemic .
She said the state is also expected to have enough ventilators , the machines used to help critically ill patients breathe , that are in short supply across the country .
That statement came even as Murphy said earlier in the briefing that New Jersey would be receiving only 300 of the 2,300 ventilators it requested from the Strategic National Stockpile maintained by the federal government .
That number is " far , far from what we ultimately will need , " the governor said .
Officials were even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care workers .
The state has been soliciting donations of health care equipment from private companies and asking the federal government for more help .
" Do we have enough PPE ( personal protective equipment ) ? The answer is no , " Persichilli said .
" We have n't had enough PPE for a long time .
"  Other updates  Murphy announced minor changes to the state 's executive order closing all non-essential businesses .
Gun shops , which were previously deemed non-essential businesses .
will now be allowed to operate with limited hours and see customers by appointment only .
The change came after criticism from Second Amendment advocates and guidance from the U .
Department of Homeland Security that suggested those stores should be allowed to remain open .
Murphy made clear that he would have preferred gun shops remain closed during the statewide shutdown .
