Mexican President Andr ? s Manuel L ? pez Obrador , shown at his daily news conference Tuesday , had been criticized for his lackadaisical posture on the coronavirus pandemic but now urges people to stay home and to practice physical distancing .
As the coronavirus pandemic spreads , Mexican President Andr ? s Manuel L ? pez Obrador has been criticized for what many called a lackadaisical posture -- urging people to hug , shaking hands and kissing well-wishers as he stumped and extolling his personal talismans : Catholic scapulars , a shamrock and $2 bill .
" Because of our culture , Mexicans are very resistant to calamities , " the president said in a video recorded a week ago in a Oaxaca city eatery and circulated on social media .
" Continue bringing the family to eat in restaurants , " L ? pez Obrador advised compatriots , arguing that such activity bolsters " the popular economy .
"  But as virus cases have begun surging , the president and his team have shifted their message radically in recent days , urging people to stay home and to practice physical distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored .

" Do n't go out into the street unless it is for something absolutely necessary , " L ? pez Obrador told the nation in a sober YouTube address Friday evening from the northern border city of Tijuana .
" We have to be in our homes .
We have to maintain a safe distance .
"  The consequences of flouting the stay-at-home directive , he added , could be calamitous .
" The number of infection cases will spike upwards and will overwhelm our hospitals , " L ? pez Obrador declared , painting a grim scenario in stark contrast to his previously upbeat assessments .
" We wo n't have enough hospitals , beds , even if we are prepared to receive thousands .

" This is the last chance we have .
We ca n't lose it , " L ? pez-Gatell said in a somber-toned news briefing .
" We are saying to everyone : ' Stay at home .
It 's the only way to reduce this virus .
"  As of Sunday , Mexico had reported 993 cases and 20 deaths , a low number compared with the neighboring United States , which reported more than 140,000 cases and more than 2,600 deaths as of Sunday .
But the first confirmed coronavirus infection was not reported in Mexico until late February , more than a month after the first case appeared in the United States .
In recent days , however , Mexico has begun seeing rapidly accelerating numbers , pointing to the kind of steep surge seen in nations where coronavirus struck earlier .
With cases rising " exponentially , " L ? pez-Gatell warned , the sweep of the virus would soon be beyond containment .

Despite the latest ominous warnings , Mexican officials have still refrained from imposing mandatory stay-at home orders and the border closures seen in other nations , hoping to avoid massive economic and social displacement .
Nonessential government workers , however , have been told to stay home , and the Holy Week break has been extended for schools .
Officials have also urged private businesses to let people work remotely .
Some local governments have gone further .
Mexico City has closed bars , theaters , churches , museums and other venues , while banning gatherings of more than 50 people .
But restaurants and shops remain open in the capital , and street life continues at a much-reduced but still substantial pace .
