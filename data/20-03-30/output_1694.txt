Courage and kindness in the face of Covid-19  Courage and kindness in the face of Covid-19  A CHARITY which supports victims of domestic violence has said it is still open and offering refuge to desperate women despite many of its volunteers having to self-isolate .
And Sara Ward , chief executive of Black Country Women 's Aid , has praised supporters who have ' gone beyond the call of duty ' to help support people escaping abuse .
Pleading to those trapped in abusive relations , including those self-isolating because of coronavirus , to make contact her message is simple : ' We are here , we are open and we will help .
'  Saying during the present health emergency , refuges are taking additional measures to keep clients safe , Sara added : " Obviously we are asking people if they are displaying symptoms so we can asses their health condition .
" If they are displaying symptoms if would be irresponsible of us to put them with 15 families in a refuge but we can find them alternative accommodation .
"  The charity works with local councils like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave their homes .
Sara said : " We 're lucky as we have group settings and also individual flats so we can put them in the most appropriate place .
" We are doing a little more screening so we can protect them and others but yes , of course , are doors are still open .
"  Explaining self-imposed confinement heightens the risk of violence , she said victims should n't be afraid to contact the service and in emergencies should ring the police who have assured her they will respond .
And she added neighbours or family members who suspect someone is being abused either physically , emotionally or mentally should also speak up .
Due to shortages it is asking for donations to continue to run the service .
Sara said : " We continue to need toiletries , any spare food people can afford to donate , our residents like everyone are short of toilet rolls and really , all the basic necessities you need to live but please no second hand goods .
" And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donate chocolates for the mums and children that would be great .
"  Speaking of the kindness and courage of donors , she explained : " On Mothering Sunday a woman , who is a florist , made and gave a bouquet to every one of our women .
" We recently had an elderly couple come to our office to donate Easter eggs for the children .
" I told them them that as they were over 70 they should n't be putting themselves at risk , but they said ' we ca n't stop giving to you ' explaining as religious people ' if God will take us , our time is right ' .
" I think we are overwhelmed by people 's generosity at any time but the things people are doing now are beyond the call of duty .
