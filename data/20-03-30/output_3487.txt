PHOTO FILE NATION MEDIA GROUP  By NJERI RUGENE  In Summary  Women and girls are most at risk of sexual and gender-based violence -- a serious protection issue -- which occurs even at home , leaving them feeling unsafe and insecure .
In most cases , women and girls become the target of such mishandled and misplaced stress because of their vulnerabilities .
ADVERTISEMENT  ADVERTISEMENT  eThe mini lockdown ordered by the government in a bid to tackle the novel coronavirus pandemic that includes the directive to stay at home , and the decision by some employers to lay off workers and have others take pay cuts or even unpaid leave , is surely a recipe for stress and tension amid economic hardship .
With the closure of schools and colleges , having to suddenly have all the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially for families struggling to put food on the table , is draining not just economically but also , most critically , mentally .
A study of past crises -- humanitarian , disease outbreaks and conflicts such as war -- indicates that women and girls become more susceptible to the ensuing chaos .
They are likely to be hit hardest by specific vulnerabilities that go beyond the risk of being infected .
Women and girls are most at risk of sexual and gender-based violence ( SGBV ) -- a serious protection issue -- which occurs even at home , leaving them feeling unsafe and insecure .
COVID-19The fact that women still bear the traditional responsibility of taking care of the home , the restrictions that have come with the Covid-19 pandemic -- such as loss of jobs , especially for those in the informal and domestic sector , school closures , also economically given the huge numbers of female-headed homes today and other related pressures -- the Covid-19 disruptions are bound to have a monumental impact on women and their sustenance .
However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the much-overlooked emotional abuse , that we must also be vigilant about by all means , especially within and outside the family , including incest -- which , besides being abusive , is also criminal .
Silence by families in the face of this violence is also not just criminal but a matter that we have to battle with as a society .
As we mull over a solution to the lack or shortage of the critical ' weapon ' against Covid-19 , such as water and soap , particularly in the informal settlements , we also have to take into account , with the same zeal , measures to alleviate SGBV and the attendant risks .
These should include protection measures such as provision for safe spaces where women and girls , survivors or those at risk of this criminality , can seek solace far from their abusers -- family or otherwise .
The need for safe houses , rescue centres and shelters can not be gainsaid at this time , when people are being directed to stay at home as efforts to fight against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This also calls for vigilance not just by women and human rights advocates and organisations but all the right-thinking members of the society , leaders , the police , community and family members .
It is time to break the silence and all should take it as a responsibility to report to the authorities any cases of sexual abuse and gender-based violence such as rape , defilement , domestic and family violence , incest and all other forms of SGBV .
CHALLENGES  Bear in mind that it is in times like these , when people deal with challenges such as job losses in the light of huge family responsibilities , that some tend to direct the attendant stress at those close to them .
In most cases , women and girls become the target of such mishandled and misplaced stress because of their vulnerabilities .
The United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) , which has been advocating gender-sensitive responses in the face of Covid-19 , urges policymakers to include women 's perspectives in pandemic planning and decision making .
PUBLISH HOTLINES  This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services amid the measures to contain coronavirus , including quarantines .
The Ministry of Public Service and Gender , whose Cabinet secretary , Prof Margaret Kobia , has been outstanding in matters gender , should publish hotlines and helplines where survivors and Kenyans of goodwill can report SGBV against women and girls .
Rights advocates and other organisations should also be vigilant , reach out and be on hand to help deal with possible risks and escalation of SGBV at this time when all the attention and focus is on Covid-19 .
