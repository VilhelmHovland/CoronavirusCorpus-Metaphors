A recent letter sent to doctors and pharmacists across the state of Michigan sparked a great deal of controversy over the perceived threat of disciplinary action for anyone caught prescribing or dispensing certain drugs to treat the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) .
This was followed by a second letter that partially walked back the threatening tone of the first letter by implying that the first letter was only intended to prevent the hoarding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and completely agree with the need to conserve critical medications during pandemics and all other situations that necessitate such care .
However , the original letter from the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs ( LARA ) was like a punch in the gut -- telling medical providers we can not adhere to the longtime FDA practice of allowing off-label prescriptions and commanding we turn in our colleagues , to name just two points addressed in the letter .

( Photo : Robin Buckson , The Detroit News )  Given this highly unsettling time and politically charged environment , the letter unfortunately became tangled in a lot of partisan political bickering .
Continuing this track will solve nothing .
Therefore , let 's bring this issue back to the one fundamental goal on which we all agree : saving lives .
Doing so requires clarifying one point made in the original LARA letter .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydroxychloroquine ) , a drug commonly used to treat lupus , is not scientifically validated to treat COVID-19 .
Though technically correct , they went on to state that to fill a prescription for hydroxychloroquine prescribing physicians were required to have a " valid " diagnosis .
The proceeding statement would seem to indicate that they did not consider COVID-19 to be one .
According to the first letter , failing to do so could subject the physician or pharmacist to " administrative act " by the licensing department .
This seemed to be an attempt to obstruct the growing practice of prescribing hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 , a disease with no known treatment .
Though this use is not yet conclusively proven or FDA approved , hydroxychloroquine has a growing wealth of data supporting that it may be effective in treating COVID-19 .
Thus , if the early data is born out , LARA could have been restricting the use of a drug that may prove to be lifesaving .
After receiving significant blowback for the tone and implicit threats contained within the letter , LARA sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clarify that the first letter was intended to prevent hoarding of hydroxychloroquine .
Hoarding is widely discouraged as it could deprive lupus patients of this much needed drug .
The problem is that LARA attempted to protect the supply of hydroxychloroquine by also suggesting that it was not a valid " off-label " treatment for COVID-19 .
It seemed to pit the interest of lupus sufferers against those of COVID-19 suffers for whom it may prove that this medication was equally as needed .
My proposal to prevent hoarding would be , rather than prohibiting the dispensing of hydroxychloroquine based on diagnostic code , instead temporarily require a diagnostic code for the quantity dispensed .
This would be a valid approach to preserve the limited supply as it would discourage hoarding and limit the quantity dispensed to those quantities appropriate for use given the diagnosis .
For example : 14 pills of hydroxychloroquine 200mg could be dispensed for a diagnosis of COVID-19 as this would adhere to the recommendation of Epocrates , which is one of the most reputable drug reference guides .
Conversely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three-month supply of hydroxychloroquine during this shortage and given the potentially equally valid use among COVID-19 patients , they may be asked to accept refills of a one-month supply at a time until the shortage resolves .
Thus , by enacting a diagnosis based dispensing approach , we could achieve protection of both patient groups while limiting hoarding until the supply is replenished .
More broadly , as only a very small amount of hydroxychloroquine may be needed to prevent potentially life-threatening COVID-19 complications , appropriate use and limited dispensing may have minimal impact on the supply of hydroxychloroquine for lupus sufferers while reducing the burden on our health care system .
This is due to the fact that the current evidence supports that hydroxychloroquine may prevent viral entry into cells and replication .
Thus , early treatment of COVID-19 patients as outpatients may prevent progression of the disease , reducing the strain on hospitals and minimizing the need for ventilators .
If true , this could have substantial economic implications as a reduction in costly hospitalization may be achievable inexpensively as hydroxychloroquine is generally very affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I highly encourage Gov .
Gretchen Whitmer , with her authority over LARA , to consider this approach instead of attempting to claim invalid the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 .
Though using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 is not yet fully proven , there is currently more data supporting that it does work than supporting that it does not work .
I believe with this approach we could both protect those for whom this is a proven and established treatment while offering others what could be a lifesaving therapy .
