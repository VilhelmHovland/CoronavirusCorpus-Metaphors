In his own words : College athlete shares story of his brother 's battle with coronavirus  Kieran Ungemach is a sophomore at Elon University in North Carolina , majoring in Journalism and International Global Studies .
He is also a member of Elon 's track and cross country teams and is a reporter for the Elon News Network .
He graduated from Don Bosco Prep in 2018 and was an all-Bergen County cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his family in Wayne .
Kieran 's older brother Brendan graduated in 2017 from Providence College , where he was a member of the cross country and track teams .
He was a two-time Passaic County cross country champion and was named to the North Jersey All-Decade Cross Country Team .
Earlier this month , Brendan survived a battle with COVID-19 .
Kieran shares that story here .
Normally , a text from your mother saying that your brother has a 103-degree fever is n't all that alarming .
That 's what Tylenol is for .
But in the era of coronavirus , that kind of news can fill you with fear and uncertainty .
From my dorm room at Elon University , I waited for updates as my 25-year-old brother Brendan 's situation in New Jersey worsened .
His fever barely went down , even on Tylenol .
His breathing became labored and his cough turned aggressive .

( Photo : Submitted )  I was trapped at school hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal lives by quarantining themselves as soon as he developed symptoms .
They were left to wonder if their two sons would be okay , and whether they were going to develop symptoms of a virus that has crippled medical infrastructures around the globe .
Unable to return to my home due to the threat of getting sick from my family , I soon learned that my brother had indeed tested positive for COVID-19 , and that he was one of the more than half a million people around the world unsure about their future due to this pandemic .
" I did n't think that this was remotely possible , " Brendan said over the phone .
" If I can get it , I 'm confident everyone in America can too .
"  He has an apartment in Jersey City , and occasionally visits his girlfriend in Manhattan .
" I work remotely from home , and when I 'm in the city , I wear clothes I take off right when I get home , and use wipes to wipe down my apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  I assembled a virtual family meeting with him , my father Jim , and my mother Cathy on March 24 after he tested positive just four days earlier .
This was our first time taking stock of the personal hell we had been through since they quarantined themselves in our Wayne home for over two weeks .
" It got real very quickly , " Mom said .
She has n't been able to return to her job at the Indian Trail Club in Franklin Lakes due to being exposed to my brother .
" He never gets sick , so the fact that he woke up with a fever was unusual .
"  Brendan Ungemach of Wayne Hills was The Record 's Boys Cross Country Runner of the Year in 2013 .

At that point , New Jersey had 23 positive tests , and one confirmed death .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s--- , now what do we do ? ' " she said .
" We all looked at each other and agreed that we had to quarantine and should n't go to work .
"  On that same day , I received an email that Elon University would switch to online classes until April 6 .
That has now been pushed back to April 20 .
As I sat in my room , I wondered when I would see my family again , and if our lives would be the same when I eventually did .
" Of course , we wanted you here , " Dad said .
" But at the same time , we wanted you to stay healthy .
"  Brendan was eventually able to receive a coronavirus test , after previous tests showed that he did n't have the flu or pneumonia .
But by then , the worst of coronavirus had hit him .
" We got the test on March 16 , but results did n't come until March 20 , " Brendan said .
He had maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it difficult to breathe , along with fatigue .
" By the time I got the positive results , the information was useless .
"  The most frightening part for us was what we , the doctors , hospitals and the government did n't know about coronavirus throughout this entire process .
The lack of information early on and floods of conflicting information was jarring .
" The only way for me to get a test in those early days , according to the CDC and my doctor , was to go to the hospital .
But every article I read told me to avoid hospitals , " Brendan said .
" I was lucky enough to get a test at the doctor 's office , but I had to independently choose to not go to the hospital for fear I would give it to more people if I had it , or get it from someone if I did n't have it .
"  " We asked the doctor what to do after his positive result , and she literally said , ' I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus hospital hotline , " Mom said .
I asked what the hospital hotline said when they called .
" They told us to call our doctor , " Dad said .
" Your mother looked at me and said , ' We are on our own .
The people who are supposed to know just do n't know .
' "  Fortunately , Brendan has been able to make a full recovery after enduring symptoms that lasted 11 days .
Although my parents have not been tested , they have n't shown symptoms for the coronavirus , which , according to the CDC , appear 2-14 days after being exposed .
As of March 25 , they have all been advised that they 're now free to leave our home , after more than 15 days inside .
This means I could theoretically return .
But with the inconsistency of information in the past , my path forward is hazy .
New Jersey is currently the state with the second highest number of positive cases behind New York .
Picture your town is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere , and the power goes out .
The snow plows soon clear the roads and the utility companies restore power .
Life for some is almost back to normal .
But imagine that your road is the only road that the plows did n't get to .
That your house is the only house without electricity .
You are trapped , stuck in place , hopeless and without information about when the snowplows will free you , and when the utility workers will light up the darkness .
I 'm sure every family touched by this pandemic feels that helpless and alone .
But we 're not really alone .
We are all navigating these dark and ominous times together , waiting for the plows to clear our streets , and for the lights to come back on .
