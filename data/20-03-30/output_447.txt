People all over the world have spent the past month , and more , dealing with the rapid spread of the new coronavirus , but for earthquake-prone California , preparation and response ca n't just stop there .
Earthquake experts -- including at the U .
Geological Survey and UC Berkeley 's seismology lab -- are considering , especially in recent days , one potential scenario that is n't an out-of-bounds notion : the convergence of an earthquake with the COVID-19 pandemic in the Bay Area and across California .
On March 18 , Sen .
Kamala Harris referenced a 5 .
earthquake that had struck that morning just outside Salt Lake City , shutting down the state 's coronavirus hotline and reportedly knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes and businesses .
The California Democrat said she hoped California would not need to contend with a dangerous earthquake or wildfire while it 's overloaded with the pandemic , but she voiced concerns that the government would not be ready in the event of an added disaster .
Geological experts warn that the next 25 years hold a 72% chance of a massive earthquake on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big faults , which means Californians live with the constant threat and possibility of quakes .
" An earthquake is just as likely this week as it was three weeks ago , " Richard Allen , director of the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory , said .
" The good news is that when we have an earthquake , one of the things we have to think about is that we will be stuck at home , and many of us are already doing that .
In a sense , the bits that we need to do in an earthquake -- they 're already there .
"  The bright side is that many steps Californians would take to prepare for an earthquake have been taken in the frantic attempts to prepare for COVID-19 .
The flip side is that the confluence of the two disasters would be as devastating as it would be unprecedented , with the state 's health system already overloaded .
One thing Californians can do now , Allen said , is broaden their disaster planning .
" There 's no question if you 're prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means .
( is ) for a big disruption to your daily life , and potentially to other disasters .
"  For many of us , pandemic preparation and response included stocking up at grocery stores , securing a good Wi-Fi connection for working at home and heeding the shelter-in-place directives .
Here are few more things you can do to expand your preparedness and limit your impact to medical systems that are already overloaded , no matter what strikes :  Have a go-bag that you can use in any emergency .
In an earthquake , you want to be ready to be self-sufficient for three to five days , which includes food and ample water .
If you do n't yet have the following , consider adding :  Keep a pair of shoes and socks by your bed .
In the 1994 Northridge earthquake , more than half of injuries were caused by falling objects .
Having footwear by your bed can help prevent foot injuries from shattered glass or other fallen objects .
Assess your bedroom and the spaces you spend time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookcases , dressers , paintings -- and surfaces under which you could take cover .
Avoid hanging items above beds and make sure heavy items are latched securely in place .
Have a plan .
The risk of an earthquake now is the same as before the pandemic , but the situation is undoubtedly more complicated , U .
Geological Survey Communications Officer Paul Laustsen said .
It 's not about alarmism but about being as ready as possible even for things that feel unnecessarily stressful .
When infrastructure is already overloaded , it 's better to be prepared where we can .
