' Realistic ' ECB reviewing ' The Hundred ' postponement , ICC to take similar call on T20 World Cup  MUMBAI : The England &amp; Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) is on the verge of postponing The Hundred , their professional franchise-driven 100-ball tournament for now , and the members of the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) are pushing for the T20 World Cup , scheduled in Australia this October-November , to be held later in a window that can be mutually decided .
Decisions to these effects are waiting to be taken anytime soon and formal announcements can be expected between now and the next few weeks .
The Hundred is ECB 's dream project , one that was first unveiled in April 2018 , playing conditions confirmed in February 2019 and the player draft taking place the same October .
" The ECB heads had internally discussed postponing The Hundred by a month very recently , in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak .
At that time , it seemed like a realistic approach .
What seems more realistic right now is posting The Hundred to 2021 .
The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources told TOI on Monday .
With a global lockdown in force and tournaments getting cancelled globally in advance to avoid any last minute logistic and financial hassle , The Hundred too is about to take the route the English Premier League ( EPL ) did and the Wimbledon will , as far as mega sports events in the United Kingdom are concerned .
" Ideally , the postponement of the 2020 Olympics should 've held the ECB in good stead .
But that is not the case anymore .
Travel bans are likely to stay in place for all of the English summer .
A thorough postponement is the only choice , " say sources .
Ticket sales for The Hundred were set to commence in the first week of April and have now been indefinitely delayed .
Sanjay Patel , managing director , The Hundred , commented : " In the midst of an epidemic which is affecting the nation in unprecedented ways , it would be wholly inappropriate for us to promote and sell tickets to The Hundred .
We appreciate this may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets in the April sales window , accessing early bird prices and securing tickets to the most in-demand games .
ECB , however , insists for now that The Hundred schedule is still under review .
The ECB , for now , is not using the word postponement .
Instead , they insist " properties scheduled for later in the season are being " reviewed " .
" We have begun modelling a range of options to start the season in June , July or August -- with an immediate focus on options for cricket in June , including the three-Test series against West Indies , the Vitality Blast and England Women 's schedule against India .
Properties scheduled for later in the season , including The Hundred , are also being reviewed .
" Close liaison with the Government will continue , with discussions on the potential of starting the season behind closed doors and giving sports fans the opportunity to enjoy live action " , the ECB told TOI in an official statement .
The statement , for now , does not confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T20 SET TO BE DELAYED  Meanwhile , some other leading stakeholders in the game have proposed to the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) that their T20 World Cup -- scheduled for October-November in Australia -- should be postponed for now .
" The question being internally discussed was to postpone it but there was no status quo on ' until when ? ' Well , India is scheduled to tour Australia in December .
Early next year , Australia have their Big Bash scheduled .
March would not be an ideal time ( with IPL to begin in April ) because the broadcaster wo n't agree to back-to-back T20 events .
India is anyways hosting the 2021 T20 World Cup .
So , the ideal choice has to be 2022 , " add those in the know .
A decision on this too is being worked upon .
For the record , Australia has shut its own international borders to the world until mid-September .
While The Hundred solely remains the ECB 's decision , the T20 World Cup is a tournament that will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , ahead of the annual board meeting in June .
" When a tournament gets cancelled , a Force Majeure comes into effect , which in totality calls for all stakeholders to once again come to the drawing board and renegotiate .
Let 's take the example of Nike .
The shoe and apparel giant has closed down all over the world .
So have some of the other leading brands that are sponsors to some leading teams or partnering with the ICC .
Moreover , the broadcaster has a lot at stake .
All these aspects have to be considered , " add industry sources .
The same elements , however , do not necessarily apply to the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) .
Should Covid-19 relent anytime between now and October-November , the BCCI along with its internal stakeholders who help run the domestic league , will remain in the best possible position to make the tournament happen .
" Either way , one thing remains clear : The IPL takes precedence whenever the markets open .
That 's not because the BCCI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elephant in the room , " say those in the know .
