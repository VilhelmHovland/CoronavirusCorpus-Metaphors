This , on top of the regular household chores as well as cooking and cleaning can feel like an extra load for many parents at this time .
The likelihood is though that despite both parents now being at home , much of the " domestic " work will still land squarely on the shoulders of the women of the house .
So much like the 1950s housewife , women will not only be expected to make exciting meals , keep the house clean and tidy and the children entertained -- but she 'll also have to do all this while working from home .
In her seminal work , professor of sociology Arlie Hochschild looked at heterosexual couples in the 1970s and 1980s and noted that women were doing what she termed " the second shift " .
So despite record numbers of women being in the labour market , women still end up going to work and then coming home to do a second job -- namely the bulk of housework and childcare .
Although her data is from the US and almost 40 years old , the most recent analysis of parents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend two if not three times as much time on care and routine housework compared to men .
Even when both parents work full-time , mums still carry out almost double the amount of childcare compared to fathers .
' Woman 's work '  With schools , nurseries and afterschool clubs closed , this is the end of the facilities that relieve parents -- but mostly women -- of their care responsibilities .
Indeed , it is through the introduction of affordable and accessible childcare that women were able to take part in the labour market after childbirth .
With this ending , that care burden now lies with the family again .
A recent German study has shown that when women work from home , they tend to do three hours more childcare compared to women who do not work from home -- while men who are home-workers end up doing moreovertime hours .
Similar patterns have been found across the world , including in the US and Poland .
The reason for this is because our societies still believe that women hold the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still mainly responsible for the bread-winning .
In the 2017 British Social Attitude Survey , for example , two thirds of respondents say that it is better for mothers to stay home or work part-time when children are under school age .
The majority felt that fathers , on the other hand , should work full-time .
So it is highly likely that for as long as the schools and nurseries are closed , women will carry out the role of teacher while also trying to ensure they themselves get some work done .
The mental load  The world is a scary place for children and teenagers at the moment , and mothers across the world are also undoubtedly having to carry out the " third shift " -- ensuring the emotional wellbeing of not only her children but also parents and other family members .
In other words , they are in charge of the mental load of worrying about the family .
So to mums I say this : you are amazing for trying to do everything but you need to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time of crisis -- when your mental health and capacity will have also suffered .
Give yourselves a break .
This is also a time for couples to have an honest conversation about who is doing what -- and how things can be made fairer .
There are some great websites and books to help you divvy up the chores .
But more importantly , employers may also need to be realistic about what working parents , and other workers , can do at this point .
Many were able to perform the " ideal worker " image , where they have no other responsibility outside of work , but it will be difficult to maintain that in these times for both men and women .
