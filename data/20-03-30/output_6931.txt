The countdown clock is clicking again for the Tokyo Olympics  TOKYO ( AP ) -- The countdown clocks have been reset and are ticking again for the Tokyo Olympics .
The model outside Tokyo Station , and others across the Japanese capital were switched on almost immediately after organizers announced the new dates -- July 23 to Aug .
8 , 2021 .
The clocks read 479 days to go .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant compared with the worldwide fallout from the coronavirus .
Then again , it 's not much time to reassemble the first Olympics to be postponed since the modern games began 124 years ago ; not for 11,000 Olympic athletes , 4,400 Paralympic athletes -- and not for sponsors , broadcasters , the fans that have already bought tickets , and Japanese organizers and taxpayers who have spent billions , and will have to come up with billions more to pay for the setback .
" I believe that these Olympics are going to have great historical significance , " Yoshiro Mori , the president of the Tokyo organizing committee , said after confirming the new dates .
Mori , an 82-year-old former Japanese prime minister , also recalled there 's no guarantee that the coronavirus pandemic will be under control a year from now .
That includes the new dates for the Paralympics now set for Aug .
24-Sept .
" This is a prayer that we have and I do believe that someone is going to listen to our prayers , " Mori said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , the new summer dates overlap perfectly with the same time slot that was picked for 2020 .
Organizers are hoping to overlay the old plans with new plans , keeping venues in place , securing thousands of rooms in the Athletes Village , deploying the same volunteers , and letting people who bought tickets keep them .
The summer date also avoids conflicts with the crowded North American and European sports schedules .
But summer in Tokyo also means grappling with intense heat and humidity , the major worry for games organizers before the pandemic .
" Obviously in the summer there might be typhoons and the heat problems , " Mori said .
" However , this situation is the same .
We always had those problems so we will be prepared for those issues .
"  Though the international sports federations went along with the new dates , some like the International Triathlon Union preferred the cooler spring during Japan 's cherry blossom season .
But that was overridden by the easiest route to lining up venues .
" We are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Toshiro Muto , the CEO of the organizing committee .
" At this point we do n't have a final decision .
However , some problems have already become apparent .
"  Muto said organizers have n't yet heard from any venues saying the rescheduled Olympic events ca n't be staged there next year .
" There are a lot of venues that ca n't make a decision yet .
So we have to negotiate with them , " he said .
" If we have to make a change to the venues , then we might have to change the competition schedule as well .
"  " I personally do n't think there are going to be many major changes to the ( competition ) schedule , " he added .
" But our discussions have n't gone that far yet .
"  David Wallechinsky , the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians , said the Olympics in 2021 -- they will still be officially called the 2020 Olympics -- could become a symbol for a world pulling together after the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity for the Olympic Movement , rather than a setback , " he said in an email to the Associated Press .
He said an outright cancellation , rather than postponement , probably was not feasible .
" From a financial point of view , cancellation was not a viable option , " he said .
" The repercussions would have been complex and widespread .
"  Mori and Muto have both acknowledged rejiggering the Olympics will incur " massive costs .
" Estimates range between an added $2-6 billion .
And Japanese taxpayers will pick up most of the bills , as they have for most of the preparations so far .
Muto promised transparency in calculating the costs , and testing times deciding how they are divided up .
" There will be costs and we will need to consider them one by one , " Muto said .
" I think that will be the tougher process .
"  Japan is officially spending $12 .
billion to organize the Olympics .
However , an audit bureau of the Japanese government says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the bid in 2013 , Tokyo said the Olympics could cost $7 .
billion .
All of the spending is public money except for $5 .
billion from a privately funded operating budget .
About $3 .
billion in that budget has been raised from local sponsorship deals driven by Dentsu Inc .
, Japan 's giant advertising and public relations company .
That amount is almost three times more than any previous Olympics .
" The current sponsor contracts will expire this year , " Muto said .
" And since the games will be extended until next year , we would like to ask them for extensions .
I 'm not hearing they have any specific objections to this .
And whether we would like to ask them for more contributions -- nothing has been decided .
"  The Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee is contributing $1 .
billion to the Tokyo Olympics , according to organizing committee documents .
The IOC 's contribution goes into the operating budget .
The IOC had income in the latest four-year Olympic cycle of $5 .
billion , and 73% was from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American broadcaster NBC makes up half of the IOC 's broadcast revenue and pays more than $1 billion for the rights to each Olympics .
The IOC also has almost $2 billion in reserve funds and insurance to cover emergency situations .
" NBC , in particular has a lot to say , " Wallechinsky , the historian , said .
" That 's why the games are scheduled for the summer , which is not ideal for athletes competing in outdoors sports .
The 1964 Tokyo Olympics took place in October , when the weather was more favorable .
"  The Olympics planned for 1940 in Tokyo were canceled because of Japan 's war with China .
So were Olympics in 1916 and 1944 .
And these Olympics have had a bumpy time , which included the resignation last year of the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee amid a bribery scanda l .
" Even the 1940 Tokyo Olympics were planned for September-October , " Wallechinsky said .
" For 2020-2021 , you see the power of television .
