How Isolating Has Changed David Yurman 's Perspective on Business  For jeweler David Yurman , wife Sybil and son Evan , running a global company from the kitchen table brings new insights and fresh challenges : " Make no mistake , spending this much time together makes for tensions and difficulties .
"  In our series My Monday Morning , self-motivated people tell WSJ .
how they start off the week .
To explain how he , his wife Sybil and their son Evan manage to work closely with each other every day , jeweler David Yurman points to their titles .
" The three of us are chiefs , " he says .
He and Sybil , both 77-year-old co-founders , are also respectively the CEO and chief brand officer of David Yurman , the American jewelry company , while Evan , 38 , is chief creative officer .
" We each have our very strong opinions and thoughts , and we realize that the only way you can all be chiefs is that you 're chief of an area , and you have to communicate and understand what that area is .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the twisted helix cable bracelet , worn by celebrities like Rihanna and Angelina Jolie , David Yurman is no humble mom-and-pop .
But for any size family company changing the way they run right now , the Yurmans ' counsel to stay in your lane -- and out of other family members ' -- holds up as solid advice .
Right now , David and Sybil are together at their Tribeca home in Manhattan , while Evan is in upstate New York with his family .
Here , the Yurmans tell WSJ .
about how their work-life routines , which include watching Legally Blonde and dancing the tango on their terrace , have changed during social distancing .
What time do you all usually get up on Mondays , and what 's the first thing each of you do ?  Sybil Yurman : We 're all quite different .
I get up Monday mornings around 6:45 a .
, and I do a little breathing , a little stretching .
I write my dreams , which kind of set a tone for the day , to see some clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's moving me and where I 'm being touched emotionally .
Then I start making phone calls to executives and planning what we have for the week .
And then I work out .
David Yurman : I probably get up later than everyone , around 7:30 , 8 a .
Wash , look in the mirror , see that I 'm still alive .
And then I go right to breakfast right away .
It 's like I dream of Peruvian coffee beans .
Coffee , it 's the reason to exist sometimes in the morning .
Then I have a muesli mix that I like to make ahead of time .
It 's a lot of organic rolled oats and cranberries and lots of nuts .
I like to take pine nuts and toast them and throw them in , a little bit of salt and maple syrup .
That is the pleasure of my day .
I think what I 'm doing is luxuriant , and I try to stretch it out for at least a half hour .
Sybil is walking around , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing everything that 's going on with marketing , with sales .
She touches everything .
And every once in a while , I 'll say , okay , I want to look at the papers .
Every day , Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday .
they 're all Sundays for the first hour .
I 'm in pajamas , it 's my luxury .
Then I have a yoga lesson in the house , so I work through yoga sessions for about an hour .
It gets me up , then I take a shower and then I 'm looking at design .
How have your routines changed during this period ?  Evan Yurman : I 'm at my country house in the Catskills .
Having three kids , having them be homeschooled takes a lot of the day , so I work around that .
The guest house has turned into my office .
I 'm having to slow down a lot , which is nice because I can put more thought to some of the things that I do .
It gives me more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're working on .
DY : Now , I 'm doing more CEO work , where we 're dealing with how we keep ourselves viable through this social distancing .
Everyone 's connected to telephone , and our online systems are working perfectly , but we 're dealing with it every day .
We talk to our president , chief finance officer and chief of HR every day .
We 're in touch with our sales teams .
We 're trying to figure out how we can actually still do business in this environment , how we financially survive this .
SY : I spend a lot of time talking with the staff , and with senior management on how we 're moving forward , and the protection of the staff .
And what 's different now is that we 're FaceTiming with multiple groups of people .
Our objective is to touch as many people as possible through dialoguing with them and reassuring , and hearing what some of their concerns are , and then we move into a strategy .
DY : What I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing each other 's faces .
It 's like , oh my gosh , where are you ? " I 'm in the car .
" Why are you in the car ? " Well , it 's the only quiet place in my house -- I have two children , a dog and this and that .
" Three days later , I said to one of our chief designers , are you still in the car ? She says , " I 'm in the car with the whole family , and we 're driving down to Florida .
" So we were doing a design session with one of our chief designers while she was driving to Florida .
What lessons have you learned over the years that other families who suddenly find themselves in close quarters might appreciate right now ?  SY : Make no mistake , spending this much time together makes for tensions and difficulties .
And so you have to remember that everyone has good intentions , and you really care about the other individuals you 're speaking to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be the most appropriate way to show the good intentions and the kindness .
EY : Are you apologizing to me ? Is that what this is ?  DY : We had a major blow-up this morning .
EY : Therapy through interview .
SY : So the idea is that it 's more important to be kind than right .
And I put a little sign on the fridge and on the table , to remind us of that at all times .
And to stay in your own lane , and not try to be helpful to everyone that 's around you in a small environment .
It 's about giving emotional and physical space to each other where you can .
And if you ca n't give physical space , then give emotional space or intellectual space , and respect for the other person 's point of view .
What are your media diets right now ? What do you read in the morning ?  SY : Oh my goodness .
I will read everything that I can possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , but it 's very important , looking at the economic stimulus programs so that we can be prepared for how and what we need to do , and what support we 'll get in protecting our workforce , which is quite large and international .
We 're also very connected to the multiple health advisors we have for the company .
At night , I watch uplifting , funny , charming movies on Netflix or anything I can get .
Do you have a recent favorite ?  DY : Oh yeah .
It 's an oldie but good .
It was Legally Blonde .
Reese Witherspoon is just brilliant .
SY : I watched It 's a Wonderful World .
Oh my God , how could we forget what we do in the morning ? We dance in the morning .
David puts on music probably within a half hour in the morning , and we dance .
It could be dancing to reggae , or dancing to salsa .
DY : We were doing tango on the terrace the other day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a week of feeling kind of depressed , and being involved in the anxiety of not knowing .
But after , you say , okay we 'll get through .
And cooking has been great for me .
I got a Ninja Foodi Deluxe pressure cooker , and I figured out how to make three different kinds of ribs .
How has the social distancing experience shifted your perspective on things ?  SY : Oh my God , it 's really shifted .
As Evan said , being thoughtful , having deeper conversations with yourself and others .
What 's important in the world right now ? What 's important for us as a family and for our business ? We did n't create it as a business , remember .
We created this so we could be creative , and to make things .
And I think the business has gotten so large that it 's time to really think about creation , and staying true to artistic visions .
All three of us love making things .
We did this to make things .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much time , listening to the senior executives in our company and talking to them for an hour straight , just hearing what they 're doing and thinking .
It 's just amazing that I had n't done enough of that , and how smart and entrepreneurial each one of them is .
We 're human .
We want to know how things are , how are you doing ? How are your kids ? And for me , that 's been the best part of this disaster .
