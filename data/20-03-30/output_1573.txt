DORSET 'S police officers are stopping people and vehicles and enforcing the Government 's lockdown measures .
After an emergency bill was passed through Parliament giving police new powers which allow them to enforce restrictions on public movement in a bid to reduce the spread of Covid-19 , officers were patrolling the county 's roads and beauty spots yesterday .
Within 30 minutes , they stopped more than 20 cars in which the drivers were travelling for exercise or to walk their dogs .
Cars were stopped all over the county , and people were warned to follow the rules .
Areas included Ringstead , where people were moved on , and Compton Abbas , where officers met a dog owner who wanted to walk their pet .
Non-essential travel goes against Government instructions and is breaking the law .
While officers were patrolling the Nothe area of Weymouth , they came across two people sunbathing .
Words of advice were given and they were told to move on .
A spokesman for Weymouth and Portland Police said : " We appreciate with the lovely weather and views people will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of exercise or essential travel .
"  Dorset Police Chief Constable James Vaughan has sent a clear message - stay at home - and says his officers will take action against those who continue to break the rules .
" I am reassured and satisfied that we have adequate powers to deal with the threat of this emergency situation and can enforce the new rules , " he said .
" We have shifted resources and created capacity across our force to ensure we have enough officers to enforce these new powers .
Our officers and staff are proactively patrolling our communities , stopping people and vehicles to ensure people are not flouting these restrictions .
So far I am reassured with the response from our public in Dorset , who in the main are taking sensible steps and are adhering to the advice .
" For some areas of the country , this weekend marks the start of the Easter holidays .
Please stay at home .
Driving to exercise , visit public locations or beauty spots is not within the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sectors .
" I have confidence that people understand the importance of these restrictions .
We have responsible and practical communities who I am sure will comply for the good of all .
" I have been appealing all week for the public to co-operate and need to emphasise that individuals who deliberately flout this will face the full force of the law .
We are determined to keep people safe .
