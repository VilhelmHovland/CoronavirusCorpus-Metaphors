Naropa University will cancel its May 9 commencement ceremony due to the spread of coronavirus , President Chuck Lief wrote in a letter to students , faculty members and staff members .
Approximately 235 students are graduating in May , said spokeswoman Ashley Chitwood , and the university is now looking at other options for commencement .
" We are currently working through the possibility of offering a virtual ceremony as well as considerations for combining the May commencement with December commencement , allowing the students a possible in-person ceremony , " Chitwood said in an email .
" We will be working through the details of the options in the coming days .
"  In his letter to campus , Lief said commencement is canceled " due to the cancellation of events at the CU Boulder Campus .
"  Naropa leaders did not look at organizing another in-person ceremony in May because of current requirements on social distancing and bans on large group gatherings , Chitwood said .
" It would not have been a good idea to bring people in from all over the country to accommodate graduation , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students and faculty members to look at other options for May commencement , Lief said .
" We want to be sure to honor those of you who have worked so hard to complete your degrees , and we will be sure to do that when we are able , and in a way that feels celebratory , " Lief wrote .
The university already transitioned to all online classes on March 11 , and Lief reiterated in the letter that online learning will continue for the rest of the semester .
" At this point the situation is so uncertain nationally that we do not even know if resuming in person classes will become possible , and that uncertainty is creating added stress for many of you , " Lief wrote .
" We realize that this will be good news to some , and disappointing to others .
We want to assure you we do n't make these decisions lightly .
"  Naropa leaders initially left open the possibility of returning to on-campus classes because that was what many schools across the country were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two weeks , virtually all schools in Colorado , and most of the schools across the U .
that we have been tracking through many sources , have chosen to remain online through the end of the semester , " he said .

While students have access to computer labs and resident halls remain open , nearly all other campus services are suspended .
Administrative offices are open for " essential personnel only , " campus libraries are closed , on-campus dining is closed and all art studios , dance spaces , music studios and rehearsal spaces are closed .
