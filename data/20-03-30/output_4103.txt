No sense of smell ? Red eyes ? Leg spasms ? Beware  No sense of smell ? Red eyes ? Leg spasms ? Beware  A number of bizarre new symptoms may be warning signs of Covid-19  not to be sneezed at Symptoms other than those related to flu have cropped up as possible indicators of Covid-19 .
Image : 123RF/Roman Iegoshyn  By now you are probably aware that a cough , shortness of breath or high temperature are warning signs of Covid-19 , and anyone who experiences them needs to self-isolate .
But another odd symptom seems to be a calling card : a sudden loss of smell .
The symptom appears to be common even though it is not yet widely acknowledged .
More than two thirds of those with coronavirus in Germany report losing their sense of smell , and 30% of sufferers in South Korea had anosmia as their main symptom , according to a report from ENT UK , an organisation that represents ear , nose and throat surgeons .
The smell loss associated with coronavirus is different to that which you might get with a normal cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhinological Society .
" Typically when you have a cold your nose is congested and no one is surprised you ca n't smell , " she says .
" But what 's happening here is there is no nasal obstruction , so people are surprised .
"  The best guess of experts so far seems to be that Covid-19 is affecting the smell nerves in the nose .
" We have seen evidence showing how the virus has the ability to affect the nerves , and the smell nerves are the only bits that are exposed in a way that no other nerves are , " says Carl Philpott , professor of rhinology at the UK 's University of East Anglia .
He believes the virus causes neuronitis or inflammation of the nerves in the nose , which stops them performing as they should .
Doing further research at present is difficult , says Philpott .
" We would need to examine the noses , and that 's what we 're telling people not to do as it puts the doctor at massive risk .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without the " typical " coronavirus symptoms , which means many will not be aware they have it .
This seems to be fairly common : in a study of suspected coronavirus sufferers with smell loss , one in six had it as the only symptom , according to Hopkins .
A further one in 10 lost their sense of smell before getting other symptoms , which shows they could be spreading infection before reaching the criteria that require self-isolation .
" A colleague told me he lost his sense of smell 48 hours before .
He got a private test , which was positive , which meant he could stay away and not infect patients .
"  Anosmia appearing without other symptoms is something we should be aware of , says Prof Nirmal Kumar , president of ENT UK .
" The spreading of it is difficult because these patients are n't terribly unwell , so they are walking around as if nothing is wrong , " he says .
This seems to be particularly the case with younger people : " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were otherwise fit and well this month .
That 's extremely unusual , I might usually see one a month , " says Hopkins .
Some patients who are reporting smell loss are also saying they have lost their ability to taste .
The likelihood is they are mistaking smell for taste , says Philpott .
" When you 're eating , 80% of what you appreciate of flavour is the smell , so people think they ca n't taste even though they can still get salty , sweet , bitter and sour .
"  Some patients are experiencing dysgeusia : things tasting different to normal .
Most people suffering this are describing a " metallic taste " , says Hopkins .
The good news is that the coronavirus-induced anosmia looks as if it will be temporary ; most patients who have reported it describe their sense of smell returning within a fortnight .
It could be that smell loss is not the only symptom of coronavirus that 's not being picked up .

Tracey Llewellyn  France 's diagnostic test asks 23 questions that cover sore throat , tiredness and aches , as well as loss of smell and taste .
The most important thing is to take smell loss seriously .
If you have suddenly lost your sense of smell , you should follow the recommendations for those with a new cough or temperature , says Kumar , and isolate yourself for at least seven days .
Two people who suffered loss of smell  ' I burnt dinner twice without realising '  March 16 was just another day in the office , a week later , the country was in lockdown and my cold-like symptoms had become a preoccupation .
Then came Wednesday and something particularly strange .
I had ordered a bottle of eucalyptus oil to be delivered .
When it arrived , I almost sent it back as defective -- it had no smell .
Next stop was the kitchen , where I first tried smelling coffee , then vinegar , followed by minced garlic .
That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smell .
It had n't happened gradually , it had gone all at once and in its entirety .
At this point , loss of smell had not been announced as a coronavirus indicator , so it was more puzzling than worrying , especially as I was n't feeling ill .
By Friday , it was added to the list of reported symptoms , I had lost my sense of taste , too , and with that my appetite -- nothing really seems worth the effort at the moment .
At the weekend , I burnt dinner twice , but did n't realise until the smoke alarms went off .
I do n't have the telltale symptoms of fever or dry cough , but I do have a chesty cough , slight breathlessness , aches in my neck and lower back , and a headache .
Fully aware of how rapidly the virus spreads , I have self-isolated as I do n't want to risk transmitting anything .
-- Tracey Llewellyn  ' My senses of smell vanished , but I did n't have a cough or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I spent last Monday evening with my dinner on my lap , watching British prime minister Boris Johnson 's address to the nation .
One half of my mind was focused on Johnson , as he announced sweeping changes to our way of life .
But the other half was focused on my beef stroganoff , which tasted remarkably bland .
After sniffing a strong-smelling bottle of gin , as well as a particularly pungent jar of mustard , I discovered that my senses of smell and taste had vanished .
Anosmia , I discovered after some online research , might be an early symptom of coronavirus .
I opened my laptop to fill in the NHS 's online diagnostic test , with the view to getting a blood test .
But after answering just five questions I was told it was " unlikely " to be coronavirus because I did n't have a cough or a fever .
According to Public Health England ( PHE ) , I was still perfectly entitled to visit the supermarket and rub my fingers all over the self-checkout screen .

My uncle , a doctor , tells me it could be the beginning or the end of coronavirus , or just a cold .
I do hope it 's the latter .
