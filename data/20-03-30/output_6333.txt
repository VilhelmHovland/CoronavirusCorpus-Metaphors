Facing the challenge of COVID-19  Part 3  Online entertainment in which Filipino talents excel may also get a big push from the boredom that quarantined people will suffer .
For example , internationally well-known Filipino singers like Marcelito Pomoy can deploy musical videos online that can get tens of millions of hits .
People in the creative arts , in which Filipinos are among the leading practitioners in Asia , should take advantage of the captive audiences in homes and quarantine zones who are looking for ways of overcoming ennui brought about by isolation required by the health measures being implemented to overcome the COVID-19 threat .
As concluded by the Frost and Sullivan study commissioned by the BPO-IT Industry Association two years ago , animation and game development subsection as well as related creative media productions are part of the IT services that can counteract the possible decline in the demand for voice-oriented BPO enterprises as robots and Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) replace call centre agents .
The year 2020 could mark a milestone in our mobilizing Filipino talents in the creative arts to prepare for a shift in the BPO-IT industry from voice-oriented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , mean putting up more courses such as those that have been famous by the St .
Benilde College and similar schools for the creative arts .
It is possible that there will be changes in lifestyle brought about the COVID-19 .
People will tend to be homebodies , travel less and spend more time working or having fun in their respective homes .
More than ever , Filipinos should take advantage of their creative talents .
The country may be able to capture a large share of the global and game development subsections of the BPO-IT industry .
In 2015 , this sector generated a revenue of $19 .
billion which is projected to reach $31 .
billion in 2022 .
With people spending more time at home , this could even be an underestimate .
The three core segments of the animation industry analyzed in the Frost and Sullivan study are TV animation , representing one-third ( 33 .
) of the market share ; movie animation or home video animation , with one-fourth ( 25 .
% ) and distributed animation , with 12 .
% of the market share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the key drivers are the growing availability of new platforms , such as internet streaming and on-demand TV , along with the increase in global broadcasting hours among many countries through satellite and cable TV .
Another driver is the advancements being seen in animation techniques , such as 3D animation , which opens a whole new market for the outsourcing industry .
Despite these bright prospects , there seems to still exist a shortage of skilled animators for digital or 3D animation .
Universities and technical schools in the Philippines should use the general slowdown in the economy to convince the youth to make use of their talents in this growing sector by taking specialized courses which need not be degree programs .
They an be technical courses offered in Grades 11 and 12 of the K to 12 curriculum .
The global animation market is projected to reach $31 .
billion by 2022 .
The movie and TV animation market contribute to more than 50% of the overall animation market .
The increasing adoption of smartphones and tablets , especially in the Philippines , is driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good number of the advisories , commentaries and even attempts at humor about COVID-19 have been in the forms of animated videos .
The majority of the animation outsourcing work is actually done in the production stage , covering pre-production , actual production itself and post production work .
Within the Asia Pacific region , India and the Philippines are capturing most of the business .
Asia is expected to be the global hub for animation outsourcing works .
It is estimated that 75% to 80% of all US-based animation programs are outsourced to Asia .
Western studios in the U .
and Europe are driven to outsource their work to Asian animation production houses because of the availability of a talented workforce at a significantly lower price .
For example , industry sources estimate that the cost of developing a full-length animated film is about 5 to 8 times lower if it was to be developed in India or the Philippines rather than in the United States .
If there will be a prolonged period to maintain the safety measures against COVID-19 , which would require more of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours of greater isolation should be used by those with creative talents to hone their skills in the animation industry which has come a long way since its humble , manual beginning .
Today , the industry is heavily reliant on technology for the entire process .
The Philippines , a market leader in hand-drawn artistry ( especially for the Japanese anime industry ) until digital animation took over , can still leverage its past to enlarge its footprint in the digital animation area by constantly analyzing overall technology trends , especially its pool of skilled 3D animators .
We have enough millennials and centennials ( those born after 2000 ) from the middle-income households who are among the first adopters of the newest digital technology .
It would be relatively easy for these young people to heed the advice given in the Frost and Sullivan Study to keep pace with the competition ( especially India ) by regularly updating their competencies .
These random considerations should convince those with Coronaphobia that there are enough activities in various sectors of the Philippine economy that should keep us busy and productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures not to be infected with the virus .
without succumbing to irrational fear mongering .
