Dyer : Trump , Johnson finally fall in line with putting needs of the old ahead of the economy  The basic choice all along with COVID-19 has been : do we let the old die , or do we take a big hit economically ? So far , the decision almost everywhere has been to take the hit and save the old ( or most of them ) , but in some places it has been a very near-run thing .
Today or tomorrow , for example , the number of deaths from coronavirus in the United States will surpass the total number who have died in China ( 3,304 people ) from what Donald Trump generally calls the " Chinese virus .
"  China has four times the population of the United States , but in the end around 50 times as many Americans will die from the coronavirus .
That is according to Trump 's own prediction on Sunday , in the speech where he finally did a U-turn , that " only " 100,000 ti 200,000 Americans will die because of his wise decision to extend the national lockdown to April 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last minute , if " last minute " is defined as the last moment when the right decision would have held American deaths down to the Chinese level .
But Trump was not alone in this dereliction of duty : his Mini-Me equivalent across the Atlantic , Britain 's Prime Minister Boris Johnson , also waited much too long , and the United Kingdom will be lucky to escape with 20,000 deaths .
Why did they wait so long before imposing the restrictions on movement that will break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 ? Because locking down the people also means locking down the economy : huge numbers of people will lose their jobs , at least temporarily , and the stock market will crash .
Whereas if you do n't impose the restrictions , perhaps on the plausible pretext that you are pursuing an alternative solution called " herd immunity , " then the economy will keep ticking over nicely .
However , achieving herd immunity requires 60 to 70 per cent of the population to have had the disease -- and with this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will die .
But who cares ? Almost all the victims will be over 70 , two-thirds of them will be male , and at least half of them will also have " underlying conditions " that are already forcing the health services to spend a lot just keeping them alive .
They are entirely dispensable to the economy .
We would be even richer if they did die .
Did Johnson understand that this was the real strategy ? Possibly not : he 's never been a " detail " man .
But his Svengali and chief political advisor , Dominic Cummings , certainly did understand it , and seems to have been perfectly OK with it .
What forced Johnson into a thinly disguised about-face two weeks ago was one or both of the following facts .
One : almost everybody his policy was condemning to death was somebody 's beloved father or mother .
And two : it amounted to carrying out a cull of Conservative voters , since two-thirds of British people in the over-70s group vote for the Tories .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strictest measures now will not keep the British death toll under 20,000 , according to the Imperial College London group that did the key calculations two weeks ago -- but half a million would have died without them .
And exactly the same equation applies to Donald Trump .
It 's always tough to know what Trump really believes , because he will say whatever he thinks works best politically at this precise moment .
If it flatly contradicts what he said yesterday , he does n't care .
And if some journalist calls him on the contradiction , he just denies what he said yesterday .
It does n't matter if the statement is on the record ; it 's " fake news .
"  We can not know if Trump ever really understood the choice he was making when he condemned lockdowns and repeatedly promised the imminent reopening of the economy .
And then , two weeks after the Imperial College group published its prediction that without lockdowns 2 .
million Americans would die , he finally read it and reversed course .
Or so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for saving two million American lives by abandoning his old strategy ( if that 's the right word for it ) .
His real calculation , at some level of his conscious or unconscious mind , was that his re-election in November would be even more damaged by two million needless American deaths on his watch than by a deep recession and huge unemployment .
But at least half of the Americans who will still die would have survived had he moved two weeks sooner , when he already had ample evidence that it was the only sane course .
Exactly the same criticism applies to Boris Johnson .
But here 's a consoling thought .
Everywhere from China and India to Spain and Russia , and even in the United Kingdom and the United States ( after stalling as long as possible ) , governments are putting the lives of the " useless " old ahead of the alleged needs of the economy .
Because that 's what their people really want .
