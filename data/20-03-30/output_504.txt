( photo credit : AHMED YOSRI/ REUTERS )  Saudi Arabia , the world 's second-largest oil producer , started a price war , ushered in by failed talks between OPEC and Russia .
The talks were intended to address the major challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic .
" The Saudi 's motive for cutting production was the drop in demand for oil which is a consequence of the lockdowns enforced around the world over coronavirus , " Danny Zaken , a journalist and lecturer at Sapir Academic College , told The Media Line .
Russia refused to cut production and consequently negotiations failed and the alliance between OPEC and Russia collapsed .
Russia says it is waiting to see what the full impact of the outbreak will be on demand .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign purchasers , declaring that it would cut April 's selling price by nearly 50% ( from $14 to $8 per barrel ) while boosting production .
Yoel Guzansky , a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , told The Media Line that " the timing is bad , leaving the Saudi economy in bad shape .
"  " The decision was impulsive and is characteristic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman 's leadership .
He is an extrovert and much more liberal than his predecessors , " says Zaken .
His motive may have been to weaken the position of other oil-producing countries or to get even with Russia .
Guzansky argues that it could be both , while Zaken suggests the former is the main reason .
" Mohammed bin Salman is fighting for control of the oil market and OPEC " and feels it is financially able to endure lower prices .
Moscow 's revenues from oil and gas are expected to be substantially lower than expected due to the dramatic fall in oil prices .
Lower revenues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will incur a deficit in 2020 .
Market Forecast  Against the backdrop of the ongoing oil price war , OPEC 's output limits were placed on hold .
Consequently , the group 's biggest producers will produce more oil in order to protect their market shares .
Hence , an attempt is being made to offset lower prices by increasing the volume of sales .
However , this is a formidable task as the coronavirus pandemic has significantly squeezed demand .
Consumers around the world are forced to stay home in a desperate attempt by governments to combat the virus 's spread .
Thus , lower prices will not necessarily increase the demand for fuel .
Consequences on Regional Geopolitics  According to Guzansky , " One possible consequence of the oil price war could be the formation of an alliance between OPEC and the USA to replace the OPEC-Russia alliance .
"  " The current oil price war is likely to have far-reaching consequences on global economies including the USA , " Prof .
Andrew Grimaluk of the General Economic Theory and Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line .
Prof .
Nikolai Lastovenko , from the same university , told The Media Line that the economic fallout resulting from the current oil price war would be more profound than that of 1973 .
Consequences on the United States  " The US is very concerned over the increase in production , " Guzansky said .
" The decision by Mohammed bin Salman to decrease prices and increase the production of oil is bad for the USA .
"  However , Zaken argues that , behind the scenes , the United States backs the Saudi decision to decrease production .
" It 's a game of who will be in control , " Zaken said .
Consequences on Oil-exporting Countries  While Saudi Arabia 's actions are aimed at punishing Russia , they could also have negative repercussions for nations whose economies depend on oil exports , such as Venezuela and Iran , and emerging economies such as Brazil , Angola and Nigeria .
Consequences on Israel  The ongoing price war seems to be ushering in short-term gains for the Israeli economy .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decrease in the price of oil on April 1 , which is good for both consumers and industry .
" However , in the long run , " the drop in oil prices may lead to instability in Saudi Arabia and other oil economies , which is n't good for Israel .
