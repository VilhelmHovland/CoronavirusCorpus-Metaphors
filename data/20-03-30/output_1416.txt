The gardener in the privately owned park opposite where I live started by blowing the leaves off all the paths ( there were very few anyway ) and is now cutting the lawn ( which had not grown much since last Monday when he cut them ) .
Clearly essential work and one must stick to the schedule .
I was talking to someone yesterday who was really panicking because they had been outside quite often and now thought they were going to get the virus - ' But Boris said it was OK .
' Do nt really know where I stand on this one .
