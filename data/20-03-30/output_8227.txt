Florida appears to be the only state getting all its federal coronavirus equipment requests met  Many states have requested ventilators , N95 face masks , gowns , face shields , and other essential equipment from the federal emergency stockpile as their hospitals prepare for or struggle under a surge of COVID-19 cases , but only Florida has gotten 100 percent of what it asked for , The Washington Post reported Sunday .
Massachusetts said it has received 17 percent of its requested protective gear while Maine has gotten about 5 percent and West Virginia about 1 percent .
But Florida , which did n't make its first request until March 11 -- later than many other states -- received its full request three days later , then got an identical shipment on March 23 and is expecting a third , the Post reports , citing the state Division of Emergency Management .
" This disparity has not been lost on the states that feel shortchanged in their requests from the Strategic National Stockpile , " ProPublica reported a week ago .
Florida officials and President Trump offered a similar explanation for what appears to be special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president daily , and the entire congressional delegation has been working as one for the betterment of the state of Florida , " Jared Moskowitz , director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management , told the Post .
" We are leaving no stone unturned .
" On Sunday , Trump said at a news conference that " Florida has been taken care of , " along with other states , adding later : " Florida , I looked , they 're very aggressive in trying to get things and they 're doing a very good job .
" Florida Gov .
Ron DeSantis ( R ) , who has been criticized for keeping the beaches open during Spring Break , is a close ally of Trump .
Florida is also Trump 's new home of record .
Control over the Strategic National Stockpile passed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) to a different Health and Human Services Department division in late 2018 and then to the Federal Emergency Management Agency barely a week ago .
FEMA has , but wo n't detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Post reports , and there does n't seem to be a uniform rationale for how the limited stockpiles are allocated .
" If a governor jumps up and down and yells and screams , it gets attention , " Nicole Lurie , a former HHS emergency preparedness official in the Obama administration , tells ProPublica .
" It probably helps to have a really loud megaphone .
