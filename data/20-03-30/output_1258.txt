Harry and Meghan are ' celebrities ' who should pay own way , ex-minister says  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now celebrities not members of the monarchy who should fund their own personal security , a former Government minister has said .
Harry and Meghan were forced to disclose they had put in place " privately funded security arrangements " for their move to the US after President Donald Trump said his country would not pay for their protection .
The couple will officially walk away from the royal family at the end of the day , starting a new life in Los Angeles , with their impending exit from The Firm dubbed Megxit .
Former Home Office minister Norman Baker said : " As far as I 'm concerned they are now private citizens , they 're not members of the royal family they 've absented themselves .
" They 're not carrying out any royal duties so there 's no reason at all why the British taxpayer should support them in security .
Harry and Meghan will formally step down as senior royals from Tuesday ( Mark Large/Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood , or wherever it is , that 's up to them but they should bear the costs of security themselves .
" You would n't expect the British taxpayer to pay for Posh and Becks or Elton John and David Furnish so why should they pay for Harry and Meghan .
"  The duke and duchess ' desire to earn money while remaining members of the monarchy was unworkable and so they chose to leave and become financially independent .
But it is not known where the private funds to pay for their security will come from , whether their own money , financial support from the Prince of Wales or another source .
Mr Baker , who has written the book And What Do You Do ? about the monarchy , added : " They talked about private security but what they have n't said is who is paying for it , I think we still need to have the answer to that question .
"  I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom .
It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would reside permanently in Canada .
Now they have left Canada for the U .
however , the U .
will not pay for their security protection .
They must pay !  From Tuesday , the monarch 's grandson and his wife will no longer use their HRH styles as they pursue their new life of personal and financial freedom in America .
But the couple are leaving the monarchy just as the country braces itself for the worst of the coronavirus pandemic , expected in the coming weeks , and after Charles completed his seven day self-isolation after contracting the virus .
Royal author Penny Junor said Harry and Meghan were now " pretty irrelevant " as the royal family attempted to lead the nation through the health crisis .
She said : " It 's a great morale boost to have words from the Queen or words from William and to watch his children clapping the NHS workers .
It 's important .
"  Ms Junor went on to say : " All of this is absolutely what the family is about and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now are pretty irrelevant .
