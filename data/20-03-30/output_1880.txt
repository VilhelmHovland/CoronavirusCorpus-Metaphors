KUALA LUMPUR : The Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs ( IDEAS ) has called for fiscal transparency in the recently announced RM250 billion economic stimulus package implementation , specifically its source of financing .
IDEAS fellows Tricia Yeoh and Sri Murniati said the origins of funds for the stimulus package , not addressed in Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin 's announcement last Friday , should be addressed publicly , as it is the government 's duty to be fiscally responsible .
The RM250 billion economic stimulus package is intended to tackle negative economic impacts of the Covid-19 crisis .
From this amount , Muhyiddin said the actual total fiscal injection is only RM25 billion .
" Will the RM25 billion be drawn from the National Contingencies Fund ? Article 11(3) of the Financial Procedure Act 1957 states the minister of finance may make advances from the Contingencies Fund to meet an ' urgent and unforeseen need for expenditure for federal purposes for which no other provision exists ' , which presumably this would fall under .
" In fact , the available balance in the Contingencies Fund as at end-2018 was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Contingencies Fund , this is nowhere close to the RM25 billion intended to be spent , and even so it is meant for development and not operating expenditure , " Yeoh and Murniati wrote in an article recently .
The duo said the RM25 billion could also be reallocated from the existing Budget 2020 , but this requires Parliament 's approval .
" Although the Financial Procedure Act is not very clear about the rules of virement between ministries as it only prohibits virement within ministries , any budget reallocation , under normal circumstances , requires the convening of Parliament , in the interest of democratic oversight , good governance and accountability .
" All national budgets -- and supplementary budgets -- are by convention tabled , debated and approved by Parliament , so our elected representatives can transparently discuss matters of national interest , " they said .
A third option , according to them , is to fund the stimulus package through borrowings .
" If so , how much will it add to outstanding debts ? As at end-June 2019 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 .
of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , below the self-imposed limit of 55% .
" Even if a small percentage of the RM25 billion is financed through borrowings , the government needs to be transparent in stating how the debt-to-GDP ratio will be affected , and whether it breaches the 55% limit , " they said .
They pointed out the government should elaborate on the economic stimulus package impact on the budget 's balance .
" If the current source of financing is not from the budget 's reallocation and is in fact an additional expenditure , Malaysia 's Budget 2020 will amount to RM322 billion in total .
" This would increase the deficit rate from 3 .
to 4 .
to GDP , calculated based on 2020 GDP estimates , which may change due to the current economic situation .
" A less-efficient budget deficit is not entirely bad considering we are facing a crisis .
Countries worldwide have also announced equally large economic stimulus packages since the onset of Covid-19 , and a balanced budget target is not necessarily many governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " But what is clear is the government needs to acknowledge that it would likely miss the balanced budget target and be open about it , " they said .
They also said the Fiscal Responsibility Act , due to be tabled next year , must include clauses for situations where the government can immediately disburse much-needed financing in a transparent and fiscally responsible manner .
