Questioning authority in times of crisis is not unpatriotic .
It 's critical .
We want our leaders to be successful , that means holding them accountable .
This makes our country stronger .
This week , we 've done just that .
Last Friday , President Donald Trump defended the nation 's response to the pandemic : " This administration inherited an obsolete , broken , old system that was n't meant for this .
We discarded that system .
And we 're very proud of what we 've done .
"  Kenneth Bernard , a former assistant surgeon general who wrote the 2004 biodefense plan under President George W .
Bush , replied : " If it was broken , why did n't you fix it two years ago ? "  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2014 and the global economic meltdown in 2008 -- world leaders joined forces to confront the threat of disease and economic collapse , " she wrote .
But the reaction to COVID-19 has been very " state-centric , " said Yanzhong Huang , a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations .
As a result , our story shows , " individual governments are competing to secure scarce medical supplies from a strained global supply chain , closing borders with little to no notice to their neighbors , and lobbing verbal broadsides that threaten to deepen the discord .
"  In an important story published today , our reporters tracked down officials previously in charge of stockpiling emergency medical supplies for the U .
Those officials told us that the stockpile has never had enough funds to buy everything experts believed was needed for the variety of threats facing the American public .
Each year , they took educated guesses about what to buy , and recently , that has n't included large amounts of masks or ventilators .
That 's why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Frieden , one of the nation 's leading experts on public health and infectious disease , told us he questions why the CDC is n't " centrally involved in making decisions " during this crisis .
Frieden , the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former New York City health commissioner , was on a video conference with the USA TODAY editorial board Tuesday .
( Read the excellent Q&amp;A , here )  " This is the first outbreak in the last 75 years that CDC has n't been centrally involved in making decisions at the table , " he said .
" Not that it 's the only group that makes decisions , but it 's got unique expertise in communicating those decisions .
And frankly , I feel less safe because of that .
" CDC has the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases ( NCIRD ) .
There are 700 professionals working there .
They 've worked , on average , for 20 years on respiratory viral infections , " he said .
" They 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's worked on lung infections , and I would n't trust myself to make these decisions .
I would trust them to bring the best decisions out .
The public health experts are the folks at CDC , and not having them there is just not safe .
"  And , of course , we 're here to help .
To connect you .
To inform and empower you .
To elevate truth and snuff out misinformation .
" The amount of misinformation being published on coronavirus is truly staggering , " said Katie Wadington , one of our fact check editors .
That 's why our efforts , and those of all journalists out there working to spread the truth , are more important than ever .
There have been more than 7 million views of our coronavirus fact checks in the past nine days .
" I am doing this , " says fact check editor Martina Stewart , " because , like all journalists , I 'm committed to facts and providing useful information to people that helps inform their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
