But there was another change that could have a more immediate impact on the Blue Jays .
As part of the Thursday 's agreement , MLB secured the right to limit this year 's draft to five rounds and to push bonus money to 2021 and 2022 .
The league also can delay the annual June draft until later in the summer .
MLB made the requests to increase cash flow at a time when the season has been postponed indefinitely because of the coronavirus .
With the season postponed indefinitely because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a simple way for MLB to cut expenses .
The MLBPA , meanwhile , sacrificed earnings of those who do not yet belong to the union in exchange for concessions elsewhere .
The potential changes could be concerning for Toronto .
The Blue Jays are set to pick fifth overall , which is their highest position in the draft since they selected Vernon Wells in that spot in 1997 .
If there was something positive to come out of last year 's 67-win season , beyond transitioning rookies to the big leagues , it was supposed to be an advantage in the draft .
No matter what happens over the next few weeks , the Blue Jays will pick fifth at some point later this year .
A delayed , or even cancelled , season is not going to rob Toronto of that opportunity .
But fewer rounds will impact Toronto 's bonus pool allotment , and the dip in funds provided by the league might convince more high school players to choose college over professional baseball .

If an organization exceeds its allotment , it faces tax penalties and -- depending on the level of overpay -- the loss of picks .
The recommended slot values will remain frozen at 2019 levels for the next two years , according to a report from The Athletic 's Ken Rosenthal .
Previously , there were annual increases of approximately three per cent .
That means , if there is a regular-sized draft this year , the Jays would have a bonus pool allotment of $11,565,500 ( U .
) , up from last year 's total of $8,069,100 , when they picked 15th overall .

If the draft drops to five rounds , Toronto 's cash advantage over other teams will become more limited .
It 's still better to draft early than late , but the benefits are smaller than they would be in any other year .
Then there 's the issue of the player pool itself .
Smaller amounts of upfront cash mean there will be fewer incentives for high schoolers to turn pro .

Others could opt for a junior college program .
Even some current college players might decide to stick around for a senior season .
The changes are unlikely to impact the players projected to go in the first round .
The prospects in line for the top bonuses still figure to take the money , even if some of it wo n't be paid out for two years .
It will , however , impact lots of others and alter team strategies .
In 2012 , Toronto used its 10th-round pick on outfielder Alex Azor , just a few months before he was set to report for military duty .
Azor agreed to a $1,000 deal and later said he would have signed for a " hot dog .
" Toronto 's front office could not have cared less that Azor went on to appear in just 14 games , because the main purpose of the pick had nothing to do with the player .
It was about saving approximately $124,000 on the recommended slot bonus and redistributing those funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few other teams used similar strategies that year and it became somewhat commonplace in following drafts .
Steve Sanders , Toronto 's former amateur scouting director , modified that strategy , with one example coming in 2018 when the Jays signed first-rounder Jordan Groshans to a below-slot deal and gave right-hander Adam Kloffenstein more money in round three .

Some of those moves can still be used in an abbreviated draft but only on a smaller scale .
Last year , the fifth pick of Round 6 came with a recommended slot value of $291,400 and the amounts went down on a sliding scale through Round 10 , which had a slot value of $147,000 .
By comparison , the team with the last selection had a sixth-rounder worth $237,000 and a 10th rounder worth $142,000 .
The difference in each individual round might not seem like much until everything gets added together .
The more rounds there are , the bigger the discrepancy becomes and the more creative teams at the top can be .
The fewer rounds there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away a couple picks in the first 10 rounds might not seem like a big deal when there are 40-plus to work with .
It 's a much different when there are only five .

Until teams start generating revenue again , owners will want to save cash where they can .
The potential loss of multiple rounds ca n't be considered a huge blow , not during a global pandemic , when everyone has much bigger issues to worry about , but there will be an impact .
Some might look at this situation and think amateur scouting director Shane Farrell 's job just got a lot easier .
It might end up being the opposite .
With fewer selections to work with , and less money to spend , there will be increased attention on every pick and much more pressure than ever to get each one right .
