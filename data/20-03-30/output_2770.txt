What to do if you 're laid off because of the coronavirus  Nearly one million Canadians applied for employment insurance ( EI ) benefits between March 16 and March 22 and you can be sure that the COVID-19 crisis will have caused another massive spike in applications this week .
Just look at what 's happened since Monday : WestJet announced that 6,900 people were leaving the company , while Leon 's Furniture let go of 3,900 staffers .
A survey from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , also released this week , found that one-third of small business owners may soon have to shut their doors .
Yes , the news , at least at this very moment , is dire , but there are some things you can do to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing anything , it 's important to understand whether you 've been temporarily laid off or permanently laid off .
If you 've been temporarily laid off , your work has essentially been frozen in time .
You wo n't get paid by your company , but you are still entitled to any medical benefits and if your employer wants you back at work , they can call you in without any notice .
If you are permanently laid off , you will be entitled to severance , which varies by province -- see more details on that below -- and there 's no guarantee your employee brings you back when the social distancing ends .
Apply for benefits , asap  Whether temporary or permanent , the minute your work ends , you should apply for EI benefits .
Prior to this crisis you had to wait seven days to apply and you needed a record of employment from your workplace , but no longer -- as part of its coronavirus actions , the Canadian government waived the waiting period and it 's now letting you supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fully understand what you 're entitled to , but , basically , you can collect 55 per cent of your average insurable earnings up to a maximum of $573 a week .
There are also plenty of people who may be out of work who are n't eligible for EI , like self-employed folks , gig-economy workers or employees who do n't meet the minimum number of hours to qualify for EI .
Fortunately , the government has something for you , too .
Starting on April 6 , Canadians who ca n't receive EI and those who can receive it , but may be off work and not earning money because they 're either caring for someone who has contracted COVID-19 , who are sick themselves or they ca n't work with their children around , can receive $2000 a month until mid-October .
( You will have to pay some income tax on that come tax time .
)  If you have been permanently laid off , you may be entitled to severance payments from your now ex-employer .
According to Lara Spiers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 'll receive depends on what 's in your contract .
Some contracts will state exactly what you 're entitled to , while others will not .
In the case of the latter , you should expect to receive an amount based on common law , which varies based on age , experience , changes of getting a new job and more , says Spiers .
At the bare minimum , you 're entitled to one week 's pay for every month you 've worked , but many employers will pay something more than that .
If you can afford it , it 's a good idea to talk to an employment lawyer , though it may be harder these days to push your former bosses to give you additional weeks or months of pay .
Tap your network and start looking for work  It may seem like an odd time to look for work , but a lot of companies are hiring .
A quick search on Randstad 's website for jobs in Toronto brings up 368 postings .
There are a variety of positions too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting and administrative support .
Grocery stores , heath companies and the many businesses that support in-demand operations are also hiring , says Spiers .
Take the time to update your resume and LinkedIn profile ( here 's a good list of things to do on LinkedIn after a layoff ) and then start applying .
If you have n't updated a resume in a while , there are a number of companies that can help you create a more appealing document .
Do n't be shy about calling up an old colleague to see if there are any openings at their workplace either -- everyone knows what 's going on right now .
And while you may not be able to go for a catch-up coffee , you and your friend can each fill up a mug with your drink of choice ( maybe stick to the java during the day ) and chat over FaceTime or Google Hangouts .
It 's important to continue engaging on social media , too , especially on LinkedIn , says Spiers .
" Your online presence is more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you need to post long-winded updates about your life or opine on the world 's greatest management tips , but sharing the occasional article and responding to other people 's comments will keep you in front of your network .
Put your skills to use  If you find yourself with too much time on your hands at home , you may want to consider taking a course -- a number of universities , including Ivy League ones , are offering free online courses ( here 's a list of some ) -- or volunteering , says Spiers .
While you likely ca n't volunteer in person right now , there may be ways to help out either virtually or from home .
Maybe a non-profit organization you care about needs marketing help or they 're looking for a finance expert to see what they can do to stay afloat .
Find ways to put your skills to use .
Getting laid off is not easy , even if half the people you know are also suddenly out of work .
The key is to stay busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind that , at some point , this will pass and the work will come .
