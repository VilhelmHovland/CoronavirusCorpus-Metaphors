Four tech companies are named in the post : US giants , Microsoft ( MSFT ) , Google ( GOOG ) and Palantir - a controversial organisation that provides services for US agencies as well as international NGOs .
The fourth firm is Faculty AI , which is based in London .
NHSX - a unit within the healthcare system responsible for digital innovation - is heading the effort to harness a range of data sources , so that they could be used in combination .
The ambitious goal is a dashboard that pulls in real time information about the pandemic which will help medics and the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks to particularly vulnerable groups of people  Increase resources in emerging hotspots almost immediately  Get critical equipment to hospitals and other facilities in greatest need  Send patients to hospitals best able to care for them based on current demand , resources and staffing levels  The NHS says that the information would mostly be drawn from existing data sources , and would be anonymised so that individual patients could not be identified .
This process will involve scrubbing the data of identifiers like names and addresses and replacing them with a " pseudonym , " it said .
Who 's doing what ?  The NHS said :  Microsoft had built a data store on its Azure cloud computing platform to hold the information in a single , secure location  Palantir is providing use of its Foundry software tool , which analyses records to deliver a " single source of truth "  Faculty AI is making dashboards , models and simulations that decision-makers would view  Google 's G Suite of productivity apps could be used to collect real-time operational data like occupancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised concerns , namely with Palantir , which is controversial for its role in helping US immigration agents track and deport undocumented immigrants , as well as its work with the CIA overseas .
The NHS is partnering with Palantir , of ICE fame , for data management and analytics in the corona crisis .
A break for Palantir in the UK -- and a somewhat risky choice for the NHS .
Would love to see the due diligence on this .

They continue : " After the emergency is over , we hope to be able to use what we have learned from our technology partners to get better within the Government at data collection , aggregation and analysis in a way that protects the privacy of our citizens .
