City bylaw officers will continue to perform wellness checks on the homeless population , while also monitoring places that have been closed to the public to ensure compliance with orders  A bylaw officer moves two panhandlers along in Sahali in the summer of 2015 .
Photograph By Dave Eagles/KTW file  Bylaw officers will be armed with education and the absence of a state of local emergency wo n't change much for the City of Kamloops as the municipality continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic .
Those were some of the answers Kamloops Mayor Ken Christian had for reporters on the steps of city hall on Friday , a day after new ministerial orders were handed down by Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General Mike Farnworth .
Farnworth said one of the new measures enables municipal bylaw officers to help ensure compliance with social-distancing orders , which could carry fines or jail time .
However the written version of the order does n't permit bylaw officers to detain people contravening those rules , nor can they issue fines .
Rather , the order enables bylaw officers to monitor places that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue warnings and report contraventions to Provincial Health Officer Dr .
Bonnie Henry .
" There seems to be some inconsistency between what the minister said about the ability to fine , " Christian said , noting the city has received many inquiries about on those powers .
When it comes to enforcing social-distancing measures , Christian said education is the city 's best tool .
" Many of the people that we see congregating are not people who would have the means to pay a fine anyway , nor are they people we want to incarcerate , nor do we have the capacity to incarcerate people , " Christian said .
He said bylaw officers conduct wellness checks on people living on the streets , which will continue .
The city closed Hillside Stadium earlier this week due to the public 's lack of compliance on social- distancing requirements .
Christian said city staff noticed a number of people continuing to play soccer on the field and gather in groups to walk around the track at the stadium .
He said the municipality wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " We want people to be able to get outdoors , but just by themselves or with their family units , " Christian said .
Also included in the province 's orders is the suspension of all local states of emergency -- except for City of Vancouver , which has its own community charter -- to better co-ordinate emergency response between cities and the province .
Christian told reporters that move does not change any of the restrictions the city had put in place under its state of local emergency , which was in effect from March 20 to March 27 .
Those restrictions included closing numerous public buildings to the public and prohibiting playgrounds to be used .
In addition , there is the potential use of city facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic for self-isolation , testing , medical care , warehousing and distribution .
Christian said Sandman Centre and Tournament Capital Centre have been identified for those purposes .
" There 's some other facilities within the community that could be put in to play and those decisions would be made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Authority , " Christian said .
