Coronavirus : ' Not clear if we will be back on campus this fall , ' writes Miami U .
dean  Miami University officials are considering the possibility that the novel coronavirus crisis will prevent students from returning to campus next fall , according to an internal email obtained by The Enquirer .
" Because it is not clear if we will be back on campus this fall , we would ideally like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " wrote College of Arts and Sciences Dean Christopher Makaroff .
The email , addressed to department leaders , also outlines a number of possibilities under consideration to address " significant " financial consequences brought on by the pandemic , including an expected sharp decline in enrollment next fall .
Miami , like other area colleges , has shifted to remote learning for the remainder of the semester and canceled commencement .
But the email indicates the effects of the virus will extend well past this academic year .

Makaroff 's email , which The Enquirer has published in its entirety below , warns of possible impending budget constraints and gives insight into Miami officials ' ideas for addressing them .
A proposal to cut certain teaching roles drew criticism from Cathy Wagner , the president of the American Association of University Professors , an advocacy group at Miami .
Wagner said the potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student enrollment confirmations are currently down 20% at Miami , Makaroff wrote , and to compensate he asked department chairs to devise academic schedules for a series of hypothetical scenarios :  Student demand dropping 20% " across the board .
"  Cutting all or half the positions filled by visiting assistant professors , or VAPs .
VAPs teach on one-year contracts for up to five years and receive benefits but are not tenured or on the tenure track .
Consolidating or increasing class sizes where possible .
Limiting the service and research faculty can perform .
Increasing faculty teaching loads  Wagner said the prospect of cutting visiting assistant professors concerns her , especially if they are the only group facing job loss .
" We think there should be shared sacrifice , " said Wagner , who is a creative writing professor at the university .
" I 'm not sure we 're seeing shared sacrifice .
"  More than 150 visiting assistant professors comprised more than 15% of Miami 's full-time faculty in 2018 , the last year data is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roles .
Other lower ranking positions at Miami -- those that are not tenured or tenure-track -- skewed female .
Men hold three in five higher ranking full-time faculty positions at Miami .
" Think about the current crisis .
The research we do is super useful , " Wagner said , listing field such as psychology , logistics and economics .
" We need the research .
"  Carole Johnson , a Miami spokesperson , downplayed the potential trouble facing the university in an email to The Enquirer .
" Despite the COVID-19 pandemic , which is leading applicants around the world to delay their college decisions , we expect another strong incoming class , " Johnson wrote .
" Because there are no precedents for this situation , Miami , like all well-managed universities , must plan for a variety of economic scenarios .
Miami is strong financially and academically .
"  " At a time when MU needs to aggressively recruit in alternative and creative ways , and make a strong case for its value for incoming and returning students , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she wrote .
" We can give our students confidence that we are still here to serve them the best possible way , without any loss to the quality of education they are paying for .
"  Sara Kilpatrick , the executive director of the Ohio Conference AAUP , criticized proposals to cut instruction budgets as a first resort .
" I think that all colleges and universities are going to be facing some difficult financial realities , especially in the wake of COVID-19 , " Kilpatrick said , but " we have to remember this is about educating students .
"  Like Wagner , Kilpatrick said if academic cuts are made , proportionate ones should be made in areas like administration and athletics .
" There definitely could be resources redirected to the instructional mission so these ( teaching positions ) are n't cut , " Kilpatrick said .
Wagner contrasted Miami officials ' thinking with Ohio University .
Though Ohio University had planned before the crisis to make $26 million in personnel cuts over three years , it recently announced it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote that " our current focus must be on the safety and well-being of our campus communities as we continue to ensure the education of our students and service to our region .
"  Miami had about $375 million more in unrestricted funds than Ohio University as of June 2019 , according to state audit records , a discrepancy that Wagner emphasized as she discussed Ohio University 's planned pause in cuts .
" It 's remarkable that Miami , in a robust and strong situation .
was not able to do something like that , " she said .
" If there was ever a time to dip into ( Miami 's $349 million ) rainy-day fund , I would think it would be now .
"  Johnson , the Miami spokesperson , wrote the university has " the highest financial score among Ohio 's public universities based on the Ohio Department of Higher Education financial ratios .
"  " Miami 's actions outstrip cost-saving measures other universities are taking , " states the petition , which had about 150 signatures by 12:3 p .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been no indication that workload policy adjustments will be reviewed by Senate .
"  Wagner did compliment Miami administration 's proactive response to the crisis , including its responsiveness to health guidelines , strong communication with faculty and dedication to training faculty in online teaching .
Makaroff 's email also addressed more immediate concerns .
He wrote only " essential spending , " such as for supplies , would be approved for the remainder of the current school year .
Guest lecturers will no longer be approved after March 20 .
Fall registration , which is currently set to open April 22 , will be postponed by two weeks .
