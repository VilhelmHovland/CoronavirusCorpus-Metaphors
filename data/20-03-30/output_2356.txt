THUNDER BAY -- Minister of Health Patty Hajdu says while COVID-19 has n't swept into Northwestern Ontario in great numbers to date , it 's not the time to get complacent .
Hajdu , also the Liberal MP in Thunder Bay-Superior North , said despite being front-and-centre in the country 's pandemic efforts , she 's been paying close attention to what 's going on in the region and her riding .
Only one confirmed case has been diagnosed in Thunder Bay , a 60-year-old man who returned to Canada after a week in Florida .
His wife is also suspected to have the virus .
small numbers to date are great , but nothing to celebrate , Hajdu said .
" It is good news , but it is also early , " Hajdu said .
" We know that since the spread of COVID-19 , it does often hit the larger centres , where there is more international travel and more dense populations and denser living conditions that increase the likelihood of spread .
" But I do n't think that means we can let down our guard in Northwestern Ontario .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as people start to make plans to maybe get away to their cottages , etc .
, there 's an even stronger risk in these more remote areas of Northwestern Ontario .
"  Hajdu added she 's encouraged Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre will soon be able to administer and analyze its own COVID-19 tests .
" That 's going to make a huge difference in terms of our capacity to react quickly in the North , to be able to have testing validation locally and close to home as part of our national strategy around testing .
The fact that labs are getting up and running across the country in smaller communities like Thunder Bay is very , very important .
"  While some politicians south of the border , notably President Donald Trump , have been suggesting it will be business as usual in a couple of weeks , downplaying the seriousness of the virus , the Health Minister said Canada does n't see it that way and she is worried about cross-border rhetoric suggesting otherwise .
" We are concerned about any country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United States , and their cases rising so rapidly and the messaging that we know their approach is different than ours or potentially different than ours , " Hajdu said , adding it played a major factor in the joint decision with the U .
to close the border last Friday to all non-essential traffic .
" We 're following our own scientists and our own public health leaders who are giving us the science as it unfolds , not just in Canada , but internationally .
And we 're part of a number of international research projects as well .
" So while we do this social distancing , we 're not resting and just hoping for a good outcome .
We 're actually combining our research and science efforts with the world .
"  To help ease worried business owners and employees , on Friday the Trudeau Liberals announced they plan to increase the wage subsidy to qualifying small- and medium-sized businesses from an initial offer of 10 per cent , to 75 per cent .
The move should allow more Canadian businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion .
Hajdu urged Canadians to stay the course .
" We have to rely on the science here .
I understand the desire and the tension , by the way , to maybe wish this away and think that it 's not serious .
But we 've got enough examples around the world , of significant negative outcomes , that I do n't think we can rest on our laurels and hope that this is n't happening and the science is wrong , " Hajdu said .
As for the stress of the job , the second-term cabinet minister said it 's been a whirlwind couple of months , but the sacrifice must be made .
" I think the hardest part for me now is with all the travel disruptions in my own schedule , I have n't been home now for two weeks .
So I have n't seen my partner and it 's looking like this weekend is more and more likely that I 'll be in Ottawa again , " she said .
" So that uncertainty of being able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardest part .
