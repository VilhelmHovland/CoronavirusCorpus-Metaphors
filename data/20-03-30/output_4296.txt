Medical fetish fights the novel coronavirus  MedFetUK announced its correspondence with National Health Service ( NHS ) representatives from across the country who wanted to acquire basic protective equipment and clothing for health workers in a deathmatch with the coronavirus pandemic .
While the company declined to identify which hospital received its " few sets " of scrubs in stock , they did let slip that it was located in the south of England .
The company added that the ordeal was " scandalous , " and that it was " being sought out as last-resort supplier " for the NHS amid the crisis , and further explained how claims from politicians that health workers were getting what they needed were untrue .
Today we donated our entire stock of disposable scrubs to an NHS hospital .
It was just a few sets , because we do n't carry large stocks , but they were desperate , so we sent them free of charge .
do n't usually do politics on Twitter , but here 's a short thread .
1/5 **26;8966;TOOLONG  In a tweet about the donation on Friday , MedFetUK said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an NHS hospital .
It was just a few sets , because we do n't carry large stocks , but they were desperate , so we sent them free of charge .
"  Additional tweets followed : " When you see someone from the government saying the NHS is getting what it needs , that is a LIE .
We have been contacted this week by representatives of NHS procurement all over the country , trying to source basic protective equipment and clothing .
"  " When we , a tiny company set up to serve a small section of the kink community , find ourselves being sought out as a last-resort supplier to our National Health Service in a time of crisis , something is seriously wrong .
In fact , it 's scandalous .
"  Funding cuts to the NHK  A decade of funding cuts to the NHS has let it " barely able to cope under normal circumstances , much less when faced with the onslaught of a global pandemic , " said MedFetUK , reports Newsweek .
MedFetUK added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors , nurses and other staff have done an amazing job ( as they undoubtedly will despite the circumstances ) .
let 's not forget , or forgive , the ones who sent the NHS into this battle with inadequate armor and one hand tied behind its back .
"  Earlier in March , the British Medical Association ( BMA ) declared it had been inundated with concerns regarding the lack of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) for nurses and doctors fighting the coronavirus pandemic .
Many of its members have been forced to work with " inadequate " protection , reports Newsweek .
As the coronavirus pandemic exposes shortcomings in the funding of health care and medical supplies , previously niche industries -- like medical kink -- are being cast to the foreground of the COVID-19 crisis .
One ca n't help but wonder what other industries might step into the fray .
