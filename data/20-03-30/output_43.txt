Inside the huge financial cost of the coronavirus crisis on football  The repercussions of football being placed on hold until further notice is being felt across the pyramid , including by those supposedly flush with cash in the coffers .
Some clubs face going out of business , many players fear losing their livelihoods , not to mention the support staff behind the scenes , from physios to press officers .
This is set to have a lasting impact , too -- way beyond when that first ball is finally kicked , whenever that is .
As one commentator in The Guardian noted , the League One star who might expect a new contract worth ? 5,000 a week might find he is only offered ? 2,500 .
Or the League Two player on ? 1,500 a week might find himself being paid ? 750 .
A new financial reality is looming , from the Premier League to non-League , and already there are clear signs of cut-throat cost-cutting amid the coronavirus pandemic .
Let 's start at the top , where money is so on tap that Newcastle United can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're immune , right ? Wrong .
Even they will feel the pinch .
Clubs are on a potential collision course with broadcasters , with executives told they face losing more than ? 750m in lost revenue .
That is because the likes of Sky Sports are losing millions themselves by offering their customers the chance to freeze their subscription , while advertising revenues are down .
As a result , Premier League clubs are discussing asking players to take pay deferrals .
The Daily Telegraph say that could be by as much as 50 per cent .
Given the significant salaries at that level , you would hope they can afford it .
Yet you mostly fear for those with families to feed , casual staff included .
In the Championship , we have Leeds United , on the verge of promotion to that land of riches and in talks with their players over temporarily reducing wages .
Andrea Radrizzani , the Leeds owner , said the five home games that can not currently take place at Elland Road leave them shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  In that same division , Birmingham City were revealed to have become the first club to ask players to defer 50 per cent of wages during the coronavirus pandemic .
In a sign of things to come in England , those earning more than ? 6,000 per week have been asked to accept a cut for the next four months .
Meanwhile , Forest Green Rovers have said they will use the government 's wage-support scheme to keep paying ' all their staff ' , with the League Two club currently in ' hibernation ' .
Lower down , and rather worryingly amid losses of ? 100,000 per month , National League Barnet have placed all non-playing staff on notice .
That includes head coach Darren Currie .
Income is on hold .
No games , no bums on seats , no tickets sold , nothing on television to watch .
Anyone working for a football club right now , whether a coach , a player , a steward , a ticket seller or even the tea lady , is wondering what will happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this ends , but it will not be pretty .
The next conference call between Premier League clubs is scheduled for the morning of April 3 , where the proposal over wage deferrals is likely to be discussed .
Amid all this , we have seen the best and worst of football 's big names .
On Tuesday night , it was revealed that Pep Guardiola , the Manchester City boss , had made an incredibly generous donation of ? 1m ( ? 920,000 ) to Spain 's fight against coronavirus .
That 's the good .
Mike Ashley , the Newcastle owner and Sports Direct tycoon , was accused of significantly hiking prices of home gym equipment as people try to stay fit during lockdown .
Plus , Newcastle United Supporters ' Trust ( NUST ) have lambasted their club for not suspending all season-ticket payments , with money being taken out of fans ' accounts this week .
Premier League rivals Brighton &amp; Hove Albion , for example , have offered a three-month payment holiday to ease the financial burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Newcastle newspaper , The Chronicle , quote one fan who had ? 624 come out of his account on Wednesday morning .
' Really knackered me this has during this very difficult time , ' he said .
' You would of hoped that NUFC would of been more understanding and helpful .
'  That 's the bad .
Very , very bad .
The moment that first match gets underway , there will be celebrations across the country -- we beat coronavirus , football is back , all is right with the world again .
Yet this is just the start of a financial crisis , which will be felt from top to bottom , by players , fans , all of us .
