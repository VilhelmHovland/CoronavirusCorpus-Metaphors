The speed and quantum of change being brought about by COVID-19 is causing significant shifts in demand across industry sectors ; from dramatic declines in hospitality and travel to massive increases in healthcare , distribution/logistics and select retail .
These shifts demand innovative and collaborative responses to workforce management as the frictional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furloughs , layoffs , hiring individual full time employees or contractors ) is too high for all stakeholders ; companies , governments and individuals .
One such innovation is a talent exchange .
In China , for example , companies have creatively started sharing employees , moving employees without work due to the COVID-19 outbreak from organizations like restaurants and lending them to others that have seen a spike in demand like Hema , Alibaba 's retail grocery chain that is well known for its fast grocery food delivery .
More than 3,000 new employees from over 40 companies in different sectors have joined Hema 's employee sharing plan .
The objective of a talent exchange is to :  * Redeploy select talent with comparable skills from industries facing reduced demand ( contributing organizations ) to those facing a significant increase in demand ( receiving organizations ) for a limited period of time  * Achieve this exchange while significantly minimizing the frictional cost and time associated with traditional employment transitions ( reductions in force/furloughs , application for unemployment benefits , applying for new positions , etc .

The receiving and contributing companies define the terms of the exchange ( duration , implications for pay , benefits and insurance , legal considerations , etc .
A critical success factor of a talent exchange is ensuring comparability of work and transferrability of skills to reduce the time to productivity of the talent being exchanged .
