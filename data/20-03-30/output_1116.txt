How worried should we be about coronavirus ?  It may be far more widespread than we think -- and less deadly  So are we all going to die or is it going to fizzle out ? In Naples the police drive along streets with loudhailers , warning everyone to keep indoors ; in Britain the government declines to close schools , call off sporting fixtures and persuade people out of the pub .
Something feels not quite right : either there is huge overreaction or under-reaction to Covid-19 .
Health Secretary Matt Hancock has not helped calm fears by announcing that the government has been working on a worst-case scenario of 80 per cent of the population catching the virus and 500,000 dying from it .
It is n't easy for the scientists , either .
In a fast-developing disease there is , inevitably , a shortage of up-to-date , peer-reviewed studies to give you an accurate picture .
But from what we do have so far , this is what we can tell about coronavirus Covid-19 .
Firstly , how many of its victims does it kill ? You may well have heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week .
This came from an announcement by the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) and was widely reported as evidence that the disease is more deadly than previously imagined , given that previous estimates had put the mortality rate at 1 to 2 per cent .
What the WHO was at pains to explain was that the 3 .
per cent is simply the number of deaths divided by the number of reported cases , known as the Case Fatality Rate ( CFR ) .
What it does n't do is account for the possibility that there may be many more people who have been infected with the virus who have gone unrecorded , most likely because their symptoms have been so mild that they have not sought treatment .
Two studies have tried to estimate how many infected people will go on to die from the disease .
A team at Imperial College looked at the results of coronavirus tests performed on nearly 1,000 citizens who were flown to their home countries on repatriation flights from China , and used this to estimate the extent of under-reporting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate an overall Infection Fatality Rate ( IFR ) of 0 .
per cent -- with a range of uncertainty between 0 .
per cent and 2 .
per cent .
The Institute for Disease Modeling , based in Washington state , performed the same exercise and came up with a very similar number : an IFR of 0 .
per cent ( with a range of uncertainty between ( 0 .
per cent and 4 per cent ) .
The latter study also measured a sharply rising death rate with age .
But how likely are you to catch the disease in the first place ? Is it remotely possible that 80 per cent of us will go down with it ? The best guide we have to the virus 's ability to spread is a study from the Shenzhen Centre for Disease Control and the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
It has not yet been peer-reviewed but , thanks to the importance of the subject , has been pre-published .
It looked at a total of 1,286 people who were in close contact with coronavirus sufferers in Shenzhen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 .
per cent of people who shared a room or apartment with a coronavirus sufferer went on to contract the infection themselves .
Of those who had close contact with a sufferer outside the home , 9 .
per cent went on to become infected .
There were , however , some missing results from the study .
If these people were included , and assumed not to have contracted the virus , the infection rate fell to 11 .
per cent for people who shared households with an infected person and 6 .
per cent who had close contact outside the home .
Children were found to have a slightly lower risk of picking up the infection , but not by much .
They were , however , found to have less severe symptoms than adults .
Finally , how many people in the world are really infected with Covid-19 ? The WHO produces a daily situation report on the virus .
The report for Tuesday , for example , showed that 109,577 globally have been confirmed as being infected , a rise of 3,993 on the day before .
There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , 7,375 in Italy and so on .
But for reasons given above , this is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg , as many people who have ? contracted the disease will have such minor symptoms that they have not come into contact with healthcare services .
Many might even be unaware they have the disease .
Whether we can trust the data reported by China and other countries is another matter .
But two peer-reviewed studies have attempted to quantify the size of the iceberg itself .
They did this by looking at the numbers of people who had travelled out of Hubei province by aircraft and gone on to spread the disease elsewhere .
If , for example , it takes 5,000 plane passengers to travel between Wuhan and Bangkok before a case of Covid-19 pops up in the latter city , that gives a clue to how many people in Wuhan might have the disease .
A team at the University of Austin , Texas , for example , estimated the number of people likely to have been infected with Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range between 1,590 and 57,087 ) .
On that day , the WHO put the number of recorded cases in the whole of Hubei province at just 270 .
A University of Hong Kong study produced an estimate for the number of infected people in Wuhan on 25 January at 75,815 ( range 37,304 to 130,330 ) .
On that day the WHO put the number of reported cases in the whole of China at just 1,297 .
That is what evidence we have so far : an infection that is likely to be far more widespread than officially reported figures suggest , yet neither as contagious nor as deadly as many fear .
You can decide yourself how worried you should be .
Many people who have the disease will have such minor symptoms that they are unaware that they have it .
