When times take a turn for the worse , our human inclinations can sometimes seem flawed .
Right now , for instance , Austin , Texas ' craft vodka powerhouse , Tito 's , has gone so far as to release statements reminding individuals of its use as a cocktail-enhancing alcoholic beverage -- not a cure , or sanitation practice -- that will rid the masses of coronavirus .
Since it 's become immediately clear that its beverages are being used in interesting ways , the company has announced that it , too , will be dipping its toes into the widespread production of hand sanitizer .
Tito 's recently-announced ' Hand Cleanser ' is the product of a pairing with permitted distillation services like Vodka Kings , who will be bringing the ethanol-based sanitation solution to the masses sometime in the near future .
As of right now , over 24 tons of the company 's hand sanitizer is slated to be delivered to at-risk communities , with the vast majority of the solution arriving as a free alternative to other reputable deterrents already on the market .
Each bottle will feature Tito 's traditional branding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both industrial , and governmental sanitation agencies .
