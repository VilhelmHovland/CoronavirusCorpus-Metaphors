Health reporters have 10 questions for the govt as India 's coronavirus crisis deepens  With more than 1,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in India , the health ministry accepted on Sunday that the country had entered the stage of " limited transmission " of the virus .
However , this admission was not made in a press briefing -- it was slipped into a document innocuously .
This is in keeping with the government 's lack of transparency over critical questions related to India 's Covid-19 strategy .
Basic information has been shrouded in secrecy -- for instance , the list of privately-manufactured diagnostic kits that have been granted licenses for sale has not been made public .
Here are ten questions prepared by a group of health journalists that the government must respond to :  Testing  1 .
Most countries have made testing available for free .
Why has the Indian government created a two-tier system by allowing private labs to charge for it ? How did it arrive at a cost of Rs 4,500 per test ( US$60 ) which is among the highest in the world ? What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to testing , no matter which state they live in and whether they can afford to pay for the test ?  2 .
Why has the Drug Controller not released the list of Covid-19 testing kits that have been granted import and manufacturing licences ? How many of the licenses are based on validation in India and how many on foreign regulatory approvals ? What is the breakup between the RT-PCR kits and rapid antibody kits ? Will rapid antibody kits be allowed for use in diagnostics for Covid-19 or will their use be limited to the community-level serological surveys announced by the ICMR ?  Safety gear  3 .
With hospitals reporting shortages of personal protection equipment for health workers , why has the central government designated one institute as the sole testing centre for such equipment ? In the current lockdown conditions , manufacturers say the centralisation is adding to delays .
Why is the central government insisting on the " taped seam " requirement for coveralls when WHO guidelines do not mandate it ? Most manufacturers in India say they will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work  5 .
Apart from the serological surveys announced by ICMR , what are the other steps that the government is taking to map the scale of the Covid-19 outbreak in the community ? Have states started community surveillance for influenza-like illnesses and how will such surveillance take place if public health centres and outpatient departments in hospitals do not function ?  6 .
Currently , all those who have tested for Covid-19 are being admitted to hospitals .
In case of a likely increase in the numbers of people infected , what is the plan for isolating those who are mildly sick ? Will they be asked to stay at home or does the government have plans to create decentralised isolation facilities at the community or village level ? If so , what are the plans ?  Healthcare access  7 .
Why have outpatients services been stopped and how will patients access healthcare and medicines during the lockdown ? Has the health ministry issued guidance to ensure there is a functioning level of primary healthcare in every district ? What arrangements have been made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , HIV that require continuous support are not deprived of critical care ? Recognising that these persons are particularly vulnerable in event of Covid-19 infection due to lower immunity , what steps has the government taken to ensure uninterrupted care ?  8 .
Some states have suspended their immunisation outreach programmes and Village Health and Nutrition Day services .
Are such closures limited to the 21-day lockdown or will they be extended for longer periods ? Does the government have alternative plans to avoid disruption of vital programmes like immunisation ?  Health insurance  9 .
The government has announced Rs 50 lakh cover for health workers involved in the fight against Covid-19 .
Officials have said the 50 lakh cover is for accidental loss of life .
Is this accident insurance or life insurance then ? What happens if a health worker needs medical treatment ? The finance ministry has said the cover is for three months .
What happens if the pandemic extends beyond three months ?  10 .
How many health workers will be covered under this scheme ? Who is eligible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subset , and if so , how is that defined ? What is the size of sum insured and premium that the government will be paying for this ? .
