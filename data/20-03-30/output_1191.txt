Had an ambulance out for him as well .
Apparently he was taking a lot of ibuprofen for tooth-ache , and that made it worse , which sort of corroborates what was said about a week ago .
Thankfully he 's been off sick for about 3 weeks now , and it 's been longer that since I last saw him , so hopefully i 'd have shown symptoms by now , but my heart did sink a bit when I found out this morning .
Apparently he 's over the worst of it so should be ok .
he better be , then we can put him in a centrifuge to strain out any anti-bodies he has .
I 'm more surprised that they did n't do it earlier , considering that Orban has a lot of support .
Feels like he could just say " from today I 'm the Emperor of Hungary " and both the parliament and the people would be cool with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps that are being mentioned more and more often ?  An app on your phone collects data from bluetooth and GPS on where you 've been , and who else was there .
Then , if you get covid , it can ping everyone you 've been near .
PRO : Probably the only way to let us out of the house in the coming two-three years CON : invasion of privacy ahoy  I 'm personally warming to the idea as long as it 's open source ( so that all the geeks can look at the code ) anonymised as good as can be open data ( because that shit will leak anyway ) an app you install yourself and delete yourself ( not some sytem level shit )  Malek86 wrote : I 'm more surprised that they did n't do it earlier , considering that Orban has a lot of support .

I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is one of the benefits of the EU .
They will get kicked out and lose free trade ( or at least , that 's the theory ) .
Around 2,500 people are reported to have signed up to join a possible Europe-wide class action lawsuit against the authorities in Tyrol in Austria over their handling of outbreaks of coronavirus at ski resorts .
In Italy , 4050 new cases and 812 new deaths .
That 's a massive drop in new cases , though it should be mentioned that less tests were done yesterday .
In fact , the percentage of infected people on number of tests is still the same .
People are still dying in droves .
Lots of recoveries too .
As for the UK : I still say they are benefitting from " second-hand lockdown " .

@richardiox because pretty much every other country has n't allowed people to leave for two weeks now , that means the virus in the UK can not come from the outside anymore - so the spread should be slower .
In other words , they are reaping the benefits of other countries locking down before them .

Really strange virus .
It 's a head scratcher .
Healthy young people can perish .
70 year olds can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I do n't know if this is known for certain .
Get the impression they still do n't fully known the symptoms or the incubation period .
Or how long people are contagious for .
Ca n't wait to get some scientific wisdom on what 's actually going on in the months to come .
Have to keep reminding myself it 's still less than 4 months old in terms of human transmission .
