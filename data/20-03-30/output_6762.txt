Collective Grief  The Author of Barn 8 Talks to Maris Kreizman  On this episode of Sheltering , Maris Kreizman talks to Deb Olin Unferth about her novel Barn 8 , released on March 3 .
Barn 8 , an experimental novel about the US egg industry told from the point of view of a chicken , tells the story of two inspectors going rogue and releasing a farm 's worth of animals , roughly a million chickens .
It takes on the ( timely ! ) ethics of sequestering living beings and rejecting capitalism .

It would be a kind of voluntary withdrawal from different areas .
It 's an idea that 's grown a little more , but what happens in the book is that , one character realizes it just is not going to happen and only will if there are areas so badly contaminated that humans ca n't live there .
Then those will be the only areas that human 's wo n't live , and it 'll be an opportunity for other species to go in and take back that area from humans .
