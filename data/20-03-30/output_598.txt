The hospital officially opened the site on Thursday and tested a total of 12 patients while another 10 were turned away , according to Linda Drummond , Director of Public Relations for Oakbend Medical Group .
Drummond said people were turned away because the hospital is only testing patients who have been approved for testing by a doctor through a telehealth visit , and those ten showed up at the site unannounced .
Unlike other Houston-area sites that offer free tests , the Oakbend hospital 's tests run $140 ; this includes a $40 charge for the telehealth visit and $100 charge for the actual test , according to Drummond .
Not all patients who are approved for testing will have to pay the nearly $140 price tag , as some insurance companies are covering the cost of the test .
