The coronavirus has taken the lives of two elderly musicians in Paris : Manu Dibango , a Cameroonian saxophone and vibraphone superstar , and Aurlus Mabele , the king of Congolese soukous music .
AILSA CHANG , HOST :  While Africa has had relatively few deaths from the coronavirus , the continent has lost two legendary musicians to the disease .
Both of them defined their genres , and both died of COVID-19 in Paris .
NPR 's Eyder Peralta has this remembrance .
( SOUNDBITE OF SONG , " LISTE ROUGE " )  AURLUS MABELE : ( Singing in non-English language ) .
EYDER PERALTA , BYLINE : Aurlus Mabele 's music was defined by that fast beat and those arpeggio guitar licks that are full of urgency .
Almost all his songs had long instrumentals .
They let him dance , and Mabele let loose .
Mabele defined the Congolese soukous .
The name is inspired by the French word for shake , so Mabele shook , sensually sometimes , carelessly others .
( SOUNDBITE OF SONG , " LISTE ROUGE " )  MABELE : ( Singing in non-English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He packed New York City clubs in the ' 90s .
The other great that Africa lost today was the Cameroonian Manu Dibango .
His influence came much earlier in the ' 70s .
George Collinet hosts the radio show " Afropop " on PRX .
PERALTA : Dibango 's early work was influenced by American jazz greats like Louis Armstrong .
( SOUNDBITE OF MANU DIBANGO SONG , " SOUL MAKOSSA " )  PERALTA : But the saxophonist came to have a profound influence on American dance music .
Collinet was in a studio in Paris when Dibango recorded the phrase that changed everything .
( SOUNDBITE OF SONG , " SOUL MAKOSSA " )  MANU DIBANGO : ( Playing saxophone ) .
( Singing ) Hey , soul makossa .
PERALTA : That song was played everywhere .
People danced it on " Soul Train , " and Michael Jackson stole it on " Wan na Be Startin ' Somethin ' .
"  COLLINET : Everybody was copying that mamago mamasa mama makossa ( ph ) .
He was suing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Over the course of his career , Dibango put out dozens of records .
He was genre agnostic - played reggae and New Orleans jazz .
He played with anyone who would play with him .
But his roots were always in Africa - in those beats , in those grooves .
( SOUNDBITE OF MANU DIBANGO 'S " WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD " )  COLLINET : The thing , is in , Africa music is dance , no matter how you look at it .
PERALTA : In the end , these two West African musicians not only helped define genres but , more importantly , they transcended borders and languages to make people dance .
