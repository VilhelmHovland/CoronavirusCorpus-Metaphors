Carluccio 's , a restaurant chain that served Italian fare in the U .
for the best part of three decades , said Monday that it had gone into administration , a form of bankruptcy , less than two weeks after the government shut down all restaurants in the face of the pandemic .
The collapse of Carluccio 's , which began life in central London in 1991 and expanded to 71 restaurants across the U .
, puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the last , with many others likely to face the prospect of bankruptcy if restaurants remain shuttered for months .
Cheap government loans are unlikely to be enough for firms that were already laden with debts or were in financial trouble .
The coming months will see the survival of only the fittest .
Carluccio 's directors made the decision to call in administrators " after a sustained period of challenging trading conditions , which have been exacerbated by COVID-19 and the broader issues currently facing the U .
's retail and hospitality sector " .
Geoff Rowley , joint administrator and partner at advisory firm FRP , which has taken over Carluccio 's , said " we are urgently focused on the options available to preserve the future of the business and protect its employees .
"  He welcomed the recently-announced coronavirus job retention scheme , which could see the government pay 80% of workers still on the payroll .
There are worries other long-standing chains could face a similar fate .
Burger chain Byron has appointed advisers to assess its future .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street are being felt far and wide , particularly among landlords .
As well as the closure of all pubs and restaurants , the government ordered all non-essential retailers to shut down .
Retail property group Hammerson , for example , said it has only been paid 37% of the rent that it billed in the second quarter of the year after the deadline to pay passed last week .
" We have received a variety of requests for rent deferrals , monthly payments and waivers , which we are reviewing on a case-by-case basis , " it said in a statement .
Professor John Colley of Warwick Business School said many businesses simply do not have enough cash or credit lines to survive the coming months .
Colley said that after the epidemic there will be far fewer businesses competing as a consequence of the virus-related lockdown .
" This is Darwinist survival of the fittest compressed into six months , " he said .
" Business will not be the same again .
