In a statement released by the spokesperson of the party , Kola Ologbondiyan , the PDP said its demand is predicated on public apprehensions of health safety issues in the Villa following reports that President Buhari 's Chief of Staff , Mallam Abba Kyari , had tested positive to the deadly coronavirus disease .
" The PDP notes that though President Buhari was reported to have tested negative to the virus , it is yet imperative that he douses public tension by addressing a distressed nation on the status of the Villa , especially given that other officials , like Abba Kyari , had travelled to high-risk countries in the course of their duties , " the statement read .
