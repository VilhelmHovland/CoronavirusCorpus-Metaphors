CGH 's unsung heroes unfazed by Covid-19  The Covid-19 outbreak has tested the resolve of Singaporeans , not least healthcare workers and hospital staff on the front line of the fight against the virus .
Recognising the sacrifices and contributions they have made , National Development Minister Lawrence Wong , co-chair of the Covid-19 multi-ministry task force , paid tribute to them in his speech to Parliament last Wednesday .
At Changi General Hospital ( CGH ) , two of these unsung heroes - a housekeeper and a laboratory scientist - are among those who have worked tirelessly over the past two months to ensure the hospital provides the best service to its patients .
The 24-year-old , who came from Myanmar to work here , told The New Paper she has to be more thorough in her cleaning now .
On top of cleaning the ward twice daily , she conducts extensive disinfection of isolation rooms after each patient is discharged .
Ms Mon is extra cautious in changing bed linen and emptying trash bins in the ward , as these may contain biohazardous waste .
