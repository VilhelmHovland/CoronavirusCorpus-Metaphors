OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is taking a measure of satisfaction from early indications that Canada 's COVID-19 caseload is not on the same trajectory as that in the United States .
While the impact of Canada 's latest efforts to curb the spread wo n't be clear for another week or two , Trudeau says he 's proud that Canadians appear to be taking seriously the need to stay home and keep their distance from others .
South of the border , a slow federal response , delays in testing and a shortage of equipment have conspired to make the U .
the current epicentre of the outbreak , with nearly 150,000 cases and 2,500 deaths .
President Donald Trump often claims that things would have been far worse in the U .
had he not slammed the door back in January on travellers from China , where the pandemic originated .
Trudeau , meanwhile , says he has no regrets about the time it took the federal government to impose stringent restrictions on international travel , which did n't happen until mid-March .
