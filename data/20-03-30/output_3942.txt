The BBI taskforce report is unlikely to be implemented this year as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to bring the economy on its knees .
There is every signal that a referendum can not be held .
Taskforce chairman Yusuf Haji told the Star yesterday the implementation of the final report is clouded in uncertainty over the spread of coronavirus .
Haji said his 14-member team has taken a break as the secretariat and the team of co-opted experts assemble the final report .
" Ours was to produce a report and present it to the appointing authority within the specified time .
I do not know if the outbreak of the coronavirus will delay the implementation of the end product .
We will present the report with ways on how to implement it , " he said .
He said the entire country participated in the validation of the report which was unveiled last November at Bomas of Kenya by President Uhuru Kenyatta .
However , the team is still receiving views from Kenyans online .
" Last week governors , among other Rift Valley leaders , brought their views to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Kenyans still have a window of opportunity to send in their views until the end of this month , " Haji , who is also the Garissa senator , said .
In January , Uhuru extended the mandate of the task force to June .
The 14-member team is supposed to propose statutory or constitutional changes necessary for the implementation of the final BBI report .
Were it not for the outbreak of Covid-19 , which has shifted the attention of the jubilee administration to the drawing board on how to deal with the highly infectious disease , the task force could have present to final report to the President by May .
Multiple sources have told the Star that experts who have been drafting questions to be put to the members of the public during a national referendum were on Monday told to suspend their sittings until further notice .
" The state was concerned that it is insensitive for us to continue with the process when Kenyans are crying over the matter of Covid-19 .
We do not know the fate of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of God , " one of them who sought anonymity for fear of victimisation as the group is not allowed to speak to the media , said .
The team , which is parallel to the BBI team , has been meeting weekly at a private office in a Nairobi hotel .
Opposition parties -- ODM and Wiper Democratic Movement -- have both insisted that the recommendations of the Haji team should be effected through a referendum which must be planned and budgeted for in the next three months .
ODM 's James Orengo ( Senate Minority leader ) is the face of those pushing for the plebiscite .
According to Orengo , the National Treasury can present to Parliament a supplementary budget to fund a referendum .
Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka says the country can go for a referendum by September and any date beyond that would be difficult as the country will also be preparing for the 2022 general election .
With medical experts warn that Covid-19 is unlikely to be contained soon .
They say the disease may result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already sickly economy .
And with the country sagging under a Sh6 trillion debt , President Kenyatta is likely to shelve the BBI report .
" This country can not afford a referendum .
Its outbreak has far-reaching effects not just on our economy but that of the rest of the world .
So , anyone thinking of a referendum either this year or next year is not in touch with reality , " Kikuyu MP Kimani Ichung'wa told the Star .
The chairman of the National Assembly Budget Committee added : " Right now , what we should be talking about is how to cushion Kenyans and ways of creating an economic stimulus package that can resuscitate the businesses .
But in Kenya , you ca n't miss some elements who would still want to push such selfish interest despite the bad state of affairs .
"  President Kenyatta last Wednesday promised sweeping economic interventions to save the economy in the face of Covid-19 .
Belgut MP Nelson Koech , who is opposed to the referendum , said the President should " now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the economy afloat and secure jobs that are now at risk " .
" This pandemic is taking us into an unknown future .
Parliament is not in session and the budget-making process is likely to be delayed .
" Now tell me , who is this right-thinking man planning a referendum behind the scenes ? Not even donors will fund it .
The referendum can not be a priority in this country any time soon , " he told the Star by phone .
