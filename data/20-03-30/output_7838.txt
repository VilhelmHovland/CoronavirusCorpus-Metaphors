Back in February , a Siena College poll showed that only 44 percent of New Yorkers viewed their Gov .
Andrew Cuomo ( D ) favorably .
Then , the coronavirus pandemic hit .
Cuomo has received widespread praise for his calm , cool , and collected approach as he guides the country 's epicenter through the COVID-19 outbreak , and his constituents are on the bandwagon , as well .
In March , Cuomo 's favorability rating spiked to 71 percent , which is the highest it 's been since he was first elected governor in 2011 .
Cuomo 's numbers are even better when it just boils down to his coronavirus response , which has garnered an 87 percent satisfaction rate .
The spike makes sense -- as former Vice President Joe Biden noted Sunday , Americans historically tend to rally around presidents during times of crisis , and there 's no reason to think that would n't be the same for governors .
Siena College surveyed 566 registered New York voters between March 22 and 26 .
The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 .
