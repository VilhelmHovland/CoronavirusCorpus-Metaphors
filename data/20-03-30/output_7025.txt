President Muhammadu Buhari has signed the Covid-19 Regulations 2020 to declare Covid-19 as a " dangerous infectious disease " .
In a statement by his media office , Buhari was said to have signed the regulations " in exercise of the powers conferred on him by Sections 2 , 3 and 4 of the Quarantine Act ( CAP Q2 LFN 2004 ) , and all other powers enabling him in that behalf " .
Femi Adesina , his spokesman , said the regulations , effective March 30 , 2020 , " also gave legal backing to the various measures outlined in the President 's National Broadcast on March 29 , 2020 , such as Restriction/Cessation of Movement in Lagos , FCT and Ogun State and others toward containing the spread of the pandemic in the country " .
There had been criticisms of Buhari 's decision to restrict movement in those areas because , according to some lawyers , there was no legal backing .
