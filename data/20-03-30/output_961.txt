The ache of long-distance coronavirus grandparenting brings us back to the power of prayer : Tom Chmura  NAPLES , Florida -- My coronavirus story begins with a confession : I am not currently an Ohio resident .
My wife , Sharon , and I did spend our first 45 years of marriage in Medina County with our family close by .
We now live in Naples , Florida , and I read about this amazing opportunity to share our story through my daily use of the cleveland .
app on my iPhone .
My story is about family .
For the last four years , it has been difficult being separated from our Ohio family .
Now , that separation , in the context of the universal COVID-19 pandemic , is much more difficult in several ways .
It is much more difficult as a father and grandfather .
I am keenly aware how powerless I am to protect my beloved family of two children and seven grandchildren .
Well , there is one thing I can do that has power -- prayer .
So I find myself praying more than before ; and in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself who connects me with my family .
I am comforted by Michelle Butler 's poem , " A Wing and a Prayer , " and other prayers on praywithme .
My separation is much more difficult as a husband .
I watch my darling wife long to be with her loved ones .
Her mother 's heart throbs with unfulfilled desire to embrace her children and grandchildren in loving hugs .
Thank God for social media !  Finally , this separation is much more difficult as a husband and wife because our planned trip to be with our loving family in May may have to be postponed , at best , and canceled at worst .
I know these difficulties are universal , and I believe I am speaking to hurting hearts .
So , please know this -- this pandemic will end , and I hope it ends with you and your family still being complete and united in love .
Until then , please remember you have someone praying for you 1,200 miles away .
I hope to meet you one day and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ago , Tom Chmura , born and raised in Cleveland , had lived all his life in the state of Ohio .
He is now semi-retired and , with wife Sharon , makes his home in Naples , Florida .
