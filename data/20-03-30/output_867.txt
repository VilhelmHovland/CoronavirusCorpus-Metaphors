With more time at home in this era of social distancing and self-isolation , we 've got a lot more time for reading , right ? It 's hardly so simple .
In this new EW series , staffers discuss how they 're coping with experiences of anxiety and isolation through books .
In this entry , Seija Rankin describes how a story about a society-ending flu pandemic ( of all things ) inspired her to panic-read .
Guys , I read a lot .
Partly because I like to , partly because my job here at EW requires it of me .
And , typically , it 's a very comfortable arrangement : The books I love are a joy to comb through ; the truly unreadable stuff , well , we can talk about that later .
But life in quarantine , with the horrors of COVID-19 circling me at every turn ( the empty streets outside my window , the sight of a solitary elderly neighbor reaching for the last package of toilet paper , the dispatches from the front lines that live in my phone and find a way to force themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even when I 've promised myself I will put it away and go to sleep ) , has not proven to be as conducive to curling up with a good read as all those sunny Instagram posts would have us believe .
Two weeks ago , on a flight from New York to L .
-- my last for the foreseeable future , of course -- I was enjoying the breezy characters of J .
Courtney Sullivan 's Friends &amp; Strangers , an upcoming summer title about a ( fictional ) journalist and new mother who decamps from Brooklyn to something a little more upstate than your usual upstate ( read : several counties north of Westchester ) and has trouble fitting in with her new neighbors .
At the risk of marking myself , this is my literary bread-and-butter : New Yorkers , aspiration , scandal , snark .
But once we were wheels-down at LAX , and discovered that in fact the ( slightly surreal ) lockdown procedures and ( very real ) constant anxiety had in fact followed me across the country , I lost my mojo .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain to get back on track .
I returned to Friends &amp; Strangers , fruitlessly , over and over .
Devoid of my usual stack of pending releases to plow through ( many copies are back at the office ; most spring titles are under threat of date changes ) , I cracked open Absurdistan by Gary Shteyngart , a backlist title I 've had my eye on since I found it on the shelves of Bart 's Books in Ojai ( bless you , Bart 's Books ) , and read the same page at least four times over before giving up .
I turned to Amy Chozick 's Chasing Hillary in the hopes of harnessing ( clinging to ? ) the swell of emotions I experienced while binging Hulu 's Hillary docuseries , but her campaign trail tales were no match for my wandering brain , or the Instagram stories that I could n't stop refreshing after every paragraph .
The solution , it turns out , was to lean into the pandemic panic .

John Mandel 's best-selling Station Eleven had been taunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 ( I never read it at the time ) , but her newest novel , The Glass Hotel , is my favorite book of the year so far .
Eleven 's premise , in short : a new strain of the flu wipes out 99 percent of the world 's population .
It 's clear why some readers would proceed with caution during These Times and I can confirm that living inside this book lends an eerie quality to the real world , but I read all 352 pages in a day and a half and that was nothing short of a miracle .
Station Eleven follows several character and timelines , starting with a patient zero of sorts -- Arthur Leander , a famous actor , who collapses onstage during a Toronto production of King Lear , dying of what onlookers believe is a heart attack but is revealed ( to readers at least ) to be the Georgia Flu , newly arrived on this continent .
By the end of that night , the city 's hospitals are overrun with victims -- the incubation period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of days the entire world is brought to its knees .
Airports close , businesses close , the roads are so gridlocked that people take off on foot ( a fruitless route to nowhere ) , news networks slowly go dark , electricity grids falter , the internet ceases to exist .
Are you hooked yet ?  Twenty years into the future , civilization has dwindled to consist of disparate camps of survivors spread across the country -- survivors not only of the Georgia Flu , but of the lawless anarchy that broke out in its aftermath .
A group of former actors and musicians have formed a traveling theater troupe , taking a caravan from camp to camp , performing Shakespeare for the ones who are left .
As the plot weaves back and forth between the final days of the Old World and the bleak , occasionally hopeful days of the New World , the characters ' connections reveal themselves to a stunning degree -- this novel , while highly suspenseful , does n't use the apocalypse for shock value .
It feels crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of having been quarantined for nearly two weeks ) but it had me legitimately pondering the meaning of life .
If COVID-19 nearly wiped us out completely , what would you want the remaining citizens to remember ( and , more importantly , preserve ) about society ? The Japanese have a concept known as Ikigai , loosely translated as reason for being -- the idea is to find the intersection of what you love , what the world needs , what you 're good at and , hopefully , what you can be paid for .
I 've been thinking a lot about that .
I 've also been thinking about how much trust I 've put in Apple to keep my earthly memories intact .
If you 're prone to existential wonderings , Station Eleven will give you more than enough fodder for the five-dozen or so meals you 'll be taking with your quarantine companions before this thing is over .
If you 've been feeling like it could n't possibly get worse than this , the novel will remind you that , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
