' Revolting ' : Harris slams people for coughing in public 's faces  We all need to work together to combat the spread of Covid-19 .
Communities are supporting one another in the sweetest ways .
Some are volunteering , others are baking treats for friends and many are calling into elderly neighbours to show they 're not alone .
However , despite the majority of people doing good deeds , there are still some people letting the country down .
There are careless people who are continuing to gather in large groups , many having house parties and groups who think it is funny to cough in people 's faces to scare them .
Covid-19 is no joke and we need to make sure that these teenagers stop their cruel pranks .
The ' Corona challenge ' is nothing but a pathetic game that needs to stop .
Coughing in people 's faces is simply revolting , and the last thing we need to deal with during these horrifying times .
People are stressed enough without dealing with ridiculous jokes like this .
Harris stated : " There are people bizarrely deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to me yesterday as I was walking from here to my department when a man and woman on the street thought it was hilariously funny to come up and cough at me and then run off laughing .
" Can we please as people just look at what 's happening in Italy , in the European Union , where we are seeing 700 people a day dying from a virus that can be deadly to some people in our population .
" And when you think , I think particularly of older people who are being targeted in relation to this , and there seems to be some sort of social media kind of game ? But it 's not a game it 's disgusting .
"  " Putting on that you would target people in your community , particularly older people and go up , cough in their face , video it and have a laugh and run off .
" Just think if it was your own granny , granddad , mother or father , or your own friend with an underlying health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together to stop the spread of this virus .
The last thing the country needs is selfish people causing public distress .
