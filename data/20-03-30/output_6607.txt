JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tested negative for the coronavirus on Monday after a parliamentary aide was confirmed to be carrying the virus , though the 70-year-old leader would remain in isolation , a spokesman said .
Spokesman Ofir Gendelman said on Twitter that Netanyahu , his family and staff all tested negative , but " he will remain quarantined until further instructions are issued by the Ministry of Health " .
Israel 's Health Ministry regulations generally require 14-day self-isolation for anyone deemed to have been in proximity to a carrier , with the duration reduced for the number of days that have passed since the suspected exposure .
Israeli media said the infected aide had been present at a parliament session last week attended by Netanyahu as well as opposition lawmakers with whom he is trying to build an emergency coalition government to help address the coronavirus crisis .
Israel has reported 4,695 cases and 16 fatalities .
An Israeli official said Netanyahu has been following medical advice and holding most meetings by video-conference .
