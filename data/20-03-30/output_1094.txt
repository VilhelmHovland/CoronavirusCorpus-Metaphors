Govt expert : not heeding medical advice on virus could lead to ' tens of thousands ' Scottish deaths  HEEDING the medical advice to stay at home and keep a social distance from others could be the difference between Scotland 's death toll being around 2,000 from the coronavirus outbreak or " tens of thousands , " a Government expert has warned .
Professor Jason Leitch , the National Clinical Director , spoke out after Nicola Sturgeon said pubs that stayed open during the Covid-19 outbreak were putting lives at risk .
The First Minister stressed that , while the " vast majority " of bars , restaurants and cafes had complied with instructions from the Scottish Government to close , she had seen suggestions on social media that a " small minority might not be complying " .
She insisted : " If that 's true , make no mistake .
lives are at risk as a result .
Please do the right thing now .
"  As she spoke out , Prof Leitch declared : " We really are n't messing around with this now .
To protect individuals and society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing and isolation choices .
"  The medical expert told the Sunday Mail : " The Chief Scientific Adviser in England has said he thinks 20,000 deaths across the UK would be a good outcome .
" In Scotland , that would be about 2,000 but the worst-case scenario is much worse than that .
People need to take the advice they 're being given very seriously , " he insisted .
Heeding advice not to go out unless necessary and to stay away from others could be " the difference between tens of thousands of deaths and the number of around 2,000 " , he added .
Prof Leitch stressed : " We 've told the symptomatic and very vulnerable to stay at home .
Then we told some other groups - those with diseases , those over 70 and those who are pregnant - to take very seriously the calls to reduce social contact .
" For everyone else , they must socially distance themselves as much as possible ; that means no pubs , no clubs , no birthday parties , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible thing and none of us have done it lightly but it 's to protect the people that will get this virus because it 's a proper disease , " he added .
There have so far been seven deaths in Scotland and , with another seven recorded in Wales today , the UK death toll is now 240 .
