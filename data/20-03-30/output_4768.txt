Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard  This vulnerable , funny and often uplifting show is delivered by an unlikely duo .
While actor Dax Shepard is best known professionally as the stereotypical rom-com jerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archetype .
Shepard talks candidly about his own battles with drug and alcohol addiction , his marriage to Kristen Bell and fatherhood all the while interviewing a diverse range of guests .

Sibling Revelry with Kate and Oliver Hudson  Camera IconKate Hudson .
These A-lister siblings are no strangers to difficult family dynamics .
Their parents Goldie Hawn and Bill Hudson 's relationship breakdown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- with their musician father has been plastered across the tabloids .
And despite many thinking they know the effervescent Kate Hudson from her blockbuster roles such as Almost Famous and How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days , the actress shows a different side in her closeness with her brother .
Oliver , also an actor on TV shows like Rules of Engagement , Nashville and Dawson 's Creek , displays a vulnerability and self-awareness on this podcast that is refreshing from a male voice in Hollywood .

Credit : **26;690;TOOLONG  Supermodel and body positivity activist Ashley Graham had Kim Kardashian as her first podcast guest .
That 's one hell of a big name to trial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Deal has only gone from strength to strength , with Graham 's second season of the show transitioning to weekly episodes and offering even more big name gets .
What Graham has tapped into , to make this podcast stand out from a flooded listening arena , is her ability to go there -- and her famous speed-dial list .
She has the conversations many think are off limits , and asks the questions many journalists would n't be allowed to .
Graham is known for refusing to have her photos retouched and advocating for " radical inclusivity " and Pretty Big Deal does n't shy away from these concepts either .
And if you want to seethe podcast , and not just listen , Graham films her recordings for her YouTube channel .
The only qualification to be a guest of Graham 's is that you be a Pretty Big Deal , so it 's only natural that the likes of Demi Lovato , Sophia Bush , Meghan Trainor , Shay Mitchell , Rosie Huntington-Whiteley , Emily Ratajkowski and Serena Williams have sat before Graham 's microphone .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mia Freedman is more a high-profile media maker than a celebrity , it would be remiss to leave her long-time love No Filter off the list .
This podcast has gained traction across the nation as a home for in-depth conversations with the names we grew up with , and the faces we see around Australia every day .
Freedman was one of the first to tap into the podcasting phenomenon in Australia , having built her Mamamia Podcast Network partly from the resounding success of No Filter .
Freedman brings a touch of Australiana in not just her guest list , but her enviable knowledge of local pop culture .
With more than 300,000 listeners each week Freedman has had " candid conversations that count " with everyone from WA talents Megan Gale , Julie Bishop and Tim Minchin , to Aussie legends Olivia Newton-John , Leigh Sales , Libby Trickett and Richard Roxburgh .
Oprah 's SuperSoul Conversations  Camera IconOprah and Bradley Cooper .

Winfrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2011 and made it purely an audio format .
The iconic talk show host proves her name still speaks volumes by snagging some of the biggest guests during their most pivotal public moments .
Winfrey mixes studio interviews with live audience recordings in front of sometimes thousand-strong audiences to bring atmosphere and show-stopping entertainment to at-home listeners .
Michelle Obama spoke about being an empty-nester post the White House , Amy Schumer opened up about IVF just days after announcing her procedures , and perhaps most notably , Winfrey 's podcast is where Lady Gaga shared her experience of being raped .
Hatjam with Kav Temperley  Rather than dabbling in interviews with actors , actresses , directors and the likes , Eskimo Joe frontman Kav Temperley hones in on the more musically inclined in his latest endeavour .
It makes sense for the ARIA Award-winning singer to explore something so close to his own heart , but this podcast series is less of a serious matter , with a fun and experimental tone coming across for listeners .
And while Temperley is a veteran behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first episode airing in January .
The reviews are already showing five shining stars .
Under the Skin with Russell Brand  If you have ever read one of Brand 's candid novels or watched a TV interview he has given , you 'd know that the Brit 's outlandish persona is like no other .
Brand 's conversations with academics , artists and celebrity peers follow the narrative of most therapy sessions , using his almost startling emotional vulnerability to connect with guests to dig beneath their surface , touching on topics of trauma , philosophy and insecurity .
There is a slight catch -- this podcast is now only available on Luminary , a subscription-based podcast service that hides some pretty wonderful gems behind its paywall .
Older eps are still available on regular podcast apps though .
Anna Faris is Unqualified  This is a quirky , refreshing little treat from the mind of actress Anna Faris .
She gives relationship advice with the candid disclosure that she has no idea what she is doing .
Faris was once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the most stable Hollywood relationships .
The actress has labelled her latest audio-based endeavour a " mission to create a community where those of us who have no idea what the f .
we 're doing can find comfort , support and laughter " .
And Faris ' episodic line-up is as diverse and quirky as her filmography , with everyone from Josh Gad to the once controversial couple Sam and Aaron Taylor Johnson .
The C-Word with Lena Dunham  This podcast is historically rich , surprisingly heartbreaking and altogether inspiring for the everyday woman and her allies .
And while the cheeky title might allude to something more profane , The C-Word is in reference to " crazy " , and this podcast looks at why women are often called that .
Lena Dunham , the brains behind hit TV series Girls , sits down with Alissa Bennett to take you on an hour-long journey with another woman , who is n't present in the room .
That third woman is a strong female from a point in history , and Dunham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and society during that time .
Two seasons in and the feminist duo have profiled the personas of Judy Garland , Barbara Hutton and Mariah Carey .
This podcast is also available on Luminary .
Call Chelsea Peretti  She 's arguably the best part of the cult TV series Brooklyn Nine-Nine , and Chelsea Peretti 's podcast is just an extension of her beloved comedic persona .
If any of the former recommendations do n't sound like your style , or you are n't looking for an interview-style show , then look no further than this undervalued audio gem .
Her hour-long episodes are a soothing balm during trying times , and are the perfect way to tune out from some of the heavier conversation that seems to be dominating our everyday .
Peretti essentially talks about anything and everything , and it almost feels like you are on a phone call with a hilarious friend who is going off on strange tangents , eating chips , drinking coffee and you ca n't interject .
