Tasmania 's childcare sector is on the brink of collapse due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
Discovery Early Learning Centres chief executive Jo Walsh said the situation was " dire " as attendance at childcare centres had plummeted .
" Parents are staying at home and keeping their children at home with them , " Ms Walsh said .
" We are trying to maintain enrolments but putting food on the table is understandably more important than childcare costs .
" Ms Walsh , who runs 21 services across Tasmania employing 380 staff , said casual workers had not been employed for two weeks and other staff were being asked to take leave .
" It is a tricky sector to work in and our staff live pay to pay , " she said .
" Where we might have 60 children , today we have only 20 and where there might be 20 there are now just four .
" We have a noose around our neck - we need government support to remain viable and stay open .
" Ms Walsh said it was impossible to keep safe distancing between young children .

" The decline in children attending our centres statewide means organisations have insufficient income to pay frontline educators and staff , " Ms Cornish said .
There are more than 260 centres and 3000 staff in Tasmania , looking after more than 23,000 children and 16,000 families each year .
The government 's key message for people to stay home is one which Ms Cornish echoes .
" But the Government also wants essential workers - nurses , doctors , health care providers and police - to go to work , many of whom require early childhood education and care , " she said , " Parents are withdrawing their children from our centres in droves as we are left to grapple with how to pay wages as usage drops and overheads remain the same - with no Government assistance or direction , " she said .
" Without Government support , every day a service remains open is another day their immediate and longer-term viability is impacted .

" Tasmania 's Premier Peter Gutwein said discussions at a national level to determine how best to support childcare centres were ongoing .
He said if people still had jobs they should use childcare because centres were taking every step they could to ensure the safety of children .
Tasmania 's Labor leader Rebecca White said the federal government needed to act as a matter of urgency to support the sector .
" There must be an orderly and supported closure of childcare centres , in line with the same principles of school closures , to protect the future viability of those businesses , the need for ongoing care for some children , and the health and safety of childcare workers and the children they care for , " Ms White said .
" The approach for the childcare sector must mirror that taken for schools , where childcare would remain available for children who still require care - such as the children of essential workers .
