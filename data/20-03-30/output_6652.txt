" I , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now and our safety is definitely the most important thing , but if possible it would 've been great to be able to go back out on the track and run in front of my home crowd again .
There is a ton of talent in the class of 2020 and I hoped we all got another chance to showcase it .

As for the North Canyon junior sprinters including Jailyn Goodwin and Elle Escobar , the reigning 300 hurdles state champion transfer from Peoria Liberty , and distance runner Maggie Vortuba , they ca n't enhance their recruitment for their critical junior season during the global pandemic .

" A lot of kids who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship , now it 's going to affect them more than anything else because they were n't able to run the time that they were looking to run .
