Boris Johnson continued to carry out his parliamentary duties this week , including Prime Minister 's Questions -- despite urging the nation to ' stay at home ' in a solemn broadcast on Monday evening .
Though the Downing Street press briefings have been carried out by video link since Monday , critics say this should have happened much sooner .

' The government has been too slow to act on this , and they 've been slow as individuals .
I was surprised to see prime minister questions going ahead this week -- it was clearly unnecessary ' he said .
' It reinforces the view that lockdown measures taken earlier this week should have been taken sooner , and raises questions about the ability of people in power , including the prime minister , to discipline themselves .
They should all have been more careful ' he added .
