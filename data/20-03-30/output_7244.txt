How can the world solve the global ventilator shortage problem ? Pt 1  Hospital ventilators are complex pieces of machinery that can use several sensors to control airflow and pressure .
Existing suppliers ' monthly production is typically in the 10,000 or so range .
New production capacity will take months .
As hospital and local governments have pleaded to get more ventilators during the coronavirus pandemic , several organizations have responded quickly , especially with new design ideas .
To provide a starting point to consolidate these global efforts , a few of the more promising approaches will be presented .
A professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida and an established inventor has built a ventilator out of items consumers can buy from hardware stores and made it open source for engineers and hobbyists worldwide .
The Code Life Ventilator Challenge invites interested individuals or teams to design a simple , maintainable , easy-to-manufacture ventilator to provide life support to COVID-19 patients anywhere in the world .
The goal is to design a ventilator using widespread rapid manufacturing tools , such as 3D printers , computer numerical control ( CNC ) machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a smartphones , Arduinos or other approach .
Those interested can join the challenge by providing manufacturing support , technical expertise support or a donation to the foundation .
While scientists , engineers and healthcare professionals find ventilator design to be the more compelling aspect , many of the recent design are manufacturable by their creators and if the devices have achieved some level of verification and the designers provided sufficient details including open source software , any group of technically inclined individuals should be able to build one , two or more ventilators in a few days -- not weeks and certainly not months .
Similar to moving the blocks for the Great Pyramid in Egypt , when enough people are involved ( we have 7 .
billion ) , the almost impossible can be achieved .
More approaches to come .
