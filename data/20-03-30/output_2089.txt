Coping With COVID-19 Crisis : James Corden On Doing Primetime Relief Special Out Of His Garage &amp; What 's Next For ' The Late Late Show '  Late-night television hosts have been at the forefront of figuring out how to stay on during the global coronavirus pandemic .
The likes of Jimmy Kimmel , Jimmy Fallon , Stephen Colbert and Samantha Bee have been experimenting with online videos and working out how to take them to air .
James Corden , however , has spent his time in lockdown putting together a primetime special , albeit one filmed in his garage .
The host of CBS ' The Late Late Show is putting together HomeFest tonight at 10 PM .
Production on his daily show , which is produced by CBS Television Studios and his Fulwell 73 company , shut down two weeks ago .
Exec produced by Ben Winston and Rob Crabbe , Corden tonight will be encouraging donations to The CDC Foundation and Feed the Children .
Corden tells Deadline it was the speed of the virus and the fallout that was most surprising to him .
" One day we were planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next day we could n't do a show and then we were figuring out what can we do and what should we do .
That 's when we started doing this HomeFest show , " he says .
The special will feature live performances from the likes of Dua Lipa in London ; K-Pop band BTS , who are all quarantined together in South Korea ; as well as Andrea Bocelli singing from his house in Italy , one of the hardest-hit countries .
Corden adds , " We wanted to make a show where essentially we 'd bring lots of people together by bringing them apart .
The incredible thing about this virus is that we 're all in the same boat , it does n't discriminate .
Everyone has to stay home , so we figured , what if we could show people staying home and what if we tried to go all over the world to show people that it 's a global crisis .
"  The Brit will chat with each guest before they perform , and the show will also feature David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Will Ferrell with an instructional video on how to properly wash your hands .
The show will end with the entire casts of a Broadway show singing a song from their own homes .
" For these artists , these are probably the most intimate performances they 'll ever give , " Corden adds .
Producing the show brought its own challenges .
Corden admits it 's the " most bizarre special we 'll ever make .
"  " Technically , and from a visual sense , it 's going to be nobody 's finest hour but we hope that people will see the intention of it , " he says .
" I 'm in my garage on my own with a locked-off camera , my wife told me before I went to the garage that I should put some powder on my face , and then I walked in and turned the cameras on and we started .
We just did it .
We had our producers on two laptops on a Zoom thing .
I do n't know what it will be like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Corden admits he has n't really processed how to be entertaining or funny during the COVID-19 crisis but believes it 's important to stick together .
" I think the important thing is to say , ' This is how I 've been feeling .
' It 's important to show that all of this is out of our control so all you can do is look at what you can control , which is your proximity to other people and you can try and put your head in a positive space and think what will someone else need from me .
I know we 've taken on board this phrase of social distancing , but I do n't think we 've nailed that .
I think it 's physical distancing , socially we can be as connected as ever , physically we ca n't be together but socially and mentally we can be together .
The world has never been more equipped for us to stay connected to each other so that 's where my head has been at .
"  He acknowledged it 's a tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're anxious .
" We 're all fine but there are n't days anymore , you 're just awake or asleep .
I 'm pleased for the distraction of children for large moments of the day .
I find if I 'm reading or watching the news too much , I get overcome with anxious spikes .
"  One of the toughest things is not knowing when things will get back to normal .
" Most times when you 're reacting to something , it 's a finite moment , whether that 's a natural disaster or if you think about 9/11 .
We do n't know when we 'll be in the aftermath of this so mostly I think our job is to say , ' I feel the same as you , you 're not alone and it 's OK to have those feelings .
' It 's OK to feel sad , frightened and helpless , you 've almost got to let those feelings wash through you and figure out what can you do .
I really think it 's picking up the phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week that I have n't spoken to in a year .
I 've called old friends and thinking who is on their own , " he adds .
However , in a Western world that has been divided over the last couple of years , whether via the political divide in the U .
or the Brexit debate in Britain , Corden says it has brought people together .
" You 've been in Britain , which has been as divided as we 'd ever felt in our lifetime , and America has felt the same , but in the oddest , most unique way , this virus has unified everybody and it 's a very strange feeling .
"  Once HomeFest airs , Corden and his producers ' next challenge is working out what The Late Late Show looks like going forward .
He says , " We 're going to try and get back on the air as soon as possible but as soon as we had this idea of this special , we figured let 's try and make that and then we 'll see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because so much of our show is about interaction .
We 'll give it some thought this week and we 'll come up with something and we 'll try and figure it out .
"  Corden has regularly taken his Late Late Show to the UK over the last few summers , with CBS working with pay-TV platform Sky to produce a version filmed in London .
That looks unlikely this year , with Corden saying , " I ca n't imagine that would be able to happen .
It would take an unbelievably sharp turnaround that I ca n't see that at the moment .
"  The other disappointment for the West Ham fan is sports -- Corden had tickets to this summer 's European Championships , which have been postponed until next year .
Having just moved from London to Los Angeles less than two weeks ago myself , the cancellation of the English Premier League was a significant moment for people realizing the coronavirus was something to take seriously ( Sod 's law , as Liverpool , the team I share with Last Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning their first championship in 30 years ) .
Corden says that a similar realization was reached in the U .
when the NBA was canceled .
It 's a strange time and all eyes will be on his show this evening to offer some distraction and enjoyment .
" We 've tried to make a show that says we 're all in this together and you 're not on your own , " Corden says .
