COVID-19 : Being essential is a privilege  Being classed an essential business is a privilege -- do not abuse that privilege , says Chris Lewis , Federated Farmers national dairy spokesman .
" It is always a massive responsibility being an employer and a privilege to have people working for you but during this time there is extra responsibility , " he told Dairy News .
" This is especially around the two-metre isolation rule .
"  DairyNZ and Federated Farmers are meeting each morning including their immigration and employment teams to discuss the challenges and what can be done to support farmers .
There is a lot of work getting underway to help farmers around policies , guidelines and Q&amp;As and those sorts of things .
The Federated Farmers website is being constantly updated .
The main challenge for a dairy farmer at this time is around keeping people safe .
" For myself I employ a team of seven .
And they have family so I have to keep them all safe .
They all have self-isolation and I have to make them all safe , " Lewis told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milking and have a bit different ways of doing things .
" Everyone has got to ride their own motorbike , if they use a commonly used tractor or tool they must wear gloves .
I have hand wash sanitiser down at the cow shed , brushes to keep you clean and am encouraging guys every day to have clean clothes on , clean overalls .
" When they see contractors come on farm -- like this morning I had to have an electrician - smile and wave at them or have the conversation from afar .
" I have sent a photograph of the broken equipment or a video of the issue so before they come out they know exactly what the issue is so they can bring the right part and be efficient .
" Some of those things I have practiced for a long time before Covid-19 .
" There are lots of things we can do and at the moment , all of us , we are learning .
"  He encourages farmers to share their learning with the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into social media posts because there will be a lot smarter farmers out there than just us industry people .
We want to hear all our farmers ' great ideas , their great insights .
So please email me , message me your videos , tag me in .
We all need to be working as a massive community looking after each other .
" Not just on policies , on social communication , Facetime , messaging -- I 'd love to hear from you .
"  Initial labour shortages or workers not turning up could happen .
" But in my local community there are a lot of kids that have come home from overseas , from university or different places .
They all have no money .
So there will be a lot of people putting their hand up for jobs in the next few months .
"  Those returning from overseas will need to be in quarantine-type isolation for two weeks .
