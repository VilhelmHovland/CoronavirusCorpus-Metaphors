UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for the novel coronavirus .
With the PM having been appearing daily on live TV along with , among others , Chancellor Rishi Sunak , and the country 's chief medical officer and chief scientific advisor , you have to hope Britain 's leadership have been measuring out their Osmans .
Re : Perfect Timing  Re : Perfect Timing  I do n't understand all the downvotes on here .
Surely the Dyson contract is an outrageously corrupt and idiotic act .
Is BJ looking for a job in Singapore when he 's finished ruining the UK ? If the PM had shown leadership earlier when it was needed , and was behaving properly now instead of throwing money at cronies , then I might have more sympathy for his condition .
Commenters complaining that we 're all not being humane enough to BJ et al have not been paying attention .
Re : Perfect Timing  Only corrupt if as you suggest Johnson ( or Hancock ? ) intend to secure a pad in Singapore on the backup , only idiotic if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been locked out and/or this locks Dyson into the production process into the future shurely ?  Re : Perfect Timing  I think its perfectly safe to say its corrupt and idiotic .
These machines are of a new design and wont have gone through normal legal testing procedures if they are going to be used .
To do this when there are other manufacturers of validated machines available and waiting is a breach of procedures that at any other time would be in the courts on Monday morning .
Re : Perfect Timing  It was my understanding that there are n't existing ventilator manufacturers lined up to deliver all the NHS needs .
Vehicle manufacturers are switching over to producing what should be proven designs .
Dyson 's whole business is founded upon efficient ways to move air - they may have a new design , and it will need fast-track testing and approval , but I 'd probably put as much trust in something produced in a Dyson plant as a car plant ( even a high tech car plant ) .
Time will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and validated - just because it 's an existing design does n't mean the factory will produce it correctly ) then Dyson 's efforts will not be needed .
As a footnote , my opinion of James Dyson fell a lot when he backed Brexit and set to move his HQ out of the UK - but moving air ( both sucking and blowing ) is his fort ? .
Re : Perfect Timing  Re : Perfect Timing  Better not let my wife hear you say that .
She switched from on of their uprights to a V7 a couple years ago and would n't use any vacuum cleaner other than a Dyson ( and I 'd take my wife 's view on its performance before most others ) ,  Re : Perfect Timing  Pretty much , some pulmonologist input and general clinical sanity and it should be good .
With testing , does n't have to be full fat certification but a lot of these " open " ventilator designs ( which are open in name only ) have no published test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be tested .
Re : Perfect Timing  You might not like it but it would appear to be necessary given the circumstances .
Or do you think that now is a great time for bureaucratic shenanigans to gum up the works ? You could get up to speed on the changes to the regulations ( gov link ) but perhaps that might not help your argument .

Re : The emergency regulations .
" drones following people walking in the countryside ( presumably where there are far fewer people "  You 'd have thought , but given some people 's behaviour .
there was a report on BBC News of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " walk through his fields over the weekend , and was assaulted by a walker ( effectively ) for disinfecting the gate .
Re : The emergency regulations .
Now people should stay off busy paths even if they are public footpaths but this farmer was not assaulted for disinfecting gate handles .
His story is that 1 ) he told the walker to go home ; 2 ) the walker gave him a funny look and then 3 ) the walker punched him several times giving him bruises and shaking him up but not seriously injuring him .
Do some people give others funny looks then launch into a full physical assault ? Or did something happen between 2 &amp; 3 ? Did he give the walker a funny look back ? Did he repeat the order to go home ? Both of those would have been absolutely no provocation .
But did he threaten to get physical ? Did he throw a punch ? Did he threaten to go and get his shotgun ?  We do n't know what started the fight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really too busy at that particular moment ?  Re : The emergency regulations .
" is neutral observers watching Ministers during business at all times and reporting worrying behaviour .
"  In a constitutional republic like the USA , that obligation is expressly conferred on a free press via the Constitution .
In other western countries , less directly so , but expected in any case .
However , since the " free " press is basically the extended arm of the Democrats in the USA ( Labor , Social Democrats or whatever your version of progressivism is ) , their interest is not in enlightened reporting and analysis , but petty partisanship and outright fake news .
There are pockets of enlightened resistance in the press , but they are drowned out by the entrenched MSM .
The internet is home to a lot of well reasoned reporting , but Twitter , Google and FB seem intent on removing that as fast as possible though de-platforming .
Every country 's experience is probably similar to a greater or lesser extent .
The demise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be traced directly to the day the " News " became a profit centre in TV , is one of the least promising aspects of our future .

The USA seems worse than most , because there is little or no recourse in law against the press , so they feel neither shame nor fear .
Re : The emergency regulations .
What kind of idiot are you ? ( Sorry El Reg .
for a personal attack ) The media was sounding the alarm while our LSoT ( Lying sack of Trump ) played politics and ignored the problem , fixating on how this could be an attack on him rather than being a real crisis .

Ventilators .
I stupidly watched a clip of him announcing it .
Like it 's some kind of reality TV gameshow with him smirking and thinking that we 'd actually care .
Wrong .
Perhaps if his* government had n't lurched from yet one disaster to another , lying and bluffing and waffling from one day to the next the country would be in a slightly less serious mess than it is now .
Maybe if he had n't chosen to ignore the EU 's plan to purchase ventilators in bulk there would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they chose not to .
Subsequently his government claimed that they " did n't know about it " or " did n't get the email " .
in relation to an invite to cooperate that was publicly broadcast in the open for all to see .
It 's either gross incompetence or belligerent lies or , given the track record , almost certainly both .
Others are starting to use rather stronger words and are calling it a starting point for manslaughter charges .
I do n't know myself if that 's accurate but I understand the sentiment .
If somebody actively chooses to not do something that would help , for whatever reason , are they culpable ?  * He is the prime minister .
The buck stops with him .
He will of course lie his way out of this one , it 's his only skill in life .

Re : Ventilators .
I was paraphrasing what the book actually said , but I have to say that it would be quite wonderful if Johnson followed that trajectory .
At this moment I 'd take an averagely decent PM over a truth-averse one .
One rule for some .
So for the past weeks , we have been told that testing is confined to seriously ill people , who have been admitted to hospital , and there are no tests for the general population .
There are n't even tests for front-line NHS staff , who should get them for pragmatic reasons alone ( not infecting many others ) even if they do n't " deserve " the tests due to their roles .
Now both BigEars and BoJo have been tested after displaying " mild symptoms " .
Yes , they are important people , but " we 're all in this together " ? I think not .
Re : Ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probably find some sympathy for the worthless liar if he did .
His government chose to do nothing , and when finally shamed into doing something it was rather too late ( although not as bad as the US ) .
All this despite all the evidence from successful countries on how to slow the virus down and to prevent many needless deaths .
His actions therefore have caused more deaths than there would be have been otherwise , for this we are meant to be thankful ?  He is not stupid , and I 've never accused him of such , however he cares for absolutely nobody other than himself , they just do n't come into his mindset at all .
The reality-TV appearance like video of him spaffing on about himself having got covid-19 pretty neatly demonstrates his self-serving focus .
Re : Ok  How is it being a " heartless arsehole " to point out that if anything happened to Johnson Corbyn would not be PM , contrary to your post , because ( a ) Labour would not have the votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer the Party leader ? And you are the over-the-top exaggerating idiot who labelled Corbyn , whose politics are about as left wing as Heath 's or Macmillan 's , " Bolsonaro " !  Re : Brexit Bus .
The budget for the NHS has very definitely not gone up by ? 250million a week .
This would have been headline front page news if it did .
Many lies were told by the convervative party during the election ( why are manifesto " promises " not legally binding ? ) and have been variably repeated and repealed afterwards , but that 's very different to doing anything .
Which they have n't .
The amount pissed against the wall on brexit and " getting it done " has already exceeded all the money that we have ever contributed to the EU in our 40 years of membership .
We are still no closer to the unicorn fart of brexit with a deal , but that does n't matter to the disaster capitalists or those behind brexit who do n't want a deal and just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Re : Brexit Bus .
Here is a more measured treatment of the same topic .
Bottom line , yes , funding really has gone up by about that much .
Sadly , since the pound crashed after the referendum and has never really recovered ( until just now , indeed , but who knows how long that will last ) , all this money does n't actually buy very much of anything .
Re : Brexit Bus .
It 'll still be down in equal number terms compared to before the conservative party started slashing the budget .
The ? 6bn being added back into the NHS is still considerably less than has already been cut .
The ? 6bm is " over the next parliamentary term " , which is five years .
Even if you are naive and think that this will be over a single year , that 's still only ? 115m per week .
Over the five years ( mostly likely four as they 'll not contribute the money for a year as this gives them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time ) this is only an increase of ? 23m per week ( ? 28m per week over four years ) .
Taking into account inflation and the collapsing exchange rate this has sum somewhat less purchasing power than previously as well .
There are a lot of well written analyses of the budget at the independent Kings Fund .
It pays to see what has happened rather than the rosy promises of " new " spend which is usually just restating previous spending commitments as if they were new .
To increase the NHS budget by ? 250m per week the government would have to commit to spending an additional ? 13 billion a year .
Immediately , and as a permanent increase , increased annually in line with the real inflation figure .
Not a " plan over the next parliamentary session " , which is 5 years .
Re : Brexit Bus .
I 'm sorry , you misunderstand .
The actual budget , not including the ? 6bn in the recent budget , not including any Coronavirus related spending , actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250m/week since the referendum .
Re : Brexit Bus .
UK NHS budget :  2015/16 - ? 122bn  2016/17 - ? 122 .
2017/18 - ? 124 .
2018/19 - ? 126 .
2019/20 - ? 133 .
2020/21 - ? 137 .
In order to go up by your claimed ? 250/m a week the budget would have had to increase by ? 13bn in between the 2015/16 years and 2016/17 years ( or , being more fogriving due to the vagaries of the differening reporting periods and other arbitrary dates , 2017/18 ) .
The difference between 2017/18 and 2015/16 is ? 2 .
That is often a below inflationary increase , let alone the ? 13bn that would be required to match your claimed " ? 250m/week since the referendum " .
The Consumer Price Index has risen from 100 in 2015 to 107 .
in 2019 , which is a 7 .
increase from 2015 compared to 2019 .
Taking the ? 122bn budget from 2015 and increasing it in line with this we get ? 131 .
, compared to the ? 133 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years of just ? 1 .
which averages out over the whole period to ? 7m a week .
Please explain where your claim of " ? 250m/week since the referendum " , requiring an instant uplift of ? 13bn in a single year and maintained from that year on , are represented in these numbers .
Only by comparing the 2020/21 budget of ? 137 .
with the 2015/16 budget of ? 122bn do we see an increase of higher than the required ? 13bn ( ? 15 .
increase over the period ) but when inflation is factored in this is reduced to a mere ? 1 .
increase over the period .
Are you trying to claim that inflation based increases in expenditure , that should happen every year , are in fact " additional " ?  Re : Brexit Bus .
I did not claim a single year increase and my statements do not require " an instant uplift of ? 13bn in a single year " .
I used Government figures that do indeed show a ? 13bn increase between 2016 and the 2019/2020 budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be replying further to you .

Re : Brexit Bus .
If you are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you read what I wrote , I pointedly stated that there was in inflationary increase in the budget year on year .
This is not " new spend " , this is nothing more than inflationary increases so the NHS budget is not slashed further .
Claiming that a regular inflationary increase is " new spend " or something that counters the abject lies of the Brexit bus shows a total gullibility and failure to understand the maths .
Are you even trying to suggest that only because of Brexit that the government are increasing the NHS budget in line with inflation , and that without this they would not be and therefore effectively reducing the NHS budget even more every year ?
