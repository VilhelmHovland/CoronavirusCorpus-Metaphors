"  Most patients with confirmed COVID-19 have developed a fever or had symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as cough and difficulty breathing , according to the Centers for Disease Control .

Like all local hospital systems , Bronson is using a screening process before anyone enters its facilities .
" If you do n't have symptoms ( fever , cough or difficulty breathing ) , you do not meet the criteria for testing , " Bronson Healthcare Group says on its website .
" The criteria and decision about who gets tested is dependent upon your risk and the availability of testing supplies .
This information will be updated if the testing criteria changes .
"  Sixteen people from Calhoun County have tested positive for COVID-19 , as of Sunday 's report from the county health department .
There are 83 pending tests .
In all , 162 Calhoun County residents have been approved for testing .

" We do n't have a positive or negative , so we do n't know if we should be alerting people , " she said .
" That really bothers me because , yes , we are a family of seven , so that 's a lot of people to come in contact with .

Two of her children , a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old , became sick before she and her fiance were infected .
When both parents are sick , " quarantining within your own house is not realistic , " Fila said .
" We want to be strong in front of them , and , it is what it is .
We 'll stay home and do our part , but , when you are sick , that stuff falls by the wayside and it 's about survival , get to the next meal and get through the day at that point .
Things like nurturing their social development and making sure they are not traumatized are hard to keep doing at this point , when you ca n't even be that close to your family .

" I understand the whole issue comes down to a lack of testing , but I feel like this has been going on now almost two weeks , so we should have more tests so we can loosen the reigns on what category you need to fall into , " she said .
" I understand I do n't do an essential job , but I still have five kids and they have contact with a lot of people .
