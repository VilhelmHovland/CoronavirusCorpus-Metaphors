Boombox Social , a new club going into the former Green Flash location at 16th and P streets , was on track to open in mid-April .
But then the novel coronavirus started spreading in Nebraska , and both state and local governments urged businesses to limit gatherings to fewer than 10 people for the foreseeable future , not a good development for a business with " Social " in its name .
So the opening is on hold for now .
" Our hope is ( to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Cody Schmick , whose family owns Kinkaider Brewing , the company behind Boombox Social .
He said the other part of the business , Sideshow Spirits , was n't scheduled to open until the fall , so it 's still on track .
The Broken Bow-based craft brewer has leased out the former home of Ploughshare Brewing Co and Green Flash at 1630 P St .
and plans to do two different concepts in the building .
Schmick is trying to stay optimistic about the situation .
" We are looking at it as a chance to get everything perfect so we can throw a huge party when all this blows over , " he said .
It might be little consolation , but Schmick is not alone .
A number of businesses in Lincoln either just opened in the past few weeks or were scheduled to open in the next month or two .
They are now faced with some tough decisions about what to do in the face of restrictions on gatherings .
Mike Worley was set to open his indoor golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but those plans are now on hold .
Instead , he said , the business at 1919 Cornhusker Highway will host private parties of groups of less than 10 in keeping with local guidelines .
" It will give people a chance to see it , " Worley said , noting it 's similar to what he 's doing at his three Omaha locations , which have had to close to the public because of restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people there .
Obstacles are a big feature of Michael Worley 's courses , and the ones in Lincoln include a hole where you have to go down a slide and a zipline to transport players between certain holes .
One of the businesses hit the hardest by the restrictions is the Kinetic Sports Complex .
The new $11 million basketball and volleyball facility got its occupancy permit from the city on March 19 and was supposed to host volleyball tournaments on back-to-back weekends .
Those events , as well as a basketball tournament set for next month and numerous practices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Developer Sam Manzitto Jr .
said the project 's lenders have been " very willing " to work with him on deferring interest and even payments for a couple of months .
He also said sponsorship money from Windstream Kinetic , which paid its first-year fee up front , has helped .
The complex has been able to keep paying its one permanent employee , a part-time building manager .
Still , Manzitto acknowledged , " it 's tough .
"  He said the complex will spend the next several weeks working out the bugs and preparing for when it can open .
" We 're just taking time to get organized and be ready , " Manzitto said .
Being smack dab in the middle of the country gives Lincoln an appeal like few other cities have , and that advantage , combined with the right facilities , could bring lots of youth sports teams into town .
Jason Metcalf , the local franchisee for Scooter 's Coffee , had originally planned to push back the opening of his newest location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of weeks , but it will now have to wait until at least the second week of May because of city restrictions that require restaurant dining rooms to be closed .
Despite the fact that he 's doing a brisk business through drive-thrus at many of his other Lincoln locations , Metcalf said he does n't plan to open the new one until both the dining room and drive-thru can fully operate .
As for the existing locations , he said customers have been extremely generous .
" Our drive-thrus are busy , our people are very thankful to be working and we have seen incredible generosity from the public , " Metcalf said .
" It 's not uncommon to have folks give the baristas $50-$100 .
"  Schmick figures that people are going to be in a celebratory mood when the pandemic passes , and he hopes to be ready to serve them .
" We feel when this settles down , people are going to be ready to come out and have a drink or two together , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location next week at 27th Street and Pine Lake Road .

WASHINGTON -- Bracing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 people , President Donald Trump on Sunday extended restrictive social distancing guidelines through April , bowing to public-health experts who presented him with even more dire projections for the expanding coronavirus pandemic .
It was a stark shift in tone by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country reopening in a few weeks .
From the Rose Garden , he said his Easter revival hopes had only been " aspirational .
"  The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government expires Monday and Trump had expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines at least in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic .
He instead decided to extend them through April 30 , a tacit acknowledgment he 'd been too optimistic .
Many states and local governments have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings .
Trump 's impulse to reopen the country met a sober reality check Sunday from Dr .
Anthony Fauci , the government 's top infectious disease expert , who said the U .
could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic .
That warning hardened a recognition in Washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as Trump expressed a longing for normalcy .
Trump , who has largely avoided talk of potential death and infection rates , cited projection models that said potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distancing measures not been put in place .
And he said the country would be doing well if it " can hold " the number of deaths " down to 100,000 .
" He said the best case for the country would be for the death rate to peak in about two weeks .
" It 's a horrible number , " Trump said , but added , " We all together have done a very good job .
"  Brought forward by Trump at the outdoor briefing , Fauci said his projection of a potential 100,000 to 200,000 deaths is " entirely conceivable " if not enough is done to mitigate the crisis .
Americans are now being called on to prepare for another 30 days of severe economic and social disruption , as schools and businesses are closed and public life is upended .
One in 3 Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus .
Trump acknowledged that he may be forced to extend the guidelines again at the end of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be well on our way to recovery .
"  The federal guidelines recommend against group gatherings larger than 10 and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home .
People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants , bars , non-essential travel and shopping trips .
For more than a week , Trump had been bombarded by calls from outside business leaders who urged him to begin re-opening the nation 's economy and warned of catastrophic consequences that could damage his re-election chances if it remained shuttered for much longer .
" The president is right .
The cure ca n't be worse than the disease , and we 're going to have to make some difficult trade-offs , " Trump 's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had said last Monday , reflecting the thinking of his economic team .
That talk alarmed health experts , who urged Trump to keep encouraging people to stay home .
The virus was still spreading , with the peak still weeks away , the experts warned .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backed off the idea of loosening recommended restrictions on less impacted parts of the country .
" They 're the best in the profession and they did n't like that idea , " he said of Fauci and Dr .
Deborah Birx , head of the White House coronavirus task force .
Trump was clearly moved by the scenes from New York , particularly hard-hit Elmhurst Hospital in his native Queens .
" I 've been watching that for the last week on television , " he said .
" Body bags all over , in hallways .
I 've been watching them bring in trailer trucks -- freezer trucks , they 're freezer trucks , because they ca n't handle the bodies , there are so many of them .
This is essentially in my community , in Queens , Queens , New York , " he continued .
" I 've seen things that I 've never seen before .
"  Phasing out the recommendations would have been a symbolic nod to business and an affront to public health experts , but may have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own restrictions in place that , in many cases , are far stricter than the administration 's , and those would have remained in place .
Birx and Fauci said even those areas yet to face a significant outbreak must prepare for the eventuality that they will .
The U .
had more than 139,000 COVID-19 cases reported by Sunday evening , with more than 2,400 deaths .
During the course of the Rose Garden briefing , reported deaths grew by several dozen and the number of cases by several thousand .
Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms , which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia , sometimes requiring hospitalization .
The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems .
Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies .
Fauci 's prediction would take the death toll well past that of the average seasonal flu .
Trump repeatedly cited the flu 's comparatively much higher cost in lives in playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday suggested without evidence that hospitals and hospital systems were " hoarding " ventilators and other medical supplies that were needed in other areas of the state .
He also encouraged the Food and Drug Administration to streamline approvals for companies seeking to sanitize badly needed respirators so they can be reused .
