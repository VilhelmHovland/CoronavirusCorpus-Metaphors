's Presidency/Reuters  Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday defended his weekend handshake with the mother of drug lord Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman , calling her a " respectable old lady " and seeking to cast his critics as the principal menace to the country .
In a 30-second video posted on Twitter on Sunday , Lopez Obrador could be seen approaching Maria Consuelo Loera 's car , parked on a dirt road on the outskirts of Badiraguato , a mountainous municipality in the northwestern state of Sinaloa .

Guzman was for years boss of the Sinaloa Cartel , a powerful criminal organisation blamed for the deaths of thousands of people in Mexico ranging from rival gang members , general citizens , police and members of the armed forces .
Critics on social media asked what kind of message the encounter , videotaped by part of the entourage that regularly accompanies the president on weekends , was meant to send .
Questioned about the meeting at his regular morning news conference , Lopez Obrador was unrepentant and quickly blamed " adversaries " for trying to make a " scandal " out of it .
" Sometimes , because it 's my job , I have to shake hands with white-collar criminals who have n't even lost their respectability .
How am I not going to greet an old lady who leaves her hand outstretched ? " he told reporters .
In the video , Lopez Obrador could also be seen talking to one of El Chapo 's lawyers , Jose Luis Gonzalez Meza .
Lopez Obrador said Loera , a " respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in getting permission from US authorities to visit her son , who is in a maximum-security US prison .
" This depends on the United States government , the US embassy .
I believe that for humanitarian reasons she should be allowed to go with caregivers , sanitarians , doctors , " he said .
Ignoring coronavirus guidance  The left-wing leader said " conservative " opponents , were trying to use the encounter to hurt him .
Accusing them of hypocrisy , he said the corruption he identifies as their legacy is a much bigger threat to the country than a 92-year-old woman " who deserves my respect " .
After questions by reporters about the meeting , Lopez Obrador promised to publish the letter from Loera , saying : " We have nothing to hide .
there 's nothing that can embarrass us .

Today while visiting Badiraguato , Chapo Guzm ? n 's hometown , he greeted Chapo 's mother with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
oh , the drama ! **26;2705;TOOLONG  Guzman shipped tonnes of drugs around the world and twice embarrassed the Mexican government by escaping from prison .
Captured for a third time in 2016 , he was extradited to the United States in 2017 and sentenced to life in prison by a US judge last year after his conviction on multiple drug charges .
The Sinaloa Cartel caused Lopez Obrador 's government considerable embarrassment last October , when security forces briefly surrounded and captured the notorious drug lord 's son Ovidio Guzman in Culiacan , the capital of Sinaloa .
Cartel gunmen responded with prolonged bursts of gunfire in the streets after Ovidio 's arrest .
To avoid bloodshed , the government ordered Ovidio 's release , sparking widespread criticism of Lopez Obrador 's security policy , and angering some military leaders .
Lopez Obrador saw Guzman 's mother on a visit to a rural area of Sinaloa where the government was building a new road that would pass near El Chapo 's birthplace .
The president said he went to meet Loera after hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has flouted the advice of his own government not to engage in physical contact during the coronavirus crisis , dismissed the suggestion that he should not be shaking hands with an elderly woman at risk of contagion .
He said it would have been " disrespectful " not to take her hand - even as two state governors Lopez Obrador had recently met with said over the weekend they had coronavirus .
