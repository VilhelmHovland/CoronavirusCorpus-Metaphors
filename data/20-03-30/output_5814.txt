When the Nipah virus outbreak occurred in Perambra in Kerala 's Kozhikode in 2018 , Dr Shameem Muhammed , a doctor from Kasaragod , asked one of the state 's political leaders what would happen if such an outbreak happened in his district .
Dr Shameem 's worst nightmare has now come true .
Not Nipah , but Kasaragod has become the district with the highest number of coronavirus confirmed cases in the state .
Since 2015 , a group of youngsters under the banner Kasaragodinoridam ( A Space for Kasaragod ) has been campaigning for the development of the district .
They have been fighting a long battle against the negligence shown to the district over the years by successive governments .
It was as part of this movement that Dr Shameem , who is also a representative of Kasaragodinoridam , prepared a report on the poor healthcare facilities in the district .
Report in hand , the group approached all kinds of authorities , from the lower level to the ministry for years .
But nothing happened .
Now with more than 85 COVID-19 cases the district has become the epicentre for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Kasaragod General Hospital ( GH ) , which has always been alleged to have poor facilities .
Women patients are admitted to the Kanjangad District Hospital as it is much better compared to the GH .
Many others are under quarantine in Pariyaram Medical College Hospital in Kannur district as there is no facility in Kasaragod .
A majority of the people from the district depend on hospitals and medical colleges in Mangaluru for healthcare and are now facing a lot of difficulty as Karnataka has closed its borders .
Dr Shameem Muhammed  Will this pandemic be an eye-opener for the government about the state of Kasaragod 's healthcare ? Dr Shameem spoke to TNM and explained why the healthcare system in the district is the worst in the state .
" Of the three levels of healthcare systems -- primary , secondary and tertiary -- Kasaragod has just reached the primary level .
We have just the basic facilities .
No round-the-clock medical assistance and emergency care .
We are lacking in number of beds , medical equipment and specialists .
That is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical services , " Dr Shameem , who is currently a Neurology resident at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital , says .
" The district is going to struggle to accommodate patients if the number of cases increase , " Dr Shameem says .
Apart from the GH , Kasaragod has one district hospital in Kanjangad , five taluk hospitals and five Community Health Centres that provide inpatient facilities .
But at all these centres the availability of beds is very low , he says .
The Kasaragod GH , though it is the biggest medical centre in the district , has just 230 beds , the lowest in the state .
GHs in cities like Thiruvananthapuram , Pathanamthitta , Alappuzha , Kozhikode , Thalasseri , Manjeri , Ernakulam and others have more than 500 beds .
" Unavailability of medicines in the pharmacy , shortage of equipment in the ICU like BiPAP , ventilators and CPAP machines is another problem , " Dr Shameem says .
" There are not many doctors from Kasaragod , those who come from out of town do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
An ophthalmologist who studied in JIPMER had joined the GH , he was ready to stay there for a while , but they were not even able to provide him with a lens .
So he left , " Shameem recalls .
He also says that if COVID-19 patients increase , the district will lack even ventilators .
" To understand the laxity shown to the district , the GH has only one post for radiologist or radio therapist .
Both are totally different .
Radiologist is a doctor who does radio diagnosis and a radiotherapist is a doctor who treats cancer with radio therapy .
We do n't understand why both are given just one post , " he says .
Trauma care , oncology , neurology , cardiology and other super specialities are just up-and-coming in the district .
Reasons behind lack of development  " The primary reason for the underdevelopment of the district is that there is no demand from the public or the people 's representatives .
The people have Gulf money so they opt for private hospitals in Mangaluru @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have n't seen the best government hospitals .
Apart from that , our political representatives are not demanding development .
We have had even ministers from Kasaragod constituency , but it is doubtful whether our leaders took an interest in the development of the district 's health sector , " Dr Shameem says , adding that the public should know what portion of the political representative 's funds are spent on the health sector .
He points out that irresponsibility and corruption in the bureaucracy and Health department are also a reason for the district 's fate .
" Lack of human resources is a major reason .
Good doctors and officers do n't stay here , " he points out .
Solutions  When coronavirus cases were reported from Kasaragod there was a call to speed up the establishment of the Kasaragod Medical College , whose construction is almost over .
A medical college in Kasaragod has been a long-time dream of the people .
Its foundation stone was laid in 2013 but it has n't started functioning till now .
Wayanad and Kasaragod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
However , a medical school can not be an immediate solution to the district 's inefficient healthcare system .
" A medical college is obviously a necessity for the district .
But it can not serve immediate needs , it will take at least 15 years after courses commence to serve its purpose .
What we should right now is to enhance the existing government hospitals in the district .
They have to be developed as super speciality centres , " Dr Shameem says .
" After this coronavirus season , we should form an expert committee that includes specialists , not just the District Medical Officer , real specialists in each stream , political leaders and bureaucrats who can study the shortcomings and lobby for the development of our health sector , " he adds .
According to him , improving the manpower , equipment and facilities in the existing hospitals is the immediate solution .
" Compared to other districts , public contribution to the healthcare development in Kasaragod is zero .
But the district has the ability for good contributions .
So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he suggests .
He also says authorities should not forget about the district after the coronavirus pandemic .
