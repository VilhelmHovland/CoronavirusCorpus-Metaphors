The virus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people , but for some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness or death .
( AP Photo/Bilal Hussein )  TEHRAN , Iran -- Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper , an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing : Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus .
The boy , now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran .
Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic , where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers .
An Iranian doctor helping the country 's Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater , giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened .
The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran , where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country .
" Other countries have only one problem , which is the new coronavirus pandemic .
But we are fighting on two fronts here , " said Dr .
Hossein Hassanian , an adviser to Iran 's Health Ministry who gave the higher figures to the AP .
" We have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus .
"  For most people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , or death .
The pandemic has swept across the world , overwhelming hospitals , crippling economies and forcing governments to restrict the movements of billions of people .
Particularly hard hit has been Iran , home to 80 million people .
As of now , there is no known cure for COVID-19 , the illness caused by the virus .
Scientists and doctors continue to study the virus and search for effective medicines and a vaccine .
But in messages forwarded and forwarded again , Iranian social media accounts in Farsi falsely suggested a British school teacher and others cured themselves of the coronavirus with whiskey and honey , based on a tabloid story from early February .
Mixed with messages about the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers , some wrongly believed drinking high-proof alcohol would kill the virus in their bodies .
The Islamic Republic has reported over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus , the highest toll of any country in the Middle East .
International experts also fear Iran may be under-reporting its cases , as officials for days played down the virus ahead of a parliamentary election .
That fear of the virus , coupled with poor education and internet rumors , saw dozens sickened by drinking bootleg alcohol containing methanol in Iran 's southwestern Khuzestan province and its southern city of Shiraz .
Videos aired by Iranian media showed patients with IVs stuck in their arms , laying on beds otherwise needed for the fight against the coronavirus , including the intubated 5-year-old boy .
