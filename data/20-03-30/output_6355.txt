Accommodation providers must support students  Mon 30 Mar , 2020  The Scottish Greens have called on student accommodation providers not to ' trap ' students who have had to leave their halls early due to the COVID-19 outbreak .
Scottish Greens Education Spokesperson Ross Greer MSP has called on the providers , including Hello Student and IQ Student Accommodation , to follow the example of Unite Students and others and release students who are impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency from their tenancies .
Ross Greer MSP said :  " It is great to see that providers like Unite Students have made a commitment that no students will be forced to pay for accommodation that they ca n't use because of a public health crisis .
This is clearly the right course of action and one that is appreciated by those students affected .
" Unfortunately , other providers including IQ Student Accommodation and Hello Student have instead disgracefully refused to support students at this time of crisis .
In response to enquiries from my colleague Mark Ruskell MSP on behalf of his constituents at St Andrews , Hello Student even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " university " accommodation ' .
" Instead of trying to maximise their own profits , companies like Hello Student , who have access to the same government support as any other company , should recognise that they must do the right thing by students at a time of crisis .
If they are not moved by the moral case , perhaps they might consider that many of the same students they are treating abysmally today will be looking for accommodation next year , and if this behaviour carries on they might just look elsewhere .
"  More like this  Responding to new guidance issued by the SQA on coursework , Scottish Greens education spokesperson Ross Greer said : " This statement from the SQA answers the major question around coursework not being required , but in doing so it opens up so many more .
" How will those who 've already submitted coursework and those who 've not be treated equally ? What will the criteria for teacher judgements of estimated grades be ? Will there be a robust appeals system for young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free school meals for low-income families should continue in communities after schools close .
Here are our proposals :  A food network for Scotland 's most vulnerable children &amp; young people  Numbers  According to information gathered in February 2018 260,842 children in Scotland were registered for free school meals .
