Give more support to New York in crisis  We are getting close to a bipartisan agreement to give our country support battling the COVID-19 outbreak .
Some figures of the allocations have been announced and will be voted on .
New York 's governor and New York City 's mayor are not happy with the $1 billion allocated to help their beloved state .
Very understandable ! People are suffering very badly , the numbers afflicted are very high and our fellow Americans need help now .
It would be a good opportunity for the NY governor , the NYC mayor , and our representatives in Washington to ask for a reassessment to the allocations within the Corona Support Package that do not directly relate to COVID-19 , and send more financial help to the suffering people and front line healthcare workers to ease their burden .
