Indonesia to limit people 's mobility as study warns of surge in coronavirus deaths  Indonesia accounts for nearly half of the 250 deaths reported from across Southeast Asia , but fewer than a fifth of some 8,400 cases that have been confirmed in the region .
President Joko Widodo has encouraged social distancing but questioned whether Indonesians have the discipline for full lockdowns .
JAKARTA : Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Monday he planned stricter rules on mobility and social distancing as a study presented to the government warned of a risk of more than 140,000 coronavirus deaths by May without tougher action .
Medical experts have said the world 's fourth most populous country must impose tighter movement restrictions as known cases of the highly infectious respiratory illness have gone from zero in early March to 1,414 , with 122 deaths .
Indonesia accounts for nearly half of the 250 deaths reported from across Southeast Asia , but fewer than a fifth of some 8,400 cases that have been confirmed in the region .
Nearly one third of those cases are in Malaysia .

President Joko Widodo has encouraged social distancing but questioned whether Indonesians have the discipline for full lockdowns , in contrast with Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines , Malaysia and Thailand .
But he appears to have reconsidered this approach after public health experts presented a prediction model to Indonesia 's planning agency Bappenas on Friday underlining a need for stronger intervention to prevent a rapid rise in cases and deaths .
The model , a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters , said Indonesia could instigate three stages of intervention : mild , moderate , and high .

With mild intervention , which includes optional physical distancing and limiting public crowds , the researchers from the University of Indonesia said the virus death toll could soar to over 140,000 among over 1 .

" These are just conservative estimates , " Pandu Riono , one of the researchers , told Reuters .
" But we have to be ready even in these circumstances .
"  Riono characterised measures currently taken by Indonesia , from rapid testing and deploying regional labs to test samples , as only approaching mild intervention .
Health experts have said Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response believed to have masked the scale of the outbreak in a country with still very low levels of testing and with a significant deficit in hospital beds , medical staff and intensive-care facilities .
Bappenas officials said the model served as input for the government and to help them allocate budgets .

Riono said that the priority now must be to suppress the number of coronavirus cases .
" The message ( in our model ) is that we do n't want people dying , we do n't want our siblings dying , our friends dying .
