' The poor must be saved from not only disease but also from hunger and thirst '  NEW DELHI : The pandemic of bailouts and public subsidies for large corporations which appear to be so mismanaged they can not survive a few weeks ' economic shock demonstrates how far the social distance between people and their governments has grown .
The ethical distance is evident , from a report that Varanasi police showed up mid-lockdown at the home of Vijay Vineet , the journalist who had reported starving children were eating grass in prime minister Narendra Modi 's parliamentary constituency .
Police reportedly served Vineet notice asking for a " clarification " within 24 hours ; it was issued by district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma , who went on to circulate pictures of himself eating the grass , to prove it was fit for human consumption .
The distance between word and deed : Doctors in Bihar 's only hospital designated as a coronavirus treatment centre are reportedly working with almost no personal protective equipment , and 83 junior doctors who say they are exhibiting symptoms have been treating patients there for at least five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's first confirmed case in Kerala on January 30 , the directorate-general of foreign trade ( under the commerce ministry ) prohibited the export of all personal protective equipment .
A week later it amended the order to allow the export of masks and gloves .
On February 25 it further relaxed restrictions and allowed eight new items for export .
It seems we kept exporting protective equipment until March 19 , and ventilators till March 24 .
The distance in priorities can be seen in the central government 's actions in the Supreme Court .
Attempts by the government of Kerala to announce a moratorium on taxes and bank dues until April 6 were upheld by the High Court -- and a similar order by the Uttar Pradesh government upheld in Allahabad -- but were met with resistance from the central government , which challenged the orders in the Supreme Court and won an interim stay ex parte .
The disease distance , however , is more easily breached , as UK prime minister Boris Johnson recently discovered , having tested positive for this virus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared commercial interests of the United States , China and other big GDPs .
This disease does not respect caste , source and result to the distances described here .
Our response to this abnormal situation -- fomenting a humanitarian crisis -- has proven abnormally casteist .
And like casteism it is unscientific , for by ordering the poor out of our cities , starving them , not housing them even though all schools and colleges and public buildings everywhere are quite emptied , our incompetent jealous state has made the health emergency much worse .
What is called caste ? Ambedkar wrote in 1936 that " Castes form a graded system of sovereignties , high and low , which are jealous of their status and which know that if a general dissolution came , some of them stand to lose more of their prestige and power than others do .
"  With the threat of general dissolution well and truly here , the realisation grows : The politics that got us in this mess wo n't get us out of it .
' Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign first .
The distancing measures to avert an epidemic should be called disease distancing , argues social activist and writer Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd in a statement dated January 28 and recirculated recently :  DISEASE DISTANCING NOT " SOCIAL DISTANCING "  Ever since the Prime Minister , Narendra Modi , announced a national lock down on March 24 , 2020 to fight Covid-19 and declared that " Social Distancing " is the only solution to save India from the Corona Pandemic , all Chief Ministers are also using the same coinage in India .
We must use ' Disease Distancing ' not Social Distancing because India is a country of social Untouchability and caste distancing for millennia .
If this goes in to the national psyche it will make Untouchability and casteism worse in future .
India is not like Europe , America and China .
This is a country with millennial practice of social distancing .
Unfortunately the Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Bharatiya Janatha Party claim the biggest organised network in the world .
But their cadre are not seen anywhere among the poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ruling .
Mohan Bhagwat and Amit Shah are not seen giving calls to the nation on how to save the poor , unemployed , beggars , nomads and semi-nomads by organizations .
No Hindutva organization is seen distributing food , water to beggars , destitute and to the old poor in urban slums .
This is a bad nationalism to say the least .
Nationalism means saving the poor 's life in a crisis like this .
I request all organizations not to use the phrase " Social Distancing " but use Disease Distancing or Corona Distancing .
With great struggles from the days of Savitribai Phule and her son Dr .
Phule who died serving the dying poor in Poona in the Bubonic Plague of 1897 , we struggled a lot to fight caste social distancing .
We should not be strengthening it again .
The poor must be saved from not only disease but also from hunger and thirst .
Let us serve the poorest of the poor like Keralites are doing to save the country .
