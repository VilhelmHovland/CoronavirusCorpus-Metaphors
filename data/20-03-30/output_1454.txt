Forum : Strong leaders who give us confidence are what we need in a crisis  Singapore University of Technology and Design professor Lim Sun Sun raised a good point in her commentary that we must now build a sense of normalcy without falling prey to complacency ( Five lessons from fighting Covid-19 , March 19 ) .
As commendations pour in on how well Singapore has done to handle the Covid-19 pandemic , we should not rest on our laurels .
Instead , we should continue to reflect on what we have done well and what can be improved to overcome this multi-dimensional crisis , both as individuals and as a country .
One aspect of Prof Lim 's commentary resonated with me in particular - leadership .
We need strong leadership that addresses people 's fears and gives them confidence in a crisis .
Not leaders who rouse emotions and eloquently pay lip service , but those who inspire , connect and challenge us to be better versions of ourselves .
Through this crisis , I see our leaders caring about the welfare of Singaporeans and the future of Singapore .
Prof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing .
Both PM Lee , with a style that exudes calmness , and Mr Chan , with a frank and direct style , show traits that we want to see and need to have .
They help calm us in times of fear and they nudge us if we need to do better .
No sugar-coating of messages , but communicating directly and honestly to connect with the people as it should be .
While communication styles may differ and will certainly be required for different audiences and occasions , their intent is similar .
Ultimately , the quality of our leaders and their ability to govern will stand us in good stead - not just in overcoming this crisis but also in giving us the confidence to come out even stronger .

This means that even though the infected is mildly ill , he is highly infectious .
It might sound paradoxical to a layman , that even though he is " just a bit sick " , he could potentially be spreading the virus , albeit unwittingly .
Coupled with the fact that the symptoms of early Covid-19 are indistinguishable from many other acute respiratory infections , it is therefore understandable that patients could convince themselves that what they are suffering from is " nothing serious " or " just a passing cold " .
Hence , some of those who felt relatively well did not bother to seek medical consultation , or they resumed work or visited public spaces prematurely even when given a five-day medical certificate by the doctor .
Instances of patients flouting the five-day MC have surfaced .
These patients are now legally bound to stay at home as mandated in the updated Infectious Diseases Act .
Perhaps we could drum in the message that as far as Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick to be terribly infectious .
With that message instilled in their minds , patients might be more mindful of the potential gravity of ignoring containment guidelines .
Appealing to the public with this reasoning might help reinforce people 's willingness to practise social responsibility .
