Covid-19 : Kashmir witch-hunts many innocents  In the last 30 years of armed-conflict in Kashmir , the Valley has been witness to numerous funerals , where each new looked more tragic than the previous one .
But the Namaz-e-Jinazah of Kashmir 's first coronavirus victim , a 65-year-old , looked even saddening , shocking .
On March 26 , mere two odd dozen mourners attended the funeral .
Amid restrictions and precautions , the unusual Namaz-e-Jinazah was guided by two guidelines : One , of course the Islamic code .
And , two , a government 's SOP for such burial .
This senior citizen , who lived in Srinagar 's Hyderpora was laid to rest in his is native Sopore , some 50 kilometers from the summer capital .
The businessman , associated with Tabhleegi Jammat , a Muslim missionary group , had tested positive for the ailment on March 24 , barely two days before his death at the Chest Disease Hospital in Dalgate .
The very news of his having been tested covid-positive took Kashmir by storm .
He was largely accused of hiding the travel history -- shamed as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  The two days of hate-campaign , spared none -- right from the critically ailing to the Islamic Tableegh .
Call it fate or coincidence , the hate campaign finally started dying within hours of his death , when the government ordered probe into his very death .
The government decision was a hint that there was negligence on the part of the health authorities and not the deceased .
As per news reports , the patient had first gone for consultation to the SKIMS Medical College Hospital , Bemina hospital .
Well , how did the patient , who had gone for consultation to SKIMS end up some ten miles way at the CD Hospital , is still not clear .
The only thing clear from the government inquiry is that the deceased was innocent .
Otherwise also , why would anyone knowingly that he or she is infected move around freely ? And would the family of any such case , put their own lives at risk by hiding such deadly details ?  In blaming the corona-virus stricken families , commonsense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with patients and their families being abused as criminals by many of us in Kashmir .
The old man escaped unwanted humiliation with his martyrdom , because as per Islamic belief , such a death in epidemic is eligible for Shahadat .
But then , there 's a family which lives with trauma for actually no fault of theirs .
Well , I am referring to Kashmir 's first corona positive patient , a woman from Khanyar , believed to be recovering .
This woman had returned to homeland from Umrah pilgrimage on March 16 .
Two days later she tested positive .
Her family had been prompt enough to rush her to SKIMS while other family members instantly went into quarantine voluntarily .
This was the first case where fear of corona turned into witch-hunt for the woman and her family and a senior official in the Jammu and Kashmir Police related to her .
As per news reports , the medical team at Srinagar International Airport had accused the police official of having " influenced " the concerned to let her skip the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Well , you can not blame media for having reported " VIP culture " because on getting such sensitive inputs at such sensitive times , journalists can not wait for a legal verdict before reporting things .
)  But then , there remain logical questions .
Would anyone knowingly carry any infected case home , only to make other members vulnerable ? Here , let 's ignore that Srinagar airport is manned by CISF and not the JKP .
These incidents of witch-hunt suggest that some forces could be spreading such rumors to divert attention from who is actually at fault .
And , I have a reason to say so .
The Khanyar woman was not the only Umrah pilgrim in that group to have arrived that fateful day .
There were over 40 of them .
So , did all such suspect cases of coronavirus enjoy same " VIP influence " ?  Well none of these pilgrims were quarantined but allowed to move around freely for over a week .
On March 24 , they were finally taken to JLNM Hospital for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support my claims .
The preparedness of the health authorities has been questionable as even doctors and paramedics are crying for proper protective gears .
And , in the evenings these saviors could be carrying infection back home as government has n't provided them with even special hostel facilities , either .
And then , the conditions of hospitals : Even though super-specialty SKIMS Soura is not a designated covid-hospital , four coronavirus cases at hospitalized there .
Wo n't such violation of norms , jeopardize lives of others , especially critical care patients , including those suffering from cancer , who visit the hospital ?  While questions remain unanswered , many in Kashmir are on endless witch-hunt .
As about the top cop , when you could be scared of being infected by the deadly disease , even going into self-quarantine was n't easy .
Given public reaction , he had to abandon his home in a hurry , with family members including his sulking baby , who kept crying unheard !
