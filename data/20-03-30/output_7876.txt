Second LDS missionary has COVID-19 ; church expects more cases to come  A second Latter-day Saint missionary has tested positive for COVID-19 , and more young proselytizers are expected to do so .
On Monday , the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reported that a female missionary in Australia has contracted the virus .
She is self-isolating at home .
Last Friday , an elder serving in Mexico City became the faith 's first missionary to test positive .
The young man , who is from Guatemala , was being treated for mild symptoms .
He and his companion are in self-isolation .
" As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses throughout the world , we recognize that additional missionaries will unfortunately contract the virus , " church spokesman Daniel Woodruff wrote Monday in a news release .
We are concerned about any missionary who contracts the virus and will work to help them receive appropriate care .
Gratefully , young missionaries are not generally considered to be at high risk of complications from the illness .
