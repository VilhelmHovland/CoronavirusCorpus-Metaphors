Newcomer teaches nursing at the college , and because of the coronavirus , must teach her class online .
She drives to the campus parking lot to use the Wi-Fi since her internet connection at her rural home is so poor .
In Wisconsin , 43% of rural residents lack high-speed internet , far below the national average .
The pandemic has illustrated how lack of reliable internet has made Wisconsin 's rural areas less efficient and more isolated .
The Newcomer household near Monroe is fairly typical for rural Wisconsin .
It is surrounded by cornfields .
The nearest neighbor is a quarter-mile down the road .
And the internet is terrible .
Now the coronavirus shutdown has put serious stress on the family .
The teenagers struggle with the drip of internet service to do their homework while school is closed .
Their mother , Traci Newcomer , 41 , teaches nursing at the nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now moved online .
Because their internet service is so poor , she can not teleconference at home .
Newcomer must drive 10 minutes to the parking lot of the college 's Monroe Campus to use the Wi-Fi there .
" Today I put the computer on my passenger side seat and turned sideways and conducted my class that way , " she said , prompting chuckles from her students before she got down to business .
Back at home , Newcomer and her two children have to alternate who can connect to the Wi-Fi .
And that is when they are getting any reception at all .
" Right now , three of us are very dependent on the internet and ca n't get accomplished what we want to accomplish in a big chunk of our day , " she said .
School and work are just a couple of the areas in which reliable , fast internet is needed as Wisconsin hunkers down to keep the coronavirus pandemic at bay .
Increasingly , health care professionals see patients online to contain the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news as this worldwide emergency continues .
The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare many of the ways in which poor internet service can make rural residents less productive and more isolated than their urban counterparts .
Already , Wisconsin lags behind the national average in broadband coverage .
An estimated 43% of Wisconsin 's rural residents lack access to high-speed internet , compared to about 31% of rural residents nationwide , according to the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin .
" We have such a long ways to go , " said state Sen .
Jeff Smith , a Democrat who has tried unsuccessfully to increase the state 's investment in broadband .
" And now this is going to be one of the things that comes out of this ( crisis ) when we 're all done : ' I guess we should n't have dragged our feet for so long , and now we 'd better get serious about it .

Jeff Smith/The Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism )  Many people in urban areas likely take for granted how much they use fast internet .
Video chatting .
Online banking .
Amazon Prime .
Now imagine life if your internet trudged along and frequently conked out .
That is what rural businesses and the communities where they operate often face in Wisconsin .
And during the coronavirus pandemic , many of those country-living people , children and adults alike , now have to conduct their daily lives from home .
Smith lives about five minutes outside of Eau Claire in the town of Brunswick , where he and his wife Sue live on a farm with horses , chickens , dogs , cats and a llama .
Smith said his internet speeds are so bad he can hardly stream anything , and websites take a long time to load .
" This is the new public utility , " Smith said , " and everyone has to have it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FCC 's Connect America Fund , the federal government has granted about $1 billion since 2015 to help service providers build and maintain voice and internet infrastructure in Wisconsin .
Some of that service is not yet online ; providers have up to six years to offer broadband .
And the program only requires an outdated speed of 10 megabits per second for downloading , although an FCC spokesman said nearly all of the funded projects will offer the federal definition of broadband , 25 megabits per second to download , and 3 mbps to upload .
Between 2013 and 2019 , the state of Wisconsin provided $20 million in grants to private and public entities and cooperatives to provide high-speed internet in unserved and underserved areas .
In 2020 , funding greatly expanded to $24 million in broadband expansion grants .
But critics say even the new budgeted amounts are rain drops in an empty pool compared to what is needed to achieve significant coverage across the state .
And the state grant rules do not set speed requirements in a rapidly accelerating digital landscape .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pretty meager , " said Anita T .
Gallucci , a Madison-based attorney who advises municipalities on telecommunications issues .
The needed speed , not to mention what will be required in the future , is " way beyond that , " she added .
As technology and stream quality advances , internet speeds have to keep up .
For example , for many new TVs with a 4K stream , Netflix requires at least an 18 mbps download speed and at least 50 mbps for multiple users , according to Consumer Reports .
Anna Newcomer , 16 , does homework in her rural home near Monroe , Wis .
In order to keep up with school work , the two teenagers in the family have to alternate who can connect to the Wi-Fi , and the connection is unreliable .
( Photo : Courtesy of Traci Newcomer/The Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism )  Telecommunications companies have relatively little problem providing broadband to urban areas , because cities and towns are densely populated .
For-profit businesses happily make the initial , and often heavy , infrastructure investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But sparsely populated areas are not enticing for private companies .
The cost of burying miles of fiber optic cables -- one of the fastest and most reliable ways to deliver the internet -- can be prohibitive .
Rural residents instead might need to rely on less dependable forms of internet delivery by satellite or wireless .
And those can be affected by factors including weather , trees and topography .
Other state governments have stepped in more forcefully .
About 16% of rural residents in Minnesota lack access to high-speed internet -- about one-third as many as in Wisconsin .
That is in large part because Wisconsin 's western neighbor has invested heavily in rural broadband .
From 2014 to 2019 , Minnesota spent about $108 million to expand high-speed internet , according to Eric Lightner , a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development .
That is more than five times what Wisconsin spent during a comparable period .
The politics of providing internet  Kathleen Vinehout , a former state senator and Democrat who lives in the ruggedly beautiful but reception-resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the parking lot of the American Legion hall in Alma to get Wi-Fi .
She echoed many from her party in criticizing Republicans , who controlled state government from 2011 through 2018 , for not funding rural broadband .
" The money they were putting in was only a token , " Vinehout said .
" It was only a soundbite .
It had nothing to do with the amount of money that needed to be invested to make a difference in people 's lives in this state .
"  In 2011 , the administration of then-Gov .
Scott Walker , a Republican , actually returned $23 million in federal stimulus money intended for broadband expansion to schools , libraries and government agencies .
Administration officials said the grant requirements were too stringent .
Walker declined to comment through a spokesman .
Last year , Gov .
Tony Evers , a Democrat , proposed adding nearly $75 million to the Broadband Expansion Grant Program in his 2019-20 budget .
The powerful Joint Committee on Finance , which writes the budget and is controlled by Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $44 million .
" There 's never enough money to do what you need to do , " said state Sen .
Luther Olsen , R-Ripon , a joint finance vice chairman who has worked on the rural broadband issue .
Luther Olsen , R-Ripon , is the vice chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance .
The committee scaled back proposed funding to the Broadband Expansion Grant Program that Gov .
Tony Evers proposed in his 2019-20 budget .
Olsen is seen here during a Jan .
31 , 2018 hearing at the Wisconsin State Capitol .
( Photo : Coburn Dukehart , Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism )  Olsen said he has good internet coverage at his home in Ripon , but his cabin in Wautoma uses less reliable satellite internet , at slower speeds .
" It 's one of those things where we 're not going to get the problem solved as fast as everybody would like , but at least we 're working towards that outcome , " Olsen said .
Gail Huycke is a community development specialist with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access , lives in Phillips in the northern part of the state .
Her internet runs slowly , about 8 to 10 megabits per second .
Minnesota 's rural broadband coverage is better than Wisconsin 's , Huycke agreed , but noted that the state also has higher sales and income taxes .
" I think that 's a trade that you have to make , " she said .
In fact , while Wisconsin has fallen behind in areas like rural broadband , Republicans are quick to boast that the tax burden has fallen to its lowest level in at least 50 years .
The finance committee rejected Evers ' attempt to raise the minimum speeds required for providers to receive state grants for providing internet .
And the committee eliminated the governor 's proposed statewide goal of achieving internet speeds that match or surpass the federal definition of broadband by 2025 .
In the current legislative session , Smith introduced several bills to improve service , including investing more in broadband expansion grants .
But the Republican majority ignored the Democrat 's bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her home office in Phillips , Wis .
Huycke is a community development specialist with the University of Wisconsin-Extension , and she has slow internet service .
Huycke has been telecommuting for four years , but " it has become a whole new experience with the rest of the world trying to do the same thing .
" She says the number of video meetings is now " off the charts , " and their home internet often slows down as she and her husband work from home and her adult daughter tries to keep up with schoolwork .
( Photo : Courtesy of Gail Huycke )  The effort to improve access did get a boost , however .
Wisconsin will end a tax on telephone companies installing internet infrastructure .
That is thanks to a bill introduced by state Rep .
Romaine Quinn , R-Barron , that Evers signed into law on March 3 .
Companies that began as internet companies do not have to pay the tax .
" This bill is another important tool for our local providers , " Quinn said in a press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Broadband Expansion Grant program , Wisconsin is truly creating an innovative environment for making sure that everyone in our state has the internet service they need .
"  Gallucci said if the move helps rural broadband expansion , that is great , but she called the bill " small potatoes .
"  On Tuesday , a bipartisan group of senators including Wisconsin 's Democratic Sen .
Tammy Baldwin introduced a $2 billion bill to compensate small broadband providers for offering free or discounted rates to low-income families during the pandemic .
Government steps in  If private companies will not provide the service , municipalities can build their own systems .
But that can be a heavier lift than some communities want to handle .
The city of Madison released a plan in 2018 to build a citywide , high-speed fiber internet network but shelved it when they learned it could cost more than $173 million .
Reedsburg 's utility , owned by the city but operated independently , built and maintains its own fiber network .
Like any other telecommunications company , the utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The city delivers rapid 1,000 mbps download and upload speeds for between $45 and $50 a month .
" It 's a lot of work , " said Brett Schuppner , the general manager of the Reedsburg Utility Commission .
" I just do n't see other utilities willing to take that on , unless their elected officials are going to push it .
"  In 22 years of providing internet service , the Reedsburg utility has made enough money to pay its bills and turn enough of a profit to invest in and grow its system , Schuppner said .
Former Democratic state Sen .
Kathleen Vinehout is seen in the barn where she currently lives in rural Alma , Wis .
Vinehout 's house burned down in a fire in February 2019 , and a new house is under construction .
She says her broadband reception is so poor she often has to drive to the parking lot of the American Legion hall in Alma to get Wi-Fi .
( Photo : Courtesy of Douglas Kane/Wisconsin Watch )  Sun Prairie 's utility company built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools and city buildings as well as some businesses , later extending to residences .
The city sold it in 2017 to TDS for about $2 .
million , allowing Sun Prairie to turn a small profit on its investment .
From 2000 to 2015 , the city of Sun Prairie and the Sun Prairie School District each saved an estimated $2 million over the cost of private service , which was slower , said Rick Wicklund , the city 's utility manager .
The city of Superior announced in February that it is also considering building its own broadband infrastructure , but one on which private companies would be able to provide the service and compete against each other .
Bringing Wisconsin up to par  There are ways Wisconsin could catch up .
Wisconsin could invest more heavily where private companies are reluctant to go .
Smith also argues for a speed requirement when doling out state grants .
Minnesota requires grant recipients to deliver speeds of at least the federal minimum , with a goal of reaching 100 megabits per second for downloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  While Wisconsin does not have a speed requirement in awarding grants for private companies to build broadband , speed is a factor when the Public Service Commission considers which proposals will receive state money , said Matthew Sweeney , a spokesman for the commission .
Olsen said a cheaper alternative to buried fiber optic cable would be to deliver internet by white space , the extra capacity in TV broadcast bands .
Such service is much slower than fiber networks .
On March 19 , 2019 , the FCC adopted a series of changes to make it easier to use TV white space to provide internet service in rural areas .
Co-op retools to provide service  Cooperative organizations also have stepped up in rural areas to lay fiber and provide internet service where private companies have not .
Cochrane Co-op Telephone in Buffalo County along the Mississippi River started as a telephone company for farmers in 1905 .
It now provides the communities of Cochrane , Buffalo City and Alma with high-speed internet delivered through fiber optic cable .
The co-op offers speeds as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as high as 1,000 mbps , the same as Reedsburg , for $200 per month .
Schuppner , the Reedsburg utility chief , said government should focus its support on providing high-speed systems .
" If public funds are being used , " he said , " it should be to provide a service that 's going to meet the needs for a long time .
"  UW-Extension 's Huycke agreed , citing a quote from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky , who said his father told him to skate where the puck is going , not where it has been .
