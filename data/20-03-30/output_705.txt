COVID-19 testing supplies scarce in Clark County  Mayors ' letter to Inslee : Clark County has less than a 48-hour reserve  A box of procedure masks sits next to boxes of gloves as staff members await COVID-19 patients at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center on Friday afternoon .
( amanda cowan/The Columbian )  On Thursday , all eight Clark County mayors sent a letter with an urgent message to Gov .
Jay Inslee 's office .
The letter said COVID-19 testing supplies in Clark County are severely low .
The county needs more swabs for specimen collection .
It needs more viral transport media to transport the swabs .
And it needs more personal protective equipment , or PPE , including masks and gowns to keep staff safe and help them collect specimens for tests .
Clark County health care providers have less than a 48-hour reserve of testing supplies and PPE , according to the letter -- and another letter sent by the Clark County Council .
The letter stated that local medical directors believe the county needs to start testing in its long-term care facilities within 48 hours , but ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at a critical tipping point in our ability to respond and mitigate the spread of the virus in our community , " the letter reads .
What 's happening in Clark County is happening across the state and nation .
After an initial delay in getting laboratories set up to test specimens , testing capacity has ramped up .
Washington has tested more than 20,000 people , more people per capita than any other state , according to state epidemiologist Dr .
Scott Lindquist .
At least 195 of those tests have come from Clark County , according to Clark County Public Health .

But as lab capacity improves , another problem has emerged .
Washington counties outside the Puget Sound area are in serious need of supplies to collect specimens for tests , and protective gear to keep medical workers safe and healthy .
Some counties do n't have any swabs and transport media , Lindquist said .
" There simply are n't enough supplies around , " he said .
" There needs to be more testing .
We need to push our federal government for more supplies .
"  On Thursday , the Washington Department of Health announced that it received more than 8,000 test packages , which include swabs , transport media and personal protective equipment .
The supplies are being sent to King , Snohomish and Pierce counties , where about 81 percent of the state 's confirmed cases reside .
No way to measure  Officials in Clark County are concerned that a lack of testing supplies here means there 's no way to properly gauge the local outbreak .
According to county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies and PPE from the state and received nothing .
Those supplies include test swabs , surgical masks , latex gloves , disinfect wipes , N95 masks , safety goggles , splash protection gowns and hand sanitizer .
Clark County Public Health Officer Dr .
Alan Melnick said he understands the demand in Puget Sound , but does n't want the outbreak to worsen in other areas because counties are left hanging .
" Whatever minimal supply they 've gotten from the federal government , I wish they had sent a little bit of it to Clark County , " Melnick said .
While Clark County is the fifth-largest county in the state , there are only six confirmed cases here .
Three of those patients have died .
Vancouver Mayor Anne McEnerny-Ogle said that on the surface , Clark County appears mostly spared from the pandemic .
That 's because it ca n't test enough people to unearth the real data .
At any time , the county could start experiencing a surge in sick patients .
Clark County mayors sent the letter to Inslee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the outbreak , McEnerny-Ogle said .
She 's worried the county 's proximity to Portland will leave it forgotten .
" It 's the epicenter up there ( in Seattle ) , " she said , " but we need the governor to understand he has more than one child .
"  Lindquist said the state wants to help more counties , but is in need of at least 100,000 swabs and viral transport media from the federal government .
The governor 's office passed off a request for comment to the Department of Health .
An emailed statement from department spokeswoman Jessica Baggett said the state health department is working " tirelessly " with the federal government to get more personal protective equipment .
Supply chain issues have begun to bubble up across the U .
Lack of test supplies and PPE appear to be next the big problem areas after faulty testing kits delayed state 's ability to test .
Drive-in clinics in Minnesota have closed because they do n't have enough test supplies , according to CNN .
South Dakota ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to temporarily stop processing tests , but has now resumed , according to a CBS affiliate in South Dakota .
Citizens upset  These shortages in Washington and across the country have manifested in frustrations on the ground .
Over the last week , The Columbian has received a handful of calls and emails from residents who feel they should be tested .
A 51-year-old Ridgefield flight attendant who believes he was exposed on a plane had to make multiple long phone calls to get tested .
A 33-year-old Vancouver woman showing COVID-19 symptoms , who works with high-risk populations , was told she was " too young " to get a test on Monday , before a doctor eventually administered a test Tuesday .
Lawrence Neville , the chief medical officer for PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center , said he shares concerns about testing , and said PeaceHealth has to be selective about testing at the moment .
" We 've had to make decisions about testing folks on a more limited basis , where we would like to open the doors to test more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing will hinder attempts to stop the virus from spreading , because many carriers of COVID-19 are not sick enough to be hospitalized .
" It 's not that people are n't getting tests , " Lindquist said .
" It 's that the limitation on supplies are hurting people who are n't the priority for who the lab wants .
"  At times , the federal government has made it sound like anyone is eligible for COVID-19 testing , Lindquist said .
It 's up to a provider 's discretion , but providers across Washington do n't have nearly enough supplies to test people who have symptoms , but are n't a high risk .
In some cases , high-risk populations such as the elderly are still waiting for tests .
" Our providers have restricted testing mostly to hospitalized patients , and it has been difficult , if not impossible , to test long-term care facility residents and other high-risk populations with COVID-19-like illness , " the mayors ' letter reads .
' Severely low ' on masks  Dr .
Alfred Seekamp , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinic is " severely low " on supplies , particularly gloves and face masks .
Vancouver Clinic can administer 50 COVID-19 tests per day right now , Seekamp said , but if staff does n't have personal protective equipment they ca n't safely test or treat patients .
Seekamp said his hospital is particularly low on N95 masks , which fit to the face and efficiently filter out airborne particles .
They are ideal for providers doing COVID-19 testing .
The CDC has recommended that providers use homemade masks such as bandanas and scarves if protective gear is unavailable .
" Right now the limiting factor is the availability of tests , but soon the limiting factor could be masks and gloves , " Seekamp said .
" We want to have enough supplies to take care of our patients , and keep our staff safe .

Cassie Gabriel , an anesthesiologist with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creek Medical Center and PeaceHealth , said medical providers are concerned about the shortage of personal protection equipment .
She said providers do n't want to contract the virus because of a shortage in PPE .
That could result in two problems : a shortage of providers because they are sick and ca n't work .
And the potential to pass the virus to patients , who are receiving treatment for another medical complication .
" Right now we are rationing , " Gabriel said .
" There are some instances where we feel like we are going to become spreaders to the people who come to see us .
We need to be protected now .
"  Legacy Health spokeswoman Vicki Guinn said Legacy Health has adequate supplies of PPE across its system , but knows a surge in patients could impact its supplies .
Melnick said Clark County 's population -- the state 's fifth-largest , behind King , Snohomish , Pierce and Spokane counties -- indicates a surge of cases could happen soon , possibly along with Spokane , which has nine confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely area where the numbers are going to increase rapidly , " Melnick said .
