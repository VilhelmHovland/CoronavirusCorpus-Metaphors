Alive from the US heart of Covid-19 , New York City  Kiwi writer and photographer Cherie Aarts Coley sent this dispatch from isolation in New York City , the US epicentre of Covid-19  I 'm not sure what day it is today , or the date .
I barely even know the month .
It does n't seem to matter any more .
Mostly all that seems to matter now is to stay sane enough so I might be of some use , somehow , to my family , my neighbours , the city I call home for now , and for my parents at home on the Coromandel .
Mostly it 's the sirens that have been pushing me over the edge .
I 'm used to hearing them two or three times a day at most - random interludes of slight annoyance between the cacophony of school children playing in nearby schoolyards , dogs barking , sassy couples arguing , or a random red Corvette blasting nineties house music and waving a Puerto Rican flag .
New York City is usually an audio-fest of brazen fun , honesty and precociousness .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant whine , with painful intermittent screaming and moaning .
NYC 's emergency calls are at 9/11 levels , and while the noise itself does n't bother me so much , what is most disturbing is the thought attached to the sound ; that in almost every single ambulance , someone is gasping for air , or experiencing heart failure ( the latest prevalent Covid-19 complication that 's turning up here ) .
We live in a small , two-bedroom apartment in an eight-floor condo building in Brooklyn that we bought 10 years ago after we moved to New York from San Francisco , where our daughter was born 16 years ago .
My partner is Canadian , I 'm a Kiwi , and our daughter is now , well and truly , a New Yorker .
When expats around the world were being asked to return " home " a few weeks ago , that put us in a bit of a quandary .
Our daughter had no desire to leave her friends , even though it increasingly appeared she would n't get to see much of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " on " and in the Eastern Time zone for , and at that time we all thought the virus would n't kill us because we were n't in the 80+ age category .
The public sentiment was also ambivalent and there was a prevailing sense that perhaps it would n't be so bad .
So we decided to stay .
I began to stock up on supplies , just in case things got bad .
I would n't exactly call it panic-buying , more like strategic purchasing .
We do n't have the space to hoard vast amounts of anything , and usually only keep a couple of rolls of toilet paper on hand and a few cans of beans .
I emptied the freezer of old bread and stuff we would never eat , and gradually began to stock it with bags of frozen veggies and fruit , and containers of homemade chilli and curry .
Then I made some room in the laundry cupboard and began stocking up with dry goods .
It was somehow compulsively satisfying .
I would come home every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my list until that list began dwindling to nothing .
My partner was still in semi-denial mode and was beginning to freak out about the food bills .
" Is this the last time ? " he 'd ask each time I 'd arrive back from the supermarket .
Then things began to change .
Our daughter got sick .
She had a cough , a sore throat , and a fever .
She described her breathing as " not like normal , but not too bad .
" For five days her temperature was consistently around 102 .
F ( 39 .
I plied her with an old-fashioned herbal concoction ( hot water , lemon juice , honey , crushed raw garlic , grated ginger , turmeric , pepper and tinctures of sage and oregano oil ) .
Who knows ? It may have just been placebo but it felt good ; both for her to consume it and me to make it .
We spoke to her doctor on several occasions .
She told us to assume it was Covid-19 but , because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get tested .
They were saving those for the people beginning to turn up at the ER with more serious symptoms .
As our daughter began to recover things began to get worse around us .
We had let our neighbours know we may have a Covid case and that if we needed to leave the building to walk the dog we 'd be wearing gloves and a mask .
The building 's board organised a professional disinfection company to clean all of the common spaces and they also hired an extra cleaner to disinfect all the commonly-touched surfaces every day .
Now the smell of bleach is everywhere .
The social distancing began to set in , but belatedly and begrudgingly .
It took a real effort not to interact with our neighbours in the way we usually did , especially their children , who did n't understand why we would refuse to hold their blankies , have to stand so far away , and not let them play ball with our dog .
And it took a real effort for most New Yorkers to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home but the parks were initially packed .
It just was n't New York-style to social distance when you live in such densely-packed neighbourhoods ( nor is it Italian or Spanish-style for that matter ) .
It took the hospitals filling up , the traumatic stories to begin trickling in from the front lines , and Papa Cuomo ( the state 's governor ) telling us all off before New Yorkers finally got the message .
An empty Grand Central station .
Photo : Cherie Aarts Coley  When my partner needed to go get something from his office we used the opportunity not only to raid much-needed supplies of hand sanitiser and disinfecting wipes but also to get some pics of the city on lockdown .
We stopped using the subway weeks ago and usually walk or cycle if we need to go somewhere .
This time we took his Vespa and drove through the once-bustling , now ghostly streets of Manhattan .
There were still some people out and about but many were wearing masks and most were endeavouring to stay six feet apart from others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N-95 mask I 'd bought earlier at a hospital .
It felt good not to have those things sitting on our kitchen counter doing nothing , and despite the palpable tension , the hospital staff were grateful .
It 's been those small moments of relief of some kind that have helped to stave off the anxiety and depression .
We make a concerted effort to limit our social media time .
I cook , write , study , edit pics , chat with friends and family , bake granola , take the dog out , and meditate , but the dread , anger , exasperation and sadness are still seething under the surface , ready to burst out at any moment .
In part that 's also been because we 've begun to hear that young people are dying too .
Many people in their 20s are turning up at the ER severely ill and struggling to breathe .
It almost seems like the virus is morphing ; doubling down in its efforts to find more healthy hosts .
Cuomo has been doing a stellar job at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the masses , but he 's been facing an uphill battle , stuck between the rock of the virus ' onslaught and the hard place of federal government inaction .
That 's beginning to change , and hopefully it 'll be in time to save lives .
Just how many remains to be seen .
Antibody testing will be a game-changer , but it 's still in its infancy .
Two days ago we applied to a hospital in Manhattan doing the testing in order to provide plasma from people who have had the virus to people who are critically ill with it , in the hope that those antibodies can pass on the armour .
But while we thought our daughter might be a prime candidate , it turns out they 're currently only looking for people who were definitely tested positive and whose symptoms stopped more than 14 days ago .
That 's not her .
So , because we ca n't be certain we have n't had it , we 've been contemplating leaving .
We do n't feel confident about our capacity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the virus .
So we 're stocking up for self-isolation , and contemplating renting a car to drive up to Canada where we can stay somewhere remote for 14 days , and just " be Canadian " in the woods for a while .
Although the virus is beginning to hit Canada , there 's something deeply heartening about the thought of being somewhere relatively calm , where healthcare is well coordinated , and the government has been taking this thing seriously for a while ( we also have family there , and hopefully we 'll get to see them once the antibody testing kicks in there ) .
While it feels a little like we might be bailing on New York if we do that , we 're taking heart in the fact that in the worst case scenario , we 'd be freeing up a couple of much-needed ventilators here .
The moral of the story for my fellow Kiwis is this : do n't take this virus too lightly .
Losing a business or losing your job really sucks , I know ( I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make ends meet .
And staying home can be challenging , especially if you have kids and/or do n't have any outdoor space .
But you 'll get through this if you stay smart , stay safe , and stay healthy .
Believe me , you do n't want to experience what 's been going on here in the U .
It 's a disaster and a tragedy of epic proportions , and one that can hopefully be avoided in our South Pacific haven .
Addendum : 1 .
It appears that many New Yorkers have n't " got it " on social distancing .
Today hundreds of them flocked to see the navy hospital ship USNS dock in Manhattan .
As the Daily Mail in the UK says , " What are they thinking ? "  2 .
The numbers are changing daily ; it looks like NYC might " apex " sooner rather than later .
Experimental treatments going on during the past few days here in NYC look hopeful .
Our emotions are oscillating like the Coney Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis .
The pandemic is pushing us into an unknown and uncertain future .
As the crisis unfolds the need for accurate , balanced and thorough reporting will be vital .
