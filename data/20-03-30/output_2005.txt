Recent data by Unesco show that 363m pupils and young people are affected by the closures of schools and universities  By SM REZA YAMANI SAYED UMAR / Pic By MUHD AMIN NAHARUL  THE Malaysia government is currently implementing the Movement Control Order ( MCO ) from March 18 to April 14 , 2020 .
The purpose of this MCO is to combat the spread of coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) disease .
The MCO aims to enforce self-quarantine for all citizens and residents .
School students , who were on their one-week break which started on March 14 and supposedly to end on March 21 , 2020 , have to continue staying out of school .
The holiday period is subsequently extended after the MCO was announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin on March 16 .
Our daily lives have changed drastically within these few weeks .
The coronavirus is affecting all of us here and internationally .
Several months ago , precautionary measures were taken to curb the virus , but the spread of the virus was drastic and further actions were needed before the situation gets more serious in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing are necessary to cut down and ( eventually ) eradicate the Covid-19 spread .
These measures certainly have consequences for all citizens , especially for students .
They ca n't go back to schools , colleges and other learning institutions .
The recent data by the United Nations ' ( UN ) education agency , Unesco , showed that 363 million pupils and young people are affected by the closures of schools and universities .
Due to the MCO , some students are corresponding through the digital network or commonly known as online social network .
The online activities are not restricted for social communication and correspondences .
The use of the ICT medium for online studies , educational activities and entertainments is gaining more traction .
More schools and colleges are deploying online learning programmes and education applications , and platforms , including the use of computers and the Internet to reach students .
These digital-based learning activities would be easier for those who have access to the digital network .
About 54% of the world 's population , or 4 .
billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two out of 10 people in less-developed countries have online access according to the International Telecommunication Unions , the UN 's Internet and telecommunication agency .
It remains a challenge to bridge the " digital divide " .
It explains the gap between those who have access to computers and the Internet and those with limited or without such access .
" Digital exclusion in general reflects and entrenches broader patterns of disadvantage across age , gender , social and economic dimensions , " said Julian Thomas , a communications professor at Australia 's RMIT University .
" The cost of Internet access can be prohibitive for low-income families , and the infrastructure and services necessary for everyone to be able to use the Internet at home is unevenly distributed across urban , rural and remote areas , " he said .
Another researcher from University of Twente , the Netherlands , Jan van Dijk , categorised digital access into four types : Material , motivational , skills and usage .
The material or device access comes first as it is an essential to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of computers and Internet networks , it could be a failure in addressing modern digital technology .
The 2018 Department of Statistics Malaysia 's ( DoSM ) ICT use and access data described the current annual figures of digital usage and accessibility in the country .
It provides a clear indication of households and individual usage of digital devices and activities .
Households access to the Internet increased between 85 .
in 2017 to 87% in 2018 .
How- ever , the access to computers , as it refers to a desktop , a laptop ( portable ) computer or a tablet ( or similar handheld computer ) , decreased to 74 .
( 2017 ) to 71 .
( 2018 ) .
Furthermore , the 2018 percentage of individuals who were using computers by state and strata showed a wide disparity between urban ( 75 .
) and rural ( 54 .
) users .
Rural pupils and youths were behind in access to the latest technology and information .
The microdata depicted the age group of 15-20 years old , which are secondary schoolchildren and pupils .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during this period .
It showed that only 5%-6% of youths were able to operate computers and had the confidence to perform main computer tasks .
The rural youth , aged between 20 and 31 , lacked ICT skills to become technophobes .
This is a worrying fact .
According to Thomas , low-income families are particularly dependent on mobile devices for Internet access , which may not be suited for learning purposes .
The 2018 percentage of individuals using computer by state , type of ICT skills and strata lagged behind in nine common computer-related skills such as copying or moving a file or folder , sending an email with attached files , using basic arithmetic formulas in spreadsheet , connecting and installing new device , transferring files between a computer and other devices , writing a computer programme using a specialised programming language , and searching , downloading , installing and configuring software .
Recently , an online learning initiative for students was launched by the YTL Founda- tion , YES and FrogAsia Sdn Bhd .
This initia- tive should be applauded as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school- children and pupils .
Their parents are able to get up to five free 4G prepaid SIM cards with 40GB data from telecommunication company YES .
They are ready to be used for two months free of charge .
The government also unveiled the economic stimulus package to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic .
Internet subscribers -- prepaid and postpaid -- will get free Internet data of 1GB for two months during the MCO .
In Chapter 3 of 11th Malaysia Plan 2016- 2020 , the following strategies have also formed another inclusiveness platform in the focus area B , which is empowering communities for a productive and prosperous society .
This focus area is the establishment of family institutions and the potential of youth development .
Moreover , building human capital with knowledge and skills as well as the moral and ethics requires a lot of commitment especially to support inclusiveness and sustainable economic growth .
Consequently , in Chapter 5 , the government raised the issue of human capital development in accelerating economic growth .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages through the shift of high-skilled jobs by continuous upskilling and re-skilling initiatives .
In facilitating the application of high-tech equipment and improving technology-enabled innovations in education , the problem , project , production-based learning can develop critical , creative and innovative thinkers in the science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) subjects .
The 2017 Bank Negara Malaysia ( BNM ) Annual Report revealed that Malaysia is currently at an " adopter " stage in the global digital map .
Malaysia 's digital advancement is on a par with other progressive economies like Canada , New Zealand , Republic of Ire- land , Australia , Slovenia , Latvia and Czech Republic .
In reaching the frontrunner stage , three key structural features are needed .
The 2012 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) -PISA Results in Focus report stated that Malaysia 's score in mathematics and science was 421 and 420 respectively , which is below the OECD average scores of 496 .
According to the Education Ministry , Malaysia 's higher education institutions are going to release a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less so in STEM and technical-vocational fields between 2010 and 2025 , based on BNM Annual 2017 Report .
This development is terrifying as economic activities in the future become more digital and driven by technological innovations .
Thirdly , high digital adoption in the government and citizens -- consumers , producers and businesses .
Malaysia 's digital adoption is growing rapidly although consumer services such as Internet banking and e-commerce remain quite low .
The majority of Internet usage in Malaysia is content consumption .
The consumption of content such as social media , games and downloading movies/music is rather limited instead of productive digital tasks such as mobile applications production , content creations , learning from formal online courses and professional networking , according to the 2017 BNM Annual report and 2016 DoSM 's ICT Satellite Account .
These are the issues the country must look into to ensure Malaysia is not left behind in the digital race .
