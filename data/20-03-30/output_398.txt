This as-told-to essay is from an anonymous pregnant woman living on the West Coast with her toddler and husband .
Her husband had a mild case of the coronavirus in February after returning from a trip to Italy .
At the time , the number of reported cases in northern Italy were rising , but there were only a couple of reported cases in the province he had visited , in southern Italy .
The woman tweets from @covidwyfe .
This essay has been transcribed and edited for clarity from a conversation with science journalist Monique Brouillette .
He flew back from southern Italy and then the next day started getting some body aches , fever , and chills .
We were n't really very worried about it because no one was very worried about it at that point .
The next evening , about 24 hours after he flew back , he thought he had the flu or something and he did n't want to get us sick .
So he sanitized everything and he was wearing a mask .
The next day he , just out of an abundance of caution , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , about 36 hours later , and felt OK .
Like , if these were normal times , he probably would have gone back to work at that point , but instead he called urgent care .
They said he should get tested for the flu because of this crazy thing that 's going on in Italy .
They told him that he should go to the ER .
Which is a little bit ridiculous for someone who 's not even very sick to be going to the ER .
So he went to the ER , and they wanted to do a chest X-ray on him .
He was skeptical .
He 's a proud skeptic .
So he said , I do n't need that .
They swabbed him for flu and discharged him .
He walked to the hospital and back and they called him on his walk home and they 're like , well , the flu test is negative , so it 's probably just a cold .
A couple days later , he had a little fever come back .
So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in .
He was there for several hours getting every single other test to rule out all the other things like sepsis , and they did another chest X-ray on him , and he was clear .
At that point , the doctor said there was a 50-50 chance that he had it .
We got word that he was officially positive while my son and I were at a park .
I did a quick sanitizing wipe over everything I saw my kid touch .
I was in panic mode .
I thought : " Oh my God , I ca n't believe we went out .
We should n't have gone anywhere .
I just put all these people at risk .
" So it was kind of a panic moment .
At first , we were really pushing for me and my kid to get tested after my husband was found to be positive .
But the public health person was like , you know , if you come back positive and your son comes back negative we would have to recommend that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then someone tells you something like that .
Our son has never spent the night away from us .
So , it just was pretty upsetting .
We decided that after my husband recovered and tested negative , then my son and I could get tested .
And then if I were positive , at least one of us would be negative and be able to watch our son .
He mostly stayed in our guest bedroom .
He would come down when my kid was down for his nap .
Or when we were distracted in the other room .
We did n't really see him very much .
I would go to the guest bedroom covering my face with a scarf just to talk to him from across the room .
It was really isolating .
We did n't feel comfortable being around him or hugging him .
He wanted to hug us and he could n't even snuggle his child .
Whenever he was around us he was wearing a mask .
He was n't allowed to eat with his head pointed toward us .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sit across from each other when you eat because that 's the direction things are going to be going if something comes on your mouth .
I would basically get up in the morning and wipe down all the kitchen doorknobs , all light switches , all handles , and anything that someone would touch on a regular basis like the banister .
I just wiped it all down .
And then excessive amounts of hand-washing all day long .
I tried to keep my husband 's dirty dishes not sitting out .
Anything that he had in his mouth I would put in the dishwasher right away .
When he took a shower , I was anxious .
The virus spreads by droplets and I did n't know if the humidity from the shower would cause them to be suspended in the air column longer .
So , I was like , " When you take a shower you have to keep the door closed for a half-hour and run the fan to get all the humidity out of there and wipe everything down with bleach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job there .
It is stressful because all it takes is one slip-up -- you know , one time when you 're lazy , that 's all it takes to be exposed to it .
It is stressful because all it takes is one slip-up .
That 's all it takes to beexposed .
With my son , luckily he is really in love with his toys .
So he just wanted to play with his toys a lot .
And we have a little outdoor area where we were going and playing .
He 's in that " threenager " stage , so I was definitely getting worn out and frustrated because he 's pushing back on stuff .
And I need a break mentally too , you know .
My husband wants to participate , but he ca n't , and I want him to participate , but he ca n't .
This whole time , my kid was getting pretty clingy with me .
And it 's heartbreaking , but he 's young enough to the point that he did n't really seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then when my husband was out of isolation he was like : " Not you ! I want Mama ! " Oh , dude , I needed a break , though .
I ca n't do everything .
I was instantly wondering , how is this for pregnant people ? If he had gotten really sick , then it could have been bad for me and my unborn child , but looking at the data that were available at the time younger people were n't really getting severe cases of it and people without comorbidities were n't really getting it .
It was comforting to see those numbers out of China .
And those early days and even since then , there was n't a lot of research that had been done , but I got overloaded and even looking at my phone would give me anxiety .
It 's really emotionally isolating .
Unfortunately , more people are going to understand what you 're going through .
But chances are , not that many people in your daily life are going to be able to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and very isolating while it was happening .
But it was n't really that long altogether , maybe two weeks .
At the end he had a tiny little cough and when the cough went away , I was allowing him to sit in the living room and observe .
It was sad .
He was getting so emotional just to be able to hang out with family and see his kid play , because he had n't been able to .
What I 'm realizing is this is what a lot of health care workers are doing right now .
They 're isolating themselves preemptively .
How long are they going to live like that ? It is rough , you know ? Ours had an endpoint because the virus ran its course .
But , for people who are on the front lines of this , when is the end ? .
