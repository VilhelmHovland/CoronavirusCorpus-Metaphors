Dalhousie research team prepares for clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine  A Dalhousie University researcher at the forefront of Canada 's quest to find a treatment for COVID-19 says human trials for a promising new vaccine could be only weeks away .
Dalhousie 's COVID-19 rapid response team is moving forward with testing a vaccine that uses a genome of DNA from SARS CoV-2 , the virus that causes COVID-19 .
" We 're beginning to evaluate this in animal models and we can even bring this into people for Phase 1 clinical trials as soon as three weeks from now , " virologist Alyson Kelvin told CBC 's Information Morning on Wednesday .
" Right now , DNA vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in people , so we hope that this will help expedite the process of vaccine development .
"  But Kelvin , an assistant professor in Dalhousie 's department of microbiology and immunology , also cautioned that it typically takes a year for vaccines to be developed , tested and distributed to the general public .
Liam Richards/The Canadian Press  " We 're working as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , " she said .
" We have other vaccines in the pipeline in case this is n't the best vaccine that we can put forth .
"  Kelvin said she hopes to get an effective vaccine out to people by the time COVID-19 returns .
" There 's a possibility that we could start seeing it causing seasonal infections and disease as we do with influenza virus .
If this is the case , we 'll have this vaccine ready for when the virus comes back , " Kelvin said .
In the meantime , stay home  As researchers spend long days in the lab , Nova Scotians can help by following the advice public health officials have been saying from the beginning , Kelvin said .
