Cutting Through the Jargon : How the CARES Act Works for Nonprofits  Last Friday , the House passed the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act and the President signed it into law .
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle already are talking about yet another major coronavirus response package .
Let 's set that aside for today and focus instead on some key elements of the CARES Act for nonprofits .
As noted in last week 's article , " How Nonprofits Can Utilize the New Federal Laws Dealing with COVID-19 , " the new massive piece of legislation contains many provisions of interest to charitable nonprofits , some of sector-wide import and others to specific subsectors ( such as emergency funding for cultural organizations , higher education , and community health centers ) .
Embedded within the CARES Act are three distinct loan programs that charitable nonprofits can tap to get cash to retain or rehire staff , meet operating costs , and , thus , advance their missions .
The following summaries provide high-level overviews before you dive deep into the details .
The Paycheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SBA 's longstanding 7(a) loan process , but with significant enhancements that will assist nonprofits .
The new loan program enables charitable nonprofits and for-profit entities with 500 or fewer employees to secure funds to pay staff and operating costs for two months .
Follow the rules carefully , and the loans will be forgiven in whole or in part .
Because this new program is being built on the SBA 's popular 7(a) process , which is run through about 1,800 local lending institutions ( and efforts are underway to expand that number ) , the learning curve for private bankers should not be too steep ( we hope ) .
Still , the SBA has until April 11 to announce its guidance , so it will take a little while before employers can apply for these loans .
Congress appropriated $349 billion for this program .
The Expanded Economic Injury Disaster Loan ( EIDL ) &amp; Emergency Grants ( SBA 7(b) Loans ) applies looser credit standards than the EIDL has had in place and creates a rapid grant procedure that could put $10,000 in a nonprofit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses .
Not every charitable organization qualifies for the EIDL program , but it 's a valid option for many .
The CARES Act set aside $10 billion total for the coronavirus disaster EIDL .
A promised Mid-Size Loan Program may be right for nonprofit and other entities with between 500 and 10,000 employees .
It 's designed to help ensure organizations can retain at least 90 percent of their workforces .
But it still needs to be designed and built out , meaning it will take longer to access this program than the other two .
