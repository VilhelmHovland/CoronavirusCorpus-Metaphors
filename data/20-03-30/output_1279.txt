For at least the next three weeks in the UK , we are subject to the most stringent restrictions on movement that we have experienced in peacetime and the current situation brings particular challenges for separated parents .
Last weekend , Cafcass ( the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service , which represents children in family court cases ) published some welcome COVID-19 guidance for separated parents , which now needs to be read in light of the government 's latest restrictions .
Below we address some issues that we are seeing arise for separated parents in the current crisis .
It helps to remember that the guiding principle is to make decisions that are in the child 's best interests , balancing that with any risks to other people in this pandemic .
DO EXISTING COURT ORDERS NEED TO BE FOLLOWED ?  The President of the Family Division , Sir Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those who have children arrangements orders from the family court and I would urge every parent who has to navigate child arrangements with the other parent to read it as a priority .
Cafcass ' guidance is that parents should still try to comply with the court order , unless it would put the health of the child or others at risk if you were to do so .
This is unchartered territory and parents will have to use their judgement and hopefully work together to agree what should happen over this next three week period .
Official restrictions due to COVID-19 mean that travel to visit a parent living far away or abroad may no longer be possible .
Other difficulties arise where one parent 's time with their child is supervised , or handovers can not take place between parents due to previous allegations of domestic violence for example .
The current pandemic is unsettling for children and further changes in their lives and daily routine can exacerbate this .
Accordingly , if you have to make changes to your child 's usual time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the reason for the change to your child and vital to allow your child to keep in touch with the other parent , for example through telephone calls and live video platforms and apps such as FaceTime , WhatsApp , Skype , Zoom or Houseparty .
Throughout this blog I refer to the parents trying to agree arrangements between themselves .
I appreciate that this is not always possible or permitted .
If you can not speak to the other parent , see if a third party such as a mutual friend or neutral person can help you to discuss the arrangements .
Apps such as Our Family Wizard that allow parents to communicate through software can also help .
Alternatively , arrangements can be agreed via family mediation or in family therapy , which is available remotely and can be very helpful .
In the longer term , arbitration could assist .
These are unprecedented times and parents need to try to agree on what is best for their child , bearing in mind that children will be feeling anxious during this time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree new arrangements for the next three weeks or on the other hand you and your child might find comfort in the existing routine .
HOW CAN WE KEEP IN TOUCH REMOTELY ?  We are fortunate that today it is relatively easy to keep in touch with each other without leaving the home .
Now is the time to try the above mentioned video calling apps to help your child keep in touch with the other parent on a regular basis .
This will help to reassure the child and the other parent that the other is safe and well .
The other parent and the child can even watch films together through apps such as Netflix party .
Although many parks are now closed and playgrounds are out of bounds , the government guidelines still allow one period of exercise a day between members of the same household .
As long as it 's safe and practical to do so , perhaps the child can go for a walk with the other parent .
You may already have an agreement as to what the arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this out for you .
If these arrangements suit you better than the term time arrangements , then you could suggest that you change to the holiday arrangements , if this is suitable for your and the other parent 's situation .
Parents will have to use their own judgement but if the child moves to another household where someone falls ill with suspected COVID-19 symptoms , that household will then have to self-isolate and so it would seem sensible for the child to remain there for the duration of the self-isolation , assuming they are well enough to care for the child .
It would also be sensible to ensure that both houses are as properly equipped for the child , as far as possible , in case the child has to stay there for longer than usual .
In such a situation , parents will have to use their judgement and discuss arrangements that will be in the best interest of the child .
I HAVE A COURT HEARING IN A FEW WEEKS -- WILL IT STILL GO AHEAD ?  The detailed guidance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings in family law cases will be the default position .
If one or more of the parents in the case is legally represented , the applicant or the first represented party will be responsible for making the arrangements for the remote hearing .
If neither parent has a legal representative , the court office will contact the parents to explain that the hearing will be held remotely and with the details for doing this .
IS CAFCASS STILL OPERATING ?  Yes , Cafcass are currently operating remotely and continuing to represent children in family court cases .
WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO TALK TO MY CHILD ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ?  There is a wealth of resources out there providing guidance about how best to talk to children about coronavirus to keep them informed while reducing anxiety .
We have listed some of these resources below :  Please note that the general guidance provided within this blog is accurate at the time of writing ( 24/3 ) .
It does not constitute legal advice and specialist advice should be sought in individual circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during these unprecedented times , please contact our team of family and divorce lawyers , who have longstanding experience in resolving disputes around child arrangements and co-parenting and who understand the pressures this can put on all parties involved .
