Telangana , Karnataka govt also lists essential commodities  States and UTs order complete lockdown  Sanitary napkins and several other hygiene products are not clearly listed under essential goods and this will cause problems in their supply across the country .
Because of big players like Amazon , Flipkart etc unable to carry on with their operations everywhere ; users will not have access to these .
Also , these big players are not able to pick up sanitary napkins due to a lack of clarity on sanitary napkins being an essential commodity .
It should be noted that Telangana and Karnataka governments have listed these as essential commodities ; the Central Govt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women around the country need these and if their supply chain is n't smooth ; it will lead to making these women devoid of basic and important hygiene .
