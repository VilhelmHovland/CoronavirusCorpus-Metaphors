When I first heard " New York 93 , " by the Korean-American d .
and producer Yaeji , it felt like something I 'd waited for my whole life , only I 'd never known to want it .
The track , released by Godmode Records in 2016 , begins with the faint outlines of a house tune -- an echo of an echo , as synth pulses , bass kicks , and occasional drip-drops all hint at a euphoric anthem that takes its sweet time to peak .
Yaeji whispers softly over the track , humming a singsong of English and Korean , as though she 's beckoning you closer to tell a secret .
By the time that tambourines arrive , snapping everything into place , you 're like confidants .
And then it abruptly comes to a close .
Much of the way in which we hear the world derives from how we grew up .
Listening to Yaeji , I realized that the rhythms and cadences of various Asian languages , spoken at home or in friends ' houses , at restaurants or on Asian TV stations , were part of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I occasionally tried to tune out .
But they conveyed feelings and formalities , expressions of affection and angst , that did n't always translate perfectly into English -- the seemingly mellow , nagging lilt of Mandarin , for example , might actually communicate desperate yearning .
These different emotional registers have become more familiar to us all .
As K-pop becomes a global force , it trains listeners from around the world in how to hear anew .
You do n't need to understand Korean to luxuriate in the music 's extravagant approach to melodrama , the liberating effects of the ecstatic and the garish .
Yaeji , whose real name is Kathy Lee , was born in Queens in 1993 .
Her family moved to Long Island , and then to Atlanta , before settling in South Korea .
In 2011 , she returned to the United States to study at Carnegie Mellon , where she became immersed in dance music .
She began making tracks and d .
' ing for the college radio station , occasionally uploading songs to SoundCloud .
She followed " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleshed out her cute , almost miniaturized fusion of vocal house and Asian pop .
She covered Drake 's house-tinged R .
&amp; B .
hit " Passionfruit , " replacing the original 's wounded machismo with a kind of tender resilience .
As increasingly happens these days , she moved relatively quickly from posting music for free online to playing festivals such as Coachella .
Her songs continued to toggle between moments of twee intimacy and the collectivizing throb of the dance floor .
" Raingurl , " a track from 2017 , alternates between soupy house rhythms and ethereal synths , as Yaeji describes timidly walking into the club : " Mother Russia in my cup / And my glasses fogging up / Oh yeah , hey dawg , hey , what 's up .
"  The mixtape " What We Drew ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , " which comes out this week , is her first release on XL Recordings .
" Thanks to the ones that walk alongside me / I can continue on , " she sings in Korean on the title track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her voice than on her early songs , which often evoked a fuzzy , A .
feeling .
" The things I drew , " she continues , " I 've created that world / With the people I love .
"  It was n't until Yaeji began getting acclaim in the Korean press that her parents , who live in Seoul , truly understood what she did .
Her success has brought her around the world , and the effects are apparent on " What We Drew ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , " which is full of new collaborations with artists from the United States and Asia .
" Money Ca n't Buy , " featuring the Brooklyn rapper Nappy Nina , is like a hip-hop track put together on an assembly line , all bleeps , drill sounds , and sprays of machine exhaust .
" Sit in a circle and look at each other and reminisce how we got to meet each other / Laugh with each other and show one another what it 's like to share love with each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketchbook quality to " What We Drew ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , " straying from the straight-ahead house rhythms of her initial singles .
The electro-thump of " In the Mirror ? ? " moves toward moody , headbanging territory ; " These Days ? ? " is like an excursion into dub-jazz , an unravelling steady beat serenaded by a distant , almost ghostly saxophone .
Other tracks can feel frivolous , as if she were pressing Record simply to capture a fleeting moment .
On " Free Interlude , " the rappers Lil Fayo , Trenchcoat , and Sweet Pea trade somewhat nonsensical verses .
( " A church has a steeple / I like all sorts of people / Every type of person / Dimples , I have several .
" ) It sounds as though you 've arrived too late to share in the joke .
I first heard Yaeji in 2016 , during a time when going outside , let alone going out , was still a matter of personal choice .
Her songs , slipstreams of language and feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I initially mistook the title " New York 93 " for some nostalgic tip of the hat to a golden age of the city 's hip-hop and club scenes ; in fact , it is simply the place and year of her birth .
Musical revolutions are experienced anew each time young people happen across something they have n't heard before .
Last fall , Yaeji threw a party that she called " Elancia , " an attempt to recall the days when she began raving in New York , in the early part of the past decade -- many years after what people often presume to be the city 's creative peak .
It 's easy to get hung up on whether a sound or a style is truly original -- or whether the brash new generation just suffers from historical amnesia .
Yet the original part , the feeling that propels young artists forward , is that of discovery .
It 's been odd to listen to " What We Drew ? ? ? ? ? ? ? " in the past couple of weeks , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's music is about the opposite of " social distancing " : going out , idly basking in the brilliance of your friends , sweating alongside strangers .
In our lowest moments , the thing that makes life meaningful is the realization that those who came before us found meaning , and endured .
For many , that idea becomes clearest in the presence of others .
Yaeji 's music has always been about communion and friendship , portals into other possible time lines around the globe .
And that 's precisely what makes it such a tease right now .
" What We Drew ? ? ? ? ? ? ? " is a collection of drafts and sketches , glimpses into a career on the go .
But , for the time being , none of us is going anywhere .
Listening to music has n't brought me much comfort lately , because it reminds me that the past seems impossibly far away , and the future promises only uncertainty .
Being present is no longer a choice , the stuff of meditation or wellness .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week , the highs somehow felt higher , and the silly parts seemed even sillier .
" Introverse from an introvert , " G .
raps on " Spell ? ? , " which feels like a scaled-down K-pop anthem ; it gets funnier the more I listen to it .
The lush synths that announce " My Imagination ? ? " sound even dreamier .
" What I wan na do / Eat rice and soup , " Yaeji raps in Korean on " Money Ca n't Buy .
" " What I wan na have / Money ca n't buy .
"  When you engage with art or music , you are exploring someone else 's imagination .
It 's never yours , even if you 're the one who made it .
It 's a gift , a secret that 's passed among those who care , changing the texture of existence , maybe in minuscule ways .
There 's nothing better than listening to music with strangers -- dancing , sharing amazement , scanning faces to see if you 're the only one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same .
For now , these songs by a young Korean-American woman telling us about the world she sees -- a world brought into being with friends , goofing around in a studio or sweating together on a dance floor -- are about some bygone way of life , or simply a reminder of what awaits , as long as you can wait .
