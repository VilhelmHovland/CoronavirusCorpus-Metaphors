As pregnant women and their doctors consider how the COVID-19 epidemic is affecting pregnancy and care , maternity wards across the country are changing policies on deliveries and visitors .
RACHEL MARTIN , HOST :  So we are hearing so many stories about hospitals in this country that are simply overwhelmed by coronavirus cases .
And there are , of course , patients with other urgent needs - pregnant women , for example , who now face the possibility of delivering babies in hospitals that are filled with COVID-19 patients .
And the plans that they have made for where to give birth and who will be with them , those are all now in question .
Here 's NPR 's Sacha Pfeiffer .
SACHA PFEIFFER , BYLINE : At Lauren and Daniel Herriges ' house in Sarasota , Fla .
, they 've been doing some redecorating .
LAUREN HERRIGES : This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
So we have our changing table and our crib , a little dresser and all the cute art we could find laying around ( laughter ) .
PFEIFFER : They 're getting ready for their first child , a daughter , due April 3 .
For assistance during childbirth , they hired a doula , a support person who helps laboring women .
But they recently got crushing news .
To reduce the risk of coronavirus , Sarasota Memorial Hospital is limiting delivery room visitors to just one person .
HERRIGES : So that 's a bit gut-wrenching because I like my doula and would n't have gotten one if I did n't think it would be very helpful .
PFEIFFER : Then Herriges got an even more startling update .
HERRIGES : That I should be prepared to not be permitted to have any support person at all , so no husband , which has really kind of rocked my world .
PFEIFFER : So Herriges is now considering being induced early , but her doctor says it 's safer to wait .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different hospital with an unfamiliar doctor ?  HERRIGES : Or do we suck it up and stick with the same practitioner I 've been with for years but then maybe not have my husband ? That 's one we 're still kind of trying to figure out .
And we 're running out of time ( laughter ) .
PFEIFFER : Many pregnant women are having similar debates and wondering how else the disease could affect their babies .
Limited research suggests COVID-19 can not be transmitted during childbirth or breastfeeding .
There also does n't seem to be evidence you 're more likely to get the virus if you 're pregnant .
Still , the preliminary studies are sometimes conflicting .
And pregnant women are considered an at-risk population for COVID-19 because they 're generally at higher risk for respiratory infections , so numerous hospitals nationwide told NPR they 're minimizing childbirth visitors and doing more prenatal visits by phone , as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists .
The organization is not advising early deliveries solely due to the coronavirus , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that option to some women at least 39 weeks pregnant .
LAURA FRANCE : To try to have women come in and be delivered and go home again before we really started to see a surge of COVID-positive women in our maternity units .
PFEIFFER : Dr .
Laura France is an OB-GYN at Fairview .
She said some worried pregnant women are debating whether to give birth at home or in a birthing center .
But she considers hospitals safer , even if visitors will be limited .
FRANCE : This is really a time to let technology be your friend .
One of the patients up on the maternity unit today is Skyping with her doula .
And that 's been a big push with a lot of the doulas .
PFEIFFER : Sarah Laskow is checking on her newborn at home in Brooklyn .
Seven-pound , 7-ounce Miriam Louise was born March 22 at NYU Langone in Manhattan .
LASKOW : While I was having contractions , we were seeing all these emails of other frantic parents-to-be , who , all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably were going to have to deliver the baby alone .
PFEIFFER : That 's because some New York hospitals told pregnant women they could n't have any support person during childbirth .
Laskow 's husband was with her , and the state has since prohibited that policy .
As they now shelter in place in Brooklyn , Laskow and her husband feel lucky .
LASKOW : We 're , like , kind of convinced that she 's maybe a little bit psychic ' cause she came right on time .
PFEIFFER : Actually , their baby was n't on time .
She was born two weeks early .
LASKOW : Well , she came right on time for the circumstances that she was born into .
