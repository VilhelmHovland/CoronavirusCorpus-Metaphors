LAHORE : Leading businessmen and economists believe Pakistan is moving from stagflation to recession amid the coronavirus ( COVID- 19 ) pandemic in the country .
Talking to Pakistan Today , leading industrialist Waleed Tariq Saigol said the country is headed towards a recession owing to the unprecedented disruption caused by the virus .
" The world has taken measures to survive for 2-3 months in the current lockdown mode .
Anything longer or a second wave of infection would send things into a further tailspin .
This will be catastrophic for the global economy as well as for emerging markets like Pakistan .
Exports , remittances , jobs etc .
will all be badly hit , " he feared .
The industrialist believed that a global recession right now is a nightmare scenario for emerging market economies , as these are highly dependent on developed markets for capital inflows .
Meanwhile , economic expert and tax consultant Dr Ikramul Haq believed that the country is already in recession following a long period of stagflation .
" Even before the coronavirus outbreak , the economy had fallen due to onerous taxation , high interest rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( IMF ) programme , " he maintained .
Dr Haq explained that technically , a temporary recession is defined as a period of economic decline during which trade and industrial activities are reduced , generally identified by a fall in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in two successful quarters .
" Our economy has been contracting for the past several months .
After the imposition of lockdowns , we are in deep recession .
"  Dr Haq suggested that if the government wants to avoid further stagnation after lockdowns , Prime Minister Imran Khan must announce a comprehensive relief plan for real estate , housing and construction sectors .
" These sectors should be given at least a 10-year tax holiday .
"  He continued that the said relaxation is of utmost importance as over 40 industries are linked to the construction industry , adding that time is appropriate for the government to provide the real estate sector with a much-needed boost .
" The construction industry in return must provide complete social protection and universal entitlements to their workers as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully documents its affairs .
"  He said that no protection should be given to any kind of tainted money .
Agreeing with them , Ghazanfar Azzam , President and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) at Mobilink Microfinance Bank , said not just Pakistan , the world economy as a whole has already entered into one of the most severe recessions ever experienced .
Azzam feared that each and every day would bring new challenges in terms of job losses , falling production , declining trade , collapsing healthcare and food security .
" We need to implement better discipline , ensure social distancing , and seal our borders till the pandemic is over .
At the moment , the focus should be to save people from disease and hunger .
"  Adviser to Punjab Chief Minister and seasoned economist Dr Salman Shah also feared that the lockdown of factories would lead to a collapse in jobs , income and consumption .
" The economy will move into a dangerous imbalance of demand and supply .
"  Talking to this scribe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ejaz said the government needs to spend on the health sector and also need to draft policy to help the private sector retain jobs .
Otherwise , as highlighted by PM Imran , the impact on jobs would be bigger than the health crisis , Ejaz feared .
Economist Hina Ayra said the only realistic response is a lockdown with complete focus on the supply of essential items .
She said that the poor should be given maximum financial support either in the form of cash or ration to avoid social disorder , and that the hospitals should be stocked with all necessary medicines along with helping doctors and paramedics .
SCS Securities CEO Naushad Chamdia noted that as per the IMF , Pakistan is already in recession .
" This virus will bring the whole world economy down .
Many economists see China as a world superpower as we come out of this crisis , " Chamdia predicted .
" The only positive I see for Pakistan is that we are one of the closest allies of China , which could be beneficial for us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the State Bank of Pakistan 's Monetary Policy Committee ( MPC ) said that the public is clamouring for a rate cut , but it would be a wrong move .
He said that the rates have already been cut dangerously low -- discount rate is like an elephant gun which has massive impact throughout the economy on exchange rate , FX reserves , liquidity ratios at banks , government budget deficits etc .
" To handle Covid-19 , we need precise measures aimed at tackling the problems created by this emerging crisis -- there is no ' one shot cures all ' approach , " he maintained .
