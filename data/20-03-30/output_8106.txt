Every other business has been open for a while generating revenues and been able to build some capital over time , and then they got hit with this coronavirus pandemic , " Horvath said .
" Us on the other hand , we built a brand new building from the ground up .
so it 's a very unique situation for us because we 've spent the last year building the place and the day we were going to open , they shut us down .
"  So their team changed their business model , now selling craft beer , wine , coffee and food through their drive through .
On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company temporarily closed its doors the same week of its one year anniversary .
" It was heartbreaking honestly .

We ca n't just flip a light switch on and open up Papa Boo 's , " Craiglow said .
" We have to have the ability to bring employees in , training them to provide our customers with a service .
"  He too expressed concern about the virus and orders lingering into the warmer months .
He explained their employees were ready to go in March , so depending on how far into summer it reaches , it will become increasingly difficult to " round the troops up and get everybody trained .
"  Although Papa Boo 's has never been used as a pickup or delivery location , Craiglow said they may have to look at that possibility eventually .

" One word comes to mind and that 's community .
The community in the area we 're in right now , is stronger than any community I 've ever experienced in business , " Craiglow said .
" They support us tremendously .
That 's how we got through the dam project and I know that 's how we 're going to get through this predicament as well .

"  The businesses also discussed ways the community can help local businesses survive during this time period .
Horvath suggested the best thing people can do is buy a gift card from local businesses and use it later .
He explained businesses receive 97% of proceeds from the gift card , which will help them stay afloat until the orders are lifted .
He also said the next best thing is for the community to make them part of their routine .
" Consistency is the name of the game here , " he said .
" As long as people keep coming through and buying something , we 'll be fine .
"  Craiglow said the community needs to take care of each other and care for the businesses that are open right now .

" When it 's time to get back out there and hang out with our friends , come out to the Lake and patronize these businesses that have been hit so hard .
"  Although Hawk seemed disheartened the pandemic hit during the area 's slowest point of the year , she said she hoped the ban would be lifted around when boating season begins .
She 's also been given hope by the community 's response to it .
" Through all this sadness of the closure of the business , my heart is so warm and humbled by the support of the community , " she said .
" It gives you that silver lining that everything 's going to be OK .
