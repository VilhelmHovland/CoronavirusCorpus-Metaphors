The recent spread of coronavirus ( also known as COVID-19 ) has not only endangered health and safety worldwide , but has also disrupted the economy across the globe .
The coronavirus , which originated in Wuhan ( China ) , has now moved explosively through 177 countries impacting more than 600,000 people who have tested positive for the virus .
Some immediate actions initiated by the countries include imposing complete lockdown ( but for essential services ) , suspension of international flights , closing international borders and ports .
As a result of these restrictions , there is an adverse impact on the economy , meltdown in capital markets , soaring unemployment and large scale reverse migration of labour .
India 's solar power sector would not be immune to such impact and these restrictions may impede India 's push to increase its renewable capacity to 175 GW by 2022 .
India is heavily dependent on China to supply around 80 percent of the solar modules it needs to achieve its expansive clean energy goals .
The impact of coronavirus coupled with the Chinese New Year has already hampered the production since the factories are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the quarantine restrictions and complete lockdown in India , the transport companies are finding it difficult to transport the supplies to project sites .
Further , the Transmission Utilities equally depend upon supply from China , which threatens to delay the completion of the evacuation facilities and consequentially connectivity with the grid .
Considering the present economic scenario , the financial institutions may find it difficult to fund renewable projects .
Thus , the threat to some projects becoming NPAs also looms large .
A recent CRISIL report suggests that over 3 GW of solar projects under construction ( worth Rs .
16,000 crore ) could get impacted ( due to delay in commissioning ) on account of the present situation .
However , it appears that this study does not take into account the impact of additional payment of infrastructure usage charges , delay in constructing evacuation infrastructure , need for additional capital infusion , etc .
Due to the unforeseen and unprecedented impact of the pandemic , at the moment , it is difficult to accurately assess the direct and ancillary impact of coronavirus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to evaluate the remedies available to developers to abate the impact of the pandemic .
Commercial contracts , including Power Purchase Agreements ( PPAs ) , invariably contain various risk allocation clauses such as Force Majeure provision .
A fundamental difference between the Doctrine of Frustration and Force Majeure is that the former brings the contract to an end ( in cases of impossibility ) whereas Force Majeure clauses provide freedom to parties to alter , suspend , or discharge its performance of the contract on occurrence of events specified therein .
As the definition of Force Majeure is neither judicially determined nor statutorily prescribed , the scope and impact of Force Majeure clauses will have to be assessed on a case-to-case basis .
Normally , Indian Courts resort to strict interpretation of the risk allocation clauses .
It is therefore vital for the developers to study these clauses closely for the risks , obligations , and solutions they offer in light of the current disruption .
The developers may also evaluate invoking the regulatory powers of the Commissions to reduce the adverse financial impact .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Renewable Energy ( " MNRE " ) issued an Office Memorandum stating that " delay on account of disruption of the supply chains due to spread of Coronavirus in China or any other country is to be treated as Force Majeure " .
However , this Memo leaves much to be desired when it comes to ensuring utilities/ regulators implementing the same .
Currently , most standard Force Majeure Clauses , are restrictive and do not cover natural calamities as Force Majeure .
Also , past experience has shown that **28;2949;TOOLONG issued by the Union Government have not always been implemented by the State Utilities .
While an accurate assessment of the impact of coronavirus on the solar energy sector is in the balance , it will be interesting to see whether the not-too-distant future is marked with pandemonium over the pandemic or witnesses an evolution of regulatory jurisprudence .
