Will die of hunger before any disease , say migrant workers  Posted by Sana Sikander Updated : March 29 , 2020 , 3:16 pm IST  Representational Image  New Delhi : " We will die of hunger before any disease if we stay here .
There is no one to even take care of our cremation , " says migrant worker Savitri , who set on foot for her home in Uttar Pradesh 's Kannauj district amid the coronavirus lockdown even though her destination is over 400 km away .
Savitri ( 30 ) , who lived in a slum in Rajouri Garden area , had no option but to undertake the arduous trek as the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic left her jobless and with no means to arrange food for her two small children .
" People are talking about the danger of some virus which can kill all of us .
I do n't understand all these .
As a mother , I am pained when I can not feed my children .
No one is there to help .
All are equally worried about their lives , " Savitri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying her belongings on her head .
She is among lakhs of migrant labourers who have only one goal ahead : reach their villages at the earliest , come what may .
Though the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh governments have arranged buses to ferry those stranded , many have chosen to walk along .
The few buses which were arranged were completely crammed with many people sitting atop them too .
The panicked workers are rushing to their native places even thought shelters are being set up for them in the national capital to stop the mass exodus .
For these workers , the stress of lockdown has overtaken the fear of the disease so much so that they are not taking preventive measures like maintaining social distancing , wearing masks and washing hands regularly to protect themselves from possible infection .
Ashok ( 25 ) , a construction labourer living in Ismailpur near Badarpur border , has a backpack with bare essential items and is bound for his hometown in Hardoi district .
He has his identity card ready in case police stop him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach home , he said , " I do n't know , but I have no other choice .
I can not die here alone .
I am jobless and do n't have savings to sustain .
Better I go home and do farming .
If I am lucky , I will survive .
"  Mahesh , another daily wager working with the Public Works Department ( PWD ) , is determined to go back with his family and relatives to their native village in Jhansi district and has began their 440-km-long journey on foot .
