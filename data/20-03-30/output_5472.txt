On Monday , Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg revealed details of the new JobKeeper payments , which will start flowing to eligible employers and employees from the first week of May .
Sole traders and self-employed people are included in this group of eligible employers , in a move that has been welcomed by small business and family enterprise ombudsman Kate Carnell , who said the payments will play a " crucial role " in supporting small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic .
" Crucially , it will allow small businesses to continue trading and paying their staff , " she said in a statement .
" It will also ensure small businesses stay connected with their staff , who have been stood down , so they can re-engage their team when trading conditions return to normal .

"  So how will the payments work for sole traders ? SmartCompany has pulled together some answers to your questions .
Are sole traders and self-employed people eligible for JobKeeper payments ?  Yes .
Sole traders that have seen the revenue from their business affected by COVID-19 are eligible to receive the JobKeeper payments .
What if I am a sole trader with no employees , can I still get the JobKeeper payment ?  Yes , both sole traders who employ people , and those who do not , can access these payments .
Provided they met the eligibility criteria ( see below ) , sole traders will receive $1,500 per fortnight , before tax , per eligible employee , which can also include themselves if they are self-employed .
The payments will be for a maximum of six months , starting from March 30 .

Sole traders will be eligible for the JobKeeper payments if their business has a turnover of less than $1 billion and their turnover is expected to be reduced by more than 30% as a result of COVID-19 , compared to " a comparable period a year ago , of at least a month " .
Businesses that have annual turnover of $1 billion or more , and which expect their turnover to be reduced by 50% or more , will also be eligible for the payments .
For sole traders that have employees , payments will be available for each eligible employee that was on their books as of March 1 , 2020 , and continues to be " engaged " by the sole trader .
This includes part-time and stood-down employees .
Casual employees will also be eligible if they have been with the same employer on a regular basis for at least 12 months .
To be eligible , employees must also be an Australian citizen , or they must hold a visa that would allow them to access other government payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to provide to the ATO ?  Business owners will need to provide an ABN , nominate an individual 's tax file number , and provide a declaration of recent business activity .
Payments will then be made to the individual 's bank account .

If the sole trader is receiving payments for eligible employees , they will then need to use the payments to pay their employees ' wages .
If an employee usually receives more than $1,500 per fortnight before tax , they will continue to do so , and the JobKeeper payment would be used by the employer to subsidise these amounts .

According to Treasury , it will be up to individual employers whether they chose to pay superannuation on additional wages available through the JobKeeper payments .
Can I still access other government payments , such as the JobSeeker payment and rent assistance , if I receive the JobKeeper payment ?  The government has temporarily opened up the eligibility criteria for the JobSeeker payment so that more sole traders can access those payments .
However , accessing the JobKeeper payment as a non-employing sole trader may change your eligibility for other government payments , as the income from the JobKeeper payment will need to be reported as such .
What happens if I am a sole trader who previously had employees but I had to let them go because of COVID-19 ?  If you stood down workers before yesterday 's announcement , and they worked for your business as of March 1 , you will still be able to access the JobKeeper payments for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria .
What about if I operate my business through a partnership or a trust ?  According to a statement from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Monday , Australian businesses that are structured as companies , partnerships , trusts and sole traders are all eligible for the scheme , as are not-for-profit entities and charities .
Sole traders that have seen a reduction in their income may also be able to access their superannuation , and sole traders are also included in the list of eligible businesses for the government 's coronavirus SME guarantee scheme for loans .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses .
So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ? .
