Fear and anger on the frontlines : What happens if there are n't enough masks ?  The trauma bay is photographed during simulation training at St .
Michael 's Hospital in Toronto on Aug .
13 , 2019 ( CP/ Tijana Martin )  Frightened and angry doctors are talking frankly about walking off the job if they do n't have the proper protective equipment to treat coronavirus patients without risking infecting themselves .
As officials brace for a fresh wave of COVID-19 patients entering hospitals this week and hospitals ration face masks , doctors are having blunt conversations .
" The stories that are coming out of hospitals are pretty dire , " said Ottawa general practitioner Britt Harrison in a telephone interview .
" People are threatening to stop working because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen what has happened in Italy .
"  On Friday the Italian association representing doctors announced that 51 Italian doctors have lost their lives fighting the disease , among an estimated 6,414 health workers who have been infected globally .
Last week , Montreal 's public health officer announced that 31 health workers in Montreal have contracted the disease .
After an outbreak at a nursing home in Bobcaygeon , Ont .
, 24 staff members have tested positive .
Canadian health workers know that as they brace for a larger wave of patients in emergency rooms across Canada , they face real peril .
They are updating their wills , discussing end-of-life care with family members and isolating themselves from loved ones to avoid bringing the disease home .
" I 'm a little apprehensive about every shift , " said an Ontario emergency room doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity because her hospital has asked doctors not to speak to the media .
" Am I going to contract this ? Am I going to make an error in my personal protective equipment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment I feel I do n't have personal protective equipment I 'm going to walk out .
"  Melissa Forbes Flint , an anesthesiologist at Almonte General Hospital , is mentally preparing herself for the high-risk intubation of coronavirus patients , which produces clouds of infectious particles .
" I am fully prepared to refuse work that puts me directly in harm 's way , " she said in a telephone interview on Monday .
" I am thoroughly prepared to intubate corvid patients and be on the front line .
I am 100 per cent ready to do that , and I will do that , but I expect that my province and my country will provide gear that is most recommended in order to prevent me from getting ill .
"  Melissa Forbes Flint , an anesthesiologist from Almonte , Ont .
, is ready to intubate coronavirus patients , but is prepared to walk if she does n't have proper gear ( Photo from her Facebook page )  In messages in doctors-only private Facebook groups shared with Maclean 's , doctors discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right gear .
They are angry and frightened .
They describe conflicts within teams over the distribution of scarce masks .
They are suspicious of the advice they are getting from public health authorities .
The authority that oversees Hamlton 's hospitals , for instance , sent out a notice on Friday asking all staff to wear masks until they are " grossly soiled or wet .
"  The main problem is a shortage of N95 masks , which filter for particles more effectively than simple surgical masks .
Many N95s are produced in China , where demand has been skyrocketing and where factories have been forced to shut down .
Canadian stockpiles were allowed to expire .
Canadian hospital administrators are afraid there may not be enough to go around if Canadian cases mount at the same rate as they have in other countries , and so they are restricting them , directing health-care workers to use them in only the riskiest situations , such as intubations , when patients are put on ventilators .
" If you have a problem with the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the math convince you , " said one doctor in a Facebook group .
And doctors who have reviewed the best scientific evidence are not convinced that it is actually safe to even do supposedly low risk interactions with patients in surgical masks .
At least one health authority is asking surgeons to operate without N95s , although other authorities believe that aerosol transmission is a risk in surgeries .
And health care workers can see pictures from China , where doctors are constantly wearing full protective suits .
Canadian doctors do n't have that option .
" Truthfully , given this is a new strain of virus it 's hard to know if only surgical masks are enough , " said one doctor in an email .
" It 's hard to go to work in a situation where you are constantly wondering , is this surgical mask truly protecting me ? my family ? my next patient ? A lot of health-care workers believe they should be wearing an N95 mask at all times while at work these days because we have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that officials really know the virus well enough .
" We have been researching the flu for over 100 years now and epidemiologists still ca n't decide whether it is airborne or whether it is spread by droplets , " said Forbes Flint .
" So I do n't know how they could decide in three months that something that is brand new that we 've never seen before is airborne or is droplets .
"  Dr .
Sandy Buchman , president of the Canadian Medical Association , says asking health-care workers to work without proper protective equipment is like asking firefighters to enter a burning building without the right gear .
" I think physicians have obligations but they also have rights and society has a responsibility , " he said in a telephone interview .
He said if they are not provided with the equipment they need , they ca n't be blamed if they refuse to work .
" We know we need to protect them , and if doctors and nurses and others start pulling away , one can understand it .
We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to walk , says Doris Grinspun , CEO of the Registered Nurses ' Association of Ontario .
" I already informed the minister herself today that I have heard from nurses that unless they get necessary personal protection equipment .
they also have families .
This is not about them .
This is about leaving their families without a mother or a father .
"  Health care workers are upset with administrators and government officials who are not communicating in detail about the quantities of equipment on hand and efforts to obtain more , as , for instance , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo does in his daily briefings .
" I do know that governments should be providing us with real time information , right up to the moment , " said Buchman .
" And we do n't have that .
"  Grinspun says officials in Ontario have still not ordered enough equipment .
" Nice words is not good enough , " she said .
" We need now actions to procure .
It is a matter of dollars .
You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underestimated where this is going .
"  A spokeswoman for Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott says the province " has been very active in procuring additional supplies and equipment , including one million more N95 respirators and nearly six million more surgical masks .
"  " The global supply chain for personal protective equipment is extremely strained as all jurisdictions face challenges in procuring supplies for frontline workers , " said Hayley Chazanin in an email .
" Now , more than ever , it is important that we provide clear guidance on the proper use of personal protective equipment .
