4 Comments  Comment Filter  It is a shame that the design of policies is not receiving more attention ; A policy not mentioned , allows those with children who no longer qualify for the IWTC on hours worked criteria to retain it but bizarrely not until 1 July .
By that time many will have had to access a benefit and not be entitled to it because of the crazy off benefit rule .
The IRD is putting out very confused messages .
The - $2 .
bln income support , including a permanent $25 per week benefit increase is very minimal- so that mnay people are having to access food grants and that system is not working well at all .
it is also flawed in design- penalising couples as does the Winter Energy Payment see St John , S ( 2020 ) Covid-19 : A Catch-22 for our most vulnerable Newsroom , 30th March .
The fiscal costs are going to be very high and it is important not to spray money unnecessarily .
The winter energy payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by in giving double to all 800,000 superannuitants regardless of need it is very costly and unfocussed .
To solve this make it an opt in not an opt out .
I wonder why the policy design is not receiving more scrutiny ?  So true Susan .
thank you for your researched wisdom .
I would add that now is the perfect time for Grant Robertson to suspend the annual $2bn contributions to the NZ Superfund ? The effects of Covid-19 shows there are much more pressing needs for the money .
The NZ Superfund contributions impose a double burden on contemporary taxpayers who are also supporting current superannuitants .
The fund does n't help anyone until 2050 and then only a modest trickle comes out .
And also - suspend the record amount of $20bn allocated for military upgrades and capabilities over the next decade in last year 's so called ' Wellbeing Budget ' .
Put on hold and deploy to more urgent concerns .

: The Reserve Bank initially set the minimum CFR at 65 percent from April 2010 , and increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A final increase raised the minimum to 75 percent from 1 January 2013 .
Requiring banks to maintain a minimum CFR reduces the vulnerability of the banking sector in a period of general market disruption .
