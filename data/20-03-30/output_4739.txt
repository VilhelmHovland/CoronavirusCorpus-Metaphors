Borussia Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has warned clubs interested in Jadon Sancho that they will have to pay full price to sign the winger this summer .
The 20-year-old has emerged as one of Europe 's most promising players since his breakthrough in Germany , having joined BVB from Manchester City in 2017 .
Manchester United and Chelsea are reportedly ready to act on their interest this summer , while Liverpool , Barcelona and Real Madrid have all been linked to him , too .
Any deal for Sancho is expected to amount to at least ? 100 million ( $125m ) , though there has been speculation that the Covid-19 pandemic will see transfer fees drop when business resumes .
Watzke , however , says Dortmund will only let Sancho leave if he demands it and maintains any buyer will have to match the club 's valuation .
" Even before the coronavirus outbreak , we said that we would prefer that Jadon stays with us .
At the end of the day , however , you always have to respect what the player wants , " Watzke told Bild am Sonntag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich club should think that during this existential crisis they can steal players from us .
We do n't have to sell anyone for less than they 're worth .
"  European football has ground to a halt due to efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus and there are concerns over the financial consequences as the crisis continues .
Juventus and European Club Association president Andrea Agnelli warned this week that the game faces its biggest ever threat .
Clubs and their employees are mired in uncertainty , but Watzke says Dortmund will do all they can to support their members in such difficult times .
" I am responsible for more than 150,000 members , for our shareholders , but above all for 850 BVB employees and their families , " he added .
" We are one of the largest employers in the city .
It 's about ordinary workers , not about football millionaires .
" Our travel agency no longer sells trips , our events and catering company no longer organises events and certainly not catering .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unity , there will initially be no short-term work .
For me , that means responsibility and solidarity .
" We can not disregard the fact that the Bundesliga clubs are and will remain competitors .
And of course , we are solidary if someone has got into an imbalance through no fault of their own .
That can not be excluded .
