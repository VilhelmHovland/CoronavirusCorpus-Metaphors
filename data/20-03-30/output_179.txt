? p=238564It 's been 10 years since the release of Dane Rumble 's solo album The Experiment .
Josie Adams looks back on why New Zealand fell so hard and fast .
At The Experiment 's launch , a decade ago yesterday , Dane Rumble had only one wish : " I just want to write the best album that I can and for every song to be as awesome as it can possibly be .
"  It 's hard to say if it 's the best album he 's capable of making .
He only ever made two .
It was good enough , or at least singular enough , to keep him in the public eye until he chose to leave it in 2013 .
It sometimes feels like Dane Rumble was a mass hallucination .
In the space of a decade , we 've seen what was once just a standard summer bop -- ' Cruel ' -- turn into a beloved piece of Kiwiana .
Its creator is a cryptid .
No one has seen him in years , and even back then you could n't be sure .
The Rumblemania phenomenon lasted for only a few brief years , but we ca n't shake it .
How did the man become the myth ?  The Kid  Within the man lives a kid : Kid Deft .
That was Dane Rumble 's name in Fast Crew , the five-person hip-hop group best known for garish sweatshirts and this absolute banger :  The first time the New Zealand public heard Rumblings on its airwaves was in 2002 , with Fast Crew 's single ' Mr Radio ' .
As Kid Deft , he was honing his songwriting : ' I Got ' shows off his keen ear for a hook , and ' Mr Radio ' and ' Suburbia Streets ' showcase a storytelling talent he 'd put to good use in his 2010 music videos .
Fast Crew would last for nine years , and support huge international acts like Missy Elliot and DMX , but nothing lasts forever ; such is the nature of the game .
It was time for Kid Deft to shed some inches of hair and become the man we all have burned into our memories : Dane Rumble .
The Man  In the two years between Fast Crew and Dane Rumble ? he transformed .
He became a pop artist .
Hair gelled , pants tight , shades on .
His first solo single was the 2009 hit ' Always Be Here ' , which remains one of his best songs ; but it 's not how we remember him .
It 's the superimposed galaxies and purple lights of ' Cruel ' that are embedded deep in the consciousness of every New Zealander .
When he wrote it , he knew what he 'd done .
" This is 100% a hit , " he thought .
" This is the best song I 've ever written .
" In the music video , he goes to space to get away from an ex-girlfriend .
The Spinoff Books editor Catherine Woulfe interviewed him just two weeks before The Experiment came out , and remembers him as having " nice skin and good patter " .
He was calm , unbothered by his imminent local stardom .
He spoke of the ultimate goal : designing his own sunglasses .
Shades would become his gimmick over the next couple of years .
I once saw him sitting on a couch ( indoors ) with shades on .
For years , I wondered what was underneath those sweet rims .
When he was Kid Deft he rapped so hard , and with so much jaw vigour , that the muscles around his eyes were permanently tensed .
The windows to his soul were so puckered by the intensity of his flow that I had no idea what I was looking at .
Did anyone ever see Dane Rumble 's eyes ?  The Myth  For a time , it was plausible that Dane Rumble was just Drew Neemia with sunglasses on .
Rumours spread that he loved public transport , but only because a man with a sharp jawline and massive shades was spotted at a Glenfield bus stop and on a train out of Britomart .
The mystery was only added to when he failed to turn up to a Parachute gig .
Was he a myth ? Was he a mass hallucination ? Was he AI-generated ?  Whatever he was , between 2008 and 2012 everyone wanted a piece of him .
He featured on J .
Williams ' ' Takes Me Higher , ' singing about the love of a beautiful woman while surrounded by luxury cars and some very tired Bendon models .
He supported The Eagles ( ! ) on their tour .
He was in November Zulu 's ' Second to None ' , rapping and fighting the rockers in a wrestling ring .
He also , allegedly , called music journalist Hussein Moses a " little snake " in an email after Moses wrote up an interview in a style that Rumble did n't appreciate ; the story and email screenshot have both been scrubbed from both The Corner and Twitter , but writer Joe Nunweek described the interaction as Rumble " making a dick of himself in his own words and Moses simply provided the mortar for the bricks " .
According to Nunweek , Moses ' crime was pointing out that Rumble 's music did n't do it for a lot of critics .
One critic , Simon Sweetman , wrote a scathing review :  " This will be shoved down people 's faces as being great new music from New Zealand and it 's not .
It 's horrible .
And everyone involved should feel very ashamed .
They are selling a lie .
"  Sam Wicks , Moses ' commissioning editor at Real Groove , confirmed that he was blacklisted by Rumble 's label following the piece .
As far as he can recall , Moses ' crime was calling Fast Crew critically unloved .
Nunweek said there were valid criticisms of Dane Rumble 's music , but in large part there was bias against him .
" Fast Crew were a bit of a running joke for what were , in retrospect , pretty snobby and elitist reasons , " he said .
" So when Dane Rumble came out solo he was kind of a big target .
"  It 's all history now , and not how the vast majority of the country will remember Dane Rumble .
The Legend  He won best male solo artist at the NZ Music Awards and most played at the APRAs , proving you do n't have to choose between quality and quantity .
Get you a man who can do both , plus a DJ set at Ohakune Mardi Gras .
Every year someone asks where Dane Rumble is .
Every year , the answer is the same -- Sydney -- but that 's deeply unsatisfying .
What we 're really asking is : how did a man who could exude that much charisma with only the lower half of his face get driven out of New Zealand music ?  The boring truth is : he was n't driven away , not even by people comparing him to Drew Neemia .
He opted out of the business we call show and got into the hardest rock of all : diamonds .
After designing a ring and getting Scotty Nicols , lead singer of Late Nyte Hype , to make it , the duo realised they had something sweet going on .
Thus , bespoke custom jeweller Cul ? t was born .
He 's a man dedicated to bespoke experiences .
He once met a stranger at a bus stop and took him to a party .
He 3D-printed rings for Zac Franich and Erin Simpson .
He rhymed " campervan " with " gasoline " and we all believed it worked .
Dane Rumble opened the Point Chevalier KFC in 2010 , only a year before the Double Down was introduced .
Did he , a proven deadset legend , have a hand in it ? It 's impossible to know .
One thing we do know is that 10 years ago he launched more than a few dozen Family Feasts -- he ascended to NZ pop immortality .
&gt;238564Everything that Dua Lipa 's new album makes us feelhttps : **35;357;TOOLONG .
Fri , 27 Mar 2020 03:20:43 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=238511Dua Lipa 's new album , Future Nostalgia , is an ode to good memories and a gateway to Zumba .
Josie Adams listened to it and took a heady trip into her past .
We 're only three months in , but I 'm calling it now : Future Nostalgia will be one of the best pop records released this decade .
It 's dropped slightly earlier than anticipated , in part because of an unfortunate album leak , but also because old mate Dua correctly thought we could use some joy right now .
And straight off the bat : this album gives a lot of joy .
As the title hints , Dua Lipa is n't interested in just looking backwards .
Her nostalgia is one that operates independent of time ; she 's wistful for loves both lost in the past and blossoming in the future .
And although the album 's early singles set expectations high , Dua and her team smashed those expectations into the basement and boarded them over with planks carved from the skeleton of pre-2020 pop music , because she killed it .
To honour its arrival and the artistic intent of its creator , I gave the record a listen and explained what each song made me nostalgic for -- past , present and , of course , future .
Future Nostalgia  The album 's opening and title track starts out reminding me of an ' 80s pick-a-path video game soundtrack , but by the bridge I know I 'm actually listening to the soundtrack for a ( currently ) nonexistent Paul Feig-directed adaptation of William Gibson 's Neuromancer .
Some of the other songs on the album veer towards almost vaporwave-esque pop , but the synths on this one are explicitly ' 80s electro .
It reminds me of my time spent as an elite hacker , surfing the mainframe and crunching bugs .
Do n't Start Now  This song reminds me of four months ago when I first heard it and decided to get a gym membership .
Probing deeper , it makes me nostalgic for the few fleeting moments in my life where I 've exhibited emotional strength .
There 's a wooden clap that manifests somewhere in the middle of the song that takes me to a breezy field , with a horse , on which I will ride away from my problems .
Cool  Gentle synth turns into hard drums -- is this what they call " new wave " ? Because I 'm surfing it .
I 'm riding this gnarly wave all the way back to 2003 and buying a HitClip that I will play outside my Year 6 paramour 's classroom .
It 's actually just plain old pop music , and it bangs .
This song takes me back to the lovelorn mania Dua Lipa is experiencing without putting my heart rate in the anxiety danger zone , which I appreciate .
Physical  I was getting a certain vibe from the aesthetics of ' Do n't Start Now ' , and now it 's confirmed : Dua Newton John is in the house .
Lipa 's ' 80s nostalgia is a little Aussie-inspired , and I love that for her .
I 'm visualising a glossy tanning oil sheen and a fight outside a Les Mills .
I 'm smelling the intoxicating vanilla musk of my teenage deodorant .
I 'm praying that Dua Lipa will one day appear in a live TV musical .
Levitating  " My love is like a rocket , watch it blast off , " is a great lyric in any context , but in a crisp English accent wedged in the white space between some really funky riffs , it takes you to a wedding reception with an open bar .
This is all about the first blushes of love , and at this point in the album I 'm having future nostalgia for the peppy whirlwind summer romance Dua Lipa and I will share , or at least the one that she 'll kindly soundtrack for me .
Pretty Please  As soon as the bassline starts bumpin on this track , I 'm transported back in time , either to New York in the ' 80s , or the time in 2005 when my sister and I took ' MTV-style ' dance classes with the ex-wife of Kid Creole from Kid Creole and the Coconuts .
I do n't recall how or why I 'm here , but I 'm having a helluva good time .
Hallucinate  This is so good I feel like I must have hallucinated it , because surely no living mortal could create such a vibe .
It takes me back to being 19 , needing no sleep , jazzed on Cindy 's , walking 40 miles uphill in freezing snow just to get to a Dunedin house party -- and loving it .
Love Again  A lush violin intro melds seamlessly with a sample from White Town 's 90s hit ' Your Woman , ' which is one of my favourite songs , and God damn , you 've got me in love again , Dua Lipa .
I 'm flashing back to the beautiful crescendo of every love story in my life tapestry .
It 's the first time I saw the Bachelorette , Dr Lesina Nakhid-Schuster .
Why did you play me this way ?  Break My Heart  It starts with an INXS bass riff , so you already know what this throws back to : my own personal fashion inspiration , Michael Hutchence .
With luscious curls , dirty basslines , and sinfully deep-cut shirts -- how could Dua Lipa 's heart not be broken ? If she 's looking for an antipodean stud to treat her terribly , I volunteer .
' Break My Heart ' makes me think about my choices and realise that , yes , they 're bad , but they 're kinda nice with it .
Good In Bed  Musically , this is a slight departure from the rest of the album .
It 's staccato piano-led and snarky , so it 's a definite British vibe -- no accent required to pin down this song 's geography .
It 's also filthy .
Smutty .
It reminds me of the staircase at my old apartment in Edinburgh , where the shadows gave off a sexy air but hid some serious health and safety hazards .
? ?  Boys Will be Boys  The album 's closing track is another one that takes us out of the dance studio .
The violin-and-piano combo is a classic for swelling hearts with profound inspiration , but unlike most anthems this pulls not one single punch .
It would have gone off at my all-girls high school ; a throwback to the heady days of inspirational Tumblr reblogs and Upworthy shares on Facebook .
It might make you want to run up a mountain , which is a bit difficult for now , but powerful lights-off living room dancing should work just fine .
&gt;238511Crowdwork from home : How Covid-19 is affecting Kiwi musicianshttps : **30;394;TOOLONG .
Thu , 19 Mar 2020 22:02:19 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=236484The effects of Covid-19 on New Zealand music wo n't be short-lived .
Here 's how some members of the industry -- both on stage and behind the scenes -- are coping .
On a plane to New York , musician Joe Locke is dry-retching .
He 's having a panic attack .
Soon he 'll be flying home to New Zealand , back to a decimated music industry and an uncertain future .
The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global music business have hit quickly , and hit hard .
In the past week , both Deftones and My Chemical Romance have announced they 'll reschedule their New Zealand shows .
Overseas , festivals including Coachella , Glastonbury and SXSW have been cancelled or postponed .
Here in New Zealand , Womad went ahead in New Plymouth over the weekend , only days before events of that size were cancelled to stop the spread of the virus .
Yesterday , indoor gatherings of 100 people or more were banned .
The limit on outdoor gatherings remains 500 .
The effect of all this on local musicians ca n't be overstated .
Artists like Reb Fountain , Nadia Reid and The Beths were due to fly out of the country for tours in the near future .
Now both they and their tour managers will be looking at a huge loss -- not just of income , although that 's immense , but also to the way they live and work .
The impact so far  " We 've had one cancelled tour , three postponed tours , two tours going ahead with back-up plans as we 're feeling like they could potentially still be postponed yet , and five unannounced tours that will most likely not be announced , " says Reuben Bonner of live music booking agency Banished Music .
The impact of a postponed tour is n't just delayed income ; it can stop a burgeoning musician 's career trajectory in its tracks .
" Three of my artists just cancelled international touring plans in various territories , after months or years of planning , and some of them were doing it to support new albums and progress into the next stage of their careers , " Bonner says .
" It 's pretty heartbreaking .
"  Dorian , one half of the musical duo Tooms , had shows lined up in the US that , at the time , were able to go ahead .
But Tooms decided to cancel them anyway .
" The responsibility we felt for the health and safety of everyone involved was very heavy , " Dorian says .
It was n't an easy decision to make , as Tooms had worked hard to get to the US in the first place .
" It 's stink , but we 're also just really keen to get home safe and sound .
"  Getting home is something Kiwis abroad are taking seriously .
" I was supposed to come home on March 31 , but yesterday I changed my flight to March 19 so I could come and immediately self-isolate , " says Joe Locke ( P .
) , who 's based in Auckland but has been on tour in the US .
" I managed to change my flight for a small fee , which I will hound them to be refunded for as soon as I 'm home .
"  Fiona Campbell ( Guardian Singles , formerly of The Coolies ) has had to completely re-evaluate her plans for the year .
" I 'm a tour manager and a touring drummer , and I was still planning on going back to the US and making my living the way I 've been doing it for 20 years , " she says .
" This is the thing I live for , which gives me life , " she says .
" I 'm a drummer .
I 'm a motivator .
I 'm not a songwriter .
I get people in the right room at the right time .
And if I do n't have a fucking room ? And I 'm not allowed to get people in it ? " She leaves the question hanging in the air .
Concerns for the future  For New Zealand musicians abroad , there are also immediate , terrifying concerns about health .
" The USA 's healthcare system is legendarily shit , " says Emily Edrosa , an LA-based Kiwi musician .
At the moment she 's tossing up between staying there or coming back to New Zealand .
" Apart from the fact that a lot of people are going to die , the economic fallout of this whole thing is obviously going to be huge , " she says .
" The US 's love of capitalism is going to bite itself in the ass and I ca n't really imagine what that will look like right now .
"  Like many of her peers , she 's seeing her hopes for 2020 dissolve .
" Musically , I had a lot of plans this year : shows , stuff with my own label , my album release , " she says .
She was in the middle of talking to booking agents when the pandemic was declared .
" They have , reasonably , stopped replying to me .
"  When she 's not making music , Edrosa works in hospitality in the US .
" All the bars and restaurants are now closed , which means no income , " she says .
" Everything is evolving so fast , it 's hard to know when to pull the plug and go home .
My partner and I have worked hard , and it 's taken years to finally feel comfortable , but worst case -- we will just have to leave everything , wo n't we ? "  Despite 20 years of work in the music industry , drummer and tour manager Fiona Campbell is also preparing for a lifestyle change .
If business were normal , she 'd be tour managing for Mitski and Shamir over the next few months .
Now stuck in New Zealand , she 's trying to gauge how successful her backup plan will be .
" My other career , which is the shittest backup career of all right now , is massage therapist , " she says .
On Tuesday the government announced a $12 .
billion package to combat Covid-19 and its knock-on effects .
Finance minister Grant Robertson said it was only the first package , and there would be more to come .
However , he was clear that a recession now appears unavoidable .
" We are all in a situation nobody was prepared for or ever expected to happen , " says Bonner .
He says the best sort of government aid he could get right now is bridging finance so he , his employees and his artists do n't lose out more than necessary .
He 's also concerned about support for venues .
" I really hope that small venues , and the people who run them and do the sound and lighting there , get the assistance they need .
That 's the lifeblood of the New Zealand touring circuit .
" The New Zealand Music Commission is similarly concerned , and has issued a call for venue landlords to give their renters some financial relief .
Jordan Luck of The Exponents touches a large crowd at Auckland venue The Powerstation .
Photo : Getty  The money crunch for the music industry goes beyond a downturn in record sales and live shows .
Hospo and promotions work are common side gigs for many musicians .
Hospitality workers have been among those on the frontlines of the pandemic threat for weeks , and the industry is now looking at further job losses during the recession .
Campbell worries the government 's package , which includes wage subsidies for freelancers as well as those in traditional employment , will be difficult to navigate for some members of the music industry .
" It would be good for full-time working crew people , " she said .
" But a lot of the musicians I know work two or three jobs and patch things together .
There 's a lot of freelancing .
How do you prove you 're making 30% less , especially if you have n't been in that job for a year ? "  Dorian similarly stresses that many musicians will be losing out on multiple jobs , not just one career .
" If you 're gon na tell artists to get a job , fuck up -- most of us have two or more .
"  What the next few weeks look like  Spending time at home , for some , means spending time creating .
" Lots of records are going to get written , and a lot of babies are going to get made , " says Campbell .
Edrosa says she 's gearing up for the former , and thinks most musicians will be at home recording and uploading to try and make some extra cash .
" My US label got in touch this morning and is trying to book an online festival where we all livestream shows from our houses , " she says .
" I guess now is the time for artists to really get creative , or for the world to realise it needs us more than they thought .
"  Emily Edrosa ( left , with her band Street Chant ) at a Grey Lynn flat .
For most musicians and labels , it 's a given that upcoming shows will be cancelled .
" We need to think about public safety , " says Bonner .
" I 'd be mortified if we made the wrong decision .
We do have a couple of tours we are holding on to for now in the late May/June/July timeframe , which we will reassess daily .
"  Like everyone else , Campbell has been going through the emotional wringer figuring out where she stands , and what the near future looks like .
At the moment , she 's working as a nanny and reconsidering her priorities .
" If we 're scrambling to figure things out , we might be missing out on how this downtime can be important , " she says .
" Our industry is n't sustainable the way it is , and we have a chance to look at it and talk about it .
Vinyl records are terrible for the environment .
I 'm on planes more than anyone I know .
I 'm driving giant tour vans on diesel up and down several countries .
"  She thinks putting live music on hold could reset the way the industry works .
" It is fucked , what I do , for the environment .
The break the environment needs is bigger than my need to do this .
I think a lot of people are seeing that .
"  The entertainment industry en masse is taking a hit from Covid-19 , but musicians with existing platforms may be slightly better placed than their friends in theatre .
Streaming is likely to pick up over the next few weeks -- it might account for only a fraction of the income Kiwi artists usually make , but it 's still income .
Tonight , Bandcamp will be hosting a fundraiser with this in mind .
And in these suddenly dire times , every little bit helps .
If you 're a music fan wanting to support local artists during the Covid-19 crisis , RNZ has a few ideas .
&gt;236484An essential guide to the people you 'll meet at Womad 2020https : **35;426;TOOLONG .
Thu , 12 Mar 2020 23:12:26 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=231921Michel .
Cruickshanks presents a complete taxonomy of the types of people who 'll be descending on New Plymouth this weekend for Womad .
First things first : Womad is going ahead this weekend as planned .
You can find more information here , and a statement from it follows :  " New Zealand is prepared and ready to deal with a Covid-19 outbreak should it occur here .
The risk of an ongoing outbreak is low-moderate , the Ministry Of Health is monitoring the situation closely .
With continued vigilance , the chance of widespread community outbreak is expected to remain low .
Womad 2020 event is proceeding as planned .
Safety of our festival audience is the top priority .
The Ministry of Health does not propose altering arrangements for public events nationwide , with large- and small-scale international events in the music , arts and sports sectors all proceeding as programmed .
Womad NZ is working with local , provincial , and national agencies to ensure a safe event and will continue to monitor the situation closely and will provide updates as necessary .
We are in communication with our UK and Australian Womad colleagues to ensure the safety of our artists and audiences also .
"  To the uninitiated , the word Womad conjures images of a vast ocean of hemp-clad alternative types tribal dancing barefoot .
In reality , the vast majority of the 50,000 people who converge on New Plymouth 's idyllic Brooklands Park each year are pretty representative of those you 'd find in any middle-class New Zealand suburb .
That 's not to say Womad is n't awash with colourful characters .
So , Attenborough-like , let us investigate some of the more common Womad species and see what lessons we can glean from their adaptations and behaviours .
Indisputably , the WOMAD expert .
Photo : WOMAD NZ Facebook page .
The Expert  The Expert has their work cut out for them .
Seeing 40+ musical acts perform on four stages is just the beginning .
To truly earn their Expert title they need to somehow bend the rules of space and time and get to six additional spaces all jam-packed with their own schedule of performances , workshops , demonstrations , lectures , cultural activities and more .
Mystery surrounds how the Expert manages to condense so much into three days .
Just as puzzling is their reproduction , as Experts seem to be almost exclusively male .
They will happily coexist with all other species but can become defensive when encountering one of their own , and it is not unusual for squabbles over scheduling to break out .
While all Experts are proficient in tool use , only a handful shepherd their followers through the throngs by holding aloft a tall festooned stick , a behaviour adapted from the European tour guide .
The Reveller  At the other end of the preparation spectrum is the Reveller .
Despite being unable to name a single act now that Ziggy Marley has pulled out , the Reveller is one of Womad 's biggest enthusiasts and zealously recruits new festival goers .
The Reveller religiously attends every Womad .
Like estimating the age of a tree by its rings , keen observers can calculate how many Womad a Reveller has attended by the number of hair and body adornments they sport .
Males of the species go shirtless and can be identified by their unique sun scorched markings .
Revellers account for a disproportionately high number of bar sales , a phenomenon linked to their enthusiastic dancing rituals .
Females carry bottles of bubbles or ros ? on their person at all times .
The males ' Globlets ( Womad 's reusable , environmentally friendly cups ) are refilled with a selection of premium and craft beers more often than any other festival goers .
What we can learn from the Reveller :  Do n't let not knowing any of the acts hold you back .
Go hard but remember Womad is a marathon , not a sprint .
If you do peak too early , follow the Reveller and soak up the excess with a Hungarian bread puff or gourmet pie and a quick nap under a tree .
The Parents and their children in their Womad habitat .
Photo : Womad 2020 Facebook page .
The Parents  Early every day Parents vie for territory and status as they cover the upper slopes of the Bowl with Kathmandu shade shelters and impossibly large blankets .
Parents are some of the easiest Womaders to identify , shackled as they generally are to one or more of their young ( who are themselves identified by the cell phone numbers emblazoned up their arms in black Vivid ) .
The dominant adult of each group shoulders a mandatory back-pack .
Parents form large social groupings to facilitate the shared care of their juveniles , who are primarily focused on the Kids Zone .
This carnival of kid-friendly performances , workshops and activities requires minimal input from the Parent , leaving them largely free to jostle for shade while they count down to the hand-off of the juveniles to the next scheduled caregiver .
Away from their base camp and the Kids Zone , juveniles are enthusiastically accepted into the general Womad audience and can be seen safely whooping and dancing ( or napping ) alongside all other species throughout the weekend .
What we can learn from the Parent :  Womad is a fully self-sufficient ecosystem .
Come prepared but do n't freak out when you forget something -- you 'll be able to borrow it , buy it or find it being given away .
The Boomer in their natural Womad environment .

The Boomer  While they generally avoid music festivals in favour of lecturing millennials on the sacrifices required for home ownership , Boomers make a rare exception for Womad .
They can be seen all over the festival reverting to the tolerant , adventurous behaviours characteristic of their youth .
Nowhere is this more evident than within the Global Food Village , where Boomers happily queue for a delicious array of ethnic dishes .
In fact , such is their vigour for the ( admittedly legendary ) eats on offer , that they often resolve to write strongly worded letters to editors advocating a name change to Womaf ( World of Music , Art and Food ) .
Inspired , the female of the species frequents the OMV Taste The World tent .
Here Boomer males are on high alert , worrying they may be forced to try quinoa and concerned how their partner 's exposure to the secrets of Somalian pilaf will impact their Tuesday-night rissoles and three veg .
Goldies are a subspecies of Boomer .
Older and exclusively wearing sensible , over-priced hiking sandals , Goldies are so named for the Superannuation Gold Cards they carry .
These golden tickets let them enter elevated , primely positioned , over-65 seating areas .
A bunch of the lovable Weirdos in their natural habitat .
Photo : Womad NZ Facebook page .
The Weirdo  No Womader list would be complete without the Weirdo .
They encompass a magnificent array of colourful subspecies , from hippies and witches to steampunk aficionados and old-school punks .
From monochromatic goths to neon glowing ravers , as well as metalheads , bogans and the odd cowboy .
The Weirdo is one of the rarest species at Womad -- some subspecies ' populations number less than a handful -- but one of the most visible , thanks to each subspecies ' distinctive plumage .
The population of the largest subspecies , the new age/nippie Weirdo , actually swells during Womad , with many festival goers using the event as their annual chance to dust off their patchwork pants and tie-dyed tops and indulge their love of crystals and prayer flags .
What we can learn from the Weirdo :  Womad is your chance to let your freak flag fly and still blend in .
Like the festival itself , the Weirdo embodies diversity , inclusion and tolerance .
If only for this one weekend , revel in what makes you unique and embrace the weirdly wonderful festival of difference around you .
As of this writing , Womad 2020 is going ahead this weekend in New Plymouth .

&gt;231921Inclusivity for all : The return of women-in-music festival Milk and Honeyhttps : **34;463;TOOLONG .
Fri , 06 Mar 2020 18:10:59 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=234206Milk and Honey Festival organisers Lani Purkis and Teresa Patterson on celebrating women in the New Zealand music industry on International Women 's Day .
What 's the Milk and Honey Festival ? A platform for women to celebrate women in the NZ music industry on a day internationally set aside for women , a platform for younger women to see the different roles in the music industry and a safe , respectful and inclusive gig environment .
" And we 're still trying to make it more inclusive and more safe as we go forward but we 've got to think of all the communities and that 's something we 're working on , " says co-founder Teresa Patterson , whose maternal grandparents come from Tongatapu and Ha'apai in Tonga .
" We 've just made sure that we 've covered ethnicity , culture , age , sexuality which we 've more or less done through our programming .
"  " There 's a definite vibe we went for , " says fellow co-founder Lani Purkis ( Nga Puhi and Ngati Kahungunu ) .
Patterson , Purkis and musician Julia Deans launched Milk and Honey in 2019 with a bang , touring four cities and six venues showcasing over 20 female artists on the same night .
" International Women 's Day 2019 was on a Friday and we thought we should do something different and we felt like no one had really done a festival like that before , " says Purkis .
It was a resounding success , with sold out shows across the country .
" We had Bic Runga doing Blue Smoke in her home city ( Christchurch ) , Ladi6 did San Fran in Wellington , Club 121 had a range of really great DJs .
We were really amazed by the response that we got .
"  When they went to book venues for this year 's follow-up event they were in for a surprise : 2020 is a leap year and International Women 's Day ( March 8 ) falls not on a Saturday , as they 'd assumed , but on a Sunday -- making evening shows a much harder sell .
That 's when Fresh Concept , the promoters who run all the events in Auckland 's Silo Park , contacted the trio to suggest a collaboration .
Lani Purkis and Teresa Patterson , the women behind the Milk and Honey Festival .
It was perfect .
The new formula -- a free , all-ages , all-day event at Silo Park with live acts , DJs , and food trucks -- allowed for a fresh approach , but also necessitated some hard choices .
This year the inclusive lineup featuring female artists , crewed by females in the industry and fed by female-owned/fronted and co-owned food trucks , needed to painstakingly chosen .
" It was hard actually because last year we had specific venues for genres , " says Purkis .
" This year we only had six slots plus DJs .
"  They came up with a lineup that was inclusive , diverse and would go over well in a family-friendly setting .
The acts include hip-hop queen JessB , DnB boss MC Tali , RnB power house Disciple Pati , and DJs Phoebe Falconer , Lil Bok Choy aka Eva Choy .
According to Purkis and Patterson , it was important to include new artists as well as those who have been in the game for a long time .
MC Tali , who won Best Electronica Artist at the VNZMAs in 2019 , started her career in a male-dominated industry in the early 2000s and now is an inspiration to up and coming female artists .
" I remember Tali being in Bristol and part of the Roni Size crew , " recalls Patterson .
" I just remember going , ' Oh my gosh I can not believe that there 's a New Zealand female MC that 's part of that crew ! ' "  " It was like she was imaginary before , " says Purkis , " and now we can book her for a festival and the younger women are going to see her and know she exists .
"  They 're young women like Disciple Pati , a new Samoan artist who was booked on the back of her debut track ' The Boy Who Cried Woman ' , an open letter to Pasifika people about reclaiming their culture and spitting in the face of stereotypes and systemic racism that Patterson and Purkis stumbled upon on social media .
" There can be a lack of opportunity for females to be booked on a lot of the summer festivals , " says Patterson .
" That 's one of the reasons why we created the event and is aligned with our kaupapa .
For someone to be really excited that they 've been booked for their first festival on one of our festivals is a really proud moment for us .
"  While there 's still a long way to go , they promise there will be something for nearly everyone at Silo Park on Sunday .
But what about those people who do n't identify as women ?  " The festival is not anti-man thing at all , " says Purkis .
" There are men in the bands and men behind the scenes and men are allowed to come to the festival .
We 're not going to be ranting .
There 's no signs , or speeches , or anything -- it 's just celebrating International Women 's Day through music , and addressing the lack of women in roles throughout the music industry and on festival lineups .
The organisers are pleased by the progress made on gender issues in NZ music over the past year , changes that they 're quick to say are n't solely because of Milk and Honey .
" Our festival was a result of a bigger outcry by women in the industry .
While we did this lots of other things happened , " says Purkis .
" We 're part of a movement .
The lineups are changing , " says Patterson .
" Maybe one specific festival did n't spark all this but definitely people are making more of an effort and trying to embrace putting women in their lineups .
"  &gt;234206Ashnikko is a pro-ghosting TikTok rap phenomenonhttps : **29;499;TOOLONG .
Fri , 06 Mar 2020 02:56:50 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=233078Like Benee , BBNO$ and about a thousand other acts that suddenly became superstars in the last 18 months , Ashnikko is blowing up off the back of a TikTok craze .
But dig a little deeper and you 'll see that there 's much more to this blue-haired rapper than Miley Cyrus memes .
Barely a second into the intro , you get a pretty solid indicator of what 's on the way : a clapped-out synth bassline and a sharp-edged trap beat , underneath a solitary voice repeatedly screaming ' WET ' on the track like its owner is trying to summon the ghosts of our crunkcore kings Brokencyde .
The song is called ' STUPID ' , the voice belongs to a 23-year-old London-based rapper called Ashnikko , and like an increasing number of out-of-nowhere smash hits of late , it 's one which found its first major audience on that most democratic of platforms : I 'm talking about TikTok , baby .
But as anyone who 's ever spent a long , fruitless afternoon neglecting crucial responsibilities and trying to nail yet another hellish dance challenge can attest , landing a TikTok hit is a lot less simple than that sentence may sound .
So how did ' STUPID ' blow up ? And why ? And who exactly is the diminutive blue-haired rapper behind it ? All of these questions , and at least 1 .
more , sort-of-answered below .
First , I implore thee : what is an Ashnikko and whom hath summoned it ?  Ashnikko , as mentioned above , is a young rapper operating out of England 's capital , although she 's called a few places home -- born in North Carolina , she grew up stateside then spent the bulk of her teens in Estonia and Latvia , before moving slightly west at age 18 .
She 's been making music since the mid-2010s , and for the most part it 's all been pretty consistent both in style and quality -- if you 're looking for an easy primer , her four-track 2017 debut Sass Pancakes gives a pretty complete prototype of her contemporary sound , splitting the difference between the extreme luridity of Brooke Candy and the hard-edged delivery of Rico Nasty .
So why did ' STUPID ' blow up ?  Why does the sun rise ? Why does the world turn ? Why do I keep buying headphones on deferred finance and then leaving them at the gym ? Truly , it seems that some of this life 's mysteries are beyond solving .
If I were to hazard a guess , though , I 'd give equal credit to the track 's playful abrasiveness -- similar to acts like the aforementioned Ms Nasty or art-pop weirdos du jour 100 gecs , its extreme heaviness does n't come at the expense of melody -- and the incongruity of Ashnikko 's saccharine delivery against her low-level toxic lyrics ; pro-ghosting lines like " Nothing about you is attractive to me now / Blocking you , avoiding you actively right now " may not constitute great life advice , but is there truly any human who ca n't relate ? That 's not a rhetorical question , the answer is no .
It 's easy to overstate the role of individual clips as catalysts for this type of blow-up , but it does also seem fair to say that Miley Cyrus played some part in its rise -- the track was already blowing up on the platform itself , but Miley using the song to introduce new boyfriend Cody Simpson to Tiktok automatically meant that the virality became a little more mainstream .
As far as Ashnikko herself is concerned , she 's said that " for the most part " she thinks that the nature of the song 's buzz is true to the spirit in which she wrote it .
Speaking to Fader at the end of last year , she said she 's proud of what ' Stupid ' has ended up meaning to people , " It 's a breakup song , basically , " she told David Renshaw , " and it feels like it 's become something like a confidence song , which I really like -- a " sing in front of your mirror with a hairbrush " type of song .
"  Does all her stuff sound like this ?  I 'm so glad you asked ! Because no , not really ! If anything , Hi , It 's Me , the 2019 EP that ' STUPID ' is lifted from , presents Ashnikko as an almost-surprisingly well-rounded artist -- albeit an extremely on-trend one .
Her stylistic touchpoint here range from the overdriven power pop of Sleigh Bells , or Charli XCX 's more bombastic moments ( the title track ) to the era-defining Bay Area bounce of DJ Mustard ( ' Special ' , ' Working Bitch ' ) , giving the overall impression of an artist who 's definitely aware of what 's hot in music , even if she does n't necessarily obliged to stay in any one particular lane .
Part of that is probably down to what seems like a pretty healthy working relationship between Ashnikko and her production partners .
' Working Bitch ' and ' Manners ' see return appearances from previous collaborators CallMeTheKidd and Jason Julian respectively , while ' STUPID ' is produced and co-written by Oscar Scheller , a buzzed-about artist in his own right and someone who she 's already worked with a few times prior .
The results are varied , but the consistent through-line is an artist who sounds just as comfortable with borderline balladry as she does with sex raps .
Which , frankly , is the kind of versatility that 2020 demands .
I have decided to stan .
Now what ?  I 'm so happy to hear that , and I also have good news for you : by all indications , Ashnikko 's not planning to switch up her approach too substantially anytime soon .
She 's apparently got new work in the pipe , telling Billboard in November that 2020 will see her " making a lot of cool music with a lot of really cool people .
I 'm just going to be throwing so much music out into the world , " but in the meantime she 's just trying to keep the buzz bus rolling -- just today she dropped chaotic new single ' Tantrum ' , and with last week seeing the announcement that she 'll soon be joining fellow Tik Tok superstar Doja Cat for a full US tour , it seems pretty likely that you 'll be hearing a lot more from her in the not-too-distant future .
Maybe keep an eye on Tik Tok , just in case .
&gt;233078EXCLUSIVE : Shannon Matthew Vanya ' Closer ' music video premierehttps : **31;530;TOOLONG .
Thu , 05 Mar 2020 05:42:38 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=234151Former .
known as Tom Lark , Shannon Matthew Vanya is an artist familiar with reinvention .
The Spinoff is extremely excited today to premiere his new single ' Closer ' , a roller disco hit that walks a careful line between Japanese city pop and smooth French neo-disco .
Here , Shannon explains how it all came together .
I worked on a lot of songs over the Tom Lark years , but many of them did n't see the light of day because they were either tied up with a label or I was waiting for a manager to recognise something I 'd written as a potential number one smash hit .
In hindsight , it sounds a bit pathetic , but I think I really had to learn how to speak up instead of being a victim of industry happenstance .
In 2016 I 'd finished three albums worth of music that I was at some point excited about .
But feeling thoroughly jaded , I just stopped working on my music .
Lots of friends gave me pep talks , but it took a really long time to want to make music for myself again .
I think it had to feel fresh , but also like I 'd really done the research to follow my new pop compass .
In the past , I think I 've used songwriting as a vehicle to make some sort of wry comment , or as a need to express frustration .
Behind most Tom Lark songs I 'd begin unpacking something that felt really heavy , and just follow some stream of consciousness around how I felt .
In writing Shannon Matthew Vanya songs , I imposed more of a sense of discipline for myself -- if I felt like I was being too clever I 'd ask myself how would it sound if I were to try and speak more simply .
Before long I 'd begun to set a course into a different pop universe , almost like the movie Easy Rider but with synthesisers and old drum machines .
I think I have this sweet side that comes out in songwriting ; the first person narrative in ' Closer ' is about expressing romantic idealism but admitting shortcomings , almost like a glass-half-empty romantic .
" If I was with you , I would do my very best .
"  I may have oversold Jordan Arts , the video 's director on my ability as a skater .
I used to play a lot of roller hockey when I was a kid , but I was n't the best -- I spent most games playing defence , and in the three years I played in a team I never once scored a goal .
Maybe this music video is a way of revisiting my childhood -- with a little bit of camera magic I sort of look like I belong on a roller floor .
We thought it would be cool ( just in case ) to get a stunt/skate double to handle some of the funkiest moves .
I seem to be quite good at coming up with the absurdities and Jordan is really good at translating and talking them into actionable ideas .
He 's obviously a man of many talents .
' Closer ' is the second single from Shannon Matthew Vanya 's first EP , coming later this year on A Label Called Success .
&gt;234151The new New Wave : Vanessa Worm is redefining the club scenehttps : **34;563;TOOLONG .
Thu , 05 Mar 2020 00:00:36 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=233674Born and bred in Dunedin , Vanessa Worm is now known in nightclubs the world over .
She talked to Josie Adams about how being punk got her signed to one of the world 's best club music labels .
Vanessa Worm -- real name Tessa -- is calling from her bed in Melbourne .
Stage names , sleep-ins , jet-setting ; she 's nailing the rock and roll lifestyle .
Next weekend she 'll be back on Kiwi shores , playing Beacon Festival with the likes of Nina Kraviz and Richie Hawtin .
Every Kiwi musician has an ' I 'm moving to Melbourne ' moment , but Vanessa Worm has gone -- as the kids say -- hundy .
She started out in the club music desert of Dunedin , and within a couple of years of jumping the ditch , became a performer and producer signed to one of the world 's most well-known club music labels : Optimo .
The Spinoff : Do you describe yourself as a DJ ?  Vanessa Worm : I 'm not really a DJ ; I 'm a performer ! Most of my shows are live performances .
Sometimes I use the guitar .
I 'm on the wireless microphone and get in the crowd .
When I was out clubbing I used to dance and dream of being on a microphone , in the crowd , bringing a new energy to the club .
Something a bit more immersive , that helps people connect together .
You 've done that by fusing club music with something rawer .
What is it ?  I 'm definitely a cross contamination of club and punk music .
That 's what I always wanted to do which was bring the two together .
It 's vocally quite punky and raw .
I think that 's being from Dunedin and being immersed in that raw realm of music .
I was really afraid of singing , but it 's the one thing I 've always wanted to do .
In the past couple of years , I 've become more confident with singing and more confident in what my voice is , rather than having an expectation of what a singer should sound like .
Speaking of Dunedin , as far as I recall it does n't really have a club scene .
Where 's the first place you performed ?  It was now-defunct artist-run space None Gallery .
The music was very different to what I play now .
I would n't be able to play that sort of stuff over here .
Dunedin was a bit less club-oriented , a bit more punky , and it suited that sort of thing .
Is that why you moved to Melbourne ? To try something different ?  I decided when I was 16 I would come over here and study music .
I did that for three months , but it was n't for me and I dropped out .
I went back to Dunedin , and that 's when I started doing the Vanessa Worm stuff , and then I came back here a year later .
That 's when the Optimo release happened , and all the club-oriented shows .
Ah , Optimo ! Have you noticed things opening up since the Optimo signing ?  Hugely , 100% .
The fact that Z Time was on Optimo -- they 're well-known and trusted -- opened heaps of opportunities .
The album 's with them as well .
I would n't have gone ahead and produced an album if they had n't asked me .
Are you heading for global superstardom ?  I hope so ! I 've got big dreams ! I 'm hopefully heading to Europe , but I do n't know when .
I 'd like it to happen this year , but if not , definitely next year .
Probably places like New York and San Francisco soon .
I love visiting new places and travelling , so I 'm lucky this is giving me the opportunity to do that .
( Photo : Supplied )  It 's in large part because of the music , but do you think it 's also your performance that leads to your popularity ?  The performance is a bit out of the box , yeah .
Half the people at music festival Meredith absolutely loved it , and the other half were frightened .
They were going ' what is this ? ' It was such a polarising response , and I think that might have a lot to do with it .
It 's not something you necessarily see every day when you 're clubbing .
For people who are into punk and go clubbing it really excites them .
They 're like ' oh my gosh , I can dance , but I still get to have my raw punk thing happening ! ' and for other people who 've only gone clubbing , they can see a whole new side of music .
In Dunedin , the music scene is very intimate and everyone knows each other , and there 's a level of safety in that .
Is it different for you performing and creating in a place like Melbourne ?  In Dunedin it 's so small that if someone new arrives and they go to None Gallery , everyone goes ' oh , who are you , where are you from , radi-rah-rah ' and it 's all very community vibes .
Here , you really have to put yourself out there .
You have to take the first step and go to events on your own .
Kiwis do n't like to blow our own trumpet .
It took me a year and a half to find my feet here and feel safe and secure .
From there I 've begun to find a new community in the scene here that 's a bit more vast , but very connected .
Did it change the way you made music ?  The difference between the music I made in Dunedin and here is huge .
In Dunedin , it was far more experimental , or gloomy , or emotional , which is what Dunedin is in many ways .
Coming over here to Melbourne , the EP on Optimo had something about it that was a bit more functional .
Being here also pushed me a lot more to challenge myself , and to be the best that I can because there 's so much more out there .
Dunedin has a slow pace with a slow process .
And here there 's a fast pace , and that energy plays out when you 're creating music .
That creates a difference in sound , and you can hear that all over the world .
There 's something about each city that connects them all , but keeps them a bit different from each other .
Someone told me the other day that music is never purely your own -- it 's part of a group consciousness .
You 're creating from that group consciousness .
You can hear that in my own music , from Dunedin to now .
Would you ever go back to your hometown to play a cheeky O-Week gig ?  Ahh .
I would n't want to play O-Week .
I think I 'd make them all shit their pants .
&gt;233674Hold me close to your heart : On loving A-ha for 35 yearshttps : **34;599;TOOLONG .
Tue , 03 Mar 2020 22:48:32 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=233544This week , the Norwegian band A-ha will play their first ever dates in New Zealand .
Though it 's been more than three decades since the release of their timeless debut single ' Take on Me ' , sometimes it seems like it was only yesterday , writes Catherine McGregor .
It 's a Saturday evening in the spring of 1985 and I 'm sitting cross legged in front of the Sony Trinitron , close enough to change the channel without getting up .
The clock has just struck 6pm , and my absolute favourite show ever ever ever is about to start .
Ready to Roll counts down the top 20 songs in New Zealand that week -- rankings that I obsess over with all the intensity of a Victorian actuary -- then segues into full clips of the big hits and new chart entries .
I love Ready to Roll , even when I hate the songs it plays .
And I hate a lot of them -- 1985 is not a good year to be a preteen pop fan .
Power ballads rule the airwaves and the charts are dominated by artists who are either pushing middle-age or acting like it .
That week the top 20 plays host to Dire Straits , Aretha Franklin , Stevie Wonder , Mick Jagger and David Bowie ; the turgid " Power of Love " is a huge smash for Jennifer Rush , just 25 .
But then , suddenly , there 's " Take on Me " , a giddy three-minute-45-second rush of youthfulness and joy .
It starts with a drumbeat , and then bass , and then that instantly memorable synth line kicks in .
I 'd say it 's a synth riff , but the word sounds all wrong .
In 1985 , riffs are the new sound of the Reagan era , played on electric guitars by rich guys with permed hair and pained expressions .
The debut single for a trio of young Norwegians named A-ha , " Take on Me " sounds like a throwback , an early-80s synthpop single released just a few years too late .
Its cousins are songs like The Human League 's " ( Keep Feeling ) Fascination " and Yazoo 's " Do n't Go " -- vestiges of that brief but glorious interregnum between the 70s and 80s reigns of bass , drums and electric guitar .
None of which I realise when I first hear " Take on Me " , of course .
All I know is it 's a great song for singing along to , and one that I 'll be taping off 4XO , Dunedin 's commercial radio station , at the earliest opportunity .
But what I 'm really enthralled by is the music video , a zippy comic-book romance told through rotoscoping , an animation technique that combines live action with pen and ink to produce a quasi-realistic look .
It 's a cool effect , especially for 1985 , and if you have n't seen " Take on Me " in a while I encourage you to join the more than one billion people who have watched this video since it was uploaded 10 years ago .
Back then , though , it 's not the innovative animation techniques that hold my attention .
No , it 's Morten Harket , the lead singer with a singing range as high as his perfectly sculpted cheekbones ( " I thought , how can somebody who looks like a film star sound like Roy Orbison ? This is unbelievable , " a music exec will later say of the first time he heard Harket sing ) .
He 's so beautiful it 's physically difficult to look at him ; when I inevitably Blu-tack an A-ha poster to my bedroom wall , I 'll decide that my favourite member is n't Harket , nor the equally model-like keyboardist Mags Furuholmen , but P ? l Waaktaar , the band 's main songwriter and the least aggressively handsome of the three .
When the less joyful follow-up single " The Sun Always Shines on TV " is released , I like it , too , though not as much as " Take on Me " .
Before summer is over , my brief love affair with A-ha is at an end .
I have new bands to obsess over , and only so much space on my bedroom wall .
It 's a Saturday evening sometime in the mid 90s and I 'm in a bar on the main street of Christchurch .
Every week I meet my friends here to drink and cheer as one of our group sings melancholy cover versions for the assembled crowd .
We all work in record stores -- they in a much cooler one than me -- and we all listen to the same kind of music : soaring choruses , string sections , minor keys .
We like songs about lonely hearts and broken people ; that a song has a " tinge of sadness " is the highest compliment we can pay .
Now our musician friend is singing a yearning lyric I have n't heard in years : " Oh c'm on , please now , talk to me/Tell me things I could find helpful .
" It 's " I 've Been Losing You " from A-ha 's second album Scoundrel Days , and hearing it stripped down to just acoustic guitar and voice , one thing becomes clear : this song is goddamn incredible .
At home , I delve further into A-ha 's back catalogue .
I 'll be the first to admit that a lot of the songs have n't aged well , but at their best they stand alongside the greatest pop music of the late 80s .
A-ha almost sound like their musical contemporaries , but not quite .
They 're set apart by their Europeanness ; by their weakness for dramatic flourishes that risk tipping over into histrionics ; by Harket 's incredible octave-skipping voice .
Besides " I 've Been Losing You " , I fall hard for the ridiculously operatic " Manhattan Skyline " , the propulsive " The Blood That Moves the Body " and most of all , for the stunning " Stay on These Roads " .
The title track of A-ha 's third album , " Stay on These Roads " should have been a massive hit ; failing that , it should have played beneath the end credits of that year 's biggest , most bittersweet romantic drama .
For the full " Stay on These Roads " experience , I recommend driving somewhere solitary and windswept , preferably in the rain , and playing it at full , window-rattling blast .
You could hardly feel more Nordic .
I 've kept checking in with A-ha over the decades .
After a long hiatus in the 90s , they released their comeback Minor Earth , Major Sky in 2000 , followed by a new album every few years since .
All of them are full of surprisingly solid pop-rock songs , with little of the melodrama of their late 80s pomp .
This year A-ha will mark 38 years together as a band , and tomorrow they begin a short run of dates in New Zealand , their first ever appearances here .
As much as I love A-ha , and as good as they 'll be live , I probably wo n't go to the show .
Nostalgia is a hell of a drug , and I prefer to take my dose alone , headphones on , remembering a time when I was young and pop music meant everything in the world to me .
A-ha play in the Horncastle Arena , Christchurch , on March 5 and Villa Maria Winery , Auckland , on March 7 .

&gt;233544Wild stat : Six60 's second album has been in the top 40 for five straight yearshttps : **34;635;TOOLONG .
Wed , 26 Feb 2020 02:00:24 +0000https : //thespinoff .
? p=232593Six60 are on pace to overtake Pink Floyd for one of the most formidable records in NZ chart history .
Duncan Greive breaks down their dominance .
Over the weekend , Six60 played Western Springs to around 50,000 people for the second straight year , a feat which seemed utterly unfathomable 18 months ago , but now feels routine .
This year they have added a string of other stadium dates to the monster Springs show , to create the Six60 Saturdays tour , including a huge homecoming show at Forsyth Barr Stadium in their Dunedin hometown .
The band will ultimately play to more than 2 .
of New Zealand 's population over a few weekends .
To put that in context , an equivalent number in the UK would be 1 .
people ; in the US it would be more than 8m , numbers no artist has ever approached .
" When we do NZ artist tours of around 30,000 total sales we feel we have done really well , " says promoter Brent Eccles .
" To have a tour that gets to 130,000 is a whole new level .
"  Yet Six60 's live numbers , unprecedented as they are , pale in comparison to the performance of their recorded music .
While they own NZ records for NZ artists in the live arena , they are regularly mowing down all time records for all artists in our charts , and doing so almost unnoticed .
Their presence at the upper reaches of our top 40 album chart is now so routine as to become near invisible .
This is in part a product of the streaming era , which prizes regular listening in a way which advantages modern artists over those for whom there was ultimately a unit sales ceiling .
Still , there is something about the smooth consistency of their chart presence which reveals an artist operating on a different plane .
Here are a few facts which make their dominance clear :  The second album ( Six60 ( 2 ) or the Colours album ) debuted at #1 on the NZ album chart on 9th March 2015 , and has never left the top 40  It has now spent 260 straight weeks in the top 40 , an all-time record for consecutive weeks in the chart  Six60 eclipsed Adele , the previous record holder for consecutive weeks in the chart in 2017 ( 21 spent 161 consecutive weeks on the chart ) , and is still going , sitting at #15 last week  The Six60 EP debuted at #3 on the album chart on 27th November 2017  Since then it has never left the top 20  It has now spent a record 118 consecutive weeks in the top 20 -- the lowest it 's ever been is #16  The new album Six60 ( 3 ) has had 12 weeks at #1 now , with only two brief dips away from the top  In the four months since ( 3 ) came out , there have only been two weeks when all of their four most recent albums have been in the top 20  The next milestone up ahead is arguably the chart longevity holy grail : the all-time record for the most total weeks in the chart .
This is held by a true monster of global sales , Pink Floyd 's Dark Side of the Moon , one of the five best-selling albums of all time .
It has spent just shy of six years ( 297 weeks ) in the top 40 , though that came in a number of different eras , with it re-emerging around tours and reissues .
Universal Music 's NZ chair Adam Holt says that the record will inevitably fall to Six60 .
" Six60 ( 2 ) will beat that total time quite easily -- and is likely to do it in consecutive weeks .
" There is no other international or domestic artist or act that comes close to them on chart performance .
