So long as the threat of global energy price wars remains , investors will need to factor this risk into their spreadsheets .
AP  The resulting collapse in oil and gas prices might normally be a cause for celebration , at least among consumers .
Trouble is , the short-term sugar hit is likely to be followed by a tightening of supply and a commensurate longer-term hike in prices .
Strategically this highlights the enduring vulnerability of the oil market to political interference and the debilitating effects of such uncertainty on the investment needed to decarbonise energy systems over the coming decades .
Oil price shocks roll around the world every few years with the frequency of a haphazard Olympic Games .
They are triggered by a combination of geopolitical instability , growing demand from developing economies and naked self-interest .
Advertisement  A unifying economic theme of many major oil producing nations , particularly in the Middle East and Russia , is that they are heavily dependent on the export revenues from oil to run their country .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was created to execute their preferred commercial strategy : sell as little oil as possible at the highest price possible .
This banked as much oil in the ground as possible , like a super fund , while balancing the national budget .
To achieve this , the major oil producing nations agreed to restrict supply at the same time .
The resulting OPEC oil shock in 1973 more than tripled crude oil prices and sent much of the developed world into recession .
Markets reacted to this shock by reducing demand where possible , switching to smaller , more fuel-efficient cars and by developing technologies to reduce dependence on oil imports .
The $US100 billion wind turbine industry was created not to fix climate change , but to reduce oil consumption .
Oil prices spiked again in 2008 , when surging demand growth from China and India outstripped supply .
For a moment some speculated the world had hit peak oil , but instead it unleashed a supply response : the development of vast unconventional shale oil and gas reserves across the US .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic implications .
Importantly , it has weakened the ability of other oil and gas majors to control prices , and therefore preserve their oil reserves .
But US shale has a weakness : it is high-cost oil production that needs oil prices above $US50 a barrel to break even .
Many shale oil developers are also highly leveraged .
Their exposure to high debt levels means they can not withstand sustained low oil prices for long .
OPEC nations and Russia were reported to have attempted to kill off the US shale industry in 2014 by increasing production to tank prices .
Their plan backfired , ending up hurting smaller oil exporters like Venezuela and Nigeria more .
The coronavirus connection  The difference this time is the coronavirus .
It has already softened oil and gas demand , with the Chinese economy slowing as China attempts to prevent further outbreaks .
Global energy demand is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2020 .
At an expanded OPEC meeting last Friday , Russia announced it would not cut production to match falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Their ability to suppress prices in a weakened market was demonstrated by the rapid response : oil prices fell to around $US30 a barrel .
This is a brand new type of oil crisis : a confected price slump in an already weak market to try to take higher-cost supply out of the market .
If it succeeds , prices will reset higher in the medium term .
Until then , or if it fails , energy producers will be hit and global energy markets destabilised .

Cheaper petrol prices and power bills in Australia are welcome , but likely to be short lived .
It will only be temporary relief , while the resulting uncertainty will risk delaying or impairing electricity generation investment .
So long as the threat of global energy price wars remains , investors will need to factor this risk into their spreadsheets .
It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments to both deliver energy security and decarbonise .
