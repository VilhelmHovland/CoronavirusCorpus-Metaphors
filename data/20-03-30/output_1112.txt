As the sports world came to an abrupt stop due to the coronavirus pandemic , a few athletics companies have pivoted to help the medical community .
The more the virus is spreading , the more hospitals , nurses and doctors are searching for personal protective equipment , including masks , gowns and face shields to keep themselves protected .
Companies traditionally based in athletics have heard that call and are now doing their part to pitch in .
Fanatics Inc .
has been one of the companies on the forefront of this subject .
Fanatics produces the official jerseys for Major League Baseball and retailers but announced it will halt production of jerseys to make nonsurgical-grade , single-use masks and gowns for doctors , nurses and healthcare personnel on the frontline battling the virus .
Editor 's Picks  Michael Rubin , the company 's chairman , met with MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and asked him what he would think about shutting down production of baseball jerseys and donating close to a million masks and gowns .
Manfred thought it was a great idea , so Fanatics repurposed its 360,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Easton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This unprecedented public health emergency has compelled our country to be more collaborative , innovative and strategic than ever before , " Rubin said .
" As the demand for masks and gowns has surged , we 're fortunate to have teamed up with Major League Baseball to find a unique way to support our front-line workers in this fight to stem the virus , who are in dire need of critical supplies .
"  Fanatics began producing the masks and gowns on Wednesday and is now making close to 10,000 a day .
It has also partnered with local hospital St .
Luke 's in Bethlehem , Pennsylvania , as well as the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency , to help distribute the gowns and masks .
( Thread ) :  Woke up in the middle of the night last week with idea of converting our @Fanatics factory in PA that makes official @MLB jerseys into a facility that makes much needed masks and gowns and then donating them to help fight this horrendous virus .

Bauer Hockey traditionally produces hockey equipment , some of which includes plastic face masks for helmets , but felt compelled to help as well .
Naturally , the company thought it would make sense to produce bigger plastic face shields for doctors and nurses using similar materials .
Bauer partnered with Cascade Lacrosse to produce medical face shields at facilities in Blainville , Quebec , and Liverpool , New York , and has since received over 1 million orders for them .
According to Bauer vice president of global marketing Mary-Kay Messier , the company has received orders from nurses , doctors , Massachusetts General Hospital and the chief medical officer of Yale , who represents many hospitals , among others .
" Nurses and doctors are pleading for these masks , and they are n't waiting for their institutions to get them to them , " Messier said .
" The fact that these people are going to work every day , risking their lives and do n't ever think about it but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Protection that allows athletes to give everything for their team is our heritage .
Right now , we 're all on the same team .
We 're repurposing our facilities to make face shields so that medical professionals battling COVID-19 can safely continue to help those most vulnerable .
**26;149;TOOLONG  Bauer called on other companies to do the same , and even shared a diagram showing how the face shields are made so that other manufacturers can produce them , too .
" We need this to be more important , " Messier said .
" It 's great for small companies , but we need a mandate because companies like us , it 's hard to reconfigure your entire manufacturing .
I think a lot of us are doing it , and it helps make a difference , but we need more than that .
"  Bauer said it has heard from thousands of medical professionals , nurses and hospital executives to place orders .
Over a million orders came in the first 48 hours after the initiative was launched .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people around a cry , and I 'm hopeful the things people are doing will bring another angle to it , " Messier said .
" We 've asked our athletes to get on board to tell the story of what Bauer is doing and call on other companies to do the same .
Everybody that 's doing anything to protect people right now are in need of this protective equipment , particularly a shield because it protects the eyes , mouth and skin from being contaminated .
"  New Balance also announced it will allocate a portion of its manufacturing workforce to developing face masks to address the significant demand for supplies .
All hands on deck .
Our U .

Nike president and CEO John Donahoe announced during the company 's earnings call that the shoe and apparel giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a face-shield prototype .
" Companies like Nike need to do our part .

" Based on needs identified by the teams and health professionals at Oregon Health &amp; Science University , our teammates are working right now about how to best help , including prototyping face shields of OHSU and others .
It 's been so energizing to see the quick-strike efforts of the cross-functional team to try to help with this critical need .
"  Zero Restriction , which is known for creating waterproof apparel with cutting-edge technology , also announced it has approval to begin production on protective masks .
Its creative director developed the first prototype out of a disassembled polo shirt less than a week ago , and the company will now begin production to distribute its first 1,000 masks to local fire and police departments .
While not every company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , other brands are stepping up to help raise funds .
