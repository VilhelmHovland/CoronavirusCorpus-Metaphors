In addition to delivering food , the Illawarra branches of Meals on Wheels are also distributing another essential household item to their clients - toilet paper .
The service is also reporting a " surge " in applications due to the coronavirus pandemic ; both from clients and volunteers wanting to help .
Woolworths is donating four-packs of toilet paper to Meals on Wheels to give to clients , which the service began distributing last week during their regular deliveries .
" Many of them are very grateful because they 're unable to get to the shopping centres to buy their own , and there 's usually none available in the shopping centres anyway , " Bruce Kafer , president of the Port Kembla Meals on Wheels committee said .
This is n't the only modification Meals on Wheels Illawarra have made to their operations due to COVID-19 .
Sarah Callaway , manager of Wollongong Meals on Wheels said they 'd reduced their deliveries to two days a week , instead of Monday to Friday .
They are also now only delivering frozen meals .
" We have also had a huge increase in people ringing up wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mercury .
" We 've had a huge surge in numbers of clients .
" We 've also had a surge in volunteer recruitment .
" There are lots of people who have been put off their jobs who are wanting to volunteer with us , which has been really good .
" She said measures in place included that volunteers delivering the meals were no longer to enter the clients ' homes , and instead were to pass the meals through the door to them where possible .
Volunteers making deliveries use wipes , hand sanitizer , gloves and face masks .
" Volunteers are no longer allowed to come into our office , " she said .
" Myself and another staff member , we pack all the meals , we get them ready for delivery .
We 've had to schedule all our volunteers an allotted time when they have to come and collect their meals , instead of them all being in the reception area at the same time .
" Meanwhile , Mr Kafer said Meals on Wheels is considered an essential service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they had also implemented strict hygiene protocols during deliveries , with hand santizing wipes and gloves used .
" We 're only delivering frozen meals to the clients ; that 's just to reduce risks associated with handling food and so forth , " Mr Kafer said .
" The frozen meals can be packed and ready to go either the night before or morning before , without any kind of preparation required .
" That also reduces the number of staff that are required in the facilities to do the work .
