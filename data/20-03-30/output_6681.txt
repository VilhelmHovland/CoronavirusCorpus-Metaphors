The pair had first started scooping up the supplies on March 1 , a day after the first coronavirus-related death in the United States was announced .
Noah spent three days cleaning store shelves of all their stock -- first at Walmart , Dollar Tree , Home Depot and Staples in the Chattanooga area with Matt by his side , and then alone , at other stores across Tennessee and into Kentucky .
In the end , Noah had driven 1,300 miles and filled a U-Haul truck to the brim .
Matt , meanwhile , prepped for pallets of even more wipes and sanitizer he had ordered online .
They went on to list 300 bottles of hand sanitizer on Amazon , selling them for between $8 and $70 each .
" It was crazy money , " Matt said to the newspaper .
But Amazon caught wind of what they were up to , and the next day , banned their account , warning of price gauging .
EBay followed suit .
" It 's been a huge amount of whiplash , " Matt told The New York Times .
" From being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going could potentially put my family in a really good place financially to ' What the heck am I going to do with all of this ? ' "  " If by my actions anyone was directly impacted and unable to get sanitizer because I purchased it all , I am truly sorry for that , " he told the outlet .
Matt had similar things to say to the Times , in a follow up interview .
" It was never my intention to keep necessary medical supplies out of the hands of people who needed them , " he confessed , crying .
" That 's not who I am as a person .
And all I 've been told for the last 48 hours is how much of that person I am .
"  Meanwhile , the Tennessee attorney general 's office have sent Matt and Noah a cease-and-desist letter for triggering an anti-price gouging law , WDRB reported .
" We will not tolerate price gouging in this time of exceptional need , and we will take aggressive action to stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a statement .
