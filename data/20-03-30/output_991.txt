DOMINIC Raab has announced a ? 75 million international arrangement with commercial airlines to airlift " tens of thousands " of Britons stranded abroad because of the coronavirus pandemic .
The Foreign Secretary told the daily Downing St press conference : " We 've not faced challenges like this in getting people home from abroad on this scale in recent memory .
"  But in response Labour claimed the UK Government 's efforts were neither comprehensive nor full-funded and were simply " not good enough " .
Mr Raab said as countries closed borders to protect their citizens from the infection , an unprecedented number of UK travellers , running into hundreds of thousands , had been trying to get home .
Hundreds of thousands of British nationals have already successfully returned home , including 150,000 from Spain , 8,500 from Morocco , 5,000 from Cyprus , a similar number from Bali , and around 4,000 from Jamaica .
On Monday morning , two repatriation flights carrying just under 500 Britons arrived at Heathrow Airport from Peru .
But Mr Raab acknowledged there were still many thousands of Britons stranded abroad , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and families .
It is estimated there are some 30,000 people seeking to return to the UK from Australia alone .
The Secretary of State explained airlines would be responsible for getting passengers home where commercial routes remained an option and urged travellers : " Do n't wait .
Do n't run the risk of getting stranded .
The airlines are standing by to help you ; please book your tickets as soon as possible .
"  However , where regular commercial flights were not available , Mr Raab said the new arrangement with airlines would kick in with chartered flights targeted at a " range of priority countries , " starting this week .
It is thought these include India , Pakistan , Australia and New Zealand .
Partner airlines would include British Airways , Virgin , easyJet , Jet2 and Titan but the list could be expanded .
The Foreign Secretary said once special charter flights had been arranged , they would be promoted through the Government 's travel advice and by the British Embassy in the relevant country .
UK travellers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly through a dedicated travel management company .
" We have designated ? 75m to support those flights and the airlines to keep the costs down and affordable for those seeking to return to the UK , " said Mr Raab .
He also pointed out how there had been unprecedented demand on the Foreign Office 's helplines ; on average the department 's call centre , available for those who could not find the advice they required in the Government 's online travel advice or from British embassies , was getting 1,000 calls a day but last Tuesday it had nearly 15,000 , a record number .
The Cabinet minister revealed staffing had now been tripled to help deal with the avalanche of calls .
" I know it has been difficult to get through for some travellers , " he acknowledged but Mr Raab noted : " Yesterday , the call centre answered 99 per cent of calls and helped thousands of British travellers get the answers they need .
"  But Emily Thornberry for Labour severely criticised the Government strategy , insiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of Britons around the world .
" We were promised a new strategy on repatriations today but for the hundreds of thousands of Brits stranded abroad and their families back home , it was just more of the same .
" More reliance on commercial flights , which - for too many British travellers based in too many locations - are simply not an option at present .
More vague promises about charter flights ? but none of the commitment or urgency other countries like Germany have put into this .
" More expressions of support for our Brits abroad but no answers to any of the specific problems they are raising , from the loss of travel insurance and accommodation to dwindling supplies of medicine and money .
"  Ther Shadow Foreign Secretary added : " We need a comprehensive and fully-funded strategy to bring our British nationals home , using every option at the Government 's disposal and to give them all the practical support and help they need in the interim .
" That is not what we got today and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alyn Smith for the SNP welcomed the Government 's package of support .
" I have been pressing the Foreign Office to do all that it can to help our constituents who are stuck abroad in challenging circumstances and , while the announcement should have come much sooner , the ? 75m package is a positive step , " he declared .
Mr Smith noted how the UK had thus far only organised limited flights from limited routes , leaving many vulnerable people trapped without access to information , access to healthcare or accommodation , and under increased financial strain .
" I will continue to work with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to ensure people receive the support and travel arrangements necessary , so that they are able to return swiftly and safely to their families and loved ones ; and to ensure that no one is left behind , " added the Nationalists ' Foreign Affairs spokesman .
Meanwhile , Sir Ed Davey , the acting Liberal Democrat leader , also welcomed the Government 's partnership with the airlines to charter rescue flights but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to return home , wherever they have been stranded , without exception .
"  He insisted questions remained about why the Government 's airlift announcement had taken so long .
" Thousands have been seeking urgent assistance for weeks as borders have closed .
The delay has caused huge amounts of worry both for those stuck overseas and their families and friends in the UK , " he added .
Also at the press conference , Mr Raab , asked about comments made by Lord Sumption , the former UK Supreme Court justice , suggesting parts of the country were turning into a " police state " , said it was important to follow the " letter and the spirit " of Government guidance .
He called for a " common sense " approach from the police but stressed : " I have got huge admiration for the incredible job all of our emergency services are doing , including the police .
"  Asked if China , where the pandemic started , would face a " reckoning " as reported at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop any further waves of the virus but added , post crisis , it would be necessary to have a " lessons learnt " inquiry led by the World Health Organisation .
Mr Raab pointed how he was " feeling terrific " after three fellow Cabinet members were forced to self-isolate , including Boris Johnson , but made clear the Prime Minister had shown " vigour " at the daily Covid-19 Government meeting on Monday .
On Tuesday , Mr Johnson will chair a Cabinet from No 10 with ministers attending via video-link .
