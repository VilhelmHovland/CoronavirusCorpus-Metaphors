The minister joins Clement Manyathela on the Midday Report to chat about what people need to know about the noval coronavirus .
We must just be concerned that we have the virus in the country , but the concerned must not cause us to panic .
The concern means we must be determined get rid of it , that means we must all do as asked .
-- Zweli Mkhize , Minister - Health  There are ways of reducing the impact of the infection and there are ways of reducing the spread of the virus , he adds .
Mkhize says even though he is concerned about the sharp increase in the infections , the steps that the government has taken are aimed at reducing the number of people that are infected and ultimately defeat COVID-19 .
About 75% of infections are accounted for by people who have either travelled out of South Africa or those who are returning South Africans and those who are visiting the country .
We knew that it was going to be the starting phase of the infection , later we are going to start having contacts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mkhize , Minister - Health  South Africa is at that phase and that is why President Cyril Ramaphosa and Cabinet took a serious decision to take drastic action to reduce the internal transmission .
Everyone needs to take responsibility for ensuring that this virus does n't continue to spread .
We are at a place where all the resources are being counted , whether from the public sector and the private sector as what we have to fight the virus .
-- Zweli Mkhize , Minister - Health  The minister says government is working very closely with the private sector to ensure that all the information gathered from private laborites goes to the national health laboratory centre .
Hospital beds , we are accounting for everyone , if you are admitted at a public hospital or private hospital , it is the same , you are admitted .
When you get to ICU , we will do our own internal arrangement between government and the private sector .
-- Zweli Mkhize , Minister - Health  Testing is done on the basis of clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then refer the person into testing .
We expect that all those who have gone for testing should fit the criteria .
The criteria is that someone must either have travelled to a high-risk country or has been in contact with a person that has travelled .
They must also have symptoms .
-- Zweli Mkhize , Minister - Health  The projections of how long the country will battle the virus are fairly wide , he says .
The lockdown is about stopping the spread of this infection , we expect everyone to just stay at home .
We discourage people from travelling .
We believe that what is important is to cut the movement of people in a way that you decrease the chances of catching the virus .
-- Zweli Mkhize , Minister - Health  Even though he prefers that people must stay at home during the lockdown , if people were to go out and jog , it has to be for a shot distance and it must n't be with a crowd , he says .
People ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit as a group and start boozing together , then smoking together and then you are coughing together .
Even in-house you have to observe certain basic hygiene and social distance .
You can stop the virus by observing what government said needs to be observed .
-- Zweli Mkhize , Minister - Health  He says if a person finds a church operating , that person has the right to notify the police .
