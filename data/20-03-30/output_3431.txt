Rhys McEndry was bagpacking around Peru when the whole country was put on lock down  4  People face jail time for trying to leave the hostel without permissionCredit : AFP or licensors  4  Two people in Rhys 's hostel have tested positive for the virusCredit : AP:Associated Press  He and others staying at the Pariwana hostel in the city of Cusco were told they could leave and go to other accommodation if they wished while awaiting authorities to unseal the borders .
However , further bad news struck when two guests at the hostel tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday - and armed soldiers were placed at the door of the building to keep everyone inside .
' NOBODY 'S ALLOWED OUT '  Irish passport holder Rhys , from Belfast , told the Irish Sun : " In the announcement , they said , it was a minimum of 28 days and it could be a maximum of three months .
" That 's 28 days from day of testing , which was Monday .
" You 're not allowed to go to the supermarket , the pharmacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically told to stay in your rooms all day for 23 hours .
" When you do leave , you 're meant to have a mask on .
We 've been given our own plate and cutlery and we 're lucky in our dorm that we have an ensuite , but we essentially have to come up with a rota for people to go to the bathroom .
" The two that have it , they started to show serious symptoms and the hostel put them into separate private dorms and called in doctors .
" The rest of us are in dorms , some have 14 of them , the one I booked was supposed to have six , but two of them were from Mexico and they got to leave on Friday and go home because Mexico was clearly on the ball in organising repatriation flights .
ARMED POLICE  " In the hostel in total , there 's about 140 in total including staff .
" I read a lot back home and I 've had access to a library app so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Netflix as well and I 'm just trying to do my workouts as well .
" We had yoga classes , which were a great way to clear the head , but they 're gone now since the quarantine kicked in .
" Just because everyone 's been travelling for a while , everyone 's got that backpacker mentality , but once that announcement came out , people started crying when they heard they 'd be here for at least 25 days .
" Everyone went back to their rooms and just sat there .
" Up to then , there was the hope of the flights home spurring everyone on .
" I 've been talking to the embassy in Chile , but they have no idea if I can get out before the quarantine has ended .
" There are two armed guys from either the police or the army at the door and they 're not letting anyone leave .
" If the embassy say I can leave for a flight , it 's then up to the guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  BEER CONFISCATED  " We 've been told if we 're caught trying to leave without permission , it 's between five and ten years in prison .
" The supermarkets stopped selling beer once the quarantine came in .
We were allowed to go to the supermarkets for 30 minutes and whenever you went in , they had police tape all around the alcohol section .
" In the hostel , they were still selling beer so at least we could look forward to having a few beers with people in the evening .
" But then the police came in and said ' no , you ca n't do that ' and it was all taken away .
" The food was quite good originally , but now it really has started to become like prison food .
" I got some chicken and it was basically just all bones .
We got rice that was all hard and then a slop of mashed potato .
Then for dinner , we were given this sweet oatmeal that we 'd had for breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning .
" It 's not even the fact the food 's disgusting , it 's more like , we 're trying to fight a virus here and we 're not getting any fruit or vegetables .
' STAY POSITIVE '  " I tried to get a bottle of water this morning and the hostel had run out and I 'm currently drinking boiled water .
" It looks like I 'm going to spend my 22nd birthday in here .
I 've been reading some of the comments on articles back home and people are saying ' it 's your own fault ' .
But the point is , when I arrived in Peru , they had about 30 cases , all in Lima .
So I thought , if I get to Cusco , I 'll be away from it and next thing I know the country 's shut down and we 're told we ca n't leave .
" After about three or four days in lockdown , the British and Irish embassies got back to us and said Avianca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be between 3,000 and 3,300 dollars .
And you could fly business class if you wanted for 7,500 dollars .
