Workers at Amazon 's Staten Island , New York , fulfillment center walked out today to protest the company 's response to COVID-19 infections among its warehouse employees .
Amazon has confirmed one case of COVID-19 at the New York facility , but workers say there have been at least 10 and that the company has failed to notify workers or properly clean the warehouse .
Now , they are calling for Amazon to shut down the facility for two weeks for deep cleaning .
" The goal is to get that building shut down , and they will shut it down , because no packages , nothing gets out the building without associates , " says Derrick Palmer , who has worked at the facility , JFK8 , for four and a half years .
" This is a pandemic .
People are literally losing their lives because of this virus .
And Amazon is not taking this seriously .
They 're not giving us our respect that we demand .
We 're not going to ask for it .
We 're going to demand it , because at the end of the day , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the managers .
They 're back in the office .
We 're in the front lines working .
"  Amazon has closed facilities only when forced to do so by government order or worker protest  Workers at 19 US Amazon warehouses have tested positive for COVID-19 , according to local news reports .
So far , Amazon has closed facilities only when forced to do so by government order or worker protest .
Last week , the company indefinitely closed a returns processing warehouse in Shepherdsville , Kentucky , after three workers tested positive and the governor ordered it shuttered .
On March 18th , a sortation center in Queens , New York , was temporarily closed for cleaning after workers walked out upon learning of a positive COVID-19 case .
Employees learned about the case from co-workers and say they had been expected to come to work .

Last week , The Verge spoke with workers at several warehouses across the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Palmer says the first case was confirmed on March 12th , but workers were only told several days afterward when managers walked the floor and told employees in person .
But the facility is staffed by more than 4,000 workers and is 855,000 square feet , so many learned of the incident through hearsay much later .
Amazon has a strong infrastructure for keeping its warehouse employees informed .
For example , when the company announces mandatory overtime , Palmer points out , the company sends out texts and emails to every worker .
" With this incident , they have not sent out one text -- nothing at all , " Palmer says .
Amazon says it has intensified the cleaning of its warehouses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic , but workers at JFK8 and elsewhere say the measures fall far short of what 's needed .
Palmer says shifts of about a dozen cleaners work at JFK8 , too few to properly disinfect such an enormous building .
( Workers in other warehouses in the US have expressed similar concerns about understaffing of cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staggered schedules to minimize workers clustering together , certain roles in the warehouse , like the packing department , still require employees to stand in close proximity , and workers often pass items between each other .
JFK8 is the first major action at an Amazon fulfillment center  " The way that the department is set up , everyone is on top of each other , " Palmer says .
" It is literally impossible to maintain the social distance within those departments , and they have n't been practiced , they have n't tried to adjust that at all because there 's no way they can do it .
"  Image : Make the Road NY  In Italy and Spain , where COVID-19 outbreaks have been spreading longer , Amazon refused to shut down facilities after workers became infected , prompting protests .
Earlier this month , a group of senators wrote a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos expressing concern for the safety of Amazon workers and asking , among other things , whether the company would temporarily shut down facilities and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
A petition among workers calling for a similar approach has garnered more than 1,500 signatures .
The workers at JFK8 are also calling for paid leave while the facility is shut down for cleaning .
In a statement , Amazon called the workers ' claims " unfounded " and said its employees are " heroes .
" The company is taking worker safety extremely seriously and has instituted several changes , the company said , including intensifying cleaning and screening worker temperatures .
Regarding closing buildings , the company said it consults with health authorities and medical experts , and if a diagnosed worker has n't been in the building for some time or if the area where they worked has already been cleaned during the regular course of business , the facility may not need to be closed .
The pandemic has shown a spotlight on the role of workers at Amazon , Instacart , and other goods-delivering tech companies .
No longer laboring in the background of digital interfaces , they 're increasingly being recognized as frontline workers providing a vital service to millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies are trying to hire tens of thousands more people to meet surging demand .
Amazon is giving its workers letters to carry saying they are " essential " employees , delivering " critical supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them " and should be allowed to continue their jobs amid shutdowns .
But the pandemic also exposes these workers to new risks , and workers say companies have been slow to adjust policies and protections .
Instacart and Amazon now offer workers diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine two weeks ' paid leave , but that does n't help workers who have COVID-19 symptoms but ca n't get tested .
Amazon warehouses have been optimized for speed and efficiency , and workers say the intense pace leaves them little time to use cleaning material that is often in short supply .

Workers at Whole Foods , which is also owned by Amazon and faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks the first major action at an Amazon fulfillment center , and workers at Amazon warehouses across the country have expressed similar concerns .
" Alexa , please shut down and sanitize the building .
"  Shutting down a fulfillment center for a prolonged period would threaten Amazon 's ability to continue delivering products , but refusing to do so and failing to assure employees their safety is being taken seriously pose potentially greater threats to the company .
Already , workers are staying home rather than venturing into crowded warehouses , choosing to forgo pay that Amazon recently increased rather than risk getting infected .
Delivery times for some items now stretch to a month or more .
Now , at JFK8 , workers frustrated with the company 's coronavirus response are trying to shut down the facility themselves .
Around 1PM on March 30th , workers filed out of the New York warehouse , many wearing masks and bandanas over their faces .
" Alexa , please shut down and sanitize the building , " read one of the signs .
On a live stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told about infections at the warehouse and said many were choosing to stay home without pay .
" We 're not done here .
Today was a cry for help , " said Chris Smalls , a worker at the facility and one of the walkout organizers , wearing a black bandana as he addressed protesters .
" Today was a win for us , but it 's a battle and the war is not over .
We 're going to go to City Hall possibly tomorrow morning .
We 've got to get the government 's attention .
Just like in Kentucky , the government has to step in and close the building down .
"  Update 8PM ET : After the protest , Amazon fired Chris Smalls , one of the organizers of the walkout .
The company said Smalls was fired for violating safety regulations , including violating a 14-day quarantine after coming in contact with an employee diagnosed with COVID-19 .
Smalls disputed the company 's claim and said he was fired for retaliation .
" I am outraged and disappointed , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" As usual , Amazon would rather sweep a problem under the rug than act to keep workers and working communities safe .
