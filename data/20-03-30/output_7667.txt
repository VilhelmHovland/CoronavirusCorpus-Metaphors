This Delawarean landed on HBO 's ' Westworld ' -- just as coronavirus struck the U .
It was six minutes after the first episode of the new season of HBO 's " Westworld " ended when New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio announced that all restaurants and bars had to shut down dine-in service the next day .
For actor and Wilmington native John Gallagher Jr .
, who lives in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tuxedoed Liam Dempsey Jr .
, it was just as strange a moment as it sounds .
" I flew out to Los Angeles for the premiere on March 5 and the screening was well attended and the after party was packed , " Gallagher described to Delaware Online/The News Journal via email .
" By the time the episode aired on the 15th , they were announcing the closure of all bars and restaurants in New York .
It was hard to believe that just a week before I had been in a big room full of people .
" That feels so foreign now .

He even gave an update on his parents , John and June Gallagher , longtime folk Delaware musicians who still live in the Wilmington area .
Q : How did this role come about ?  A : The showrunners , Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy , reached out to my agent about the role and I ended up Skyping with them to discuss it since I live in New York and the show films in Los Angeles .
" Westworld " is a very secretive operation so I could n't read any of the script .
Instead they just pitched the character to me .
I was intrigued and I ended up saying yes .
Q : When did you film ?  A : I filmed on and off in Los Angeles from March to September of 2019 .
Q : What was the experience like ?  A : It was wild .
It 's very surreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swing .
The intricacy and the scope of the production design was really something to behold .

Each episode is like a mini hourlong movie .
Q : I was thinking it would be interesting to suddenly be on that show considering a lot of it is about what 's real and what 's not .
I could imagine being on the set and seeing Dolores would be a little mind-bending .
A : It was a trip ! Evan Rachel Wood is so stellar on the show .
She really has the character of Dolores completely locked in .
She can slip in and out of it at the drop of a hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallagher Jr .

Joan Marcus/AP  Q : Was this the first time joining an already established show with an extended role like this ?  A : I 've never really done a sizable arc on a running series before so I was pretty nervous joining the team for this season .
There are so many actors and artists involved in the show that I admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them .

Johnson/HBO )  Q : Aaron Paul and Marshawn Lynch were newbies , too .
Did you run into them at all during filming ?  A : Yeah I got to hang on set a bit with Aaron and Marshawn .
Aaron is a total sweetheart .
Just one of the most enthusiastic and positive people I 've ever worked with .
Marshawn is hilarious and a real force of nature .
Obviously he 's an amazing athlete and now he can add acting to his resume as well .
Q : I would assume that in terms of visibility , this project is high up there in terms of your career , maybe with " 10 Cloverfield Lane " ?  A : It 's definitely a show with a robust and loyal viewership .
A lot of folks tune in for this one .
It 's nice to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely done my fair share of projects where the opposite was true .

( Photo : The News Journal/WILLIAM BRETZGER , The News Journal/WILLIAM BRETZGER )  Q : What 's life been like since the " Westworld " premiere ? There are so many coronavirus cases there in New York City .
A : My heart goes out to the doctors , nurses , EMTs , hospital staff and all emergency workers .
They 're doing everything they can to save so many lives .
It 's hard to imagine a more selfless group of people in the world right now .
Real life superheroes .
I am so much of a homebody that I am not struggling too hard with the self isolating and quarantining .
I live not too far from a hospital in Brooklyn that is getting hit pretty hard so I hear a lot of sirens lately .
Q : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? What do you do inside ?  A : I have n't been outside in a week .
When I do go out it 's only for a quick trip to the grocery store .
I 've been really strict with myself about the social distancing .
As much as I miss walking in the park near my apartment , I just stay home .
I 've been watching a lot of movies and spending way too much time staring at my phone .
Q : And , finally , how are your parents doing in all of this ?  A : They 're hanging tough as always ! I check in with them every day to make sure they 're OK .
My sister got them a Roku for Christmas so I think they 're keeping themselves occupied .
