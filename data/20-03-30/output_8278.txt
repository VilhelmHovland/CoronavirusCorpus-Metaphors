Nurses Are the Coronavirus Heroes  They marinate in risk as they spend more time than anyone else tending to patients .

It 's 1 a .
A nurse I have known for a long time said to me as she left the shift , " In 18 years , I never felt the need to take a shower in the staff locker room so I could feel safe to go home .
" Earlier she was at the bedside in a negative pressure room , wearing a powered air-purifying respirator as she helped intubate a possible coronavirus patient who 'd crashed .
The precaution and gear make the work feel more dangerous .
" Will that equipment be enough , " she asks , " to keep the virus out of my body ? "  Nurses are the underappreciated heroes of this crisis .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the department after her shift .
" I am anxious for the first time in my life , " she said .
" I 'm usually the face of calm .
I tell family members of patients , ' Look at my face , when this face gets worried , then you worry .
' "  Our department 's nursing leadership led the charge by working with hospital administrators and the disaster-preparedness team to set up , within hours , a screening tent outside our two San Diego emergency departments .
This newly created care area off-loaded many cases that would have entered the emergency department , endangering others and burdening our inner system .
If you wonder who actually sticks the swabs into the noses of worried patients , it 's the nurses .
They 're on the front line , face-to-face , in the 6-foot danger zone .
They are collecting the data that epidemiologists use to track the outbreak .
Moving in and out of negative-pressure rooms , putting protective equipment on and taking it off , nurses are caring for elderly patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marinate in risk as they spend the greatest amount of time with the patient .
They draw blood , obtain samples , provide oxygen , and steadfastly tend to their patients ' needs .
They are by the doctors ' side as we intubate patients struggling to breathe .
Once that patient is transferred to the intensive-care unit , it 's the nurses who do the mundane and the heroic to make sure the patient survives the illness or dies more comfortably .
How critical are nurses to the capacity of the health system ? The number of nurses staffing the hospital determines its capacity .
An absence because of a sick call or child care closes three beds .
Understaffed floor beds result in boarding in the emergency department , and that creates a waiting-room backup .
I thank everyone who 's working to help get through this .
I commend the scientists at big pharmaceutical companies who are developing better tests and vaccines .
I thank the teachers setting up remote classes and the managers making tough business decisions .
Everyone is playing a part -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr .
