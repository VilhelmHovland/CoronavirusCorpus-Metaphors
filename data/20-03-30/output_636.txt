Now is usually the time that broadcast networks would be consumed by pilot season -- the annual practice of ordering scores of scripts to develop into the next This is Us or Mom , while simultaneously fighting each other to snag the most appealing group of actors to headline their new fall shows .
But this year , none of that is happening .
Ever since the TV industry made the collective decision to shut down production in an effort to prevent further spread of the coronavirus , the pilot season has ceased to exist .
Nothing new is in the can .
Nothing new is even in the works .
Given all that , the networks have canceled their annual May upfront presentations to advertisers in New York .
" It 's unprecedented , " reflects media buyer Andy Donchin .
" We had the writers ' strike , the horrible events of 9/11 , the ' 09 recession .
But those events happened and it did n't change the market all that much , two or three weeks maybe .
But this is much more unprecedented .
Long term , it 's going to initiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Since no one can say when it will be safe to resume production on pilots , the networks can only set a tentative fall lineup based on what they currently have on air .
That means bubble shows that would normally get the boot in May could get a second lease on life .
Though one Big Four network executive admits it 's " a very unsexy fall launch , not having anything new , " the networks could at least present Madison Avenue with a solid schedule in order to sell ads .
And there 's still a chance a few new shows could make it to broadcast by September , since several projects like The Lincoln Lawyer at CBS and thirtysomething(else) at ABC have already been ordered straight to series .
But what about all those scripts that were ordered to pilot in the last few months ? The executive says the networks are hoping for a summer start date : " We 're planning for July , praying for June .
" Those pilots could then be considered for a midseason launch , meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back half of the TV season -- may be in order .
Until then , the work stoppage has wreaked havoc on the current schedule , as many shows -- including Grey 's Anatomy and The Walking Dead -- have had to wrap their seasons earlier than planned .
But viewers are still getting plenty of new shows to sample , offers one Big Four honcho , like Council of Dads on NBC and Broke on CBS .
" It 's fairly remarkable what we 're doing .
Most people would n't know the difference watching any of the networks on a given night , " the exec says .
" We 're putting new episodes on .
Some of these shows have done miracles .
The crazy thing for some of the last episodes of these shows is that post-production houses have shut down .
So even though the episodes were shot , getting them into post and finishing them has been crazy .
They 've gotten really creative .
They are editing in garages and doing sound mixes in people 's basements .
