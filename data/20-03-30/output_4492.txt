As the initial shock is dying down and everyone is settling into lockdown , various types of Capetonians have emerged showing their true isolation colours .
Everyone handles strange situations differently , and everyone copes with being home this much in their own unique way .
We 're all about Cape Town and her people , so here are the different kinds of lockdowners out there in the Mother City :  1 .
The Darth Vaders  These lockdowners take it very seriously , and you wo n't catch them setting foot outside their door .
They may also be the ones shouting at others in Facebook comment sections about how appropriate it is to wear a mask .
They know all the news , are updated on the stats and spend their free time making hand santizer .
The socialites  They are used to going out every night , always made plans over weekends and are now having an exceptionally hard time without the usual Caprice or Modular jol .
You 'll see these lockdowners sporting a fashionable outfit to the store and posting about every group Skype , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the centre of their social circle .
The jokesters  South Africans are known for their sense of humour and while a pandemic is no laughing matter , it does n't hurt to see the lighter side of things .
That 's why these lockdowners will be bringing on the jokes .
The positivity activists  It wo n't do to sulk , and so we 're especially appreciative of those keeping us looking on the bright side and spreading the positivity .
Whether it 's a calming meditation app or repeated posts on social media about how best to look at the opportunities the lockdown has given you , these lockdowners are spreading the positivity and light , whether you like it or not .
The fitness freaks  Never mind that all the Virgin Actives are closed , you ca n't even go run on the prom ! Those who exercise regularly are feeling the restriction , but have decided to dedicate themselves to at-home fitness , which is of course documented at every opportunity .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more than before lockdown .
The hungry-all-the-time  Have you noticed your friends all suddenly making bread ? It seems lockdown has brought out the snack expertise in many .
With the fridge just being around the corner , it 's hard for food-lovers to keep the cravings at bay .
These are the kinds of people who ran out of their lockdown snacks on day one .
You know who you are .
There 's a saying that goes " It 's 5 ' o clock somewhere .
" and some Capetonians are taking that this literally .
It is a global pandemic after all .
Whether it 's a breakfast mimosa , a beer before lunch or a fruity cocktail , because you know , you deserve it .
A little ( or a lot ) goes a long way to helping them feel like they 're on an exotic vacation .
We can all get a little sucked in at times , and with your favourite series just waiting one click away , well .
who can blame them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-forgotten DVDs to explore there is no reason to get off the couch .
The binge-watchers out there are already on their third series during lockdown and who knows when they 'll stop .
