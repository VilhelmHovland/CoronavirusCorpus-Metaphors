Breadcrumb  Legislation includes several loan and payroll tax provisions that may help hospitals and health systems maintain adequate cash flow  The Coronavirus Aid , Relief and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act authorized $2 .
trillion in new spending to help individuals and businesses weather the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 , as well as to provide critical resources to the health care system .
It included a number of new payment mechanisms for health care providers , such as the opportunity for accelerated and periodic interim payments under the Medicare program and a dedicated $100 billion to an emergency fund for the Department of Health and Human Services to , in part , make grants to providers .
However , several provisions relevant to hospitals and health systems as businesses and employers may provide additional sources of needed revenue .
These include :  This new loan opportunity is targeted to both for-profit and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 total employees and is intended to help businesses maintain their workforce through the economic downturn .
Hospitals that meet all of the eligibility criteria ( described below ) are eligible to participate and may access funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under certain circumstances , these loans ( or a portion of them ) may be forgiven .
The AHA estimates that approximately 700 hospitals may be eligible for a total of $7 billion .
Payroll Tax Delay .
Employers may delay payment of the employer share of the Social Security portion of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act ( FICA ) between the date of enactment and Dec .
31 , 2020 .
This payroll tax delay essentially functions as an interest-free loan for nine months , which would need to be repaid over the next two years .
Nearly all hospitals and health systems would be eligible for these delayed payments unless they had received and had forgiven a small business loan under the Paycheck Protection Program .
We estimate that this provision could reduce hospital and health system expenditures by a total of $15 billion in 2020 .
Other Business Loans through the Federal Reserve .
The legislation authorizes $500 billion in business loans using the Federal Reserve 's emergency lending authority .
While these loans may be available to a wide range of businesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " loan programs specifically targeted for nonprofit organizations and businesses between 500 and 10,000 employees , subject to additional loan criteria and obligations on the recipient .
Given uncertainty around eligibility and potential uptake among hospitals and health systems , the AHA has not estimated the financial resources that may be available to the field through this mechanism .
More information on the Paycheck Protection Program and the Payroll Tax Delay follow .
We intend to provide additional information on the loan program through the Federal Reserve in the near future .
HIGHLIGHTS OF PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM &amp; PAYROLL TAX DELAY  Paycheck Protection Program  Eligibility :  Organizations must meet the following criteria to be eligible :  Be for-profit or nonprofit .
Public/governmental hospitals and health systems do not qualify .
Have fewer than 500 total employees , including both full- and part-time employees .
In calculating the number of employees , the SBA will apply its " affiliation rules , " which are intended to identify whether an organization is under common ownership and control of any other organization and , if so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls below the 500 employee threshold .
While there are some criteria for determining affiliation , the SBA has some discretion through an assessment of the " totality of circumstances .
" The AHA anticipates that most , if not all , hospitals that are part of systems would be subject to the affiliation rules and therefore be unlikely to qualify .

times the amount of average monthly payroll costs , excluding any compensation above an annual salary of $100,000 ; and  $10 million .
