Coleman : How Will The Mets Fare In The Post-Virus Season ?  NEW YORK ( WCBS 880 ) -- At this point , no one really knows when or if the Major League baseball season will be able to begin , and what shape or form it will take when or if it does .
Will there be games played in empty stadiums ? Will some games be rescheduled at or moved to neutral sites ? Will there be travel restrictions already existing or that crop up to alter the schedule ? All unanswerable at the moment .
But one thing that 's always important in baseball , whether it 's a 162-game season or a contracted one , is a team 's depth , in particular , pitching depth .
And the Mets have already taken a hit in that regard with Noah Syndergaard , their # 2 starter , sidelined after Tommy John surgery .
There will be roster expansion when and if the season gets underway which will help .
MLB had already added an extra player ( 26 ) to rosters for this season , and that will be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for teams to build up their starters and not tax their bullpens .
And many people believe that if you 're going to lose a pitcher to Tommy John surgery ( Syndergaard , Luis Severino of the Yankees , Chris Sale of the Red Sox ) , this is the year for it to happen with an obviously shortened season .
But I do n't necessarily agree with that assumption .
MLB has several models and scenarios that they are working on , but the goal seems to be to shoehorn in as many games as possible , and plans appear to call for numerous double-headers , possibly as many as 2 per week .
The last time the Mets lost a starter to Tommy John during Spring Training was 2015 when Zack Wheeler went down .
If you want to look at the bright side , the Mets also went to the World Series that year .
However , they also had the luxury of adding both Syndergaard and Matz from the minors during that season , and they both pitched brilliantly down the stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Girardi and the Phillies , and as Degrom , the Mets ' ace and # 1 , was on his way to his 2nd consecutive Cy Young last season , Wheeler was the 1A in the second half , going 5-2 with a 2 .
ERA in 12 starts .
The Mets were hoping that Syndergaard would be this year 's 1A to Degrom , and early indications this spring were that he could match or surpass that .
Unfortunately , not to be .
So where do they turn for reinforcements ? Well , the cupboard is not bare , but not exactly fully stocked .
There 's Walker Lockett , who made 4 starts for the Mets last season and has 7 in his short career .
There 's young lefty David Peterson , the Mets ' # 1 draft pick in 2017 , but who has n't pitched above Double AA yet .
There 's another lefty Stephen Gonsalves , who started 4 games for the Twins in 2018 , going 2-2 with a 6 .
There 's Corey Oswalt , who made 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring .
And I will throw in Erasmo Ramirez , who impressed the coaching staff in Florida .
Ramirez made 10 starts for Seattle in 2018 and pitched well for the Triple AAA Red Sox in Pawtucket last season .
But not a lot of experience there .
The Mets could dip into the bullpen for either Seth Lugo or Robert Gsellman , but I believe they have to find out whether the back end of that bullpen -- Edwin Diaz , Dellin Betances , Jeurys Familia and Justin Wilson -- can deliver the goods to close out games before tinkering with it .
What constitutes this baseball season is hard to say right now .
Do you just pick up the schedule at a certain point and wipe out the games that came beforehand ? Do you try and tack those games on at the end and play deep into the fall ? Do you make up an entirely different schedule ? And is that even possible with so many tickets to games have already been sold ? The more games you play , the more games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams .
So , a shortened season should mean less separation between teams , and if as rumored there are expanded playoffs , that could be a good thing .
But also keep in mind that the Mets have been known to be slow starters and a better second half team of late , and that does n't necessarily cut it in a shortened season .
But whatever the season , losing Syndergaard , and thus losing depth , does n't make it easier .
