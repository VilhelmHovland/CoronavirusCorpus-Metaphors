The Central Bank of Sri Lanka ( CBSL ) yesterday via a statement issued a clarification in relation to the article published in the Daily FT on Monday titled the ' Fate of the rupee : Culprit is untamed inflation and budget deficits , not COVID-19 ' by W .
Wijewardena , a former Deputy Governor of Central Bank .
The statement is as follows :  CBSL categorically denies that CBSL was involved in sale of gold in meeting the foreign debt service obligations .
CBSL , being the apex financial institution , it would be obligatory to provide the real facts to the general public that may have been tainted by the impudent allegations levelled against reserve management strategies of CBSL , and hence the following explanation is provided by the CBSL .
CBSL has changed its reserve management strategy in 2016 to a model based scientific structure known as the Strategic Assets Allocation ( SAA ) which has been practiced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model , the reserves are objectively divided into different tranches and asset classes with a view to derive an optimal asset allocation to CBSL .
Accordingly , the CBSL 's longstanding gold holding of 15 to 20% over the last decade had proven to be an over-allocation .
The most detrimental factor in over allocation is that gold happens to be a non-income bearing asset for a substantially longer period as the demand for safe haven assets like gold had deteriorated with the recovery of the global financial crisis .
In consideration of all the above-stated factors , CBSL analysed the international practices of holding gold as a reserve asset in central banks in the region and the rest of the world .
Upon a thorough analysis on the international best practices and the nature of gold as a reserve asset , the management of CBSL decided to reduce the gold holding to 3 to 5% of the foreign reserves once the gold prices have escalated to appropriate levels with a continuous monitoring in the market .
Whilst CBSL was considering to reduce its gold holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $ 1,300-$ 1,400 levels started to escalate since mid-2019 owing to the reversal of the monetary policy stance of US Federal Reserve Bank and the geopolitical tensions that erupted in Middle East .
CBSL has also disposed smaller portions of its gold holdings during above period of time .
However , with the outbreak of corona ( COVID-19 ) virus in China during the months of January and February 2020 , an abrupt movement was shown in the gold prices recording an eight year high .
At this juncture , CBSL disposed a portion of excess holding above the prudent level in order to bring down the gold holdings to an acceptable percentage of the reserves .
It is also pertinent to note that , CBSL sold excess holding of gold above the average cost of purchase , realising a profit to the CBSL .
Timing of this disposal was opportune , as subsequent to the disposal , gold prices have moved abruptly with the increased volatility in the market .
Similarly , across the globe , reserve managers unwound their gold positions with this abrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Accordingly , CBSL categorically denies the erroneous interpretation that CBSL has disposed the gold as an act of desperation in order to finance the loan repayments falling due .
It is important to note that the decision to reduce gold holding was executed with a long-term objective of converting a non-income bearing asset to an income bearing asset in line with the modern reserve management trends .
In that context , gold disposal proceeds had been invested in different asset classes in the foreign reserves and have not utilised to pay any government debt servicing purposes or for any other purposes .
