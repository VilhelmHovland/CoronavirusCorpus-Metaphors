Brazilian rapper warns of coronavirus danger in Brazil 's slums  RIO DE JANEIRO , March 29 -- Brazilian rapper MV Bill added his voice to a chorus of criticism of President Jair Bolsonaro for downplaying the gravity of the new coronavirus epidemic in a video clip that urges people to protect themselves .
His rap Quarantine recorded in the isolation of his home and posted on social media warns that contagion could be explosive in Brazil 's crowded " favelas " or slums , such as Rio 's City of God where he was born , some with no running water .
Seeing that many Brazilians including their president were not taking the virus seriously motivated his song , he told Reuters by email yesterday .
" The World Health Organisation warned , people paid little heed , head of state downplayed , delayed , they lost time on things that do not matter , " he rapped .
Covid-19 is not " a small cold " as Bolsonaro has claimed and more Brazilians will become infected due to the leader 's " ignorance " and " arrogance , " the singer said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no room in the intensive care units , " he warned .
The 46-year-old rapper lives next to City of God , a sprawling complex of slums made famous in a hit 2002 movie of the same name and where the first case of coronavirus in Rio 's favelas was reported last weekend .
Armed gangs and militias in the slums have imposed strict curfews and are stopping outsiders from entering to stop the virus spreading .
Confirmed cases in Brazil trebled to 3,417 in the last week , with 92 deaths so far , according to the Health Ministry .
Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro , Brazil 's two most populous and most affected states , have shut down non-essential business and public gatherings to slow the spread of the virus , their authorities at odds with Bolsonaro who has called the pandemic a " fantasy " that was exaggerated by the media .
Like US President Donald Trump , the Brazilian president has advocated reopening of activities to get the economy moving while minimising the need for social distancing urged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favela inhabitants would not be able to quarantine themselves because they had to work for a living and go to get food as no one was going to deliver to the slum .
The economy must continue working for those with precarious incomes .
" We do need to think about the economy , but we ca n't condemn people to death , " he said .
" What worried me the most in this pandemic is the lack of information of people who still do n't believe how lethal this virus is , " he said by email .
" Even with the example of Italy , there are still people who are ignoring it .
