Understanding NZ 's Covid-19 curve  Analysis : On the face of it , New Zealand 's epidemic curve is going exponential .
But are case numbers really rising for the same reasons as overseas ?  If you 've been following any news about Covid-19 over the past three months , you 've heard of The Curve .
It looks , variously , like a sky-high pillar representing thousands of cases overwhelming our healthcare system or a squat hill representing a system operating at , but not above , peak capacity - the famously flattened curve .
The Curve is explained in this graphic from the United States Centers for Disease Control .
Since the first days after the arrival of the virus in New Zealand , commentators have attempted to map our curve onto international precedent .
In mid-March , it was asserted that New Zealand was just 10 days behind Italy .
That is clearly no longer the case , but with our cases now doubling every two to four days , new international comparisons are being made .
Are these fair ? Is New Zealand really on the same path as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases and deaths ?  In short , no , not yet .
Although the number of cases continues to rise each day and New Zealand has moved from eight cases to 589 in two weeks , this is n't due to the virus spreading rampant in our communities .
When people talk about the virus spreading exponentially , they are talking about community transmission .
If one person transmits the virus to three other people - which is the reproduction rate modellers have deduced for Covid-19 - and then those three transmit it to three more , the situation gets out of control .
But that 's not what is happening in New Zealand .
Of the 455 cases the Ministry of Health has gathered a body of information on , 57 percent - a majority - contracted it overseas or have a close link to overseas travel , Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said Monday .
Another 26 percent are close contacts of a confirmed case and 15 percent are both a close contact and have an overseas travel link .
Just 2 percent of cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
There are still 145 cases where more information is still pending and it is likely that some of these will be community transmission , but the vast bulk of New Zealand 's cases are linked to overseas travel or just one or two degrees removed from an international element .
Why have n't we seen community transmission ? In part , it 's because we 've moved early .
The best practice is to adjust your policy settings for where you think you will be in two weeks , not where you are today .
That 's why New Zealand introduced stringent travel restrictions on March 14 when it had just six cases - the same restrictions were first implemented in Israel when the country had 42 cases .
Norway , a country of similar size to New Zealand , took the same action on March 12 when it had 598 cases and Australia did so two days after New Zealand , when it had 401 cases .
Less than a week later , New Zealand closed its borders entirely .
We had just 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases when it closed its borders and Australia had 756 cases .
By the time the Prime Minister announced a total lockdown , New Zealand had 102 cases of Covid-19 , while Norway announced its lockdown at 598 cases .
Australia still has yet to go into full lockdown , but stricter measures were announced by their Prime Minister Scott Morrison on March 25 , when the country had 2676 cases .
Now , it 's certainly possible that community transmission is more widespread in New Zealand than we think and that we just have n't found it yet .
It remains unclear how many of the 1700 or so tests conducted each day are for patients who have no link to overseas travel or other confirmed cases - in other words , are we actually testing to find community transmission ?  " I ca n't give you the exact proportion but it 's very clear that there is a lot of clinical judgment being applied to the application of testing , " Bloomfield said on Sunday .
" Not everybody has a history of overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see - we have got testing capacity there , we continue to increase it and as I 've said right from the start , we want to find the cases so we can act accordingly and break the chain of transmission .
"  Even if we are n't finding that community transmission , however , the existing curve of known cases does n't represent an exponential increase through community spread .
