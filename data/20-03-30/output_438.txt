Metropolitan Transit Authority confirmed late Sunday that a bus operator and a dispatcher for MetroLift -- with no contact with the public at work -- both tested positive for the novel coronavirus .
Metro spokesman Jerome Gray said transit officials were following the lead of local health officials , and the agency was not privy to how the two caught COVID .
Gray said Metro CEO Tom Lambert spoke to both employees by phone and " they are doing well .
"  After confirmation of the COVID tests , transit officials blitzed riders with information on the driver , who operated a bus along the downtown GreenLink shuttle on weekdays from 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when shuttle service was halted .
The driver operated a bus along the 247 Fuqua Park &amp; Ride route from 6:18-9:17 a .
on March 24 and March 25 .
Both of the buses used by the driver were removed from service when the positive test was confirmed , officials said .
" Anyone riding the routes driven by the operator in the last 14 days should monitor themselves for possible symptoms , contact your health care provider as soon as you develop any symptoms , and self-isolate to avoid possibly exposing others , including refraining from using public transportation , " Metro officials said in a statement .
Officials said they were unable to estimate how many passengers could have been aboard the buses during the time the infected driver operated the routes .
Typically , the GreenLink averages about 10 riders per hour - divided among a half-dozen buses that could be operating the route at any one time .
About 27 people per hour take the Fuqua park and ride bus , based on Metro 's January ridership .
It is likely the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since March 6 as people worked from home and limited trips .
Still , Metro has warned riders far and wide , sending all users who listed their email addresses on Q cards and others emails about the positive cases .
" All told , we are talking a couple hundred thousand people , " Gray said of the warning .
Since early March , Metro also has increased cleaning protocols for buses and trains , and told employees to practice good hygiene and social distancing , including among drivers at bus garages .
" There is not a lot of hanging out anywhere , " Gray said .
He said Metro at the moment has no plans to test operators who might have come into contact with the driver , saying any decision on testing would be left to the other employees and health officials .
