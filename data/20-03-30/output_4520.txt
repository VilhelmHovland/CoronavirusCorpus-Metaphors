Kareem got up by 7 AM Ghanaian time to prepare for an 8 AM work call time .
He can afford to do so an hour before only because his company now allows working from home .
The sales dev rep did pushups , freshened up and wore cleaner clothes .
He powered up his Macbook , to find he 's 5 minutes early for a daily Zoom call with the entire team .
After exchanging pleasantries and catching up on one another 's weekend for less than 2 minutes , Kareem 's boss started dishing out lags for the past week and the way to avoid them going forward .
And , most of the errors fell on the part of Kareem , who at this point thought it serious to buckle up and double down .
That was when his mother barged into the room to the glare of the whole ( virtual ) team .
The 40-year-old woman , surprisingly , said , " Maaky ? , are you not going to work today ? "  Perception  For many African youths whose jobs come with the work-from-home option , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Kareem 's .
Getting some of these senior citizens to understand you do n't have to put on work clothes and get on a vehicle to an office is one Mission Impossible -- unlike in other places of the world .
To be fair , the concept of working from home is relatively new , especially in a place like Africa .
The internet fully came to the continent in August 1995 .
Around that time , only 20 nations in the region had access .
It is only now that the internet has really penetrated Africa , which has made the continent the cradle of mobile money .
Single Mobile Content From  Email address *  Source : Impressa  But more than 20 years down the line , adult Africans who lived in a time of toiling under the scorching sun are skeptical about their children working from home .
Even those who worked in the civil service or in some other public capacity still raise an eyebrow .
Training a child for more than 2 decades only for him/her to sit behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not something most of them see as " success " .
Except they are running a personal business driven by the technology they hear of , they 'd still want " the best for their children " .
Parents generally want children they can be proud of .
It 's their well-deserved reward .
This usually comes from knowing their wards are " doing well .
" But they have not yet gotten to appreciate how diverse work is , and the many ways that the internet has made that possible .
Interest Conflict  Ogini Nonso , an executive assistant , is now working from home for the first time in her 2-year career .
Before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic , she had to shuttle between Surulere and Lekki Phase 1 to get to work everyday .
But confirmed cases in Nigeria 's worst-hit city are now 111 , which means there 's no better time to activate remote work .
In a conversation with WeeTracker , Nonso said her mother feels more relaxed knowing she 's home and not out there .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent does not fully understand what it entails for an executive assistant with a investment firm to work from home during such times -- when businesses are taking heavy hits .
" We are all at home trying to stay safe from COVID-19 spread .
I still have to do chores once it is 5 or 6 PM -- which is earlier than I would , considering getting home in Lagos traffic .
However , sometimes , she tries to get me to do something for her while I 'm in the middle of work .
If I tell her I 'm busy , it often ticks her off , " she explained .
For a middle-aged parent who mostly listens to the radio and gathers with friends around newspaper stands , a stay-at-home-work is mostly strange .
But due to a coronavirus crisis which is now in most African countries , they have the time and reasons to finally understand why remote work is real , legit and profitable .
Trust  The first thing that could pop into the mind of a senior citizen when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job that involves using a laptop is : fraud .
It 's not something everyone is keen on talking about , but that 's the reality .
However , family trust plays a huge role in keeping these misgivings checked .
Kofi Genfi is the co-founder of software innovation company CYST and CEO of Accra-based fintech Mazzuma .
The 26-year-old entrepreneur told WeeTracker that he is living with his parents while the rest of the team works from home for the time being .
Ghana 's 3 major cities have gone into a 14-day lockdown to contain the viral outbreak .
" I worked from home for some couple of days in the past , before COVID-19 .
My parents were there .
Even though it could have seemed strange , they know I am a grown man who can make good decisions .
Trust , in this case , needs to overshadow familiarity -- which is being used to going to work in offices in their own days , " he explained .
Kofi 's opinion on trust rhymes with that of Shalom Dickson , Lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions for developing economies .
When he started out working from home at his parents ' , it was a little difficult internally to convey that something important was happening even if it did n't seem like it .
The case was worse in one way and better in another .
It was worse , in that , he was starting a company ( Paperloops ) and so things were not very structured .
It was better because Shalom had a nice room specifically for work .
But he still had to run sudden errands like going to the bank every now and then .
There were external pressures from other parents who knew he was n't heading out with " shirt and tie " daily .
They suspected it could be something odd he was doing with computers .
But since things were settled at home ( for the most part ) Shalom was shielded from all those judgments .
His father would vouch for him every time .
Level Of Understanding  " In general , we could agree that relating to a culture that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apply any less to work cultures .
People from older generations , particularly African parents , are psychologically invested in the ' getting up daily and heading to work ' culture " .
Shalom told WeeTracker .
He continued : " For one , they ca n't relate to whatever kind of sense of purpose and responsibility one could have in waking up daily to simply do something on the internet .
What might convince them otherwise is when they see the financial reward .
I can think of two main problems , from their perspective , with accepting the internet work culture " .
The first is the fear of the possibility of their ward participating in fraudulent activities .
The other , where the first fear stems from , is a lack of awareness of how exactly the internet works .
Parents who endorse remote work have a relatively sound grasp of the vast possibilities of the Internet .
On the other hand , the parents who do not are basically fish out of water on the internet .
They likely do n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited moves .
Whatever goes beyond that in their imagination risks falling in the category of fraud .
Major cities across Africa are on lockdown .
Businesses that are not in the banking , food or pharmaceutical sectors are now taking things more online .
With more young people at home alongside their parents , senior citizens ' level of understanding for remote work is significantly increasing .
Urgency  " It 's great that , in the face of this coronavirus crisis , we have a platform like the internet and layers like social networks to communicate .
If these older generation folks are getting to appreciate how much can really go on over the internet , it may have the positive effect of understanding that their wards who work from home can be doing legit , responsible work , " Shalom concludes .
For Obayuwana Confidence , an Admin/Information Manager and co-founder of PrimeXBranding , getting parents to understand the work-from-culture pretty much depends on necessity and urgency .
For all his work life , he 's been under the same roof with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the makings of a cybernaut .
" My parents have been away since I started working from home this period .
However , they do get the concept of working from home as I did work from home for 4 months after my NYSC ( a scheme set up by the Nigerian government to involve Nigerian graduates in nation building and the development of the country ) .
Before the explosion of the internet in Africa , Nigeria precisely , it was not possible to work from home .
That shaped the mindset of the senior citizens , " he told WeeTracker .
