COVID-19 : Ogun shuts borders with Lagos , Oyo , others  Ogun State Government has announced the closure of all borders with neighbouring states and the international border with the Republic of Benin .
States in the South-West including Lagos and Oyo with high COVID-19 cases would be affected by the border closure .
The government , which said this on Saturday , explained that the closure would be effected at 12 midnight on Sunday , 29th March 2020 .
In a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor , Kunle Somorin , the government said the border closure would be in force for two weeks in the first instance .
The statement read , " With this restriction order , movement in and out of the state has been banned as a further measure to contain the coronavirus pandemic .
" The state is constrained to effect border closure in order to stem and flatten the curve of the spread of the dreaded coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , not only in the state but in the country and in the West African sub-region .
" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares an international border with the Republic of Benin , but it also does so with all other states in the South West ( except Ekiti ) , including Lagos State , which has understandably recorded the highest number of infections in the country largely because it hosts the busiest air and seaports and it 's the nation 's economic capital .
" The border closure will not only be beneficial to Ogun State but the national efforts to curtail and contain the virus .
Lessons from other climes strongly indicate that closure of borders has the potential to drastically flatten the curve of spread whilst unrestricted movement portends grave dangers .
"  The government , however , clarified that the only exceptions to the interstate restrictions are vehicles conveying personnel involved in essential services such as security agencies , health workers , food and medical items and petroleum products .
