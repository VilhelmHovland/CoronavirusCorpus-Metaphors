Most popular content  Currently viewing Global edition  FLSmidth , Perenti suspend dividends  Denmark 's FLSmidth has added its name to the list of mining equipment , technology and services ( METS ) companies that have suspended dividend payments and suspended 2020 financial guidance as government efforts to curb the Covid-19 spread in countries around the world make it too difficult to assess unfolding business impacts .
" The underlying mining and cement industries remain sound but given the day-to-day development in markets around the world , we are currently unable to assess the extent of the impact , " the company said .
" The activity level for the group at the beginning of 2020 was similar to 2019 , and in addition we have booked three large mining orders with a combined value of around 2 .
billion Danish krone .
" We are now increasingly seeing disruptions to customers and own operations , and we see higher costs related to , amongst others , more complex logistics and a weaker fixed cost absorption .
We continue the implementation of our business improvement initiatives launched last year and have taken further actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced capex spend and postponement of salary adjustments , etc .

The company said its decision to withdraw a proposed DKK8/share annual dividend was to " ensure resilience in a period of market uncertainty and to further strengthen FLSmidth 's financial position " .
Meanwhile , Ireland drilling products manufacturer Mincon started 2020 brightly after reporting 2019 revenue of ? 120 .
million and operating profit of ? 14 .
million - " ahead of expectations " , according to supporting local stockbroker Davy - but also faces uncertain markets , according to Davy .
" Mincon 's progress in early 2020 appears to be well ahead of our expectations from a sales growth perspective .
However , with rising risks surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic , we believe it is too early to become more optimistic regarding forecasts , " it said this week .
In Australia , mining services and drilling contractor Perenti Global has suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October in a bid to address the potential risks of what managing director Mark Norwell called the " worst financial crisis since the 1930s " .
Norwell said Perenti would " prefer to move too early than move too late " , and it was taking steps now because forecasting the future was " impossible " due to the coronavirus pandemic .
He said the company 's decision to withdraw its guidance earlier this week was " not taken lightly " , nor was the decision to suspend the dividend and reactivate its dividend reinvestment plan .
It was examining a suite of capital management initiatives to ensure the company was in the " strongest possible financial position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent global financial impact " .
It expects to keep A$24 million in the kitty as a result of the dividend delay that , while not material to Perenti 's finances , together with other initiatives such as deferring capital and tightening fixed costs , would allow it to prepare for the " invariable upside " at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by COVID-19 , Perenti has established several taskforces to manage after its staff and logistics chains , maintain operations , and maximise cash .
Operationally , Norwell said there had been no impact from its clients yet , which range from tier one clients to single-mine owners , as they continued to pay their bills , and Perenti continued to pay its own suppliers to ensure the health its supply chains .
Perenti was somewhat protected from a loss of contracts because it has limited exposure to exploration , which is likely to be curtailed globally , and it works primarily in ensuring the continuity of mining operations , he said .
The pipeline of future work appeared healthy , and Perenti submitted a new tender last week .
The most immediate impact might be a delay in taking over the contract at the Hemlo gold mine in Canada , which was due to start on April 1 , but was not included in its financial 2020 guidance .
Perenti had asked among its expatriate staff for volunteers to stay at work in Africa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some came back from leave early .
That 's despite global airline shutdowns that could leave staff in place " for months " - but the company is examining charter flight options if required after April , if global economic and other restrictions do n't start improving .
Norwell said none of its customers had talked about mine shutdowns or suspensions so far , but that was ultimately in the hands of governments , and impossible to predict .
To date , the firm has seen no impact on its financial performance , although it this week withdrew its financial year guidance of an underlying net profit between $115-120 million .
Downer EDI and Monadelphous Group are among others who have withdrawn guidance , and Downer delayed its $83 million interim dividend until September  Perenti had been considering a bid for Downer 's mining services division .
Shares in Perenti were up 2% to 49c in early trade , having hit its lowest level since April 2016 yesterday .
