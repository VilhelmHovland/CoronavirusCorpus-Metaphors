Coronabonds Are Inevitable .
Everybody Knows It  ( Bloomberg Opinion ) -- The European Central Bank has just taken a giant step toward converting its emergency aid package of 750 billion euros ( $824 billion ) -- dubbed the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program -- into a true no-limits bond-buying vehicle by relaxing the " issue limits " it imposes on its debt purchases related to Covid-19 .
Previously , the ECB could n't buy more than one-third of a country 's eligible debt .
But financing the fight against the new coronavirus should not be put exclusively on the shoulders of the euro zone 's central bank .
Action by European governments is necessary too .
Last week , nine euro area governments -- including France , Italy and Spain -- sent a letter to Charles Michel , president of the European Council , calling for the issuance of so-called " coronabonds .
" These would be a common debt instrument for the single-currency bloc to raise funds in the markets to the benefit of all member states .
The Germans and the Dutch are against such mutualized financing , calling the move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be taken with a large dose of salt .
Europe will get coronabonds , although not before the hawkish euro states do a certain amount of shadow boxing to convince the folks back home that they 've fought the good fight to protect their interests .
The general public in Germany , the Netherlands and other fiscally conservative member countries are opposed vehemently to mutualized debt issuance , fearing that it would encourage more " feckless " behavior from their free-spending southern cousins .
So their leaders are reluctant to embrace it , except in a crisis .
So far , the ECB 's giant pandemic bond-buying spree has acted as a balm to to the European debt markets .
But there 's something headed our way that might spark another outright emergency : a ruling from the German Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe due in early May .
Many experts expect that the court will rule that the ECB 's Quantitative Easing program ( which now includes the pandemic plan ) is constitutional only with strict limitations on asset purchases .
An unfriendly verdict from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between southern states ' bond yields and those of benchmark German bunds -- in European markets and endanger the euro .
This is where coronabonds come in .
The European Stability Mechanism , the single-currency area 's rescue fund , or perhaps the EU Commission could issue the bonds .
The proceeds would be distributed to member states according to a previously agreed weighting , and all the countries would be jointly and individually liable .
The purpose of a coronabond would be to transfer the burden of financing the fight against Covid-19 from the ECB to the ESM .
This would get the ECB out of a business it has no business to be in , which should especially appeal to ECB hawks such as Klaas Knot of the Netherlands and Germany 's Jens Weidmann .
Nations such as Italy could raise the money they needed to fight the virus through coronabonds rather than the issuance of new national bonds , which would have to be propped up continuously by the ECB to keep interest rates from skyrocketing and strangling an already weakened state 's economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of its new no-limits bond-buying policy in a safe way , without blowing out the spreads , endangering the euro and undermining the fight against the virus .
To make the German court 's decision a non-event for the markets , the euro zone governments should adopt coronabonds before the verdict is announced .
Yes , German politicians are right that the coronabond might be a stepping-stone to a full eurobond .
But the remorseless march toward full monetary union works that way in Europe .
The founders of the euro understood that the currency would create tensions and problems leading to crises and then reforms .
Ultimately , something approaching full monetary union would be achieved .
Adoption of coronabonds would be part of that inevitable process .
