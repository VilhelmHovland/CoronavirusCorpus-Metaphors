When political beliefs contradict science , the results can be deadly .

And we 're going to be opening relatively soon .

I 'd love to have it open by Easter , OK .
I would love to have it open by Easter .
I will tell you that right now .
I would love to have that .
It 's such an important day for other reasons , but I 'll make it an important day for this too .
I would love to have the country opened up , and they 're just raring to go by Easter .

And for those who say we choose prayer over science , I say science is an answer to our prayers .
" -- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , press conference ( 3/26/20 )  Political beliefs are ideological beliefs .
And yet , in politics today , ideology does n't so much predict political affiliation as political affiliation predicts ideology .
While we may choose our political party affiliations based on where we stand on core issues like abortion , immigration , or gun control , where there are stark divides , many of our feelings about those issues are predetermined by the families and communities in which we grow up .
Furthermore , once affiliated with a party or political perspective , we tend to adopt all of the beliefs that are part of that party 's platform , as if learning and adopting the playbook of a sports team .
So it is that we can often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their political affiliation .
It , therefore , came as little surprise that in the microcosm of my own social media feed this month , I noticed that it was my conservative friends who were the ones who disagreed with the emergent consensus of public health epidemiologists , infectious disease experts , and physicians and instead wrote about how COVID-19 might be a hoax , that it 's " just like the flu , " or that we 're overreacting by imposing strict social distancing rules across the country .
Indeed , a number of recent polls by Axios , Civiqs , NBC News/Wall Street Journal , Pew , Reuters , and Quinnipiac University have all confirmed that concern about COVID-19 is greater among self-identified Democrats than Republicans ( this summary suggests that , on average , 65 percent of Democrats are either somewhat or very concerned about catching the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus compared to only 38 percent of Republicans ) , while Republicans are much more likely to believe that social distancing is an unnecessary overreaction .
And while that difference may be narrowing as the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U .
overtook China as having the most confirmed cases of any country in the world ) , with conservatives like Newt Gingrich urging concern and President Trump pivoting from talking about hoaxes to acknowledging a pandemic , the difference persists .
For now , at least .
Many of us already concerned about COVID-19 are wondering just how many people have to die for conservatives to pivot en masse .
In a recent Washington Post article , " In a Pandemic , Political Polarization Could Kill People , " NYU psychology professor Jay Van Bavel refers to that pivot point as a " reality constraint " on beliefs .
In other words , people can disregard reality for a remarkably long time according to motivational reasoning , at least until it comes butting right up against their own personal lives .
But it may be some time yet before that happens .
As Ronald Brownstein highlights in his Atlantic article , " Red and Blue America Are n't Experiencing the Same Pandemic , " COVID-19 is currently concentrated mostly in U .
urban centers that tend to be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only political but also geographic , such that until COVID-19 finds its way into America 's heartland , some will continue to dismiss it as a metropolitan scourge ( independent of politics , there has also been a seemingly obvious generational divide such that young people , who already think of themselves as invincible and appear to be much less at risk of death from COVID-19 , can dismiss it as a geriatric disease with cavalier comments like , " If I get corona , I get corona " ) .
A recent article by University of West London professor of evidence-based health care Heather Loveday , drawing from an earlier " epidemic psychology model " based on the AIDS pandemic , 1 outlines how the psychological response to COVID-19 can be broken down into distinct attitudes about fear , explanation , and action .
This distinction allows us to look more deeply at the political divide over COVID-19 .
Attitudinal differences are n't only related to fear of infection or death ; there are also significant partisan differences about the cause of and best response to COVID-19 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are writing it off as a disease of " others , " just as AIDS was originally written off by many as a " gay disease .
" For Republicans , blaming COVID-19 on " China " ( and the insistence on calling it the " Chinese virus " or " Wuhan virus " ) has become a well-established strategy , whether because of legitimate complaints about China 's failure to contain the initial outbreak or false rumors about SARS-CoV-2 being created in a lab as a bioweapon .
On the other side of the political divide , liberals counter that the U .
response to COVID-19 has been at least as bad China 's , if not more so , and that xenophobic disease attributions are far more harmful than helpful .
Mirroring those causal attributions , differences in attitudes about optimal COVID-19 responses also play into the current political divide over race and immigration .
Conservatives are more likely to believe that isolationism in the form of " building walls " and travel bans is the answer to COVID-19 , if not everything else that ails us .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to science experts for guidance on just how concerned we should be and about optimal solutions to things related to science , whether we 're talking about COVID-19 or climate change .
Thus far , the rate of infectious spread of SARS-CoV-2 and death from COVID-19 has tracked almost exactly with predictive mathematical models , underscoring why -- until herd immunity , vaccines , or established treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 are available -- social distancing is absolutely necessary to " flatten the curve " and minimize deaths , and why letting up on those efforts now would be very foolish indeed .
Conservatives ' mistrust , disregard , and hostility towards science have been something of a deliberate strategy over the past few decades that has become intertwined with the Republican party 's current populist narrative that dismisses scientists as arrogant elitists who do n't understand the common man or have his best interests in mind .
Of course , lest we fall into the trap of black-and-white thinking about American partisan politics today , the political divide over COVID-19 should n't be over-stated .
After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as 35 percent of Democrats are unconcerned about it .
In the final analysis , it , therefore , makes more sense to frame differences of opinions over COVID-19 according to science and anti-science beliefs , rather than a matter of conservatives and Republicans vs .
liberals and Democrats .
It 's been said that there are no atheists in foxholes , suggesting that we all reach out to God in the face of death .
But similarly , when we 're sick , most of us reach out to science and medicine for salvation .
Sometimes we reach out when it 's too late .
Indeed , in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic now , rejecting scientific consensus in favor of anti-science attitudes can be deadly .
Science is n't perfect and is n't always right .
Far from it -- it 's not a dogma ; it 's an iterative process of acquiring knowledge that we can trust .
When it comes to COVID-19 , trust the process .
Trust science .
Lead with science .
If there 's to be any hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the efforts of those who have embraced science in their careers -- the doctors , nurses , and many other health care workers putting themselves in harm 's way , fighting on the front lines against COVID-19 and the misbeliefs that fuel its spread .
" Of course , lest we fall into the trap of black and white thinking about American partisan politics today , the political divide over COVID-19 should n't be over-stated .
After all , almost 40% of Republicans are concerned about COVID-19 , just as 35% of Democrats are unconcerned about it .
In the final analysis , it therefore makes more sense to frame differences of opinions over COVID-19 according to science and anti-science beliefs , rather than a matter of conservatives and Republicans vs .
liberals and Democrats .
"  And yet the whole rest of the article is about how those who see differently than you are primitive and anti-science .
In other words , you 're throwing verbal Molotov cocktails while singing about peace and we 're not supposed to notice .
Once again , up until February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPECIFICALLY DENIED that COVID was transmissible among humans .
Out of political expediency they believed China and ignored Taiwan .
And you can go back here on this very website a month ago and find dozens of articles where psychologists on the left called people who were alarmist xenophobes and racists .
And now these same experts are telling us how to cope with a situation that they said was a sick fantasy of racists .
There 's plenty of stubborn denialism from both sides , including people I have respected .
Dennis Prager may well be throwing his reputation away by being stubborn on this .
Biden and Sanders said recently they would still have open borders .
So lost of people are not learning from brutal reality .
I 'm not on the left and three weeks ago I was arguing with many people on the left that it was urgent to be alarmed .
So no , the left does n't not speak for science .
In fact postmodernism by its very nature is antiscience because it disregards empiricism .
It 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We 're dealing with a medical emergency and you do n't say a thing about hospitals or medical professionals .
A real doctor would n't be talking about the border right now .
A real doctor would be concerned about the health and well-being of doctors and nurses .
Real doctors are pitching in to save lives , not reading articles on Psychology Today about political positions .
I 'm not a MD .
I added MD after my name to show how easy it is to claim to be one .
Breaking down the population as being Republican or Democrat misses the point .
Breaking it down as Red State or Blue State gets a little closer to reality .
As of Sunday morning there are three states with less than 100 cases : North Dakota 94 Wyoming 84 South Dakota 68  As the case number rises close to home people start to pay attention .
It was n't long ago the West Virginia had zero cases .
People living there had reasons to think COVID-19 was n't something to be concerned about .
West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to think differently about it there .
The website 538 has a good article about how people saw COVID-19 as a Blue State problem .
It compares numbers from March 23rd to March 26th to show how fast the Red States are catching up .
This story is developing quickly .
Everyone is a socialist at a family level but a country is not a big family despite what teen beauty contestants posing as intellectuals say .

The biggest science deniers during this pandemic were the extreme left especially the CCP who denied the contagion and are now attempting to rewrite history with the assistance of useful idiots in the US press .
Now we are finding out that the CDC was wrong about masks , and they are useful .
If you were really a medical professional you 'd know that the CDC was right about masks .
The CDC knows the supply is finite and hospitals will be short on supply .
If hospitals are completing with the general public for N95 masks it will compound the problem .
The recommendation is that people should n't hoard masks .
They chose a better way to word it , but their concern was valid .
People should avoid contact with other people and leave the available inventory of masks for the first responders and medical professionals .
The CDC 's role is n't to provide personal advice .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YouTube for tutorials on DIY masks .
A DIY mask will provide adequate protection for most people that are unlikely to be in contact with someone with the virus for any length of time .
It would be ideal if everyone worn a mask , because the wearer of a mask is protecting other people more than they are actually protecting themselves .
The assumption is that no one is knowingly walking around in public with the virus .
But , you ought to assume you have it .
and so does that guy near you in the grocery store .
The most important message shared in the Czech Republic has been this : " My mask protects you ; your mask protects me .
" Wearing a mask there is now considered a prosocial behavior there .
The CDC has changed their position .

Now they are telling at risk people to wear them out .
