News  What lies ahead for the housing market  As New Zealand begins to settle into the " new normal " of the Covid-19 lockdown , commentators have started releasing their ( tentative ) outlooks for the housing market .
Here 's a summary of some of them :  Tuesday , March 31st 2020 , 12:58PM  by Miriam Bell  Westpac chief economist Dominick Stephens says that while the market is currently frozen amid the lockdown , when house sales resume prices are likely to decline .
" There is little reason to suppose that the long-run fundamental value of property has changed , but short-term market realities certainly have .
" Job losses and business failures will put fewer people in a position to buy property , and other erstwhile buyers will be too nervous to act .
"  The plan to grant repayment holidays to mortgage borrowers affected by Covid-19 will limit forced selling , but there will still be some people whose circumstances require them to sell later this year , he says .
" How far prices fall depends mainly on sentiment , which is hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline over the second half of 2020 , based on the house price declines seen in past New Zealand recessions .
"  " So we are forecasting house price inflation of 8% in 2021 and 12% 2022 .
"  What a difference a couple of months have made .
At the start of the year ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley was expecting 2020 to be a very good one for the domestic housing market .
This view has now changed and , by the end of the year , they expect nationwide house prices to be around 5-6% below their likely March 2020 peak .
Tuffley says the fall could have been much larger in the absence of government policies to reduce job losses and offer mortgage relief .
But the Government and the Reserve Bank have stepped up and their actions should help to mitigate the economic hit , with likely job losses and falls to house prices less severe than they could have been .
" The outlook is for house prices to basically flat-line over 2021 given the uncertain economic backdrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investors will remain wary given controls on rental increases .
" We anticipate some tentative green shoots will start to appear from 2022 , and some regions will perform stronger than others as the economy strengthens .
"  Independent economist Tony Alexander points out that no-one has a model telling us what usually happens when we have a global pandemic , let alone a lockdown of four to eight weeks .
Picking what will happen in asset markets including housing is hard , he says .
" And a lot comes down to how much people focus on the short-term pain , and how much they focus on the long-term fundamentals .
"  To that end , Alexander comprehensively lists the negative and the positive factors which are set to impact on New Zealand 's housing market going forward .
The negative factors include job losses and loss of job security ; temporary stalling of net migration ; downsizing ; loss of retirement wealth ; the hit to the Airbnb market ; lending pullback from banks and non-bank lenders ; falling rent and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates ; higher long-term net migration ; building/construction declines which means slower supply growth ; the economic downturn will be sharp but temporary ; the support measures are huge ; mortgage holidays ; shortages and an enhanced preference for property as an investment .
Alexander says everyone can form their own personal view on how strong each factor is and when it kicks in or drops out .
" My focus can best be summed up as this - the worse the short-term impact once the lockdown ends , the greater the purchasing opportunities for those able to do so and with an eye toward the long-term fundamentals .
"  CoreLogic senior property economist Kelvin Davidson says advice from the NZ Law Society makes it " clear that any property settlements that require physical movement of people is now for all practical purposes unlawful " .
That means there will be essentially no property sales throughout the lockdown period .
Davidson says that , interestingly , there was a spike in new listings just over a week ago , before anyone knew about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could be a sign that people were already worried about their jobs/income/security , so were looking to rush in and deleverage .
" The question then , given they essentially ca n't sell , is going to be what happens during the lockdown -- ie : how well can they hold on -- and once it 's over , how desperate will they be to sell ? Because that will influence the price they accept ( assuming there 's still enough demand to want to buy ) .
"  There 'll be some extra help provided via the mortgage repayment holiday option , and the business finance support package , and both initiatives should help to mitigate forced property sales , he says .
" Our simple forecasting model for overall sales volumes indicates that there might be a 15-20% decline in activity this year ( relative to 2019 ) , whereas we were previously projecting a 2-3% increase .
" We have to hope the effects of the virus will be relatively short-lived , with any impending transactions simply deferred , leading to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is going to be a significant slowdown in property market activity to get through until an eventual recovery begins .
"  For Squirrel Mortgage Brokers chief executive John Bolton , it feels like a mug 's game to put an estimate on how much house prices could fall as a result of the Covid-19 crisis .
But his view is that they will only soften in Auckland and Wellington .
In Auckland , it could feel like much of 2019 .
" Areas more impacted by tourism will be harder hit , along with holiday locations .
There will likely be more sellers than buyers in these areas over the next 18 months ( and beyond the six-month mortgage deferments offered by banks ) , " he says .
" That will put more downward pressure on prices in these areas , so expect a bigger fall .
I ca n't see many people rushing out to buy a holiday house , and there will possibly be some business owners that will need to sell .
"  Underpinning prices will be the very low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have an oversupply of housing , Bolton adds .
