Downturn likely as property market feels the effects of the coronavirus  Topics  THE national real estate market is feeling the impact of COVID-19 , with a sudden , sharp slowdown in housing market activity already apparent , according to CoreLogic data .
Head of Australian research Eliza Owen said the likelihood of a decline in housing values was also rising , especially considering forecasts unemployment could reach around 11 per cent over the next three months .
" The decline in property price momentum has already been demonstrated in the daily index , which shows a decline in rolling 28 day growth , " she said .
" Although the series remains in positive territory , the trend is clearly pointing towards a slowdown in growth that is likely to move into negative territory over the coming months .
"  Corelogic also surveyed about 400 real estate professionals between March 20 and 22 to gain some insight into what was happening in the market .

Another way to measure current market activity was the number of requests from agents for CoreLogic comparative market analysis reports ( CMA ) , which had also declined .
Ms Owen said the number of CMAs generated was usually a leading indicator of property listing volumes and generation was falling sharply .
" In the week to the 25th of March , the volume of CMAs generated fell 38 per cent , " she said .
" Reports are down approximately 20 per cent of where they were this time last year , and this time last year was near the trough of the national property market downswing .
