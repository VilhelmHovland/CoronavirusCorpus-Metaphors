Opinion  Coronavirus underscores the crucial role - and responsibility - of the free press in a crisis  Sometimes it takes deeply shocking events to remind us why we need certain social institutions to work freely and effectively .
We 're now not just having a pandemic , but we 've also had a drought and a catastrophic bushfire season to underscore -- in red ink -- just how important it is to have a well-resourced and genuinely free media that does its job with professionalism and integrity .
In each of the crises from the Summer of Hell , the most valuable thing of all -- the thing that saves lives and limits the crises -- is consistent high-quality information .
Information is critical in a pandemic .
This is not to suggest that good information alone will quench the flames or resuscitate a patient , but it alerts those at risk of a looming emergency ; it tells us of escape routes and strategies likely to keep us safe .
It keeps us abreast of the latest science , the judgments of experts and the experience of others .
It informs policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when we use it to measure the decisions of our political leaders , it helps us hold them to account .
But that wo n't work unless we , the public , trust the integrity of information , and the sources it comes from .
And this , at its most basic , is what the Alliance for Journalists ' Freedom is fighting for .
Advertisement  At times like this , a government 's instinct is for control of everything including the messaging .
Proponents , generally in weak democracies or dictatorships , call it ' crisis journalism ' , where journalists suspend their usual scepticism , and line up behind officials to support rather than question the government 's line .
The idea is that anything that undermines or contradicts official information erodes trust in our government and its agencies and damages our collective capacity to tackle the virus .
To be effective , journalists need to maintain their scepticism and independence .
But it also means ditching some of the cynically desperate measures some of our news organisations have been adopting  It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , when President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued menacing statements urging the media to become patriots and support his administration in its fight against " terrorism " .
The media is now so cowed and compliant that it has become little more than a mouthpiece for propaganda , and Egyptians now have more faith in social media posts than the newspapers or broadcasters .
To be effective , journalists need to maintain their scepticism and independence , to uphold their democratic role as watchdogs over government making sure that it operates effectively and ethically .
But it also means ditching some of the cynically desperate measures some of our news organisations have been adopting in a bid to grab eyeballs and hold on to shrinking revenues .
There has been excellent reporting in Australia , on the bushfires , the drought and now the coronavirus .
But we 've all seen the outrageously sensational reporting , clickbait headlines based on the flimsiest of information , rumours reported as news , and the most extreme scenarios covered as if they are imminent .
The UK-based First Draft News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has published a best-practice checklist for coronavirus reporting .
( Readers would do well to apply the list to their own reading .
) It includes :  Avoid sensationalist language that could cause elevated levels of fear  Avoid stock images that feed stereotypes or cause more panic  Avoid speculating about worst-case scenarios  Talk to more than one expert  Remember that not every rumour deserves coverage  This matters for the immediate crisis , of course , but it also matters in the long run .
Now more than ever before , news organisations are struggling to survive .
The digital revolution has shredded their finances , with Google and Facebook harvesting the vast bulk of advertising revenue that used to underwrite good , independent journalism .

Jim  Now , despite a shift to subscriptions by some publications , many stories still generate income through clicks online .
Ad-funded models for journalism punish the sober , thoroughly fact-checked , in-depth reporting we need , and reward the kind of cheap , gossipy click-bait that we clearly do n't .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Evening Standard declared : " Calls for government to save newspapers and magazines from ' existential threat ' of COVID-19 by recognising journalism as public service .
"  How we pay for that service , in a way that insulates it from both political influence and unhealthy commercial pressure , is a debate we are yet to have .
And it will only happen if journalists win the trust of the public they are supposed to be serving in the first place .
At a time of crisis , we need our institutions -- all of them from government on down -- to work effectively .
The media is an essential part of that system , and it must have the freedom to act independently , but also act responsibly .
