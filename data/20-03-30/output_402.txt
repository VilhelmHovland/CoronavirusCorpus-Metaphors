As the coronavirus spreads and disrupts life across the country , Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans are facing a secondary threat : racism .
The virus was first detected in Wuhan , China , and some now blame the country for its global spread .
In recent weeks , blame has escalated into reports of harassment and even assault in places with large communities of Asian Americans .
Last week Russell Jeung , a professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University , started tracking these attacks on a new website he helped launch called Stop AAPI Hate .
In the site 's first eight days , it received more than 650 reports of discrimination -- largely against the Asian American community .
Jeung spoke with NPR 's Steve Inskeep about this spike in reports .
Here is some of what he had to say :  On the need for the site  We recognized early on that people were experiencing a lot of bullying , a lot of shunning , a lot of avoiding when the coronavirus outbreak occurred .
And we did n't have any hard data to document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was we looked at news trends , and we counted news stories that had coronavirus and discrimination or xenophobia in it .
We found hundreds of articles about policies that people thought were xenophobic , economic boycotts of Asian businesses and then later on about interactions that Asian Americans were having where people were bullying , taunting , harassing and now attacking .
We had hundreds of accounts to go to the state legislature and say , " This is happening .
We need to get it documented .
We need to proactively address these trends .
" And since the government did n't have the capacity in California , we started our own website as a reporting center , and it just was launched last week and we 've been getting over 100 reports every day .
What types of reports the site is receiving  Name-calling and verbal harassment -- microaggressions are the most common .
It moves up to people having bottles and cans thrown at them , their homes being vandalized , and then .
maybe three times a day , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit or punched , pushed on subways .
Are there things that have made it worse ?  After Sept .
11 people were attacking Muslim Americans and President Bush came out and said we have to not discriminate or mistreat Muslim Americans .
What President Trump did was he insisted on calling it the " Chinese virus " and labeling coronavirus as a racial disease .
And by othering Asians -- and it 's not just Chinese , anybody who looks Chinese -- it just gave people license to attack us , to blame us for the disease , to say we 're the source of it .
And it 's not the people who are the source of the disease , it 's just , you know , a virus that does n't discriminate .
Yeah , we appreciate that .
I think that was due to the pressure that we exerted and the complaining .
But I think it 's a little too little , too late .
He 's already opened the door to this racism .
It was already starting even before he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacerbated the situation .
He still uses this us vs .
them binary that argues that , " Oh , we 're really working with them " and that " We 're protecting them , " that we 're still outsiders and foreigners and not part of the American fabric .
