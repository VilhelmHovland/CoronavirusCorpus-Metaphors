CPP-NPA virus deadlier than Covid-19 : Parlade  MANILA -- While the military is assisting the government on containing the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( Covid-19 ) , Southern Luzon Command ( SOLCOM ) chief , Lt .
Antonio Parlade , Jr .
, said efforts will continue to protect the country and its people against the deadlier menace of the " CPP-NPA virus " .
" As we endeavor to assist the IATF ( Inter-Agency Task Force ) in the containment of the Covid-19 , we will continue to secure our communities from this vicious and more dangerous CPP-NPA virus , " he said in a statement Saturday , referring to the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing , New People 's Army .
Parlade , who is also a member of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict ( NTF ELCAC ) , said he considers the CPP-NPA and its ideology deadlier than Covid-19 because it has killed thousands of Filipinos in the past 51 years .
" The latter ( CPP-NPA ) has killed a vast throng of our people , some ( of them ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sison ) even call his revolutionary forces that include students , young children , and the marginalized sector , " he added .
The CPP-NPA is listed as a terrorist organization by the United Kingdom , the European Union , the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , New Zealand , and the Philippines .
He also chided Sison on whether his " violent National Democratic Front " still has a place in the Philippines as the country and its people go about with their efforts to stop the spread of the dreaded Covid-19 .
He made the statement as communist rebels struggle to find a replacement for National Military Commission head Julius Giron and overall CPP-NPA chairperson who was killed along with two others in an operation in Baguio City on March 13 .
" As we are about to expose CPP chair Julius Giron , whose party wife Annie Tauli is Execom ( Executive Committee ) member of Ilocos Regional Party Committee and sister of former CPA turned UN Special Rapporteur Victoria Tauli Corpus , think Sison , how this is going to impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
He added that If people can connect the dots , SIsion should start explaining how the CPP-NPA-NDF International Solidarity Works defrauded the UN ( United Nations ) , EU ( European Union ) and several international organizations especially during times of crisis .
" All these connections with JMS , Giron , Tauli , will solidify the NTF ELCAC 's position that all those sham HR ( Human Rights ) investigation of UNCHR ( United Nations Commission on Human Rights ) and of KARAPATAN , and NUPL ( National Union of Peoples Lawyers ) were all part of JMS and Giron 's Oplan Talsik , in tandem with Oust Duterte of the Movement Against Tyranny that we exposed in October 2018 , " he added .
Parlade dared Sison to surrender now while at his peak of infamy , adding that by doing it , at least he will be remembered for fighting in the Netherlands rather in the Philippines with the rest of his communist rebel comrades .
" If I were JMS , I will consider capitulating while at the peak of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel who fought remotely in the comforts of ( the ) Netherlands before Covid-19 eats up your dark disgusting lungs , " he added .
He also slammed Sison for always claiming that the CPP-NPA ranks are on the rise that shows his detachment to the realities in the Philippines .
" I wonder what CPP chair emeritus has to say about his NPAs .
JMS is so detached from the realities in the Philippines .
He keeps saying his army is growing .
How is that possible with the killing of top CPP-NPA honcho Julius Giron ? The capture and killing of many of their NPA leaders and political officers , and the exodus of surrender from his ranks ? " he asked .
Arrogance  Sison 's arrogance in not immediately reciprocating the unilateral ceasefire declared by President Rodrigo R .
Duterte for March 19 to April 15 to allow the AFP to focus on supporting anti-Covid-19 measures of the government was brought by the fact that he wants to win big against the military .
" Jose Maria Sison 's arrogance in not reciprocating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PRRD to enable AFP to support the IATF ( for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases ) has basis after all .
He wanted to make sure that the CPP-NPA ( will ) be able to deliver a big blow to the AFP and its front line responders against Covid-19 , " he added .
Parlade said this plan of communist rebels was demonstrated by CPP-NPA forces attacks against troops visiting and informing communities about Covid-19 in Kabasalan , Zamboanga Sibugay .
This was followed by attacks and atrocities against communities in Lianga , Surigao and Kapalong , Davao Del Norte .
" ( The communist terrorists ) also started killing IPs ( indigenous people ) supportive of localized peace initiatives and of NTF ELCAC .
Everything is going by the plan of the Central Committee to conduct tactical offensive nationwide , " he added .
He said communist in Rizal and Quezon were poised to launch an attack against communities in Puray , Rodriguez over the weekend but the former mass base has already decided to support the government 's NTF ELCAC and reported it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ info that the NPA was planning to attack , the troops executed a community defensive posture a kilometer away from the village .
It resulted in the preemption of enemy attack , the killing of a high-ranking officer of the rebels , recovery of an M-16 rifle , a hand grenade , a rifle grenade , and the recovery of several CPP and Bayan paraphernalia .
Unfortunately it also resulted in the killing of one soldier , " he added , referring to the botched NPA attack against government forces in Rodriguez , Rizal on March 28 .
More surrenderers  He added that Army commanders in Quezon reported the voluntary surrender of three communist terrorists armed with an M-16 automatic rifle and a .
caliber M-1 Garand last March 26 and 27 .
On March 28 , the eve of the 51st NPA anniversary , he said , 40 regular NPA members and Militia ng Bayan ( MBs ) in Camp General Nakar , Quezon , Kalayaan and Sta .
Rosa , Laguna .
The group turned in war material , 14 firearms including one M-16 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistols , rifle grenades , and ammunition .
He dared critics of the NTF ELCAC and government to prove that these surrenders are fake .
