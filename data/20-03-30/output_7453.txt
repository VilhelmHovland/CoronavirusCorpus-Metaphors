LETTER : President Trump has right idea on coronavirus  President Trump has right idea on coronavirus  President Trump has come to terms with the COVID-19 , declaring total war .
Rightfully , he has called this a war and with war there are casualties and in war there are individuals throwing themselves on live grenades .
The Greatest Generation knows war all to well .
They have given by sacrifice their bodies that the nation might live .
The boomers , the greater generation , have given nothing to the country .
is n't it time the greater generation give of themselves rather than taking for themselves .
Volunteering to throw themselves on live grenades ( COVID-19 ) that the nation might live .
I , myself , am 72 and I am way prepared to give my hospital bed ( if it came to that ) to a younger person that he may live , that the nation might live .
President Trump calls this disease the Chinese virus , telling covertly , if you have n't gotten it that COVID-19 came out of a Chinese germ factory .
So President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks is sound government .
Otherwise the Chinese and Russians will assume world power while America remains in its sickbed , and after that , game over .
For the walking wounded , get up , get going , be the arsenal of Democracy that our fathers were .
