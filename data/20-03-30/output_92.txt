Rate of coronavirus infection slows in NSW as authorities urge public to maintain social distancing  The NSW Health Minister repeats pleas for the public to stick to social distancing measures as the number of new infections in the state drops to 174 in the last 24 hours , down from 212 the previous day .
29 March 2020  The number of new COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours in New South Wales has risen by 174 , down considerably on the previous day 's increase of 212 cases .
The total number of confirmed cases is now at 1,791 , with 24 people being treated in intensive care .
It comes as NSW and federal authorities deal with an influx of overseas passengers that must go into mandatory quarantine from today .
About 1,000 travellers have arrived in Sydney today on 12 airplanes .
Police said 30 passengers had been put into high-level isolation due to feeling unwell or experiencing coronavirus symptoms .
About 3,000 passengers in total are expected to arrive today .
Anyone found breaking the quarantine restrictions could face an $11,000 fine and a six-month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation for incoming passengers was most important .
" The need for that isolation and quarantine in our hotels is absolutely crucial .
" We have still thousands of people coming in , our citizens and permanent residents , returning from some of the most dangerous places in the world for COVID-19 , " he said .
" To have this measure will certainly , hopefully , make a huge difference to ensuring those people are not out and about in the community until they are appropriately checked and in quarantine for the period of 14 days .
"  Mr Hazzard repeated pleas for the public to stick to social distancing rules .
" This virus can do it 's evil best but it is not a high jumper , not a long jumper and as long as you are 1 .
away from somebody else , you have a fairly good chance , a reasonable chance , of not actually getting transmission of the virus , " he said .
Mr Hazzard also appealed for better behaviour in the community .
" I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are actually stealing hand cleaner and other items that will keep our frontline staff safe , " he said .
" I 've even heard of reports of hand-cleaner containers being ripped off the wall in hospitals .
I can not think of anything more appalling .
"  NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said 11 fines had been handed out to date for breaching social-distancing and self-isolation rules since they were introduced last week .
He also said reports of a group of 33 medical professionals who arrived from Chile on Friday who did n't self-quarantine was disappointing .
" My understanding is that the orders had n't been served on them at the time , so we may not be able to issue them with infringements .
" But doctors should know better .
We all really know now how serious this is .
" It is my understanding we have been in contact with everyone and they are all in self-isolation now , back in hotels in Sydney , or in their own homes .
