Arbitration in a time of Covid-19 : My experience so far - by Josephine Davies  The spread of Covid-19 across the globe has been dramatic .
Worldwide , governments are imposing restrictions .
This should not , however , stop us helping our clients to resolve their commercial legal disputes .
This note shares my recent experience which shows that , with sensible precautions , it is possible to conduct a London international arbitration safely and effectively .
Techniques developed to meet this time of difficulty may even lead to new ways to conduct arbitration .
The arbitration in question involved parties and expert witnesses from the People 's Republic of China ( ' PRC ' ) , Singapore , Thailand and Hong Kong .
It began in February 2020 before extensive government restrictions were in place but while there were developing concerns about the spread of Covid-19 from those countries .
Several of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their firms and chambers .
The hearing was to resolve long running multimillion-dollar litigation and could not be adjourned .
At very short notice , we had to adopt remote working procedures .
In the end , the hearing was effective and efficient .
Minimising lawyers in the room  One party to the arbitration had instructed lawyers from the PRC who had arrived only a few days before the hearing was due to start .
This posed a problem for many other participants who were prevented , by firm policies and health reasons , from being present in the same room as recent arrivals from the PRC .
To ensure a level playing field , both sides were required to minimise their legal teams and a video link was set up to the arbitration room using a commercial service .
This system worked very effectively .
All lawyers and experts able to gain a full understanding of what was taking place without any ( actual or perceived ) risk of infection .
It may even have improved efficiency because the legal team back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when constrained by the confines of an arbitration room .
Avoiding unnecessary factual and expert witness presence  The majority of witnesses were from jurisdictions with significant Covid-19 outbreaks .
All those witnesses were therefore asked to give evidence by video link .
A couple of witnesses were from jurisdictions then unaffected by Covid-19 but , to ensure a level playing field , those witnesses also gave evidence by video link .
In the common law tradition , great emphasis is placed on cross examination and there is scepticism as to its efficacy by video link .
In this case , however , I consider that concern was misplaced .
Each witness gave evidence from a room with two cameras -- one facing the witness , one showing what the witness could see .
Thus , the traditional requirement that a representative of the opposing party be present with the witness to ' supervise ' was removed .
Interpreters were present in the arbitration room ( rather than being closeted with the witness ) .
All went well .
Although video link has historically had a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one morning where we experienced technical challenges ( which were ultimately resolved without impact ) .
Remote access to documents  Given the short notice on which the arbitration was converted to a largely remote event , it was fortunate that electronic trial bundles had already been adopted .
Screens were set up for each witness in their location and the electronic trial bundle provider synchronised the pages .
This worked well , even for technical documents which required enlargement .
Of course , not every hearing justifies the cost of a full electronic trial bundle system .
However , it is now a rare case in which it is not possible to provide pdfs of the trial bundles .
With pdf trial bundles and modern technology , it should be easily possible to provide a screen share where a junior lawyer simply opens the pdf to the relevant page in much the same way they have always helped the witness find a page in a hard copy bundle .
Could everyone have been remote ?  If you 've read this far , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same room .
So , this begs the question , could we have done everything remotely ? In my view , the answer is yes .
Although the immediacy of personal interaction in the same room can never really be replaced , detailed written submissions and a careful hearing management can make remote hearings effective .
For me , this is demonstrated by a Commercial Court hearing I was involved in last summer .
Counsel were all outside London but , with the benefit of the parties ' detailed written submissions , the judge conducted an effective telephone hearing and produced a judgment which dealt in detail with all the issues raised in the written and oral submissions .
With a video link , the results would be even better .
What does the future hold ?  We live in an increasingly globalised society .
Transnational issues are resolved in jurisdictions remote from the action and the parties ' home countries .
The question is , can such disputes can fairly be resolved with all participants placed remotely ? In my view , if all the participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' yes ' .
Our clients are based internationally .
They do their deals over the phone , email and the internet .
If anyone can understand the efficiencies and potential for remote international dispute resolution , it should be the commercial client .
It is up to us , as their lawyers , to provide them with the best way to resolve their disputes .
We need to keep our minds open .
