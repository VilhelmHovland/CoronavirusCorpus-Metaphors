2020 Lockdown - Motor Racing Quizzes and Puzzles  To complement the long-running ( individual question ) quiz thread I thought I 'd open up this one , designed for anyone gently going crazy at home who fancies contributing or answering a puzzle .
I was thinking .
no time pressure .
nobody to post answers online for , say , a week , so that things are n't spoilt for someone coming to it late .
Originator available to answer queries .
The pm facility could be useful too , from time to time .
But it 's not my thread , any ideas welcome , I 'm just starting it off .
Motor Racing Pairs  Here are twenty four names .
Can you pair them and provide the name that links each pair ? For example , this smaller ( non-motor racing ! ) group of Ray Mitterrand Claude Churchill could be arranged :  Claude ( Francois ) Mitterrand  Ray ( Winston ) Churchill  So here are the twenty four names , all racing drivers .
Not singers , politicians or betting salesmen .
I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last one , but It might be that Chilton 's partner has a mix-up of first/last names .
I have seen that mix-up more often , even in period .
Can you check ?  I think I have got them all , not terribly difficult except for the last one , but It might be that Chilton 's partner has a mix-up of first/last names .
I have seen that mix-up more often , even in period .
Can you check ?  I do n't think many people knew that at the time , Henk .
Certainly not the British press .
