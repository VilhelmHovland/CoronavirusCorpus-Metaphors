Amid the bewildering figures and contradictory political narratives , it is important to recall that numbers and governments are abstractions -- whereas people actually live with and through disease .
By fixating on the former , we risk losing sight of the human dimensions of epidemic life .
As a scholar researching the cultural aspects of the 2003 SARS epidemic , I too initially focused on geopolitics and biosecurity .
But what I discovered in addition -- rarely discussed but vitally humanising -- were the vibrant forms of everyday communal life generated by SARS at its very epicenters .
Under conditions of obligatory isolation and social distancing , common people invented new kinds of sociality and new genres of epidemic expressions .
With Covid-19 now , even more than SARS , the Chinese internet and social media offer a cornucopia of examples of epidemic communities brought together by heart , humor and creativity .
Play  Residents of Wuhan encourage each other while under strict quarantine .
Pandemic solidarity  One early set of viral videos surfaced in Wuhan just five days into the city 's lockdown .
On the night of January 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , " meaning " hang in there " or " do n't give up " -- out their apartment windows , in a spontaneous burst of solidarity .
It was a demonstration of collective strength and defiance , of people 's refusal to be quelled by the virus and the quarantine , and their desire to cheer each other on .
Outside Hubei , other animal lovers likewise help those stuck inside the province look after their pets at home .
These tales of animal caretaking , even in times of human crisis , can usefully offset perceptions of Chinese culture as simply one of cruel and unbridled animal consumption .
Another unexpected focal point for communal care is the face mask .
Across China , masks have become a powerful vehicle for enacting goodwill , generosity and fellowship during the epidemic .
In one viral video from Anhui , an anonymous Good Samaritan was captured on surveillance camera dropping off 500 masks at a local police station .
As he hurried away , two officers ran outside to salute him .
This video in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a song that garnered nearly 600,000 hits within the first day of its upload .
A tribute to ordinary people 's small acts of fortitude and kindness during the outbreak , the music video opens with the Anhui clip and then splices together other moving scenes , including a train employee gifting a mask to an elderly woman passenger and a man distributing free masks to travelers in an airport abroad .
As Manya Koetse reports from Beijing , these social media trends allow people to " mock neighbors , their friends or family , or even themselves in the extreme and sometimes silly measures they are taking to avoid the coronavirus .
" But more than mockery , the very sharing of these memes is a constructive and healing social act .
In times of high stress and distress , to sustain these virtual communities is to deliver shared recognition , concern and laughter .
This is not to say that China 's epidemic experience is solely lighthearted or affirming .
Yet neither does life at epicenters have to be apocalyptic , defined by epic heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Indeed , in other countries that have since become Covid-19 epicenters , social media offer similarly inspiring examples .
Frontline health workers in Iran dance in hospital hallways to buoy their patients as well as themselves , and Italians in lockdown sing from their balconies to boost each other 's morale -- in turn prompting a string of " Italy jiayou " videos from Chinese netizens .
Collectively , these chronicles attest to the idea of pandemic resilience -- the possibility that disease outbreaks can be lived through with empathy , ingenuity and sheer human ordinariness .
