London bike shop offers e-bikes to NHS staff for free on three month loan  A bike shop in London is lending e-bikes for free to NHS staff during the coronavirus pandemic .
Fully Charged , which operates out of premises at London Bridge and also has a branch at Silverstone in Northamptonshire , will be renting the bikes to doctors and nurses in the capital for three months at no cost .
It is also calling on other operators within the cycling industry to help key staff travel to their work as public transport provision in the capital is reduced , resulting in severe overcrowding .
The initiative starts today , Monday 30 March , with 20 bikes available immediately through a partnership with Gocycle , which is providing its GS model , usually retailing at ? 1,999 .
NHS staff in the capital can sign up here , and Fully Charged mechanics will assemble the bikes as well as carrying out pre-delivery inspections .
Dan Parsons , director of operations at Fully Charged , said : " Bicycle stores have been excluded from the Government 's list of mandatory closures amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the importance of cycling as a viable alternative to using public transport , as well as the benefits it offers to people 's health and wellbeing , particularly at a time of self-isolation and social distancing .
" At Fully Charged , given we 're able to remain operational , our focus is on supporting the country 's key workers -- namely NHS staff who are going above and beyond to help those suffering at the hands of COVID-19 .
" With cycling exhibitions cancelled , many demo bikes are going unused .
Fully Charged is grateful to our business partners for enabling us to get these eBikes into the hands of NHS workers for their use during such difficult times .
" We hope NHS staff will seize the offer and , moreover , we are calling on the rest of the industry to help provide more support for doctors and nurses in this way .
" We are grateful to Gocycle as our first partner in this project and hope that other suppliers follow their example and generous commitment , allowing us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Richard Thorpe , founder and designer at Gocycle , commented : " We 've all seen the images of packed tubes in the capital in the last few days .
" With far less traffic above ground , and the reduced number of trains being made available , eBikes are probably the best solution for essential NHS workers to move around the city .
" The last thing frontline staff need after a long day saving lives is being confined within a crowded train carriage or bus or to be stuck standing in a long queue .
" Bicycles are part of the solution , but tired legs will appreciate the benefits of an electric motor to assist them home with less effort .
" It 's a tough time for everyone being on lock down and very hard for small businesses everywhere , " he added  Simon has been news editor at road .
