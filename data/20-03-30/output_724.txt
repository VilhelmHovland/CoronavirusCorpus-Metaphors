"  And it is n't just the Cape that 's worried about the potential for incoming coronavirus cases .
In the Berkshires , state Rep .
William " Smitty " Pignatelli , D-Lee , said he called Lt .
Karyn Polito asking that the Baker administration shut down on the short-term rental industry , including companies like Airbnb , as people in western Massachusetts worry about travelers coming in from nearby New York .
" For someone to promote a Berkshire COVID-19 getaway with free toilet paper is making light of a dangerous situation , " said Pignatelli , saying he saw such an ad that has since been removed .
" We 're not prepared to have an influx of people during a pandemic , not only from a public health standpoint , but from a public safety standpoint .
We 're not equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peak .
"  When asked if Baker is considering implementing such restrictions during a press conference Monday , he said , " We will have more to say about that shortly .
" His office declined to provide more detail on when to expect an announcement or what measures Baker is considering .
Airbnb spokeswoman Kelley Gossett cited efforts the company has made to combat the virus , such as hosts who have opened their homes for free to medical workers and others who need safe places to stay and self-isolate near hospitals .
When asked about the proposals to cut off the Cape , Baker 's office referred to his Friday advisory that all travelers entering the state self-quarantine for 14 days .
More strict policies like Rhode Island 's efforts to obtain out-of-staters ' contact information " sends a similar message , " Baker told reporters , adding that , " we 're not going to take any options off the table .
"  Officials from Cape Cod Healthcare and the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce recently wrote an open letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 days if they come to the Cape during the coronavirus crisis .
Officials in the Berkshires are urging visitors to stay away during the outbreak , noting the lack of space at their hospitals ahead of an expected surge in two weeks .
Pignatelli made a distinction when it comes to second homeowners , but Great Barrington Selectman Stephen Bannon noted that any out-of-state people who do go to the Berkshires should arrive with enough supplies to quarantine for two weeks .
" Our first choice is that people do n't come here because we simply do n't have the medical capacity , " Great Barrington Selectman Ed Abrahams said , noting there are only 25 beds at the local Fairview Hospital , which is " working frantically " to expand to 50 .
Executive Director Jenn Nacht of the Lenox Chamber of Commerce said the group is " not comfortable at this time with visitors coming to the Berkshires for refuge , " also excluding people who own second homes there .
People should remain isolated until the end of April , Nacht said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will already become stretched taking care of residents .
