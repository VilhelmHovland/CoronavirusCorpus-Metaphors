Flying aid to virus-hit Italy , Moscow flexes soft power  Russia has not officially reported deaths from COVID-19 .
By Olga Rotenberg and Maxime Popov  March 26 , 2020 11:27 GMT  Since the coronavirus took hold in Europe , Moscow has sent planes of virus experts and aid to Italy while fighting accusations of spreading disinformation , flexing its " soft power " in various ways during the pandemic .
The Russian defence ministry released multiple daily statements after the first planes took off for Italy on Sunday , carrying 100 virus specialists with medical equipment , mobile laboratories and disinfection units .
The experts sent to Italy have worked on international epidemics including African Swine Fever and in developing an Ebola vaccine , the ministry said .
They are to work in cities including northern Bergamo near Milan , the hardest hit by the virus .
China and Cuba have also sent experts to Italy .
The Russian aid comes at a crucial time for Italy , which has warm ties with Moscow and has supported lifting sanctions against it .
Meanwhile European Union countries have been slow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the EU is also divided on a potential rescue plan for the region 's economy .
Germany has warned against unreasonable expectations while Italy , France and Spain have urged a massive response .

Zakharova was responding to accusations of fuelling fears over the virus .
Earlier this month the EU said Moscow is " spreading disinformation about the coronavirus " in a " significant campaign " in social media accounts linked to the Russian state .
This came less than a month after US officials told AFP that thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram had embarked on a coordinated effort to spread alarm about the virus .
Russia has attributed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures such as closing its border with China at the beginning of the year .
Moscow is building a new dedicated COVID-19 hospital that is due to open in a few weeks , following China 's example .
Russian officials have stressed that the majority of the 658 people with confirmed cases in Russia have recently flown back from western Europe .
Russia has not officially reported deaths from COVID-19 .
Many Russians find it hard to trust this tally , however , given a past history of official cover-ups .
In an address to the nation on Wednesday , Putin made a sombre assessment , saying Russia can not seal itself off from the epidemic and urged the public to stay at home .
" What is happening today in many Western countries -- in Europe and across the ocean -- can become our nearest future , " he said .
For now , though , the low numbers are working to improve Russia 's image abroad , making it appear well-organised and able to impose strong measures .
" If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be further proof that authoritarian regimes work better in such situations , " Malashenko said .
That is the message being put out by pro-Kremlin news outlets and on social media .
If the pandemic proves long-standing and the EU is unable to cope , " respect for Russia will rise , " Malashenko said .
