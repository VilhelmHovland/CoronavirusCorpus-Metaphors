CHL coaches ponder what could have been after cancellation : ' Everybody lost '  Jim Hulton 's lasting image of the 2019-20 season is a bus ride to nowhere .
The head coach and general manager of the Charlottetown Islanders was travelling with his team for a pair of Quebec Major Junior Hockey League games against the Cape Breton Eagles earlier this month when word came down .
Following the lead of other sports across North America , the Canadian Hockey League was suspending play in response to the widening COVID-19 pandemic .
The rest of the regular schedule was cancelled shortly thereafter , but hope remained for the post-season and the annual Memorial Cup tournament .
That hope , however , was snuffed out last week when the CHL -- an umbrella organization for Canada 's three top-tier junior circuits -- pulled the plug amid the novel coronavirus outbreak .
" We were literally on a bus and were told to turn around , " Hulton said .
" We were four hours into a six-hour trip and turned around .
That 's the lasting memory of our group being together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a season .
"  Before the announcement , there were signs that junior hockey would n't be able to delay its decision much longer .
The Memorial Cup , awarded every year since 1919 and pencilled in for late May in Kelowna , B .
, was already fast-approaching .
Coaches and players were hoping for more time , but as the virus that 's already killed thousands of people around the world continued to spread , the announcement seemed inevitable .
" It 's difficult to process , " Hulton said .
" Normally in a season you 'd have a chance to prepare .
You 're either missing the playoffs or if you 're in the playoffs in the heat of a battle , and you know there 's going to be one winner and one loser .
" But here , everybody lost in the blink of an eye .
"  Ottawa 67 's head coach Andre Tourigny , whose team was ranked No .
2 in the CHL , was looking to make another run after opening last spring 's playoffs with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Guelph Storm in the final .
" I have no doubt it 's the right decision , " he said .
" As a hockey team you win , you lose .
Some years you have better chance , but that 's sports .
" It 's more on the human side seeing guys who have played their last junior game , that is extremely tough .
"  Many teams across the country sent players home immediately after the season was postponed amid fears of spreading the virus and the closing of international borders .
There were no in-person goodbyes , team dinners , handshakes or hugs .
And there 's a chance , with the way life works , some players and coaches who spent countless hours together might never again cross paths .
" ( 67 's defencemen ) Noel Hofenmeyer and Nikita Okhotyuk lived together all season -- they might never see each other again , " Tourigny said .
" I might not ever see ( top NHL draft prospect ) Marco Rossi again .
" It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey side , the Vancouver Giants made a number of moves before the Western Hockey League trade deadline .
Now , like most teams , they 're left to ponder unanswerable questions .
" We did n't want to have any regrets , " said head coach Michael Dyck , who led Vancouver to the 2019 WHL final .
" You put everything on the table and let the chips fall where they may , but this year will be a year of what could have been .
" That 's what we 're left with .
and we 'll never know .
"  Portland Winterhawks head coach and GM Mike Johnston , whose sixth-ranked team wound up finishing first in the WHL this season , was able to keep his roster together for a couple of days after the initial postponement before sending players on the way .
" Wish them good luck and hopefully we 're going to see them in another two months , " he said of the message from that final meeting .
" All of us believed when we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon ) .
"  Johnston added he was impressed by the maturity of his veterans in the wake of the crushing news that the season was over .
" They sent out notes to the other players and told them , ' Do n't take anything for granted in your junior career .
It goes by very fast and you never know when your last game 's going to be played , ' " Johnston said .
" We always tell kids to take advantage of every day , every practice , every game .
" Those messages really hit home right now for players that are leaving .
"  Tourigny , meanwhile , was eager for Ottawa 's chance at redemption after that gut-wrenching loss in last spring 's OHL final .
" It 's rare to have a chance to finish first overall after you lost in the final the year before , " he said .
" You have another chance with the same group of players .
And we had that chance .
" We 'll always have that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'll think of 20-year-old goalie Matthew Welsh , who recently set the QMJHL record for career minutes played .
The Islanders were by no means favourites -- Charlottetown sat seventh out of 15 playoff teams when the season was halted -- but they 'll never know where Welsh might have led them .
" You wanted him to be able to ride off into the sunset in a victorious way , " Hulton said .
" We had our hopes set on him in terms of a Cinderella playoff run .
" You envision him capping off his career in a grander fashion than getting the bus turned around on side of the highway .
