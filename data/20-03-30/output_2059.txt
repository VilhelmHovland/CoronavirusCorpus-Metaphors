There are n't many people in the world who do n't know about the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected over 500,000 people , killed 23,000 and ravaged several countries such as Italy , China and the U .
In fact , many are seeking a break from the daily churn of gloomy pandemic updates and self-isolation tips .
Anyone looking for a welcome distraction found it in Boo the bear in Golden , B .
A video of Boo , a hulking grizzly bear , groggily emerging from his snowy hibernation in time for spring has racked up more than 100,000 views on Twitter .
In the video , Boo pops his head out of a thick layer of snow and looks around confusedly as his caretaker , Nicole Gangnon , excitedly films him on her cellphone .
" Eight years it took me to catch this moment , " she says gleefully as Boo lumbers his way into the sunlight .
Gangnon , who along with a colleague has been taking care of Boo ever since he was a little bit more than a year old , said she had attempted to catch this moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cameras .
" But you know how , when you try to get something with technology , technology fails you at that moment ? " she told the National Post .
For the past 18 years , Boo has lived at the Grizzly Bear Refuge , a sprawling 20-acre enclosure , owned by the Kicking Horse resort in Golden .
He was born in the wild with his brother Cari , Gangnon says , but was found after their mother was found shot dead by a poacher .
With little-to-no rehabilitation resources available at the time , the only option was to euthanize the bear cubs or take them into captivity at the refuge , she said .
Within a year of living at the refuge , Cari died from a twisted intestine .
But Boo continued to thrive and has become the refuge 's ambassador .
" He helps us educate the public on his kind , why they 're there , their importance to the ecosystem , " Gangnon said .
As a male bear , Boo is accustomed to an independent lifestyle , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin den in the winter , where he hibernates , often buried under more than two metres of snow .
The snow helps to insulate the cabin , Gangnon explained , and also allows the sun to seep through as spring approaches , indicating to Boo that the winter season is ending .
On March 17 , Gangnon said she was repairing the electric fences that surround the habitat when she heard shuffling-like sounds coming from Boo 's den .
" I 've heard them before , sometimes it 's just him shifting or stretching his muscles , " she said .
Boo the bear plays with a branch at Grizzly Bear Refuge , at Golden , B .
Horse Resort  However , as she could hear him begin to dig through the snow -- a sign that he was ready to emerge -- Gangnon climbed up onto the roof of the den and got her phone-camera ready .
" I could hear him sniffing and digging and pause to figure out what direction to go into , " she said .
Moments later , a fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera on , just in time to catch Boo peeking out .
" You could hear the elation in my voice to capture that moment , " she said .
" It 's like a family member went away and then a grand reunion .
"  Despite the current pandemic , Gangnon said that she and her colleague will continue looking after Boo .
" We are considered essential as we do need to be around to take care of Boo and provide him with what he needs , " she said .
Rules on social-distancing and self-isolation would have almost no effect on Boo 's schedule of sleeping and eating -- if anything , according to Gangnon , the lack of skiers at the resort this year means Boo can move from his den into his habitat earlier than usual .
And once there , Boo will continue on with his spring and summer , blissfully unaware of COVID-19 and the little relief he brought to his many fans on social media .
" It 's important that people have something happy to reflect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Gangnon said .
In the past social distancing has helped to mitigate the effects of pandemics .
