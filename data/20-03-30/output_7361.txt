How Indiana hospitals are preparing to handle the surge of coronavirus patients  Indiana health officials outlined Monday how the state 's hospitals are preparing for an expected surge in coronavirus patients by expanding the number of critical care beds and taking steps to increase the pool of health care providers .
State and hospital officials say they are bracing to see an influx of patients sometime between mid-April and mid-May .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus as of Monday .
About 40% of Indiana 's intensive care unit beds are open , said State Health Commissioner Kris Box said , but that availability is expected to change dramatically in the next few weeks .
In a sobering moment Monday during Gov .
Eric Holcomb 's daily briefings , now held via video teleconferencing , the chief medical officer for the Indiana State Department of Health urged people to talk with their family members about end of life planning -- just in case .
" It 's time to have that conversation now , " Dr .
Lindsay Weaver said .
Increasing critical care beds  Hospital officials for weeks have been discussing how to handle a surge , from expanding critical care beds to ensuring the state has enough medical personnel and supplies to protect them on the job .
Since March 1 Indiana 's hospitals have increased the number of critical care , or intensive care unit , beds from 1,432 to 1,940 , a 35 percent increase , said Dr .
Jennifer Sullivan , secretary of the Family and Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the state had a baseline of 1,177 ventilators , which may become necessary to keep alive someof those who become severely ill with COVID-19 , the disease caused by the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 .
Based on models of what Indiana 's surge may require , the state has a goal of doubling that number , Sullivan said .
Hospitals can readily change the number of critical care beds by repurposing non-traditional space , said Sullivan , an emergency room physician .
This can include using beds formerly designated for less severely ill patientsor moving beds into unused spaces like operating suites and recovery rooms .
Discharging patients to clear rooms  Indiana University Health staff are working hard to discharge patients to help create capacity , said Dr .
Chris Weaver , senior vice president of clinical effectiveness at Indiana University Health .
IU Health Methodist has moved its NICU and other pediatric units to Riley Children 's Hospital to free up the space for adult intensive care .
" Hospitals can increase the number of critical care spaces they have at a moment 's notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds in our emergency department is pretty irrelevant .
It is the supplies and people we need to take care of critical care patients .
"  Increasing the pool of providers  On Monday Holcomb signed an executive order that aims to increase the pool of providers who can care for patients by allowing retired nurses and doctors to volunteer to help out .
Fourth-year medical and nursing students also are being asked to help .
IU Health has established a system that allows facilities that need ventilators to reach out to others across the system to find if any other site might be able to give them one , Christopher Weaver said .
In addition , the hospital system is looking into repurposing anesthesia machines previously used for elective surgeries into ventilators .
" We believe that Indiana 's COVID patient surge will begin soon , and the peak surge is expected to be mid-April to mid-May , " Sullivan said .
The surge curve could wind up being flattened somewhat so the peak would not necessarily be as high but would last over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ' emerging hot spots '  Central Indiana already has seen such a dramatic increase in the number of cases in the past week that it prompted U .
Surgeon General Jerome Adams to Tweet over the weekend that Indianapolis was one of the virus ' " emerging hot spots .
"  Adams , who served as state health commissioner before he took the national post , noted in an email that Indianapolis is his adopted home and the place where his three children were born .
He added that such areas need to follow President Donald Trump 's guidance on how to slow the outbreak .
Indianapolis " is also unfortunately one of several areas in the country where we are seeing a rapid uptick in COVID-19 cases , " he said .
" What metropolitan areas like Indianapolis do right now will determine their trajectory and outcomes in the coming days and weeks .
"  At his press briefing , Holcomb said that he spoke to Adams this morning and appreciated what he has been doing .
Likewise , Adams said he was confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department Director Virginia Caine .
One Central Indiana hospital system already has braced for the worst .
Afraid that the coronavirus could lead to multiple deaths , Community Health Network officials plan to use temporary units outside the hospital to handle any overflow .
" Unfortunately , we also must prepare for the likelihood of an unprecedented surge of deaths as a result of COVID-19 , " Community spokeswoman Kris Kirshner said in an email .
" Because the morgue space within our hospitals is limited , if needed , we plan to utilize temporary refrigerated units to appropriately place those victims until their families are able to make funeral arrangements .
" We realize this is a sensitive issue , and maintaining the dignity and respect of our patients and their families is our top priority , " she said .
If the state experiences a surge beyond the hospitals ' initial preparations , a Plan B and then Plan C and beyond would kick into play , Sullivan said .
For instance , less critical patients might move to neighborhood hospitals or medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty floors at state facilities such as the NeuroDiagnostic Institute on the east side or Richmond State Hospital , Sullivan said .
Recently closed facilities , such as one in Michigan City , might reopen .
She said the state is poised to open field hospitals and alternative care sites with as little as 24 hours notice .
" My sincere desire is that much of this will go unused , " she said .
" However , there is absolutely a possibility that the best surge plans and social distancing measures will still require us to find alternative resources to care for large numbers of patients , and we are planning to those levels of surge as well .
