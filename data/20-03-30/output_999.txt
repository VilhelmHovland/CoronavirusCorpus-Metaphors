Jenny Lee offers a personal perspective on helping a child with autism cope with the chaos and uncertainty of coronavirus  Journalist Jenny Lee on her son Noah : ' I worry about his future .
I worry that he will not cope with a return to formal education '  OBSESSIONS , repetitive behaviour and routines are how people with autism cope with everyday life .
If a traffic accident or roadworks makes a parent deviate from the way they normally path to school , it can lead to heightened anxiety for the child and even them refusing to get out of the car .
School closures and special times of the year , like Christmas , can be magical to many families , but a time of trepidation for parents of autistic children , who know that they ca n't cope with the unexpected , the change of routine , even the sensory assaults of the season , such as smells .
These occasions need careful planning and preparing the child for changes of routine .
So what do you families of neurodiverse children do when you add a global pandemic into the mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school and their classroom assistant is taken away from them and everyone around them is acting anxious .
They 're told they ca n't go to the play park or see their cousins and everyone must stay in their houses because of a virus that can kill .
Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) varies vastly from those who are non-verbal and have learning disabilities , to those who have Asperger 's syndrome , who are highly intelligent but also struggle with social understanding , behaviour and communication .
My nine-year-old son Noah has ASD , as well as dyspraxia and dyslexia .
After many challenging years fighting for diagnosis and support , he was finally awarded a ' statement ' and since December he has had the support of a classroom assistance and access to assistive technology .
It 's been wonderful seeing him no longer afraid to go into school , or to attempt to read a few lines , without hiding under the table .
He has been starting to slowly gain some self-esteem and confidence and to believe in his own ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must admit the past two weeks have been a massive struggle , for both him and the entire family .
He has a lot of sensory issues , including an aversion to water , so increased handwashing has been a struggle .
We have seen the return of daily meltdowns ( bigger , more emotional , longer-lasting , and more difficult to manage than the average temper tantrum ) , stimming behaviour ( rocking , head banging , repeated noises ) , emotional shut-downs , violently lashing out at his sister , and anxiety .
And as he has previously had treatment for self-harming , this is extremely worrying development .
On numerous mornings , he has asked " What 's happening today ? " The answer has been met with disappointment -- he 's collapsed in floods of tears saying , " I want to go to school " or " I do n't know what to do .
"  A quarter of the world 's population is under lockdown .
When the world comes grinding to a halt , it 's difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a child with ASD to understand why he ca n't go to his McDonald 's or even visit his granny .
The internet has a number of helpful social stories , which help explain coronavirus , and Autism NI have produced some useful resources , including an anxiety resource pack and educational resource kit , which can be downloaded from their website , Autismni .
Like many , I 'm trying to juggle working from home with the demands of childcare and home schooling .
Our phones are constantly sending alerts , our children 's schools asking you to sign up to a number of online learning platforms .
While his little sister ca n't get enough of worksheets and online learning videos , attempts to home school Noah usually result in angry or tearful outbursts where he repeatedly says " I 'm dumb .
"  Of course I do n't want my child to regress in school ; I want him to continue his reading programme , but I 'm learning , through experience , that when a child is feeling stressed , learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning tool in the ASD environment , so we are gently creating a new one -- one that incorporates plenty of time spent outdoors .
Many kids with ASD seek solace in watching a screen , but not mine .
We are blessed to live on a farm , so when the books fly and the tears fall , Noah 's safe place is usually found up an apple tree -- and in today 's uncertain world , I 'm happy that he has found that place .
So digging soil , shovelling stones , gathering apple-tree prunings and feeding animals is our current home schooling timetable .
Fractions , division and phonics can wait until we rediscover calm and order .
Yes , I worry about his future .
I worry about his social skills .
I worry will he may never be able to read and write .
I worry that he will not cope with a return to formal education .
But this current global crisis makes us all feel grateful for our families and is a reminder that my child 's mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Autism services , CAMHS and Rise NI have made a series of resources available on supporting children with ASD coping with COVID-19 isolation , available at **34;0;TOOLONG .
AUTISM IN THE LOCKDOWN  ? Shirelle Stewart , director of the National Autistic Society Northern Ireland , shares advice on coping during the coronavirus pandemic .
" This is an unprecedented situation .
It is affecting everyone 's lives , including the 18,000 autistic people in Northern Ireland and their families .
" This sudden unexpected change and disruption to everyday life is particularly hard for autistic children and adults .
A cancelled appointment , empty shelf or closure of a local caf ? can be so much more than an inconvenience -- it could trigger intense stress and lead to a meltdown or a shut down .
" Many autistic people and families will find it hard to adjust to this drastic new lifestyle .
But it 's important to keep calm .
" Give each day structure , by making time for exercise , eating and fun activities .
With all the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking out the most important parts only .
Communicate this clearly and give yourself or your family enough time to process and respond .
" Think about what you like from your usual sensory environment at work or school and try to create this at home m -- for instance by only have cooking smells at certain times of day , using noise-cancelling headphones so outside noise is n't a distraction or finding a quiet area in your home .
" If you 're feeling lonely while social distancing or self-isolating , talk to friends and family over the phone , connect to other parents on our online community or get support through our Parent to Parent service .
