: This William &amp; Mary freshman class has been studying coronavirus since January  When the coronavirus first made its way into the United States , there was an unlikely group that was n't too surprised : A class at the College of William &amp; Mary .
Since January , the group of 16 students has been taken a semester-long class called Emerging Diseases , a popular freshmen-level class that Dr .
Beverly Sher has been teaching since 1996 .
Sher , a senior lecturer in W&amp;M 's chemistry department , had first noticed news of the coronavirus , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease was an unusual pneumonia that was sickening people in China .
By late January , " it was obvious it was going to be a problem , " she said .
So when the college semester kicked off , one of her first questions to her class was about the coronavirus .
" It was day one , " recalled student Mac McEvoy , a 19-year-old from Orlando , Florida .
" We walked into class and she said , ' So have you heard about the news ? ' That was the first thing we talked about .
"  As a class , Emerging Diseases focuses on just what the title says : emerging diseases throughout the world , both past and present .
The class discusses historical outbreaks such as the 1918 flu , Ebola and AIDS , talks about antibiotic-resistant bacteria and examines how diseases can start and spread .
Previous classes watched the spread of SARS in 2003 , and a mild flu pandemic in 2009 , but COVID-19 has been different .
" I never wanted Emerging Diseases to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I said since I first taught it that there will be another pandemic .
We 've known that .
We 've always known that .
And here it is .
"  Even when Virginia lost three consecutive ACC games in January , and especially when the Cavaliers started to win all the nail biters in February and March , the recurring topic never stopped serving as a motivator .
Mamadi Diakite and Braxton Key spoke about it with the sage wisdom that only comes from experienced NCAA tournament travelers longing to return to something resembling the scene of their greatest glories .
Just when it seemed within reach , it was gone .
No matter how hard they worked to achieve it again , the opportunity was never coming back -- a cruel reality in the coronavirus outbreak for U .
' s seniors .
" We talked about it all year that we thought we could go to the Final Four , " Key said .
" I thought we were getting hot at the right time .
It 's obviously unfortunate we 'll never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season , including seven of those victories by three points or fewer , will be one of the sweetest memories of their senior years .
It 's not the final recollection either Diakite or Key wanted .
After making indelible contributions in Virginia 's dramatic run to the championship in the 2019 NCAA tournament , including Diakite 's game-tying shot at the buzzer in the eventual overtime Elite Eight win against Purdue , Diakite and Key both hoped to have the chance to defend that title .
For Diakite , having another opportunity to play in the NCAA tournament would 've meant extending a college career at U .
that started after he came from Guinea on the west coast of Africa to the Blue Ridge School in St .
George .
