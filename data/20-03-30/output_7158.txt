Square Enix reveals European and Australian players may receive the game sooner than April 10 launch  In an unusual move , Square Enix has decided to ship Final Fantasy VII Remake earlier than planned in select regions .
A statement released via Twitter attributes the decision to the disruption caused by COVID-19 , which producer Yoshinori Kitase and director Tetsuya Nomura say has " made it very difficult to align timing of our global shipping .
"  But in an effort to avoid that , Square Enix has decided to " ship the game far earlier than usual to Europe and Australia .
"  Players who pre-ordered in these regions may now receive their copy before April 10 .
The publisher remains optimistic that the game will reach other western regions in time for its intended launch , although it can not provide specific delivery dates .
Kitase and Nomura asked players who do receive the game early to avoid spoiling it for those who have to wait -- acknowledging the irony , given the original came out in 1997 , but emphasising the remake features its own secrets and surprises .
