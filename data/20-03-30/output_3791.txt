Speaking about the impact of COVID-19 and managing its business impact , Christos Adamantiadis -- Marsh Middle East &amp; Africa CEO , says : " Current events have taught us that as the world becomes more inter-connected , the risk of disease outbreaks may increase , and preparation for a pandemic will become a mainstay of business continuity plans going forward .
