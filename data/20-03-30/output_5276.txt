The Australian economy is currently in the ' stop ' or freefall phase of the ' U ' depicted in Chart 1 below .
Bushfires and the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to result in a moderate fall in economic growth in the March quarter .
However , as ' lockdown ' measures only began to be ramped up during March , expectations are for a massive fall in output over the June quarter as most of the hit to the economy will be taken then .
Economic growth could fall by as much as 10% over the first half of the year .
A sharp lift in the unemployment rate into the 8% to 12% range appears in store and has elicited a swift , dynamic and powerful fiscal and monetary policy response as policymakers seek to build a bridge to the other side of the U .
It is important to emphasise that this COVID-19 shock is finite and that when we are all allowed to resume our normal lives , activity will begin to normalise .

Time spent at the bottom of the ' U ' will be a function of how well countries manage the spread of the virus and will test citizens ' and governments ' resolve and societal cohesion .
A range of challenges wait at the other side of the ' U ' .
Policy accommodation will have to be unwound at some stage , with little appetite for post-GFC austerity measures .
Countries will most likely question supply chain vulnerabilities and there could be a further retreat of globalism .
' On-shoring ' the production of goods and services , while providing a national security benefit , will result in a decrease in welfare .
For debt holders , the blurring of monetary and fiscal policy increases longer term inflation risk .
