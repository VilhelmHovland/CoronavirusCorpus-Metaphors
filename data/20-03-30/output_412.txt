What 's often referred to as the first pandemic began in the city of Pelusium , near modern-day Port Said , in northeastern Egypt , in the year 541 .
According to the historian Procopius , who was alive at the time , the " pestilence " spread both west , toward Alexandria , and east , toward Palestine .
Then it kept on going .
In his view , it seemed to move almost consciously , " as if fearing lest some corner of the earth might escape it .
"  The earliest symptom of the pestilence was fever .
Often , Procopius observed , this was so mild that it did not " afford any suspicion of danger .
" But , within a few days , victims developed the classic symptoms of bubonic plague -- lumps , or buboes , in their groin and under their arms .
The suffering at that point was terrible ; some people went into a coma , others into violent delirium .
Many vomited blood .
Those who attended to the sick " were in a state of constant exhaustion , " Procopius noted .
" For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No one could predict who was going to perish and who would pull through .
In early 542 , the plague struck Constantinople .
At that time , the city was the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire , which was led by the Emperor Justinian .
A recent assessment calls Justinian " one of the greatest statesmen who ever lived .
" Another historian describes the first part of his reign -- he ruled for almost forty years -- as " a flurry of action virtually unparalleled in Roman history .
" In the fifteen years before the pestilence reached the capital , Justinian codified Roman law , made peace with the Persians , overhauled the Eastern Empire 's fiscal administration , and built the Hagia Sophia .
As the plague raged , it fell to Justinian , in Procopius ' words , to " make provision for the trouble .
" The Emperor paid for the bodies of the abandoned and the destitute to be buried .
Even so , it was impossible to keep up ; the death toll was too high .
( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though no one is sure if this is accurate .
) John of Ephesus , another contemporary of Justinian 's , wrote that " nobody would go out of doors without a tag upon which his name was written , " in case he was suddenly stricken .
Eventually , bodies were just tossed into fortifications at the edge of the city .
The plague hit the powerless and the powerful alike .
Justinian himself contracted it .
Among the lucky , he survived .
His rule , however , never really recovered .
In the years leading up to 542 , Justinian 's generals had reconquered much of the western part of the Roman Empire from the Goths , the Vandals , and other assorted barbarians .
After 542 , the Emperor struggled to recruit soldiers and to pay them .
The territories that his generals had subdued began to revolt .
The plague reached the city of Rome in 543 , and seems to have made it all the way to Britain by 544 .
It broke out again in Constantinople in 558 , a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The Justinianic plague , as it became known , did n't burn itself out until 750 .
By that point , there was a new world order .
A powerful new religion , Islam , had arisen , and its followers ruled territory that included a great deal of what had been Justinian 's empire , along with the Arabian Peninsula .
Much of Western Europe , meanwhile , had come under the control of the Franks .
Rome had been reduced to about thirty thousand people , roughly the population of present-day Mamaroneck .
Was the pestilence partly responsible ? If so , history is written not only by men but also by microbes .
Just as there are many ways for microbes to infect a body , there are many ways for epidemics to play out in the body politic .
Epidemics can be short-lived or protracted , or , like the Justinianic plague , recurrent .
Often , they partner with war ; sometimes the pairing favors the aggressor , sometimes the aggressed .
Epidemic diseases can become endemic , which is to say constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to a new region or when conditions change .
To this last category belongs smallpox , dubbed the speckled monster , which may have killed more than a billion people before it was eradicated , in the mid-twentieth century .
No one knows exactly where smallpox originated ; the virus -- part of the genus that includes cowpox , camelpox , and monkeypox -- is believed to have first infected humans around the time that people began domesticating animals .
Signs of smallpox have been found in Egyptian mummies , including Ramses V , who died in 1157 B .
The Romans seem to have picked up the pox near present-day Baghdad , when they went to fight one of their many enemies , the Parthians , in 162 .
The Roman physician Galen reported that those who came down with the new disease suffered a rash that was " ulcerated in most cases and totally dry .
" ( The epidemic is sometimes referred to as the Plague of Galen .
) Marcus Aurelius , the last of the so-called Five Good Emperors , who died in 180 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the fifteenth century , as Joshua S .
Loomis reports in " Epidemics : The Impact of Germs and Their Power Over Humanity " ( Praeger ) , smallpox had become endemic throughout Europe and Asia , meaning that most people were probably exposed to it at some point in their lives .
Over all , the fatality rate was a terrifying thirty per cent , but among young children it was much higher -- more than ninety per cent in some places .
Loomis , a professor of biology at East Stroudsburg University , writes that the danger was so grave that " parents would commonly wait to name their children until after they had survived smallpox .
" Anyone who made it through acquired permanent immunity ( though many were left blind or horribly scarred ) .
This dynamic meant that every generation or so there was a major outbreak , as the number of people who had managed to avoid getting infected as children slowly rose .
It also meant , as Loomis rather cavalierly observes , that Europeans enjoyed a major advantage as they " began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Alfred W .
Crosby , the historian who coined the phrase " the Columbian Exchange , " also coined the term " virgin soil epidemic , " defined as one in which " the populations at risk have had no previous contact with the diseases that strike them and are therefore immunologically almost defenseless .
" The first " virgin soil epidemic " in the Americas -- or , to use another one of Crosby 's formulations , " the first New World pandemic " -- began toward the end of 1518 .
That year , someone , presumably from Spain , carried smallpox to Hispaniola .
This was a quarter of a century after Columbus ran aground on the island , and the native Ta ? no population had already been much reduced .
The speckled monster laid waste to those who remained .
Two friars , writing to the King of Spain , Charles I , in early 1519 , reported that a third of the island 's inhabitants were stricken : " It has pleased Our Lord to bestow a pestilence of smallpox among the said Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smallpox spread to Puerto Rico .
Within two years , it had reached the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl ? n , in what 's now Mexico City , a development that allowed Hern ? n Cort ? s to conquer the capital , in 1521 .
A Spanish priest wrote , " In many places it happened that everyone in a house died , and , as it was impossible to bury the great number of dead , they pulled down the houses over them .
" Smallpox seems to have reached the Incan Empire before the Spaniards did ; the infection raced from one settlement to the next faster than the conquistadores could travel .
Advertisement  It 's impossible to say how many people died in the first New World pandemic , both because the records are sketchy and because Europeans also brought with them so many other " virgin soil " diseases , including measles , typhoid , and diphtheria .
In all , the imported microbes probably killed tens of millions of people .
" The discovery of America was followed by possibly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " William M .
Denevan , a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , has written .
This disaster changed the course of history not just in Europe and the Americas but also in Africa : faced with a labor shortage , the Spanish increasingly turned to the slave trade .
The word " quarantine " comes from the Italian quaranta , meaning " forty .
" As Frank M .
Snowden explains in " Epidemics and Society : From the Black Death to the Present " ( Yale ) , the practice of quarantine originated long before people understood what , exactly , they were trying to contain , and the period of forty days was chosen not for medical reasons but for scriptural ones , " as both the Old and New Testaments make multiple references to the number forty in the context of purification : the forty days and forty nights of the flood in Genesis , the forty years of the Israelites wandering in the wilderness .
and the forty days of Lent .
"  The earliest formal quarantines were a response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killed something like a third of Europe and ushered in what 's become known as the " second plague pandemic .
" As with the first , the second pandemic worked its havoc fitfully .
Plague would spread , then abate , only to flare up again .
During one such flareup , in the fifteenth century , the Venetians erected lazarettos -- or isolation wards -- on outlying islands , where they forced arriving ships to dock .
The Venetians believed that by airing out the ships they were dissipating plague-causing vapors .
If the theory was off base , the results were still salubrious ; forty days gave the plague time enough to kill infected rats and sailors .
Snowden , a professor emeritus at Yale , calls such measures one of the first forms of " institutionalized public health " and argues that they helped legitimatize the " accretion of power " by the modern state .
There 's a good deal of debate about why the second pandemic finally ended ; one of the last major outbreaks in Europe occurred in Marseille in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , they often provoked , as Snowden puts it , " evasion , resistance , and riot .
" Public-health measures ran up against religion and tradition , as , of course , they still do .
The fear of being separated from loved ones prompted many families to conceal cases .
And , in fact , those charged with enforcing the rules often had little interest in protecting the public .
Consider the case of cholera .
In the ranks of dread diseases , cholera might come in third , after the plague and smallpox .
Cholera is caused by a comma-shaped bacterium , Vibrio cholerae , and for most of human history it was restricted to the Ganges Delta .
Then , in the eighteen-hundreds , steamships and colonialism sent Vibrio cholerae travelling .
The first cholera pandemic broke out in 1817 near Calcutta .
It moved overland to modern-day Thailand and by ship to Oman , whence it was carried down to Zanzibar .
The second cholera pandemic began in 1829 , once again in India .
It wound its way through Russia into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast to plague and smallpox , which made few class distinctions , cholera , which is spread via contaminated food or water , is primarily a disease of urban slums .
When the second pandemic struck Russia , Tsar Nicholas I established strict quarantines .
These may have slowed the spiral of spread , but they did nothing to help those already infected .
The situation , according to Loomis , was exacerbated by health officials who indiscriminately threw together cholera victims and people suffering from other ailments .
It was rumored that doctors were purposefully trying to kill off the sick .
In the spring of 1831 , riots broke out in St .
Petersburg .
One demonstrator returning from a melee reported that a doctor had " got a coupl 've rocks in the neck ; he sure wo n't forget us for a long time .
" The following spring , cholera riots broke out in Liverpool .
Once again , doctors were the main targets ; they were accused of poisoning cholera victims and turning them blue .
( Cholera has been called the " blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dehydrated that their skin becomes slate-colored .
) Similar riots broke out in Aberdeen , Glasgow , and Dublin .
In 1883 , during the fifth cholera pandemic , the German physician Robert Koch established the cause of the disease by isolating the Vibrio cholerae bacterium .
The following year , the pandemic hit Naples .
The city dispatched inspectors to confiscate suspect produce .
It also sent out disinfection squads , which arrived at the city 's tenements with guns drawn .
Neapolitans were , understandably , skeptical of both the inspectors and the squads .
They responded with an impressive sense of humor , if not necessarily a keen understanding of epidemiology .
Demonstrators showed up at city hall with baskets of overripe figs and melons .
They proceeded , Snowden writes , " to consume the forbidden fruit in enormous quantities while those who watched applauded and bet on which binger would eat the most .
"  Eight years later , while the fifth pandemic raged on , one of the most violent cholera riots broke out in what 's now the Ukrainian city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and businesses were burned .
The authorities in St .
Petersburg responded to the violence by cracking down on workers accused of promoting " lawlessness .
" According to Loomis , the crackdown prompted more civil unrest , which in turn prompted more repression , and , thus , in a roundabout sort of way , cholera helped " set the stage " for the Russian Revolution .
The seventh cholera pandemic began in 1961 , on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi .
During the next decade , it spread to India , the Soviet Union , and several nations in Africa .
There were no mass outbreaks for the next quarter century , but then one hit Peru in 1991 , claiming thirty-five hundred lives ; another outbreak , in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo , in 1994 , claimed twelve thousand .
By most accounts , the seventh pandemic is ongoing .
In October , 2010 , cholera broke out in rural Haiti , then quickly spread to Port-au-Prince and other major cities .
This was nine months after a magnitude-7 .
earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of the outbreak was a base that housed United Nations peacekeeping troops from Nepal .
Riots occurred in the city of Cap-Ha ? tien ; at least two people were killed , and flights carrying aid to the country were suspended .
For years , the U .
denied that its troops had brought cholera to Haiti , but it eventually admitted that the rumors were true .
Since the outbreak began , eight hundred thousand Haitians have been sickened and nearly ten thousand have died .
Epidemics are , by their very nature , divisive .
The neighbor you might , in better times , turn to for help becomes a possible source of infection .
The rituals of daily life become opportunities for transmission ; the authorities enforcing quarantine become agents of oppression .
Time and time again throughout history , people have blamed outsiders for outbreaks .
( On occasion , as in the case of the U .
peacekeeping troops , they 've been right .
) Snowden recounts the story of what happened to the Jews of Strasbourg during the Black Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pestilence -- they had , it was said , poisoned the wells -- and offered them a choice : convert or die .
Half opted for the former .
On February 14 , 1349 , the rest " were rounded up , taken to the Jewish cemetery , and burned alive .
" Pope Clement VI issued papal bulls pointing out that Jews , too , were dying from the plague , and that it would n't make sense for them to poison themselves , but this does n't seem to have made much difference .
In 1349 , Jewish communities in Frankfurt , Mainz , and Cologne were wiped out .
To escape the violence , Jews migrated en masse to Poland and Russia , permanently altering the demography of Europe .
Advertisement  Whenever disaster strikes , like right about now , it 's tempting to look to the past for guidance on what to do or , alternatively , what not to do .
It has been almost fifteen hundred years since the Justinianic plague , and , what with plague , smallpox , cholera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are an epidemic number of epidemics to reflect on .
The trouble is that , for all the common patterns that emerge , there are at least as many confounding variations .
During the cholera riots , people blamed not outsiders but insiders ; it was doctors and government officials who were targeted .
Smallpox helped the Spanish conquer the Aztec and Incan Empires , but other diseases helped defeat colonial powers .
During the Haitian Revolution , for example , Napoleon tried to retake the French colony , in 1802 , with some fifty thousand men .
So many of his soldiers died from yellow fever that , after a year , he gave up on the attempt , and also decided to sell the Louisiana Territory to the Americans .
Even the mathematics of outbreaks varies dramatically from case to case .
As Adam Kucharski , a professor at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and the author of " The Rules of Contagion " ( forthcoming in the U .
from Basic Books ) , points out , the differences depend on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time an individual is contagious , and the social networks that each disease exploits .
" There 's a saying in my field : ' if you 've seen one pandemic , you 've seen .
