Only Multilateralism Can Save Us  By Anne O .
Krueger  Between a coronavirus pandemic and collapsing stock markets , the global economy may be in a worse situation than it was during the 2008 financial crisis , because America has all but slammed the door shut on international cooperation .
And yet , without a multilateral response , the US will suffer as much as anyone .

Many commentators have been warning that stock markets were overheated , that advanced economies were heading for a slowdown , and that US President Donald Trump 's protectionist policies had disrupted supply chains and ushered in an era of heightened uncertainty .
Now , the stock market has finally crashed , and a recession has become almost inevitable .
In the past , the international community has successfully mustered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by SARS in 2003 , H1N1 ( swine flu ) in 2009 , MERS in 2012 , Ebola in 2014-2016 , and the 2008 global financial crisis were all contained through rapid multilateral action .
But Trump has shown nothing but contempt for multilateralism , which helps to explain why a global response to the COVID-19 crisis has yet to materialize .
Trump 's flailing response to the outbreak is a sharp departure from that of his predecessor .
According to former Vice President Joe Biden , now the leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination , Barack Obama 's administration helped to contain multiple previous outbreaks by convening health officials from around the world in the White House Situation Room , where they mapped out a coordinated response .
Earlier economic downturns were likewise addressed through multilateral channels .
At the height of the global financial crisis , the G20 repudiated trade protectionism and committed to pursuing simultaneous fiscal and monetary expansion .
We now know that this coordinated response played a major role in preventing the downturn from getting significantly worse .
The current crisis is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents challenges above and beyond those previous threats .
In what amounts to an economic perfect storm , the pandemic has combined with preexisting recessionary pressures , the broader disruption to global trade , and a new and somewhat unexpected complication : a sharp drop in oil prices .
Major oil-exporting countries ' failure to agree on either price or production limits has driven the price of oil to $20 per barrel .
That may be good for US consumers and oil-importing countries , but it also means that many US fracking companies will struggle to service their debts .
Falling investment and an increase in nonperforming loans will become another major source of downward pressure on economic activity .
The current disarray in global trade also hurts .
From the beginning , the Trump administration has rejected America 's long tradition of global leadership and support for the open multilateral trading system .
Opting instead for bilateral deals with trading partners , the US has bullied its allies along with everyone else .
Almost all of America 's trading partners , including the European Union and Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel and aluminum .
And Mexico , Canada , South Korea , Turkey , India , Brazil , and Argentina have all been pummeled with non-negotiable demands for US-friendly revisions to previously negotiated trade agreements , on the threat that previously granted favors will be revoked .
The trade war with China , moreover , is still ongoing .
In the current climate of uncertainty , exporters do not know whether they will suddenly face new tariffs , and importers are reluctant to expand domestic productive capacity because they do not know if or when existing tariffs will be rescinded .
Protectionist policies thus continue to disrupt supply chains and discourage investment around the world .
These factors will not only make the next recession more severe ; they also are making it much harder to organize a global response .
There is already near-unanimous support for fiscal and monetary stimulus to soften the blow from the pandemic .
But in the absence of multilateral coordination , these policy responses will issue haphazardly from individual countries .
A 2008-style concerted push would provide far more stimulus and improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option is quickly closing .
Still , there is a chance for a coordinated push under the auspices of the G20 or the International Monetary Fund .
Jointly orchestrated monetary and fiscal policies would provide not just immediate stimulus but also a boost in confidence , as would an agreement to reverse the protectionist policies of the past few years .
A mutual ceasefire in the trade war and a return to multilateral trade negotiations would directly boost economic activity by restoring confidence and spurring investment .
It would show that the international community is still capable of coming together in meaningful ways to fight a global crisis .
Taken together , joint action to tackle the pandemic , manage multiple economic shocks , and end the trade war would both limit the severity of the downturn and accelerate the pace of the subsequent recovery .
The US can and should assume a leading role in the fight against COVID-19 , given the risks to the US and global economy .
Until recently , restoring multilateral cooperation and rebuilding confidence in the institutions that Trump has torn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent and near-existential one .
