, Redbird 's COVID-19 check-in app is a way for every person to self-report symptoms without needing to visit a healthcare facility and thereby aiding in social distancing .
Mapping out COVID-19 heat maps  The solution will enable public health officials from Ghana to see a real-time map of where patients are self-reporting symptoms in order to follow-up directly with high-risk patients .
This provides them with a digital alternative to the overwhelmed hotlines for triage and follow-up .
Through this platform , Redbird provides hospitals with digital record keeping and the potential to keep unnecessary patients from coming to the hospital and putting themselves and others at risk .
" These remain trying times all over the world , but we 're also seeing an incredible validation of everything we 've built at Redbird and we 're not letting that slip .
With limited testing resources , understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk is of great importance .
We have been looking at how to support public health with the data and the COVID-19 Daily Check-in App and Symptom Tracker is one such way , " says Patrick Beattie , CEO and Co-Founder pf Redbird .
At present , the app works in the U .
and Ghana but Redbird plans to roll out the solution to Nigeria , Kenya , and South Africa .
