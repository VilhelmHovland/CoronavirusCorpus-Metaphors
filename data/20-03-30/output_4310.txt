Political Analysis South Africa  Department of Employment and Labour places the onus on employers to claim from COVID-19 relief fund  Department of Employment and Labour places the onus on employers to claim from COVID-19 relief fund  Published on  30 March , 2020  The Department of Employment and Labour has placed the onus on employers to claim from the newly created COVID-19 UIF relief scheme , for employees that they can not afford to pay their full salaries .
On Friday , 27 March 2020 , the Department of Employment and Labour announced the creation of the COVID-19 Temporary Employer/Employee Relief Scheme ( COVID-19 TERS ) .
The scheme was created following meetings between the Department of Employment and Labour , spearheaded by Minister Thulas Nxesi , and the Unemployment Insurance Fund ( UIF ) executives and Board .
The scheme aims to mitigate the deficit that employers might experience because of the 21-day national lockdown , which could result in them being unable to pay employee salaries .
The scheme calls for employers , and not employees , to claim for the scheme , citing the potential backlog as the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications will be considered .
The creation of the fund has not been without its hiccups .
Initially , some employers proposed the deduction of the 21 days from their employees ' annual leave days , which is unlawful and should be reported .
Moreover , applying for COVID-19 TERS implies that the company will be subjected to an audit , which has resulted in resistance from some employers .
Employees that might experience this are encouraged to reach out to the UIF call centre , or alternatively , visit the website .
