Located on Peter 's Street in Cork , the organisation stated that " While intimacy is as important now as ever , it is vital that people take extra precautions regarding any physical contact with others , including sex .
"  Dr .
Martin Davoren , the Executive Director of the Sexual Health Centre stated that " this campaign is a direct response to queries that our centre has received in relation to online hook-ups , condom provision , and what is now being called ' #covidsex ' .
We are conscious that for many people , this is a time of loneliness and disconnection , however we must all be particularly careful during the COVID-19 pandemic .
"  Most notably , people should avoid physical contact with people outside of their own household during this time .
