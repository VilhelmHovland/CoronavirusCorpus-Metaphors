In addition to the coronavirus pandemic that 's sweeping the globe , there is also what a World Health Organization official calls an " infodemic .
"  " We are facing an infodemic , which is an epidemic of false information , " said Dr .
Corinne Capuano , director of Pacific Technical Support and World Health Organization representative to the South Pacific .
To combat this , the WHO in Fiji hosted a video teleconference last Thursday for media partners across the Pacific in a bid to help decrease misinformation about COVID-19 and share helpful information with the region .
Saipan Tribune was one of the participants .
Rose Aynsley , risk communications lead for WHO division of Pacific technological support , pointed out that there is currently no drug -- or " pharmaceutical intervention " -- that 's going to slow this pandemic " so we really need to have the community on our side .
"  " We really need to implement practical containment measures at the community level , " she said .
How is the virus spread ?  According to Aynsley , the virus will spread if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person touches an infected surface ( tables , handles ) , or a sick person , and then touches their mouth or face , or kiss someone 's face , hands , etc .
" Good hygiene is really the best way to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 , " said Eynsley .
This includes regularly washing your hands for 40 to 60 seconds or using hand sanitizer , covering your sneeze or cough with a tissue or your elbow and washing your hands after , avoiding touching your face , nose , or mouth .
If necessary , wash your hands beforehand .
Keep a distance of at least one meter from other people and avoid hugging , kissing , shaking hands , and sharing items such as cups , utensils , etc .
Who needs to wear a mask and gloves ?  " We 're seeing everyone globally who are using masks inappropriately , " said Eynsley .
Often , people who are using masks are touching their face more because they 're readjusting the mask , they do n't fit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  WHO strongly advises that a healthy person do not need to wear a mask and gloves .
Those who need to wear a mask are persons with COVID-19 symptoms , individuals who are caring for persons who have COVID-19 , and health workers or persons screenings individuals who may have COVID-19 .
" Masks and gloves can provide a false sense of security , " said Eynsley .
Quarantine and isolation : What 's the difference ?  Isolation is the separation of person/s who have COVID-19 from others in order to stop the spread of the virus .
Quarantine is when you restrict the movement of healthy individuals who may have been exposed to the virus and to monitor them if they become sick .
Persons who are in quarantine must be kept separate and monitored for 14 days from the last time they were exposed to the person with COVID-19 .
The 14-day period is the incubation period of the novel coronavirus .
Individual actions for reducing spread  In practicing physical distancing , families should develop a household plan of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which includes grocery shopping , getting water , paying bills , getting medicine , etc .
Persons with medical conditions should talk to their health provider in advance .
According to Aynsley , it is recommended to not panic-buy and to shop for a two-week period , if a person is able to and shop again after those two weeks are over .
" Panic buying not only changes the price of products but it also means that when people try to get products , they are n't able to because someone stocked up for six months , " said Eynsley .
At work or home , reduce the risk of exposure by wiping down high-touch surfaces like door handles , keyboards , lights switches , phones , etc .
daily .
That includes getting information from accurate and reliable sources .
Prevent and address rumors and misinformation by researching , looking at credible sources such as the Commonwealth Health Care Corp .
, newspapers , news broadcast , etc .
Minimize exaggerations that undermines trust and creates fear and uncertainty .
Inaccurate and sensational information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among people .
Addressing stigma and discrimination  -- Drives people to hide the illness to avoid discrimination -- Prevents people from seeking health care -- Discourages them from adopting healthy behaviors  Words and images matter  -- Talk about " people who have COVID-19 , " not " COVID-19 victims/cases .
" -- Do n't repeat or share rumors .
-- Motivate people with preventative measures and solidarity , not dwell on threat .
-- If you or a person gets symptoms , call the Commonwealth Health Center before going there .
