COVID-19 -- the latest challenge to ' levelling up ' the UK economy  In uncharted territory .
When I flew out of Buenos Aires in late 1990 , having ended my stint working as part of a team supporting the economic reform programme of President Menem , I genuinely believed I would never again work in such a severe economic situation like the one Argentina had been in .
Prices in the shops often doubled at midnight , the US dollar was the effective currency and there was an eight-year waiting list for a telephone .
The current situation is different , but the scale is similarly daunting to that Argentina faced 40 years ago .
COVID-19 has changed everything -- the economic rule book has been ripped up and we are in uncharted territory .
The signs of economic stress are obvious .
EY 's latest profit warnings report shows that , at the close of markets last night , COVID-19 had triggered 130 profit warnings in 2020 .
In the last five days , there have been 76 COVID-19 related warnings -- far more than a typical quarterly run rate in normal times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
As Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman suggested , it is more akin to a combination of a recession and a natural disaster .
This means that the impact across the economy is different to that of a typical recession .
As the profit warnings demonstrate , the FTSE travel and leisure sector is in the eye of the storm , with segments of the retail and media sector next in line .
As the crisis continues , we can expect other sectors will experience greater stress .
In common with its peers , the UK Government has launched a massive economic support programme to shore up businesses and protect jobs .
Sector specific initiatives have been launched in transport and we can expect others to follow .
However , sector is not the only axis that we need to worry about .
As EY 's recent regional economic forecast for England 's regions , cities and towns showed , sector performance is a key determinant of local economic performance .
It is important that we do n't forget ' levelling up ' in our response to the COVID-19 emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from quoted companies headquartered in the regions .
These businesses have issued an extraordinary number of profit warnings already in Q1 2020 , almost double the same quarter of last year .
The most striking increases are in the South East and North West , where the number of profit warnings have more than doubled year-on-year in the first quarter due to an exceptionally high proportion of coronavirus-related downgrades .
In the Midlands and East Anglia , the spike in warnings pre-dates COVID-19 , which accounts for just a half of Q1 20 warnings so far -- the lowest of any region .
We 've seen a significant increase in warnings from this region in the last week -- concerning given the vulnerability the previous spike in warnings highlights .
This is something that is likely to come into sharper focus as corporate distress spreads out from consumer sectors into the wider economy .
highlighting longer-term concerns .
The stress created nationally by COVID-19 is amplified by the fact that the UK 's towns and smaller places do n't start with a level playing field .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government 's levelling-up agenda .
Even more significantly , many local economies are dominated by the sectors showing the early signs of stress .
We know that outside of the major cities , retail , hospitality , the public sector and manufacturing account for a greater share of employment and activity than the national average .
These places do n't have the level of professional , business and financial services that we find in larger cities and towns , and therefore are more exposed to the impact of COVID-19 .
Analysis by the Centre For Towns of the number of businesses in each place in the most vulnerable sectors clearly highlights the risks .
In Bridlington , 13% of business are in the retail sector , nearly 12% are pubs and restaurants and almost 3% support the arts and leisure .
In Ambleside in the Lake District , the comparable figures are 22% , 12% and 4% -- in total , two-fifths of all businesses in sectors facing high stress .
When we consider hotels and other holiday accommodation , the picture is even clearer .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see a similar picture across seaside places .
26% of all businesses in Newquay , 24% in Skegness and 23% in Minehead provide accommodation services .
There is a real risk of irreparable damage to vulnerable local economies .
The South West is the region most exposed to the vulnerable sectors , followed by the North East , Wales and Yorkshire and the Humber , and small towns are the places under most pressure .
However , up and down the country and especially in those regions , it is coastal towns that are facing real stress .
Whitley Bay , Cleethorpes , Skegness and Clacton have at least 50% more businesses in exposed sectors than the average for their regions , Deal , Whitstable and Ramsgate are examples of similar challenges in Kent , and Falmouth , Penzance and Newquay are the tip of the iceberg in the South West .
for the Government and business  For the Government , the message is clear .
Once the initial stabilisation programme is in place , it will be important to turn to the geographic impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect and then restore local economies .
When economic activity is concentrated in a small number of vulnerable sectors , the risk of a downward collapse is all too real .
There is an urgent requirement for an initiative to protect and then rebuild our coastal towns .
National , generic support programmes will not be sufficient given the levels of concentrated stress identified by the Centre For Towns .
A strategic effort is needed .
Businesses also need to build geography into their thinking .
Firstly , a geographic analysis should be undertaken to ensure all potential vulnerabilities have been factored in .
Once the business has been protected as best as possible against the initial shock , planning will have to recognise the impact that geographic differences mean for plans to restore the business .
For example , if the slowdown extends through the summer holiday period , then the recovery and level of effort required to get operations up and running in the tourist areas of the country is likely to be more significant .
This is not just an issue for businesses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places may be so shocked that it will take longer to get normal services up and running effectively .
