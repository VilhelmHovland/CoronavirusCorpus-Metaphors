( WLFI ) - Clinton County 's new COVID-19 call center is helping answer general questions about COVID-19 and what to do if you have symptoms .
It was created through a partnership between the county 's health Department and the Healthy Communities of Clinton County Coalition .
" The most important thing we have for people is information , " said Clinton County Health Officer Stephen Tharp .
According to Tharp , the call center will be able to provide more information to residents .
" We have people who are answering questions at the Health Department , but we need a better organization so that we can talk to more people and get them to know what 's going to happen , " said Tharp .
The call center will also give updates on the county 's status , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing clinic that we may in the near future set up , if there is a different declaration from our community leaders , then we can get that out very quickly , " said Clinton County Health Department Administrator Rodney Wann .
Wann said the center is being staffed by local nursing and county volunteers .
" I think the fact that they can call in and get a hold of somebody here locally that is giving them the local information is going to be a confidence builder for those are worried right now , " said Wann .
Wann said the call center has six lines operating and will expand if needed .
" If the emergency gets worse , then we have that ability to expand seven days a week if we need to , " said Wann .
