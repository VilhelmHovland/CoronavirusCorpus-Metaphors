Proposal to waive late fees , interest on McHenry County property tax bills  McHenry County Board Chairman Jack Franks speaks Jan .
30 during a League of Women Voters forum discussing the dilemma of an elected coroner 's office at McHenry County College in Crystal Lake .
McHenry County Board Chairman Jack Franks will move to waive all late fees and interest on the first installment of this year 's property taxes for 90 days because of the economic impacts of COVID-19 , according to a news release from the county .
The proposed ordinance will provide relief to local businesses and homeowners , Franks said .
" The coronavirus pandemic is causing unprecedented damage to the national economy , the spreadsheets of our businesses , and the checkbooks of our residents , " Franks said in the release .
Franks , D-Marengo , will call a special meeting of the County Board , which members will join remotely , to approve the ordinance before tax bills are sent out , according to the release .
" The statewide stay-at-home order , while necessary to halt the spread of this contagion , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
" It is imperative that we aggressively seek whatever relief we can find for our taxpayers .
"  Deadlines to file federal and state income taxes were recently pushed back to July , which Franks said helped him come to the decision to make this proposal .
A statute within Illinois ' property tax code gives county government the authority to waive late fees and interest payments if a disaster proclamation is made at either the state or federal level , according to the Illinois General Assembly 's website .
" I 'm using the disaster area proclamation of the President as my basis for doing this , " Franks said .
" So I 'm on strong legal ground here and I do not need legislative approval to do this .
"  County Board Member Michael Skala said he has been working to understand the effects that a proposal like this one could have on the county 's taxing bodies , such as local school districts and municipalities .
" I was trying to work with the taxing bodies to understand better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think that most of them are able to deal with it just because so much of property taxes are in escrow .
"  About 67% of county residents use an escrow account to pay property taxes monthly along with their mortgage payment , McHenry County Treasurer Glenda Miller said .
Franks said this statistic makes him feel confident that the decrease in funds available to be distributed in June would not be significant enough to pose any problems for the county 's schools , libraries or municipalities .
" I 'm also going to encourage people who have the ability and the means to pay their first installment on time , " he said .
" Right now , a lot of people are n't getting paychecks so it 's a matter of shared sacrifice .
"  Skala said he is supportive of the general idea , but wants to be sure that the board considers all of the factors involved .
" We need to be cognizant of the fact that there are laws also being passed here in the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially more than what they were planning on for staff depending on what they decide to do with their school year , " Skala said .
If Illinois schools still are operating past their original end date for the school year , school districts must pay staff an additional stipend to compensate them for that time , he said .
With COVID-19 shutdowns derailing curriculum plans , this kind of additional compensation for staff may become necessary , Skala said .
" For some school districts that have large reserves , that wo n't be an issue but some of the school districts that are a lot more lean potentially could have some cash flow issues , " he said .
Superintendent for McHenry High School District 156 , Lea Damisch , said she does not anticipate that the proposed ordinance will cause problems for her district .
" Our district would be able to absorb a percentage of property tax owners not making their first installment on time as long as we get the payment at some point within the calendar year , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of four schools in Marengo and Union .
McHenry County 's school districts together use about 70% of the funds generated by property taxes , Miller said .
" I am empathetic to families that are affected financially by COVID-19 and if making their installment a little late eases their burden , we can work through it , " Damisch wrote .
County Board Member Chuck Wheeler said he supports the proposal .
" The school districts are an important part of our community , " Wheeler said .
" But the taxpayers right now are the ones that are funding everything and I think that they need to have the ultimate flexibility .
"  The county generates around $1 million in late fees and interest payments on property tax bills each year , Miller said .
This money goes into the county 's general fund and is not used to fund school districts or municipalities .
If the ordinance is passed , the first installment of this year 's property taxes can be paid anytime up to 90 days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in early September , Franks said .
" If we have to extend the second one out , we can discuss that as well , " he said .
