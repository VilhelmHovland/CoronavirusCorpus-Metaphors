Nasrul Ismail writes that the poor health of prisoners , together with the poor living conditions found in prisons , put this population at an increased risk of COVID-19 .
He argues that suspending short sentences and providing for the early release of certain prisoners will allow the government to manage the potential magnitude of the issue .
The turn of the new decade saw global society enter what has been described as the " worst public health crisis for a generation " .
The novel coronavirus pandemic has pushed governments into rapidly developing unprecedented measures in order to contain the spread of the virus .
These responses all have something in common : prioritising the protection of vulnerable individuals with underlying health conditions .
Yet although meeting the ' vulnerable ' criterion , the prison population appears to have been side-lined from mainstream discussions .
Prisons as coronavirus incubators  Prisons , by their very nature , are isolated and contained .
However , once they enter these institutions , infectious diseases spread rapidly .
To date , at least nine prisons across England and Wales have registered confirmed cases of COVID-19 , although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that six in ten detainees could become infected , with a death rate of 1% across the prison population being forecast .
Prisons are particularly susceptible to this coronavirus due to the poor health of their inhabitants .
They are a prime target because of prisoners ' risky behaviours ( e .
smoking and drug-taking ) , being immunocompromised , and the presence of bloodborne viruses and tuberculosis .
Environmental factors further intensify these problems .
Even prior to COVID-19 , overcrowded prisons had been detrimental to prisoners ' health .
The latest statistics show that approximately 98% of adult prison places were in use and with prisoners living in close proximity to one another , the risk of transmitting pathogens is very high .
Whilst suspected coronavirus cases were isolated , some individuals can spread infection even prior to developing symptoms .
As such , outbreaks can spread easily -- and rapidly -- in overcrowded prisons .
The capability of prisons to fight coronavirus is affected by minimum standards of cleanliness and infection control compliance not being met .
Furthermore , there are no plans to stop prisoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can governments ensure safe and secure prison environments during this pandemic without violating the rights of those in their care ? To date , the policy response has resulted in restrictions of movement within and to prison establishments , prisoners ' activities being restricted to only shower , phones and exercise , and no social visits from friends and family members .
Whilst these measures might be considered practical , prison riots in San Vittore prison in Milan , Unidad Penitenciaria in Argentina and La Modelo prison in Colombia indicate that they are unsustainable .
The blanket restriction of movements and visits , as well as poor prison conditions , can also trigger fear and anxiety amongst prisoners .
A more viable and sustainable way to limit the spread of coronavirus in prisons is to reduce the current prison population .
This requires the implementation of two proactive strategies : suspending short sentences and ordering the early release for older and female prisoners .
With regards to suspending short sentences , a key underlying fact is that England and Wales have the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push towards longer sentences , in addition to the use of community sentences , has also contributed towards the high rate of imprisonment .
Despite a shrinking budget ( 22% overall since 2010 ) , prisons have been stretched to breaking point , and we are now reaping the consequences .
Secondly , the early release of older and female prisoners could also help lessen overcrowding , which is a key risk factor of coronavirus .
The global rise in ageing prison populations , longer sentencing , and delayed parole reflect the ageing populations in developed countries .
Another growing minority group is female prisoners , eight in ten of whom commit non-violent offences ( e .
theft ) and therefore generally attract short custodial sentences .
Many of these older and female prisoners do not pose security or public protection threats ; releasing them early could improve prison population management .
New York and Los Angeles have already freed vulnerable prisoners amid the coronavirus outbreak .
Similarly , Spain and Iran have followed suit so as to reduce virus transmission amongst prisoners and staff .
The recent ministerial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to bail hostels , whilst modest , could see more than 9,000 prisoners being freed on the grounds of exceptional circumstances .
Reducing the prison population also demonstrates compliance with international policy and legal obligations .
The Mandela Rules impose a duty of care on the state to protect prisoners ' health , since when an individual is deprived of their liberty , there is no other alternative but to rely on the authorities to protect their health .
Furthermore , this avoids triggering legal actions from prisoners .
Legal cases such as Yarashonen v Turkey and Alimov v Turkey demonstrate that a state is in breach of Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights ( prohibition of torture , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment ) when it fails to contain frequent outbreaks of contagious diseases , chronic overcrowding , unacceptable cleanliness levels , poor medical interventions and the psychological fear of contracting diseases .
Reducing this population not only improves the capacity of prisons to deal with coronavirus outbreaks , it is also necessary , proportionate , and deferential towards individual dignity .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health crisis for a generation ' and that vulnerable populations with underlying health conditions need utmost protection , the current crisis forces us to reflect on how we manage the prison population in England and Wales .
Coronavirus is largely preventable ; suspending short sentences and providing for the early release of older and female prisoners will provide the government with increased capacity to deal with the magnitude of the issue .
