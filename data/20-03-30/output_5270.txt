One of Australia 's largest media outlets , News Corp , has said it is doing everything it can to preserve jobs within the organisation as consumer confidence and ad spend dries up due to uncertainty around the COVID-19 ( coronavirus ) crisis .
In order to protect jobs and reduce its cost base , News Corp said the executive team " will need to take a significant pay cut " , while other staff members will be presented with options including part-time work , nine-day fortnights , and taking additional leave .
The organisation did concede that some job losses will be inevitable .
The company will also be directing staff to take leave over the Easter period .
Michael Miller , the company 's executive chairman , told staff in a note seen by Mumbrella that despite consumers increasingly turning to news organisations throughout this crisis " falling business confidence is impacting the advertising revenues of all media businesses " .

News Corp boss Miller says he wants to protect jobs  " I want to assure you that my priority is to preserve as many jobs across the company as possible .
But it is now clear that some job losses will be inevitable , " he said .
" Together we need to move quickly to do everything we can to secure the health of our business and retain jobs .
"  Further cost-saving measures include halting projects , all travel and entertainment ceasing , and events being called off .
News Corp has also reduced the page count across its mastheads and reallocated copy sales and distribution .
It 's anticipated that the new working arrangements , to be discussed with staff in coming days , will continue until the end of May .

On our teams call 99% of staff yesterday wished nothing more than being back at the office as soon as possible .
Having to do everything remotely has slowed us down to the point where most are working 12-14 hour days to keep everything moving forward .
Work life balance certainly is out the window at the moment .
But better that then doing nothing and facing an uncertain future .
Hopefully it means we 'll be better at interstate and international collaboration moving forward though , but at least at my agency most are bloody keen to get back into the office .
I work in a media agency , although focusing on technology not buying media so I can manage my workload from home quite well .
I 'll definitely be looking to work from home more consistently following this .

You would think that with every set of eyes in Australia on the media for news , now would be the greatest time ever for brands to be booking space and building on their branding .
Even if they are shut down , they will reopen , and at no other time will they ever have such a captive audience again .
