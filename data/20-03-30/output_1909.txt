In an attempt to emulate the South Korean model of doing mass testing of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) using rapid technology , the Karnataka government wants to buy one lakh such antibody-based kits .
The kits will be sourced from a Singaporean manufacturer and will cost less than Rs 800 per test compared to the present Rs 2,500 per test .
The kit will take a blood sample from a patient 's finger with a pin prick .
Speaking with TNM , Dr CN Manjunath , the Director of Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research and the nodal officer of testing for COVID-19 in the state , said , " We are going to acquire it from a National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) Pune validated company -- Sensing Self Private Limited .
These kits will give results in 15 minutes .
I have been told these kits have been tested elsewhere in Europe , South Korea amongst other places .
"  Sensing Self is among the 12 private rapid testing solutions approved by NIV to screen people .
" If these test kits say that a patient is COVID-19 negative then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive result , we will confirm it via our legacy testing , " explained Dr Manjunath .
He further noted that it was this system that had worked in South Korea and helped them to understand the burden of the disease .
" Otherwise in our present method of testing , we will not know many cases and there will be many hidden cases , " he added .
Worldwide , the South Korean model has been hailed as they have been successful in tackling the virus without disrupting much of normal life .
On an average they did around 18,000 such tests per day and managed to reach a measure of positive cases to less than 100 in a matter of two weeks from a peak of 909 at the end of February .
As of date , Karnataka has done a total of 3,170 tests .
However , the state government has yet to implement a rapid testing protocol .
The tests in place currently are based on polymerase chain reaction ( PCR tests ) and give results in 24 hours .
Rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , but they do not give definitive diagnoses and are used to identify if someone has been exposed to the virus .
So far the testing is done in five government and three private laboratories in the state for coronavirus disease -- - Bangalore Medical College , NIV 's Field Unit in Bengaluru , Mysore Medical College , Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences and Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences .
The three private labs are Neuberg Anand Reference Laboratory , Cancyte Technologies lab in Bengaluru and Kasturba Hospital Lab in Manipal .
Further testing can also be done at the Air Force Command Hospital in Bengaluru .
The state government is also in talks with the Indian Institute of Science , Bengaluru and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences ( NIMHANS ) among others .
