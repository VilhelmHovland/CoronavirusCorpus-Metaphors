A video that has been circulating heavily on social media over the weekend claiming that a Dublin pub was " full of punters " and " raided by Gardai " during the lockdown period is fake .
The short clip , which has been appearing all over social media platforms in the last 24 hours , shows a number of Gardai on patrol with a few officers appearing to enter the premises before coming back out .
Audio and a caption equipped with the footage says ' the pub is after being raided , it 's full of punters ' .
The owner of the establishment said that the video was in fact fake and was saddened that the false rumours and clip had circulated considering they " knew the person who took it " .
They told Dublin Live : " Gardai were carrying out inspections in the area .
They came into the pub , which was open because we operate an off-licence nearby also , checked it out to make sure nobody else was inside and left .

Gardai did not have any record of the allegation but added that they will carry out inspections if a place is observed open .
A spokesman said : " An Garda S ? och ? na has carried out and continues to visit licensed premises , if observed open , to remind businesses of their social responsibility to implementing the guidelines issued by the Government and HSE in order to minimise the impact of COVID-19 on our community as a whole .
" Gardai currently has no legislative basis on which to enforce business closures in breach of the Government guidance above .
