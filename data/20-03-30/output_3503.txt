SA 's toiletpaper and tissue manufacturers ramp up production  Warning :  That 's the word from the Paper Manufacturers Association of South Africa ( PAMSA ) .
This after the outbreak of COVID-19 caused a global phenomenon in recent weeks : the stockpiling and " panic buying " of items such as toilet paper .
On Monday , PAMSA assured consumers that the paper and tissue value chains would continue operating as a " critical business continuity service " during the 21-day lockdown period in South Africa .
The lockdown means all non-essential services have been paused in a bid to combat the spread of the Coronavirus in the country .
However , the sector providing wood and recycled paper fibre for the production of essential goods such as tissue , toilet paper , paper packaging , hospital gowns , masks , and personal hygiene products continues with its work .
