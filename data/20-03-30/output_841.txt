Pandemic Delays Return Of Arctic Researchers  The German icebreaker Polarstern is moored to a piece of ice , drifting for a year , as scientists study the warming Arctic .
( Ravenna Koenig/Ravenna Koenig )  A massive , year-long science expedition currently underway on an icebreaker in the Arctic Ocean is having to significantly alter its plans due to the Coronavirus pandemic .
Scientists who have been on the ship since late February -- in their own form of isolation at the top of the world -- were supposed to be picked up by aircraft in early April , with different personnel rotating in .
But with travel and other virus-related restrictions , they may now have to remain in the ice until June , essentially doubling their shift .
Five such rotations were planned for the expedition over the course of the year .
" The flights were planned to go through Longyearbyen , on Svalbard , and right now all non-residents have been asked to leave Svalbard , " says expedition coordinator Matthew Shupe , an atmospheric scientist with the University of Colorado and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice to come home on the exchange that was already scheduled for June , though other options are being considered to get them back sooner .
" The people who are out there on site right now , they 're nervous , " he says .
" They 'd like to get home to their families , and so we 're trying to devise plans that will enable that .
"  The expedition -- known as the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate , or MOSAiC -- is an international effort spearheaded by the Alfred Wegener Institute to study Arctic climate change .
Shupe says the ship has enough food and fuel to last until the next planned transfer , and organizers do not believe anyone on board is infected with the coronavirus .
To insure the virus does not spread to the ship , the next rotation of incoming MOSAiC participants will be quarantined for 14 days , and subject to multiple tests before they begin their journey out to the icebreaker .
