Of contagions and conspiracy theories  Share  Of contagions and conspiracy theories  Monday , 30 March 2020 Nadeem paracha  In societies hardwired to understand life through the lens of faith alone , it is a challenge for the Government to impose certain restrictions during outbreaks like the one the world is facing right now  A worried colleague at my office asked another if it was okay for a Muslim to use hand sanitisers that contained alcohol .
The second colleague took a step back from the inquirer and sardonically replied : " Were the Saudis using juice to disinfect the holy sites ? " Later in the day , I saw the worried colleague washing his hands with an alcohol-based sanitiser .
Personally , I did not feel any annoyance towards him .
There are many like him whose minds have been bombarded with numerous , often contradictory , ideas about faith and morality .
According to Andrew Newberg , the Director of Research at Philadelphia 's Thomas Jefferson University , overtly religious people " have more tissue in the frontal lobes , or regions of the brain associated with attention and reward .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to doctrinal reasons but also due to a physiological variance .
In societies that have been hardwired to understand life through the lens of faith alone , it is a challenge for the Government to impose certain restrictions during pandemics .
For example , how to tell people not to gather at mosques , temples or churches ? A scientific explanation alone does not cut it .
That 's why one often sees Governments utilise clerics and priests in such societies to wrap the scientific rationale in theological justifications .
The March 14 issue of The Guardian reports that a cleric of a major mosque in conservative Kuwait changed certain words of the azaan ( call to prayer ) .
Instead of inviting people to come pray at the mosque , he asked them to pray at home due to the Coronavirus scare .
Thousands of miles away , in the otherwise constitutionally secular US , newspaper reports suggest that instructions to the people by the authorities to avoid attending church services in the so-called " Bible belt states " , have increased anxiety levels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grip of Hindutva nationalism , a Hindu organisation invited fellow Hindus to a " party " where cow urine was served to the guests as a serum against Covid-19 .
Psychologists believe that a crisis that may restrict people from engaging with their faith in a normal manner can also cause anxiety within the caretakers of faith -- they may become more brazenly exhibitionistic to remain relevant or to " save faith " from eroding .
On March 16 , a video clip of a Muslim cleric in Pakistan went viral in which he was inviting people to a large rally and claiming that " God will never allow anyone at the rally to be infected by the virus .
"  To secularists and even moderate believers , such acts may seem bizarre .
Yet , these acts are not emitting from the lunatic fringes of society as such .
They are taking place within mainstream segments that have been hardwired to understand reality from a religious point of view -- or rather , from their particular religious point of view .
At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hindu societies who do not see any dichotomy between faith and science .
In fact , they maintain that their respective faiths are flexible enough to better harness science .
Then there are the usual conspiracy theorists .
Once relegated to the confines of the so-called lunatic fringe , the mushrooming of social media outlets , in the last 20 years or so , has lobbed their ideas and claims into mainstream discourses .
One of the stickiest conspiracy theories about the outbreak of Covid-19 doing the rounds is that the virus is in fact man-made and/or it is a " biological weapon " gone astray or -- worse -- it has been deliberately deployed by China or the US or even that it has been spread to enrich pharmaceutical companies .
There is not an iota of evidence to substantiate these claims .
But conspiracy theorists do not deal in evidence , only in connecting disparate dots which may make sense in minds plagued by fear and uncertainty .
Viruses have been around for millions of years .
Humans have continued to develop antibodies to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which introduce new antibodies in the system to ward off what virologists call " Novel viruses .
" The dreaded Covid-19 is one such virus .
It 's a " flu virus " but it is n't the first , nor will it be the last .
There have been at least six flu or influenza pandemics in the past .
There may have been more but scientists so far have been able to trace just six in the last century and a half .
Virologists trace the viruses of each of these pandemics to infected birds who transferred the virus to a mammalian animal before it entered the human body .
Bird viruses are largely unable to stick to human cells and when they do , are often slain by human antibodies .
However , sometimes , through the evolutionary mutation process , a flu virus from a bird manages to stick to a cell of a mammal .
There , it further mutates and is then able to stick more easily to human cells .
Further mutations help it fight off human antibodies rendering them obsolete , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The natural development of new antibodies , or antibodies triggered through a vaccine , are the only means to neutralise it .
The Covid-19 outbreak has been traced back to an animal and seafood market in Wuhan , China .
An infected bat infected a pangolin from which a human handler caught the mutating virus .
Many outside China have demanded that the Chinese stop eating " strange animals .
"  But do they really ? Yes , some do .
Why ? According to Frederick J .
Simoons in Food in China : A Cultural and Historical Inquiry , China has a history of eating rats , snakes and dogs during famine .
The practice receded in the early 20th century but returned when Mao Zedong 's radical economic policies in the late 1950s triggered widespread famines .
But even after the famines receded in the late 1970s , the practice of getting meat from unusual sources continued in some quarters .
Nevertheless , shops dealing in " unusual meat " , are now likely to be closed down for good .
