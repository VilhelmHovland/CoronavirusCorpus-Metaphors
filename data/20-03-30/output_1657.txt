Trivium China , a policy research consultancy , has estimated a 20% contraction in the first quarter compared to the same period in 2019 .
Looking ahead to the rest of the year , the numerous scenarios resemble scenes from a disaster movie :  Continued business resumption in the second quarter leads to real GDP growth of 2 .

The profit of a mask now is at least several cents compared to less than one in the past , " Shi Xinghui , a sales manager of an N95 mask machine company , said .
" Printing 60,000 or 70,000 masks a day is the equivalent to printing money , " Shi , whose firm is based in Dongguan , a city in Guangdong province @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the country 's manufacturers and their multinational rivals are suffering from various degrees of financial phenomena as global consumer spending dries up to a trickle .
