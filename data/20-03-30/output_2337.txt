Fed Lifeline Saves Bond Funds Teetering on Brink of ETF Hell  ( Bloomberg ) -- The Federal Reserve 's unprecedented step into U .
corporate bonds helped cure many of the massive dislocations in exchange-traded funds -- and may have saved mutual funds from a similar fate .
After prices for the biggest fixed-income funds held in a kind of dazed stillness during the worst of the sell-off -- presumably because the bonds they owned simply were n't trading -- net-asset values on some of them dropped precipitously early last week as their outflows forced sales on a frozen market .
The $215 billion Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund and the $51 billion Fidelity U .
Bond Index each saw the value of their holdings drop as much as 4 .
in the the week through March 20 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Meanwhile , the $137 billion PIMCO Income Fund posted a net-asset value plunge of roughly 6 .
in the span -- after largely holding steady over the past five years and outperforming 97% of its peers over the same period .
The steep declines were beginning to mirror prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep discounts to their underlying securities .
Faced with $149 billion of redemptions so far in March -- after not seeing a monthly outflow since January 2019 -- mutual funds were forced to sell their holdings into a market caught in a cash crunch .
However , the Fed 's pledge Monday to buy investment-grade credit and certain ETFs helped halt the slide in mutual fund net-asset values and sparked a rally in higher-rated debt .
That 's largely due to the fact that fund managers now have a willing buyer on the other side of the trade , according to Bloomberg Intelligence .
" Mutual funds dodged a big bullet by not having to unload bonds into a market with no buyers , " said Eric Balchunas , senior ETF analyst .
" The Fed has now brought liquidity , and so they will get to avoid the ' hell ' we saw ETFs in for the past month .
"  The U .
central bank said last Monday that it would create a Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility , one of several new measures aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facility allow for the purchase of up to 10% of an issuer 's outstanding bonds and up to 20% of the assets of any ETF " whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for U .
investment-grade corporate bonds , " a primer accompanying the Fed action said .
That Fed 's move quickly stemmed the bleeding in high-grade bond markets , where investors were shedding even their highest-quality holdings in an effort to raise cash .
The carnage quickly appeared in ETFs , which trade on exchanges and behave like stocks , as the funds sold off much more quickly than the underlying bonds .
The pain had just started to spread to mutual funds , which were initially able to satisfy redemptions by burning through cash and their more liquid securities , according to Kingsview Wealth Management 's Paul Nolte .
The net-asset values began to drop as the fund managers were forced to try and liquidate harder-to-unload holdings into a market with few buyers -- but the Fed announcement broke the cycle , he said .
" They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a little bit more of a normal bidding process in the market , " said Nolte , a portfolio manager at Kingsview Wealth Management .
" We 're probably a week away from a normally functioning market .
It 's going to take some of these funds a while to work their way back to where they used to be .
"  The impact was immediate for many fixed-income ETFs .
After trading at a discount as deep as 5% to its net-asset value in the week through March 20 , the $36 .
billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF , ticker LQD , closed at a premium of 3 .
to its underlying holdings last Thursday , while just six bond ETFs ended with a discount of 5% or more .
That compares to 37 funds on March 20 , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Meanwhile , 214 fixed-income ETFs closed at a premium .
Easing corporate-default fears have stoked an investment-grade rally after the coronavirus outbreak reignited solvency concerns .
While the Fed 's pledge of support is a positive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank 's backstop , according to Charles Schwab Corp .
' s Kathy Jones .
" There 's going to be more credit risk than there was a year ago , " said Jones , chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab .
" There 's going to be some problems from a fundamental point of view , but I think you could wade back into the IG market and say , ' I feel confident with the higher rated companies .
