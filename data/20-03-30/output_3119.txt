The New Rhythm of Life in the US  It was early morning on a working day in mid-Marchas my wife and I came out of our house to pick up some groceries at a nearby shop .
We saw the main street close to useerily quiet and deserted , which normallybustleswith morning commuters , buses taking children to school and businessmen rushing to catch theMetro to their offices .
Instead , the weird scene was reminiscent of a Christmas or Thanksgiving holiday when people usually stay indoor to celebrate with family .
There are other signs of a country under siege .
We live in suburban Maryland , a short distancer from the nation 's capital .
Washington 's world-renowned cherry blossom season , heralding the arrival of spring , just passed its peak .
Normally , the festival would drawhordes of visitors , national and international , but visitors are few and the mayor is trying to ban them altogether .
The celebrated Smithsonian museums of Washington , cherished destinations for most tourists , are locked down , as well as the world-famous Kennedy Center of Performing Arts .
Sections of the city look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , theGovernor has shutdown schools , colleges , restaurants , libraries , bars and all places of worship and entertainment .
grocery shopping is an expedition aspanicky shopperstry tocartaway whatever they can find , tinned food , paper towels , soaps , and even toilet paper .
The courage of the cashiers at the counters is admirable as they are dealing with a variety of customers at close range .
coronavirus is highly contagious and much more lethalthan seasonal flu .
A person showing no overt symptoms of the disease can still transmit it to others .
of this writing , more than 124,000cases of corvid-19have been establishedin the US , the number surpassing that of China and Italy , and there have been more than 2,000recorded deaths .
The spread of the coronavirus pandemic globally seems an unprecedented catastrophe , but the deadly battle between humans and pathogens has been ongoing ever since man evolved on this planet  The country suffers from a severe shortage of protective gear , face masks , gloves , surgical gowns , and ventilators .
Also , there is critical shortage of hospital beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Among the most vulnerable to infection are the health-care workers -- doctors , nurses , dental hygienist and medical techniciansand hospital cleaning staff , who work in close contact with patients .
feeling of appreciationand gratitude to medical personnel for risking their lives has spread worldwide .
The people under lockdown , Turkey , Britain , Italy and many other countries , have been coming out in the evenings on their balconiessinging and lighting candlesto express theiradmiration .
The pandemic has taken a severe economic toll .
A number of states have made it mandatory for people to stay indoors , except in an emergency .
Millions of workers employed by shops , restaurants , hotels and bars , are without employment , as areairlines personnel , stewards , pilots and support staff .
Many automotive plants , General Motors , Ford and Fiat Chrysler , have laid off workers for lack of demand for their products .
Last week , an unprecedented , 3 .
million Americans applied for unemployment benefits .
Paradoxically , only a month and half ago , the country was enjoying 3 .
percent unemployment rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have put an extra burden on parents who must stay hometo take care of children or hire someone to do so .
The US Congress has passed a 2 .
trillion-dollarpackage to help the economy and individual workers affected by the emergency shutdown .
There is no certainty that this amount will be enough to achieve this objective and there is already talk of a second stimulation package .
The Trump administration has come under withering attack for its lack of timely preparations to face this crisis .
The Washington Post recently reported that the US intelligence agencies had warned the Governmentas early as last January and February about the disastrous pandemic in China could potentiallyimpact this country .
President Trump minimizedthe peril , describing it as a hoax by the opposition Democrats .
This failure of the Governmenthas had a devastating effect on the country 's preparedness .
The impact of the deadly virus is especially devastating in developing countries , because of poor medical facilities .
India has officially reported 700 positive cases , but the figures are probably too low as there is no large-scale testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is estimated to have only 0 .
hospital beds per 1,000 people , compared to 3 .
in Italy and 12 in South Korea .
Pakistan has an even weaker health care system .
It has registered more than 1,500 cases in the past few days , and it is not clear how rigorously their contacts are followed and isolated .
More worryingis the relentless chokehold the Mullahs exercise on the Government and would not allow even a temporary suspension of congregational prayers , the hotbed of infection .
What are the measures taken to combat the virus ? In the US and other countries , a frantic effort is underway to develop a vaccine ; but , even though the genetic architecture of the virus has been elucidated , it will take at least a year to test a vaccine 's efficacy and safety .
Another approach is to extract antibodies from the blood of those patients whohaverecovered from Covid-19 disease and give them to patients in the hope that they will help fight the virus as presumably they did in the recovered patients .
Meanwhile , anold antimalarial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for itseffectiveness against the coronavirus .
Other studies have raised hopes that the virus may be sensitive to seasonal changes of weather , heat and humidity and its hold may slacken during the coming summer months in northern hemisphere .
The spread of the coronavirus pandemic globally seems an unprecedented catastrophe , but the deadly battle between humans and pathogens has been ongoing ever since man evolved on this planet .
the Middle Ages , the bubonic plague , also referred to as the black death , raged from 1347 to 1351 , costing the lives of an estimated 75 to 200 million people in Europe and Asia .
There was no cure and no understanding of microbes .
Only later , it was established that the plaguewas caused by a bacterium Yersinia pestistransmitted by flees .
century ago , the world was traumatized by a viciousinfluenza pandemic thatwent around the world in 1918 and took some 50 million lives .
No one knew about viruses at the time or what had causedthepandemic .
One day , hopefully soon , we will find a cure for the newCovid-19 and learn how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerassistant professor , Harvard Medical School , and a retired health scientist administrator , US National Institutes of Health .
