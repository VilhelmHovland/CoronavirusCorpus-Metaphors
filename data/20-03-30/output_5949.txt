Birds flock Peru beaches amid absence of humans  LIMA , MARCH 28 ( IANS ) : Seagulls , cormorants , pelicans , boobies and other birds have flocked to the beaches in Peru 's capital cit of Lima due to human absence in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown .
Confinement measures over the coronavirus pandemic has forced Peru 's entire population to isolate indoors since mid-March , reports Efe news .
With the people gone , thousands of Peru 's winged inhabitants have taken over the green coast of Lima , the fifth largest city in Latin America with about 10 million inhabitants and the only South American capital on the coast .
The birds on Lima 's beaches have gone viral on social media starring in videos recorded by locals .
The scenes have even surprised experts , unaccustomed to seeing so many wild birds just a few meters from built-up areas .
" Suddenly , tonnes of kilometres of beaches have been left uninhabited and the birds have recolonized them .
Some are being seen in places where they did not flock to before , " Fernando Angulo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news .
The best proof of this is the populous Agua Dulce beach , in the fishing district of Chorrillos , which throughout the summer sees a steady stream of sunbathers and families crowding the sand with umbrellas .
Food trucks throng the promenade and ice cream makers bellow for trade .
Now this beach has transformed into and quiet oasis and idyllic resting place for thousands of migratory birds such as Franklin 's gulls , which at the end of the summer season in the southern hemisphere are on their way back to North America .
Peruvian and Dominican gulls are rarely seen during the summer in the city , even though they reside all year round on the coast of Peru .
" They were on stretches of coast that the humans use little or not at all .
Towards the south of Lima , there are about 100 km of urbanized beaches .
Only about 20 km are free , and it is there where these birds gather during the summer .
That is why protected areas play a very important role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unexpected phenomenon " that has also been observed on other Peruvian city beaches is also due to the fact fishermen are not going to fish and that leaves more food for these birds .
Quarantine has also led to the cleanest air in Lima for years and pollution levels have reached the standards recommended by the World Health Organization .
Peru has so far recorded 635 confirmed coronavirus cases and 11 deaths .
