COVID-19 and the consequences of irresponsibility  I did not want to do this , but now I have to drawing motivation from the fact that inevitability stands to be a moral justification for anything and that we are about to face an inevitable catastrophe unless we take responsibility ! Let me say this , and please let it sink .
On 27th February , Nigeria got its index case , an imported case from Italy .
11 days later , on 9th March another person was infected through local transmission ! It was n't until on 18th March that Nigeria instituted major travel bans , while international airports were totally shutdown on 21st March , and we recorded 10 new cases that day .
Today we 've experienced a surge from a single local case to 97 cases in just 20 days , and from 8 to 97 in just 11 days ! We have 3 days and 6 days until we reach 2 weeks from the day major travel bans were instituted and the day our airports were totally closed respectively ! How many people do you think flew in from the pandemic-devastated countries ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many states have they or their contacts reached ? Have we been efficient in contact tracing ? Are our statistics even reliable ? How many diagnostic labs do we have , What are their capacities and how are their geographic spread ? What of isolation centers ? How many do we have , how equipped are they ?  Why all these questions ? Because , the disease has an asymptomatic incubation but contagious period of an average of 5 days ( 14 days max ) , and we are about to clock the end of this supposed period ( at least from relevant dates I .
dates travel restrictions and airport shutdowns were instituted ) .
Who knows how many asymptomatic carriers there are today in this country ? Who knows how many contacts they 've made ? Are you sure you have n't met one yet ? Because interstate movement were n't stopped ( until recently in some states ) ! Are you sure there 's a well equipped isolation center ( close to you ) that you could use when you test positive ? What of the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you even have one in your entire geopolitical region ? Ask yourself , " these chances I am taking , are they worthwhile ? "  Hmm , To be frank with you , you 're not safe , nobody is safe ! There are a lot of asymptomatic careers roaming around ! The only way for you to be is to #stayhome and monitor yourself ! Do n't be part of the domino effect , that we pray not for , but is imminent if we do n't take our responsibilities towards fighting this pandemic seriously ! Meanwhile , the federal government should also brace up for a worst case scenario ; a national impact sort of and should therefore focus on a strategic national and not semi-regional intervention .
I must confess I find the recent FG financial support sharing method to states , the unavailability of test kits across the country and the geographic distribution of diagnostic centers highly imprudent and should beget expedient review .
The state governments should also brace up , draw resources from wherever resources can be drawn from to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so much wrong to think the disease is elitist , it just seems to be so because so far , only the elites have reasonable access to the diagnostics ! You 're not safe until you take responsibility ! Yes you !
