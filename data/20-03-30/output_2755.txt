Coronavirus May Have Infected Half of UK Population , According to Experts  The coronavirus may have already infected half of the population in the UK , according to researchers at the University of Oxford .
The new model suggests the coronavirus was circulating in the UK by mid-January , approximately two weeks before the first reported case and a month before the first death .
The study into the infection rate was led by Sunetra Gupta , professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford .
If the results are confirmed it suggests fewer than one in a thousand of those infected with Covid-19 become ill enough to need hospital treatment , and the vast majority develop very mild symptoms or none at all .
The findings came after the official death toll jumped a record 87 in one day to 422 , and confirmed cases passed 8,000 .
Speaking to the Financial Times , who first reported on the study , Professor Gupta said testing was needed to assess what stage of the epidemic the UK is at now .
The Oxford researchers are working with colleagues at the Universities of Cambridge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as possible .
Oxford 's modelling presents a very different view to Imperial College London studies , which has strongly influenced the government 's approach to tackling the outbreak .
" I am surprised that there has been such unqualified acceptance of the Imperial model , " Gupta told the FT .
If the Oxford University model is accurate , the results would mean the country has already acquired " herd immunity " through the unrecognised spread of Covid-19 .
Herd immunity is the idea that coronavirus will stop spreading when enough of the population have become resistant after being infected .
The government abandoned its unofficial herd immunity strategy after its scientific advisers said it would overwhelm the NHS .
