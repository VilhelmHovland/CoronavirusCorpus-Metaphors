Battered Macau junkets need China visas back : trade rep  Macau urgently needs to see the resumption of mainland China exit visas for trips to the casino hub , for people in parts of the country presenting " relatively lower " risk of further spreading the novel coronavirus .
That is according to Kwok Chi Chung ( pictured in a file photo ) , president of the Macau Association of Gaming and Entertainment Promoters , in comments to GGRAsia in response to our enquiry .
He told us such a suggestion had been put by his group to Macau 's casino regulator , the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau during a meeting last week .
" Almost every day there are new changes , " relating to travel rules and other factors , and " just as with every other sector , the junket industry is facing a lot of difficulties , " Mr Kwok remarked to us .
In late January the mainland authorities reportedly stopped issuing any new exit visas under the individual visit scheme ( IVS ) as part of the country 's effort to limit the spread of the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal trading times for independent , relatively well-heeled Chinese travellers from the richer provinces and cities to visit Macau , according to industry analysts .
The number of places in China covered by the IVS system currently stands at 49 .
Last week Guangdong , the mainland province next door to Macau -- and which typically supplies a significant portion of the casino hub 's tourists -- announced a 14-day quarantine would be required for anyone -- including Guangdong residents -- that wished to enter the province from either Macau or Hong Kong .
Patron flow to the city 's VIP gaming rooms , had already been " very slow " in recent weeks -- even before Guangdong 's announcement -- while the junket firms ' operating costs had been mounting , Mr Kwok noted .
" The junket sector has already been trying its best to answer to the Macau government call not to impose lay-offs , " he said .
" But some smaller junket firms that are more financially challenged will likely close , " Mr Kwok remarked to us .
He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also do n't rule out the possibility that they will scale down the number of their operating rooms in the city .
"  Macau 's total number of licensed junkets fell from 100 in January 2019 to 95 at the start of this year , marking the seventh consecutive year of decline in the tally of such entities according to data from Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau .
In the course of the first two months of 2020 , the city 's Labour Affairs Bureau -- also known by its Portuguese-language acronym DSAL -- received one complaint involving three local employees , about alleged termination of employment by a junket firm , the bureau noted to GGRAsia in an email .
DSAL declined to name the junket employer or to say when the complaint was filed , but explained that it related to " advance notice " and " remuneration " topics in regard to the complainants ' labour-contract termination .
The bureau also noted to us that it was investigating if the complaint involved any violation of local labour law .
" The junket sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macau government call not to impose lay-offs .
But some smaller junket firms that are more financially challenged will likely close " Kwok Chi ChungPresident of the Macau Association of Gaming and Entertainment Promoters .
