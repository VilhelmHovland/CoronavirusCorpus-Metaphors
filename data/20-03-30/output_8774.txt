A PANDEMIC OF HOPE : Poetry by George Payne  As fast as the virus and then some , Love is spreading .
In the hands of doctors and nurses , it spreads .
Through the central nervous systemof the species like an electric shock , Love grows with invisible power .
Love is spreading .
Everywhere , in more places than the virus could ever be , Love is taking over .
We are on lockdown andLove is our warden .
A national guard is neededto keep it from getting too big .
A pandemic of hope .
Love is spreading .
For the sick and the healthy .
the lost and the saved .
For the living and the dead .
For any being that has ever contributed to the project of Life .
is Love and it is spreading .
Infecting the cell with truth .
