There were plenty of high profile high school basketball players on display at the Pitt Jam Fest in late April of 2013 , including a New York City junior named Isaiah Whitehead , one of the highest-ranked recruits in the country who would go on to star at Seton Hall .
But also in attendance was a relatively unknown senior point guard named Justin Robinson , who caught the eye of Monmouth University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NCAA 's spring evaluation period .
Robinson went on to become a two-time Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year , and is now starring professionally in France .
" As they say the rest is history , " said Rob Kennedy , president of the Neptune-based Hoop Group , which counts Pitt Jam Fest among its numerous showcase tournaments .
" Justin was an unsigned senior going into the spring and luckily Monmouth got a chance to see him at the Pitt Jam Fest and credit to King Rice , he saw something special in Justin that some other people did n't pick up on .

Currently , the NCAA is prohibiting in-person recruiting , evaluating and on-campus visits through April 15 , and the expectation is that the entire April live period will be called off in the coming days .
The next live recruiting period comes in July .
" This is not just about the Monmouths of the world .
It 's about the Georgian Courts and all the Garden State Athletic Conference teams and all the kids that are hoping to be able to get a good education and have the great experience of playing college basketball at all levels , " Kennedy said .
" But there 's no way around it .
"  It 's unclear what the ultimate remedy will be since no one is sure what the time frame is for a return to normal life .
But there is hope that the recruiting calendar will be extended this summer into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up for lost time .
There 's a chance the ripple effect will be felt for some time at the college level , where the NCAA 's Transfer Portal currently has more than 200 players seeking to change schools for next season .

Middletown , NJ Saturday , January 12 , 2019 ( Photo : Doug Hood )  " We think that we have incredibly high transfer rates now , and we do , which coincides with the NCAA continuing to limit the evaluation process , " Kennedy said .
" There are so many kids who are committing to schools that have n't seen them play enough , that do n't know enough about them as players and students .
And because of that we have these historic numbers in our transfer portal .
" This year , so many of these decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know each other , my guess is it will continue to rise .
The group I feel for most are those unsigned seniors .

The Hoop Group is one of many local businesses impacted by the coronavirus ( Photo : File photo )  Like so many other businesses across the country , the Hoop Group is feeling the economic crunch of the nationwide shutdown , which has brought the sports world to a grinding halt .
Beyond the training , clinics and leagues run at their Neptune facility , which is closed , the majority of their business involves running showcase tournaments , camps and leagues throughout the region , with the entire business model on the shelf for now .
" Spring is a huge time of year for kids playing basketball , " Kennedy said .
" Our spring AAU events are some of the biggest in the country on both the boys ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that sounds so insensitive with what so many others are having to deal with , but it is as well the reality of life .
" We 're event operators who run large scale tournaments and camps , the same as if you were a wedding planner .
The business is down to zero .

The CARES Act in Sioux Falls : What $2T in aid means for local businesses  Businesses in Sioux Falls have been forced to cut staff and face financial uncertainty in the first few weeks of the novel coronavirus reaching South Dakota , but the new federal aid package passed Friday could serve as a lifeline as local restaurants and retailers bear the brunt of social distancing .
The $2 trillion aid package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help small businesses cover the cost of payroll and the other costs of staying open -- or temporarily closed -- as most of the public stays home to prevent the spread of COVID-19 .
" I think that program is probably going to save some businesses if they can get into it right away , " said Stacy Newcomb-Weiland , owner of Parker 's Bistro .
The Coronavirus Aid , Relief and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act includes financial relief for affected businesses for up to eight weeks as Sioux Falls and the rest of South Dakota cope with the response to the worsening pandemic .
Newcomb-Weiland has worked to continually limit operations at Parker 's , going to a take-out only business model in an effort to follow the recommendations of city and federal health officials .
Unlike other leadership in neighboring states such as Iowa , North Dakota and Minnesota , Gov .
Kristi Noem has yet to mandate closures of non-essential businesses , but city officials agreed to limit patrons in businesses to nine or fewer at a time last week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so .
Programs to assist them will now be available through the Small Business Administration due to the passage of the CARES Act .
The CARES Act provides a number of different options for businesses :  The Paycheck Protection Program  The program is intended to help small businesses cover payroll costs and retain more employees during temporary closures .
Loans are 100% guaranteed and are eligible to be forgiven for up to eight weeks of paychecks if they maintain their payroll during the crisis , according to the federal government .
Businesses can apply for up to $10 million in aid .
The PPP is available for small firms from sole proprietorship to businesses with fewer than 500 employees .
The program is also available to nonprofits .
The Small Business Debt Relief Program  The program is in fact a range of different type of options for debt relief for businesses who have non-disaster loans from the SBA already .
The administration will cover loan payments for six months .
Businesses can also apply for any of the qualifying loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they file paperwork within a six-month window .
Debt relief is available for specific loans , such as so-called 7(a) and 504 loans , as well as microloans .
Businesses can still apply for such loans , even if they have entered the Paycheck Protection Program .
Disaster loans and grants  A business applying for one of the SBA 's disaster loans can receive an emergency grant of up to $10,000 within three days if they are dealing directly with the economic fallout from the pandemic .
To qualify , businesses must first apply for the administration 's Economic Injury Disaster Loan .
The disaster loans are available in amounts up to $2 million , again for businesses with 500 or fewer workers .
