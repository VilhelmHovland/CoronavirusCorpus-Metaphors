The Tauranga Cup  Last weekend , a thoroughbred race that dates back over a century was run at the Gate Pa track .
The Tauranga Cup , over one and a quarter miles , was run almost continuously until 1967 , when it became the Bay of Plenty Cup .
The first reported running of the Tauranga Cup was in 1898 , with the featured events at the Bay of Plenty Jockey Club meeting , being the three mile Hunt Steeplechase of 25 sovereigns and the Tauranga Cup worth 50 sovereigns .
From 1980 until 1997 , the Cup raced under various names , before reverting back to the Bay of Plenty Cup in 1998 .
The return of the Bay of Plenty Cup in 1998 brought special pleasure to local Gate Pa trainer Jim Pender .
O'Toole , who was raced by Jim Pender and his mother , cruised to a comfortable victory ridden by one of the pioneers of female jockeys in the country in Trudy Thornton .
A Tauranga Cup winner with strong local connections was Surveyor , who won the 1923 event .
Owned by William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Motiti Island , the well performed racehorse won 13 races in the Paterson colours including the 1925 Wellington Cup .
Sideline Sid is a history nut who likes nothing better to unearth stories and write about times of long ago .
The running of the recent Bay of Plenty Cup got him thinking about the life and times of Tauranga folk when the Tauranga Cup was first run in 1898 .
New Zealand had a population of less than one million citizens , iconic New Zealand politician Richard Seddon was Prime Minister and a small old-age pension was introduced that year .
Tauranga was a sleepy fishing village , with Colonel Gerald Arnold Ward elected mayor , which reflected the towns strong links to the military .
Many of the citizens of the time would go on to experience a similar event to the coronavirus pandemic that we are undergoing at present .
In 1918 , the world was decimated by an influenza epidemic that was known as the Spanish Flu .
No sooner than WW1 had ended , the influenza epidemic swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Zealand military that died in the entirety of the Great War .
It would be interesting to know how the country coped in 1918 , compared with the how we are dealing with the coronavirus today .
While the Bay of Plenty Cup lost its identity in the 1980 's and 1990 's , it bounced back , just like New Zealand will come back to normality after living our lives in a different manner in the coming weeks and months .
