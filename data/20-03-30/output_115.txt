Oscar Jorda , Sanjay R .
Singh and Alan M .
Taylor from the University of California have released a dark academic paper for these dark times .
They 've looked at the long-term economic impact of pandemics dating back to the Black Death .
Little is known about the medium- to long-term macroeconomic effects of global pandemics .
But the recent COVID-19 outbreak places more urgency on trying to gauge the likely economic fallout .
In this paper we use the history of pandemics and rates of return since the 14th century to shed light on this problem .
Here 's their conclusion .
Summing up our findings , the great historical pandemics of the last millennium have typically been associated with subsequent low returns to assets , as far as the limited data allow us to conclude .
These responses are huge .
Smaller responses are found in real wages , but still statistically significant , and consistent with the baseline neoclassical model .
Measured by deviations in a benchmark economic statistic , the real natural rate of interest , these responses indicate that pandemics are followed by sustained periods -- over multiple decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital per unit of surviving labor , and/or heightened desires to save , possibly due to an increase in precautionary saving or a rebuilding of depleted wealth .
Either way , if the trends play out similarly in the wake of COVID-19 -- adjusted to the scale of this pandemic -- the global economic trajectory will be very different than was expected only a few weeks ago .
If low real interest rates are sustained for decades they will provide welcome fiscal space for governments to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic .
The major caveat is that past pandemics occurred at time when virtually no members of society survived to old age .
The Black Death and other plagues hit populations with the great mass of the age pyramid below 60 , so this time may be different .
Some countries are seemingly doing much better than others at combating COVID-19 .
Among those that appear to be doing well is South Korea .
Writing for NPR , Jason Beaubien looks at what 's working for South Korea where the number of new cases has slowed significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict lockdown strategies deployed in countries like New Zealand .
The key appears to be widespread testing .
South Korea 's foreign minister , Kang Kyung-wha , speaking to the BBC last week , said the key lessons from her country are that it developed testing for the virus even before it had a significant number of cases .
" In mid-January , our health authorities quickly conferred with the research institutions here to develop a test , " Kang said .
" And then they shared that result with the pharmaceutical companies , who then produced the reagent chemical and the equipment needed for the testing .
"  So when members of a religious sect in Daegu started getting sick in February , South Korea was able to rapidly confirm that it was COVID-19 .
" Testing is central " to the outbreak response , said Kang , " because that leads to early detection .
It minimizes further spread .
" And it allows health authorities to quickly isolate and treat those found with the virus .
Hong Kong and Singapore have followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've used testing aggressively to identify cases -- not only testing people who are so sick that they 're hospitalized but also mild cases and even suspected cases .
They 've quarantined tens of thousands of people who may have been exposed to confirmed cases .
Hong Kong , Singapore and South Korea all have recent experience to draw on that undoubtedly helps .
Hong Kong and Singapore were hit hard by SARS in 2003 , and South Korea came to a standstill during a MERS outbreak in 2015 .
Japan has also been doing well , but not so much through testing .
Japan is another Asian country notable for its response .
Although Japan has more than twice the population of South Korea and also has strong ties to China , it has recorded only a fraction of the cases that South Korea has -- just over 1,000 as of Thursday .
Japan has n't been testing nearly as widely as South Korea , but it appears to have fended off significant community transmission by quickly investigating any flare-ups of cases , identifying who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Writing for The Conversation Klaus W Larres takes a look at Germany 's response , where the number of COVID-19 related infections and deaths are much lower than in its comparable European neighbours .
He sees an older population in Italy as more vulnerable , and credits the German health system .
Goldman analysts , led by David Kostin , argue three criteria must be met :  1 ) The viral spread in the United States must begin to slow , so that the ultimate economic impact of the virus and containment efforts can be understood .
2 ) There must be evidence that " extraordinary measures " taken by the Federal Reserve and Congress to support the U .
economy are sufficient .
" While the willingness of policymakers to use all the tools at their disposal is clear , only time will tell to what extent the actions succeed in limiting defaults , business closures and layoffs , " Kostin wrote .
3 ) Investor sentiment and positioning must bottom out .
Goldman analysts point to their U .
Equity Sentiment Indicator , which combines nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined by 1 .
standard deviations , versus standard deviations of between -2 and -3 in recent corrections .
Additionally the Goldman analysts see a further headwind with a significant reduction in companies buying back their own shares .
They point out that nearly 50 U .
corporations have suspended existing share repurchase authorizations in recent weeks , " representing $190 billion in buybacks , or nearly 25% of the 2019 total .
"  " Buybacks have represented the single largest source of U .
equity demand in each of the last several years , and we believe higher volatility and lower equity valuations are among the likely consequences of reduced buybacks .
"  The Guardian reports on an Australian astrophysicist who was admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose while attempting to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus pandemic .
Ouch .
Reardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils , and two on the outside .
When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose , the two inside stuck together .
Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove them .
" At this point , my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me , " he said .
" I was trying to pull them out but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose you ca n't get past .
" After struggling for 20 minutes , I decided to Google the problem and found an article about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem .
The solution in that was more magnets .
To put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside .
" As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets , they clipped on to each other and I lost my grip .
And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right .
At this point I ran out of magnets .
"  Before attending the hospital , Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out , but they became magnetised by the magnets inside his nose .
" Every time I brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet , " he said .
" It was a little bit painful at this point .

I came in way back 3 Feb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny poster asking if people had been unwell .
No checks or tracing done whatsoever .
Hopeless NZ border and we had every chance possible to monitor it then .
I have yet to hear a compelling answer to why we do n't test as many people as we can .
I 'm tired of hearing how most of the cases have a link to overseas travel or to another confirmed case , yes that 's because the criteria means we predominantly only test THOSE PEOPLE HELLO ! ! !  I watched a bit of it .
I think the COVID 19 messaging has to start distinguishing between " self-isolation " and " quarantine " .
They speak of the whole nation as " self-isolating " , but our implementation of that self-isolation allows us to go to the grocery store , go out for walks , etc .
As I understand it , those NZers returning from overseas , regardless of whether they have been tested , show any symptoms of flu , etc .
are all supposed to be " quarantining " themselves for 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us are doing .
They are supposed to be in a bubble of one ( be it a whole house if living alone , or a single room in a house where they co-habit with others , or in a motel/hotel room ) .
They are not supposed to go grocery shopping - someone else should be delivering them food ( whether it be to their door or to their home ) .

"  It is becoming increasingly apparent that testing is the most critical tool in fighting this disease .
Our first death was someone who was misdiagnosed .
The WHO has forewarned countries that testing is the most important step in fighting viruses .
Tests completed should be the measure we focus on when looking at progress in fighting the disease .
And , in the spirit of #5 but with less larfs , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of a choir practised , none exhibiting symptoms at the time .
45 have the Dreaded Lurgi , two have died ( so far ) .
Seems that aerosol transmission is - er - Alive and well .
exactly what the WHO assures us all is not possible .
Experts said the choir outbreak is consistent with a growing body of evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosols -- particles smaller than 5 micrometers that can float in the air for minutes or longer .
The World Health Organization has downplayed the possibility of transmission in aerosols , stressing that the virus is spread through much larger " respiratory droplets , " which are emitted when an infected person coughs or sneezes and quickly fall to a surface .
