Early signs of spread emerge  Civic workers arrive to sanitize an area outside a hospital to check the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in Mumbai , India , Saturday ( AP )  India has detected " early signals " of community transmission of the novel coronavirus , at least three patients whose source of infection is unclear , government researchers said on Saturday but asserted that there was no evidence yet of widespread transmission .
The " sporadic cases " were picked up through efforts to look for the coronavirus in hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness ( SARI ) but no travel history under testing criteria recommended by the ICMR .
" There are some sporadic cases with no exposure history , " Raman Gangakhedkar , the chief of the ICMR 's communicable diseases division , said .
" But the numbers are not significant .
We should not assume the virus is spreading everywhere .
We should not over-interpret what we observe .
"  The findings imply that India 's coronavirus epidemic might be on the brink of slipping from local transmission into community transmission , a stage in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the source of infection remains unclear .
India 's count of coronavirus infections grew by 193 on Saturday -- the highest rise so far in 36 hours -- to reach a cumulative number of 917 .
But almost all patients have had a history of recent foreign travel or had contact with positive cases .
Eighty patients have recovered and been discharged so far and 19 have died .
But health officials are aware that the rising number of infections also suggests that the virus has had opportunities to spread locally into the community .
" It is not surprising to see sporadic cases with no exposure history , we should expect to see more such cases , particularly in states such as Maharashtra or Kerala with large numbers of positive cases , " Manoj Murhekar , the director of the National Institute of Epidemiology , Chennai , told The Telegraph .
He said more than three sporadic cases could be interpreted as " early signals " of community transmission .
Up to March 20 , India had tested only patients with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing criteria , surveillance units in more than 50 medical college hospitals across the country under a network created by the ICMR 's National Institute of Virology , Pune , began testing hospitalised patients with SARI .
" We 've increased the number of tests over the past week , " Murhekar said .
A network of 118 government labs and 44 private diagnostic labs are now approved to test for the coronavirus , Gangakhedkar said .
" We have a testing capacity of 12,000 per day .
Only 30 per cent is currently being used .
There is no shortage of tests .
Whoever meets the testing criteria can get tested , " he said .
A senior virologist who has been tracking the coronavirus pandemic worldwide said no one should be surprised that there is now evidence for community transmission .
" This was bound to happen .
The outbreak is still growing rapidly -- look how our numbers are increasing , " said Shahid Jameel , the head of The WellCome Trust-India DBT Alliance , a partnership between a UK-based trust and the Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community transmission is taking place .
