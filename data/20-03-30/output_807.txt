&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal is stepping up its measurers to help homeless people cope with the coronavirus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They include opening five outdoor day centres , expanding shelter room for men and women , and adding temporary public toilets .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re working with our partners to ensure the homeless have access to facilities that allow them to practise good hygiene while respecting the protocol established to deal with the virus , &amp;rdquo ; said Rosannie Filato , the Montreal executive committee member responsible for public safety .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The first two day centres opened this weekend at Cabot Square and Place &amp;Eacute ; milie-Gamelin .
Three others will open shortly .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Filato said it was important to get these centres opened because indoor day centres had to shut down to respect the ban on large gatherings .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We had to find room outdoors , which allowed us to serve this vulnerable population , but also offered enough space that we could respect social distancing , &amp;rdquo ; Filato said .
&amp;ldquo ; There will be facilities to wash and the homeless will be able to something good to eat .
People will be able to get information about the virus and what they can do to protect themselves .

" data-portal-copyright= " John Kenney " **28;16774;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1760775 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; The city&amp;rsquo ; s health department will manage the Cabot Square centre along with Resilience Montreal , which has experience dealing with homeless people , particularly among the Indigenous population .
There&amp;rsquo ; s also help from the province , community organizations and volunteers .
The Red Cross was on hand to help get things rolling during the weekend .
Filato said the five centres will be able to accommodate 1,000 people on a daily basis .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The former Royal Victoria Hospital site on Pins Ave .
has been used as an emergency shelter , but it will now be reserved for patients who require isolation .
There is a shelter for women at the YMCA on Stanley St .
and for men at Complexe Guy-Favreau .
The city&amp;rsquo ; s website says new locations will be available soon .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The city is also installing 24 portable washrooms , mostly in the downtown area .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is important because many of these people relied on restaurants that are now closed , &amp;rdquo ; Filato said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The city ramped up its efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus when Mayor Val&amp;eacute ; rie Plante declared a health emergency on Friday .
Among the new regulations are a ban on dogs in city parks and a limit on joggers who are required to stay within one kilometre of their homes .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; Combine the current need for solo exercise and the arrival of spring , and it&amp;rsquo ; s the perfect time for a Couch to 5K running program .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Created a decade ago , the eight-week program has successfully turned hundreds of walkers into runners .
That said , the workouts aren&amp;rsquo ; t limited to folks who want to run .
They also work for walkers who want to put a little extra pep in their step .
Just substitute the running intervals with brisk walking and you&amp;rsquo ; re good to go .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The beauty of this program is that it allows for a gradual introduction to running , giving your body plenty of time to get used to pounding the pavement .
It starts with lots of walking and small bursts of running .
As the weeks go by , the walking is replaced by running .
Before you know it , you&amp;rsquo ; re running 30 minutes , which is about five kilometres ( give or take ) .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Another plus of the Couch to 5K program is that it takes just 30 minutes ( plus or minus a couple minutes here and there ) three days a week .
I suggest you take a day off between training sessions , but if you need to do a couple back to back or put more than a couple of days between workouts , no problem .
Just make sure you do all the workouts &amp;mdash ; don&amp;rsquo ; t skip ahead , as the program is meant to introduce running gradually and gently .
That includes non-runners who are already in good shape .
No matter how fit you are aerobically , your musculoskeletal system needs time to adjust to the impact stress of running , so patience is your friend .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Don&amp;rsquo ; t worry about how fast you&amp;rsquo ; re moving .
You need to find a pace you can sustain for the whole running interval .
Those first few short intervals seem pretty doable , but as you get closer to running three uninterrupted minutes it starts to feel more challenging .
So find a comfortable pace and stay there .
The rule of thumb in running is distance before speed .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Before you get started , make sure you have a good pair of running shoes .
You also need a basic kit of athletic wear , which should be made of breathable fabric that moves with you and has no rough seams .
And ladies , make sure you have a good sports bra .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Finally , feel free to check in with any questions .
I&amp;rsquo ; ll answer as many as possible and publish some of the best at the bottom of my weekly column .
You can also share your successes and struggles .
If we&amp;rsquo ; ve learned one thing these past few weeks , it&amp;rsquo ; s that we&amp;rsquo ; re one large community , so stay calm and run on ! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;17259;TOOLONG .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; BLAINVILLE &amp;mdash ; A Zumba instructor who goes by the name H&amp;eacute ; l&amp;egrave ; ne Antidote provided some joy for a group of seniors at the R&amp;eacute ; sidence Le Nobilis on Friday .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The residents , who have been isolated in their apartments because of the coronavirus , flocked to their balconies to be led through a series of exercises led&amp;nbsp ; by Antidote , whose brightly coloured outfit wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t have been out of place at a Cirque du Soleil show .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It was really great , &amp;rdquo ; said Ophelia Roy .
&amp;ldquo ; When they gave us our rainbows ( signs with a rainbow motif and the word &amp;ldquo ; &amp;ccedil ; a va bien aller&amp;rdquo ; ) , it really touched me .
It&amp;rsquo ; s very nice .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Roy said it was good to feel a sense of community with her fellow residents even though it was limited to greetings exchanged at a distance .
She noted social distancing is taken very seriously at the independent living complex .

&amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re not allowed to visit .
We mostly go out on our balconies .
We can talk to each other , but this is the first time I see people walking around outside .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Roy and her fellow residents are aware of the importance of exercise and she said she has been heeding her children&amp;rsquo ; s advice and getting outside to walk in addition to doing some exercises in her apartment .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I try to to keep busy because usually we have a lot of activities here , but they&amp;rsquo ; ve been cancelled , &amp;rdquo ; Roy said .
&amp;ldquo ; Zumba , I do every week .
&amp;rdquo ; The residence has an indoor swimming pool and an exercise room , but both have been closed by government decree .
An onsite caf&amp;eacute ; and hair salon are also shuttered and the isolation extends to a ban on visitors .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s scary , but what can we do , nothing , &amp;rdquo ; Roy said when asked about the pandemic .
&amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; m very disappointed that people are not listening .
If everyone had stayed home , we would be okay .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Armande Beauvais was also among the participants in Friday&amp;rsquo ; s class and , while she enjoyed the lesson , she had one minor complaint .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It was fun , but it was rather cold on this side of the building because the sun isn&amp;rsquo ; t here yet , &amp;rdquo ; Beauvais said .
Her apartment is on the north side of the building and the balconies are in the shade in early afternoon .
Roy&amp;rsquo ; s apartment is on the south side and she and neighbours were treated to sunshine for their class .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Beauvais said the order to isolate has forced her to change her exercise routine .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We can&amp;rsquo ; t exercise as a group , but I try to do some exercises in my apartment , even if it&amp;rsquo ; s not very large , and I try to come and walk outside every day , especially when the weather is good , &amp;rdquo ; Beauvais said .
&amp;ldquo ; If not , I walk through the halls .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This was good and we&amp;rsquo ; re also expecting to go outside on our balconies and sing but , when it&amp;rsquo ; s cold , it&amp;rsquo ; s&amp;rsquo ; not easy , &amp;rdquo ; Beauvais said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The important thing , Beauvais said , is she&amp;rsquo ; s healthy and she&amp;rsquo ; s trying to stay healthy .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; m 81 and , thank God , it&amp;rsquo ; s not too bad .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; Family doctors across Montreal have switched to telemedicine to examine as many as 90 per cent of their patients&amp;nbsp ; &amp;mdash ; a new development that is likely to influence the way physicians practise even after the &lt;a href= " https : **33;18568;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; pandemic ends .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Patients with abdominal pain and other serious conditions are still being examined in doctors&amp;rsquo ; offices .
But in most cases , doctors , nurses , dietitians and social workers are relying on the phone , and to a lesser extent video calls , to communicate with patients .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For years , telemedicine has languished in Quebec , except in the Far North where doctors have used it routinely .
But since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11 , the practice is now being embraced by family doctors across the province .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Telemedicine is coming into its own for family medicine groups , &amp;rdquo ; &lt;a href= " https : **33;18603;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Dr .
Mark Roper&lt;/a&gt; , director of the Queen Elizabeth super clinic on Marlowe Ave .
, told the Montreal Gazette on Tuesday .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s working very well .
We&amp;rsquo ; re sparing patients from having to go outside and be exposed to people on the m&amp;eacute ; tro and on the bus .
We&amp;rsquo ; re sparing people in the waiting room from ( potentially ) picking up ( the coronavirus ) .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Telemedicine is still a patchwork of different systems in Quebec .
But the need to maintain social distancing is driving doctors in clinics to work more closely with systems like the &lt;a href= " https : **33;18638;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Dossier sant ? Qu ? bec&lt;/a&gt; , the provincial network of electronic medical records ; and &lt;span class= " st " &gt;&lt;a href= " https : **33;18673;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Rendez-vous sant ? Qu ? bec&lt;/a&gt; , which lets people book appointments at clinics online .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The last incentive to switch over came when the R&amp;eacute ; gie de l&amp;rsquo ; assurance maladie du Qu&amp;eacute ; bec added a new billing code two weeks ago allowing doctors to invoice the medicare board for a telehealth consultation .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Being in a wartime situation , technology advances very quickly , and the electronic medical record providers are adding the video conferencing very quickly now , &amp;rdquo ; Roper explained .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Before the pandemic , the Queen Elizabeth clinic did not rely at all on telemedicine .
Today , it&amp;rsquo ; s using it for more than 90 per cent of its patients .
By comparison , doctors are treating no more than 50 patients a day at the clinic in **26;18708;TOOLONG ; ce , down from the usual 150 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;18736;TOOLONG .

Doctors and nurses will speak to patients over the phone , or ask them to upload an app on their phone for a secure video call .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We had a lady with swollen legs due to heart failure and we wanted to see if her legs were improving , &amp;rdquo ; Roper recalled .
&amp;ldquo ; She couldn&amp;rsquo ; t talk very well .
She&amp;rsquo ; s quite elderly .
So her daughter turned her iPhone camera to her mother&amp;rsquo ; s legs and we had a look at the legs , and then we saw that they were less swollen than before .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Following a telemedicine consultation , doctors will send faxes for drug prescriptions to the pharmacy .
They can refer patients to a specialist by faxing a referral to the doctor or using a computerized referral system to choose the earliest available specialist .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some patients still have to show up at the clinic to get a bacterial culture done , to have their blood drawn or to take a urine test , but in such cases a dedicated team is on site to process the samples quickly .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The patients are extremely happy because they don&amp;rsquo ; t want to risk catching the virus coming in to get a renewal of their blood pressure medications , &amp;rdquo ; Roper said .
&amp;ldquo ; If they need to go to the emergency , obviously we call the ER ahead and tell them this patient is coming in and we send a summary .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; More than 30,000 patients depend on the Queen E clinic .
But what about the tens of thousands in Montreal who don&amp;rsquo ; t have a family doctor ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For such patients , Roper recommended &lt;span class= " st " &gt;Rendez-vous sant ? Qu ? bec ( RVSQ ) &lt;/span&gt; , known in English as the &lt;a href= " https : **33;18801;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Quebec Medical Appointment Scheduler&lt;/a&gt; .
Patients can book an appointment through the website with a clinic that&amp;rsquo ; s closest to where they live .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Before COVID-19 , appointments filled up quickly each morning , or were simply not available .
But with most clinics now filled to half capacity , that should not pose a problem .
At the Queen E clinic , patients booking through RVSQ are seen either the same day or the following day .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **28;18836;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **35;18866;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " http : **25;18903;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **31;18930;TOOLONG .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the past week , there were reports that some common medications might make COVID-19 worse .
Many news reports stated that anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and a class of common blood pressure medications might either make infection more likely or the illness more severe .
While the World Health Organization initially put out a press release suggesting that people might want to avoid ibuprofen during the current outbreak , it subsequently &lt;a href= " https : **33;19553;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;withdrew that statement&lt;/a&gt; citing insufficient evidence .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The blood pressure medication story began with a &lt;a href= " https : **33;19588;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;research letter&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine .
It asked , rather provocatively , if patients with hypertension and diabetes were at increased risk of COVID-19 infection .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There is little doubt that patients with pre-existing medical conditions are at higher risk if they become infected .
Of course , patients with high blood pressure and diabetes are more likely to be older , and age in and of itself would increase that risk , as well .
It is , however , another thing entirely to claim that high blood pressure and diabetes make it more likely that you will catch the virus in the first place .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The hypothesis centred on the fact that this current coronavirus binds and infects cells using an enzyme called ACE2 .
Higher levels of ACE2 would , in theory , make it more likely for the virus to infect the cells of the lungs where this enzyme is produced .
Therefore , any medications that increase ACE2 levels could potentially increase the risk of infection .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By rather unfortunate coincidence , many common blood pressure medications can increase ACE2 levels .
The research letter noted that medications like ibuprofen , as well as blood pressure pills like ACE inhibitors and ARBs , can increase ACE2 levels and should be monitored during the current pandemic .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The implications of this recommendation were profound .
ACE inhibitors ( like ramipril/altace and peridopril/coversyl ) and ARBs ( like valsartan/diovan and irbesartan/avapro ) are used not just to treat blood pressure , but also to protect the kidneys in patients with diabetes and to help cardiac function in patients with heart failure .
It would not be going too far to state that they are a cornerstone of treatment , and stopping them in light of the COVID-19 pandemic would almost certainly be disastrous for patients .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The danger , as was &lt;a href= " https : **32;19623;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; by numerous cardiovascular groups and societies , is that if patients were to suddenly stop these medications , it could lead to rapid spikes in high blood pressure , which could in turn lead to strokes , heart attacks and acute episodes of heart failure .
When it comes to cardiovascular care in stable patients , there is something to be said for not rocking the boat .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The &lt;a href= " https : **33;19657;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;recommendation to avoid ibuprofen&lt;/a&gt; is a little bit different .
While there are some people who rely on anti-inflammatories to treat conditions like arthritis , they are not generally recommended for most people because of their side effects .
Anti-inflammatories like these can raise your blood pressure , cause stomach ulcers and affect your kidneys in high doses .
While probably not harmful if taken sparingly in small doses , most physicians , myself included , would probably recommend that patients start with acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) if trying to treat a fever or mild aches and pains .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I myself am somewhat unconvinced that any of these medications is really having any significant effect on the spread of COVID-19 .
People are understandably concerned about COVID-19 and , unfortunately , in this climate of uncertainty , preliminary studies are often given much more credence than they deserve .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So while I might recommend that people avoid ibuprofen anyway , given its side effects that have nothing to do with virology , suddenly stopping your cardiac medication would be a catastrophically bad idea that could land many people in hospital .
And we can ill afford that right now .

Do active parents raise active kids ? http : **35;20087;TOOLONG .

" data-portal-copyright= " Tasos Katopodis " **28;20159;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1747990 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Are active parents more likely to raise active children than parents who never work up a sweat ? And does a failure to engage your children in an active lifestyle mean they&amp;rsquo ; ll grow up spending more time in front of a screen than in the playground or kicking a soccer ball ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines recommends preschoolers accumulate at least 180 minutes of physical activity spread throughout the day and progress toward at least 60 minutes of energetic play by the age of five .
From the ages of five to 11 , the guidelines suggest children accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity daily .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Those are ambitious targets for kids to accomplish on their own , which implies that parents have a role in encouraging their children to be physically active .
That responsibility doesn&amp;rsquo ; t just involve providing opportunities for kids to be active , but also by limiting sedentary activities and modelling their own active lifestyle .
After all , kids learn not just by doing but also by observing .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet despite the importance of an active lifestyle , little is known about the ABCs of raising an active child including whether children are more likely to accumulate the majority of their active minutes in school/ daycare or in the presence of their parents .
Some studies suggest that young children are more active under the care of others than they are at home .
In fact , only a small percentage of daily physical activity accumulated by kids and their parents is accrued together .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To get a better sense of the number of minutes per day children and their parents are active both individually and together , a research team from California State University at Fullerton put accelerometers on 26 parent-and-child ( two to six years age ) teams for 10 days .
They also requested parents fill out a daily online diary reporting the amount of time their child spent with their parents and any other caregivers like babysitters and teachers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The results showed that when parents and children were together , the parent&amp;rsquo ; s activity , or lack thereof , directly influenced their child .
The more active the parent , the more active the child .
A similar dynamic was found for sedentary behaviour ; when together , children modelled the behaviour of their inactive parents .
This association may seem obvious , but studies suggest that parents and children spend only a small amount of time being active together .
Indeed , most active parents work out without their child in tow , going to the gym or out for a bike ride or run solo instead of as a family unit .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The results from this study do not support the notion that active parents will yield active children by merely being active themselves , &amp;rdquo ; the researchers said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The other important revelation by the researchers is that within the family dynamic , not all physical activity need be initiated by the parents .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; An active child may require the parent to be active to keep up with the child , &amp;rdquo ; the researchers said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Frankly , it doesn&amp;rsquo ; t matter who motivates whom , but it&amp;rsquo ; s clear that parents and children need to spend more time being active together .
Visits to the park should involve running , jumping , sliding , climbing and swinging alongside children instead of watching from a park bench .
And it&amp;rsquo ; s never too early to practise the building blocks of physical activity , including changes in speed and direction of movement and other sports-related actions like throwing , catching and kicking .

" &gt;Fitness : Treat those aching knees and hips with **29;20259;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; The goal is to ensure children accumulate the recommended minutes of daily vigorous activity associated with their age .
It&amp;rsquo ; s also important that children see their parents enjoying themselves while being active .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A word of caution , however : Kids don&amp;rsquo ; t exercise like adults .
Unlike the adult tendency to get in as many minutes of exercise as possible in one session , children are more comfortable being active in short bursts .
Kids naturally gravitate toward interval workouts , interspersed with generous bouts of rest or light-intensity activity .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The idea of making exercise a family affair is particularly important as children tend to move less the older they get .
Active play is replaced with more sedentary pastimes and exercise tends to be scheduled versus spontaneous .
Families that make physical activity part of their lifestyle are more likely to continue the trend as the children get older .
Active vacations , weekends spent skiing , tobogganing , skating , paddling , hiking or exploring new activities like zip lining and indoor rock climbing are all activities kids and parents can enjoy together .
Active parents only raise active kids if the whole family learns to love exercise together , instead of parents prioritizing their own exercise goals .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This supports the notion that active parents must be active around their child to provide valuable behaviour modelling , while being active not in the presence of the child may not provide the same opportunity for such modelling to occur , &amp;rdquo ; said the research team from the University of California Fullerton .

Fran ? ois Legault last week ordered the province 's schools , universities and daycares closed for two weeks&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This is not a vacation .
The government of Quebec is in emergency mode , &amp;rdquo ; Sebastiani said on Tuesday .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Provincial health authorities announced 74 confirmed cases of COVID-19 late Tuesday , up from 50 on Monday .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;20509;TOOLONG .
title= " " alt= " " data-portal-copyright= " " **28;20544;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Around the world there have been nearly 200,000 documented cases of the influenza-like respiratory illness since it was first detected in December in China , and almost 8,000 deaths .
Although many cases are mild , the elderly and those with underlying health conditions are especially vulnerable .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It is very important for families to understand that they can have an important , active role in this phase of the epidemic , &amp;rdquo ; Sebastiani said .
&amp;ldquo ; They can help the physicians and other health care professionals in saving lives &amp;mdash ; just by staying home .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We have a small window of opportunity to avoid the exponential phase of the outbreak : one week , a few days &amp;mdash ; not more .
We must take advantage of it .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hospitals are reducing non-urgent visits and procedures to be prepared for a flood of COVID-19 cases , Sebastiani wrote in a Facebook community group post .
She urged parents to &amp;ldquo ; please help us flatten the curve , &amp;rdquo ; to slow the spread of the virus so that fewer people need to seek treatment at any given time , &amp;ldquo ; so that we can be ready to face upcoming emergencies .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Children who contract COVID-19 are often asymptomatic .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; If we start saying it&amp;rsquo ; s OK for the children go to the park with their grandparents or to share play dates or share common spaces , this will lead to a propagation of this illness , &amp;rdquo ; she said .

I think the government has taken very important steps &amp;ndash ; and much more quickly than what happened in some European countries , where the epidemic went out of control .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sebastiani , who is a liver specialist at the McGill University Health Centre , emphasized that she was sharing her personal view , as a physician and a mother of two .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; As an infectious diseases specialist and medical microbiologist , Marty Teltscher is one of the doctors at the Jewish General Hospital dealing with patients who have contracted COVID-19 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Teltscher works as a consulting physician for those treating patients infected by the novel coronavirus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The biggest part of his job now is working with the team of infectious diseases doctors to pare down how many regular patients they are treating , both so they can be available to help treat COVID-19 patients , and to reduce the number of people in the hospital , in order to reduce the chance of spreading an infection .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Today in our walk-in clinic , where we usually see up to 35 people , we have seen eight , &amp;rdquo ; Teltscher said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although he has reduced the number of patients he treats daily , Teltscher said the virus is keeping him and his team very busy , &amp;ldquo ; reorganizing in order to prioritize certain services and equipment .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While most doctors in the hospital aren&amp;rsquo ; t dealing with patients who are infected , Teltscher said all hospital personnel are now pulling together to get ready for an influx of COVID-19 patients .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; What we&amp;rsquo ; re expecting is the potential for many people to need medical support and a significant number of people who will need critical care and equipment , &amp;rdquo ; Teltscher said .
&amp;ldquo ; That&amp;rsquo ; s what happened in Italy , and you end up depleting supplies and personnel , and then you are left with a system that can&amp;rsquo ; t cope even with people who are not infected .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We know what this virus can do is completely disrupt the healthcare system by overloading it in a rapid fashion .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Teltscher said he&amp;rsquo ; s not afraid to be working with COVID-19 patients , but he is concerned about what lies ahead .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s challenging , and to a certain degree frustrating , &amp;rdquo ; he said .
&amp;ldquo ; I wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t say this is an interesting time I&amp;rsquo ; d like to study .
I&amp;rsquo ; d rather not be here at all .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Michael Sidel is a neurologist who sees stroke patients in the hospital .
And while he doesn&amp;rsquo ; t deal directly with COVID-19 patients , his whole practice is affected by the virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sidel , an associate professor of neurology and neurosurgery at McGill , said the clinics where he works are paring down the number of patients they see in the hospital , to do as much follow-up on the phone and work from home if possible .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He too is working with a team of neurologists who will decide in the coming days which services they must offer and which ones can be put on hold to reduce the number of people in the hospital so that more resources can be made available for the fight against COVID-19 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Unless they are critically urgent , we&amp;rsquo ; re trying not to see people in the hospital , &amp;rdquo ; Sidel said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The ward where Sidel works is now being converted into the area in the hospital to treat patients infected with the coronavirus .
As such , many of the nurses he has worked with have been retrained in recent weeks to deal with the pandemic .
He said he is impressed by the dedication of the nursing staff to work on patients infected with this virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The nurses on the ward are stressed .
Nobody really knows what will happen , &amp;rdquo ; he said .
&amp;ldquo ; That hangs over everything .
There is a tremendous sense of work and dedication , and altruism .
Anyone working on the front lines , there&amp;rsquo ; s a measure of self-sacrifice there .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He said he&amp;rsquo ; s not concerned he will be infected , even though he works with nurses that come in contact with the virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; At a certain point , you have to trust that the measures being taken are protecting the healthcare workers and the people that they come in contact with , so I&amp;rsquo ; m protected and my family is protected .

" data-portal-copyright= " Pierre Obendrauf " **28;21400;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1197688 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; As an emergency room doctor at the McGill University Health Centre , Mitch Shulman would normally be on the front lines working with infected patients .
However , he recently returned from a trip abroad and will have to isolate himself for two weeks on the orders of Quebec Premier Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Legault .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Although he knows the precaution is a sensible one , it will be difficult for him to be sitting on the sidelines knowing his colleagues covering his shifts will have their hands full .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The procedure for dealing with patients who may be infected or are infected is very labour intensive , in terms of the donning of gear , &amp;rdquo ; he said .
&amp;ldquo ; You have to be meticulous about the protocol and if you&amp;rsquo ; re in the gear , it&amp;rsquo ; s really tough to breathe .
It&amp;rsquo ; s tough to maintain focus and concentration for many hours at a stretch , especially if you&amp;rsquo ; re gowning and regowning .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There are a lot of logistical concerns , along with the practical one , like : &amp;lsquo ; am I going to get infected and bring the virus home ? ' &amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Teltscher said while healthcare workers are doing their part , he believes everyone in the country has a role to play .
The outcome will depend on how well average citizens heed the warnings to avoid social gatherings and reduce contact with others as much as possible .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s the most important group effort that we have seen , probably in our lifetime , &amp;rdquo ; he said .
&amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s as important as if we would be going to war .
Everybody has to contribute in all aspects of society if we&amp;rsquo ; re going to succeed .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; No easy task , but I found some tourists strolling Ste-Catherine St .
Jacky Le Naour , his wife Fran&amp;ccedil ; oise , their son and daughter-in-law had just arrived from France&amp;rsquo ; s Brittany region a few days earlier .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s great , almost like we have the whole city to ourselves , &amp;rdquo ; Jacky said .
&amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s our first time here and we are managing to enjoy ourselves , even with so many places closed .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The family is well aware of the coronavirus , having dealt with it in France .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; ve been lucky so far , &amp;rdquo ; interjected the smiling Fran&amp;ccedil ; oise .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lucky that they arrived before quarantine and strict isolation policies took hold here .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Suffice it to say , these are trying times for the city&amp;rsquo ; s tourism trade .

&amp;ldquo ; This is such a huge industry in this city and country , and the ( coronavirus ) is having such a devastating effect on it and everything else .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Torriani had a sense of what was to come when he heard that Nestl&amp;eacute ; , one of the world&amp;rsquo ; s largest companies , had banned travel for its employees .
And then events just mushroomed everywhere &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There has been a precipitous drop in occupancy here , &amp;rdquo ; he said .
&amp;ldquo ; We could really start to feel it three weeks ago with things plummeting overall .
Then came entertainment , sports events and conventions being cancelled .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Ritz is also a popular destination for visiting NHL clubs , not to mention visiting entertainers , actors and production personnel as well as business execs from around the globe .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Everyone I&amp;rsquo ; ve talked to in the business across the country has also been effected .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He pointed out that the hotel had been taking an intensive pro-active safety approach for a while , with doorknobs to key-cards being constantly scrubbed and hand sanitizers being placed everywhere .
The hotel&amp;rsquo ; s acclaimed restaurant Maison Boulud has been shut down for cautionary reasons .
As a consequence , staffing levels are also down , with employees on temporary leave .

&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With the Grand Prix and summer festival plans still in the works , this will be imperative for the survival for the tourism trade .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I think Premier Legault has to be credited for taking tough measures now .
If we don&amp;rsquo ; t do this now , then we&amp;rsquo ; ll have another Italy , and that could be the end for so many and so much .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s a two-way street for tourism .
They&amp;rsquo ; re not coming here , and we&amp;rsquo ; re not going there .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Travel agent Genevi&amp;egrave ; ve Stachtchenko conceded she hasn&amp;rsquo ; t made &amp;ldquo ; a penny&amp;rdquo ; for a few weeks .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; No one is going anywhere these days , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
&amp;ldquo ; All I&amp;rsquo ; m doing now is cancelling tickets and reservations and trying to get refunds for customers .
Or else trying to get snowbird customers booked to come back later to come back now , but that&amp;rsquo ; s been so tough with many of those flights booked or being cut back .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; If I don&amp;rsquo ; t get some customers out from France within 48 hours , they could be facing many weeks of quarantine when they get back here .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Stachtchenko can&amp;rsquo ; t recall business ever being this abysmal .
Not even around 9/11 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I was actually booking a lot of people then , but I can&amp;rsquo ; t see anyone booking for at least another month .
Still , I&amp;rsquo ; m sure I&amp;rsquo ; m far from the only one with zero income these days .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; No doubt .
There&amp;rsquo ; s an eerie emptiness at downtown shops .
So many businesses have curtailed operations for the time being , even though they aren&amp;rsquo ; t required to do so .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s no customers coming , so what&amp;rsquo ; s the point of staying open ? &amp;rdquo ; said one salesperson , whose shop was in the midst of closing .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Boutique Tozzi manager Ismael Oblitas acknowledged that business at his Crescent St .
shop had slowed down and he was anticipating more of a downturn in the next two weeks .
But he echoed the sentiments of other retailers offering a solution to those uneasy about showing up in person .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The best short-term solution would be to support businesses like ours and so many others through our online platforms , &amp;rdquo ; he said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The strategy appears to be working .
Canada Post mailman Tony Francescangeli has seen a huge upsurge of late in home deliveries of parcels from Amazon and other online operators : &amp;ldquo ; Neither snow nor rain , nor sleet nor heat , and , now , coronavirus can deter these packages from being delivered .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lufa , the food delivery system with its urban rooftop vegetable farms , has , not surprisingly , also received a major sales boost .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even though restaurants are permitted to stay open , albeit in diminished capacity , many are now shutting down entirely .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Time Out Market in the Eaton Centre announced that it will be closing down temporarily as of Tuesday .
Also starting Tuesday , Tim Hortons will close indoor seating at its outlets , offering only take-out , drive-thru and delivery .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Other restos , which have closed or planning to do , are also considering a similar tack , in providing take out service .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re looking into it , &amp;rdquo ; said Stephen Leslie , whose two popular restaurants , Tavern on the Square and Monkland Tavern , are both closed .
&amp;ldquo ; But the situation is ever evolving , changing from hour to hour .
It&amp;rsquo ; s nuts .
I&amp;rsquo ; m now been hearing rumours about the SAQ closing .
If that happens , there will be tough days ahead for many .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not everyone is bemoaning bad business .
With interest rates about as low as they&amp;rsquo ; ve been and with many wishing not to place their cash in the stock market , they are choosing brick and mortar investments instead .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; That happened during the financial crisis in 2008 , and I can see it happening now , &amp;rdquo ; noted Joseph Montanaro , among the city&amp;rsquo ; s premier real-estate agents .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He reports having completed 10 offers for homes during spring break .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I haven&amp;rsquo ; t been seeing panic in real estate .
In fact , I foresee an amazing season , especially if they slash the interest rates even further , which I think they will .
There are many taking advantage of the opportunities .
It&amp;rsquo ; s going to make a hot market even hotter .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; But nothing is gained anywhere if people keep freaking out .
We simply can&amp;rsquo ; t let things grind to a halt .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; It began with a cough .
A solitary cough , in the night .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was lying in bed at my friend Rupert&amp;rsquo ; s place in the south of England , on a stopover on my way back from covering the &lt;a href= " https : **33;22977;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Berlinale , a .
the Berlin International Film Festival .
&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was Thur .
, Feb .
27 , a more innocent time , seemingly ages removed from the current COVID-19 world lockdown .
Rupert and I had spent the day hiking the hills , ocean-side cliffs and wetlands of the area .
Rupert had a cough , and apparently I had caught it .
Or had I ? Perhaps my throat was dry .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The next day , I was due to fly back .
After lunch with Rupert and his sister at a vegan restaurant , I stopped into the small-town pharmacy next door and purchased a surgical mask at the cost of four British pounds , or $7 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was not concerned about the cough which I may or may not have caught &amp;mdash ; and which I was certain was not COVID-19 &amp;mdash ; but about protecting myself from other travellers carrying the virus on the flight home .
My wife lives with an autoimmune disease , and I was determined to stay safe .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I was one of just a few passengers on our British Airways flight to do so , much to the consternation of my seat-mate , who eyed me cautiously despite the empty seat between us and my unsuccessful attempt at small-talk .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I landed in Montreal , ditched the mask , cleaned my hands with Purell , took a cab home from the airport , and kissed my wife .
Agreed , that last part probably wasn&amp;rsquo ; t the smartest thing to do .
But remember , we&amp;rsquo ; re talking almost three weeks ago .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Turns out I did have a cough , and it soon became nasty .
But I never had a fever , and the COVID-19-related information at the time said symptoms were cough plus fever plus trouble breathing , etc .
And my wife never caught it , so we weren&amp;rsquo ; t worried .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The cough stuck around , forcing me to take a couple of sick days and leaving me at half-capacity when I tried to stage a comeback , even while working from home .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Which brings us up to last week , &lt;a href= " https : **33;23012;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;when each day seemed to take the COVID-19 protocol into new&lt;/a&gt; , unknown territory .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Upping the ante , my wife&amp;rsquo ; s parents were driving in from Ottawa to see her final exhibition for her master&amp;rsquo ; s degree in visual arts .
And they were planning to stay with us .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Things were ramping up , both in Quebec and internationally .
There was a moment of truth , as we wondered whether to have her parents come &amp;mdash ; but I still had no fever , therefore no COVID-19 , and she hadn&amp;rsquo ; t caught my cough , so I surely wasn&amp;rsquo ; t contagious anymore ; we went ahead , albeit cautiously .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I stifled my cough &amp;mdash ; coughing only once all evening , going into our bedroom to do so &amp;mdash ; and washed my hands repeatedly .
I avoided kisses , hugs and all bodily contact .
We chatted , ate dinner and retired for the evening .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then , after hearing over the course of the day about the &lt;a href= " https : **33;23047;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;NBA season being postponed&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href= " https : **33;23082;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Sophie Gr ? goire Trudeau being in self-isolation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href= " https : **33;23117;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Tom Hanks and his wife having COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; , we saw that Quebec had changed its guidelines for getting tested : from having cough and fever and trouble breathing , to cough OR fever OR trouble breathing .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **33;23152;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;I called 811&lt;/a&gt; around 10:30 p .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After 51 minutes on hold , a nurse answered .
She asked a bunch of questions , and informed me that since I had been out of the country and was experiencing symptoms , I should get tested .
She would call the COVID-19 testing clinic at the former &lt;a href= " https : **33;23187;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;H ? tel-Dieu hospital&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning and they would call me for an appointment .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I messaged Rupert to see if he had got over his cough , and went to bed .
I woke up early Thursday and was relieved to read his reply .
Not only had he fully recovered , but no one around him had caught it &amp;mdash ; not even his parents , whose home he and his sister had slept at on the day he dropped me at the airport .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , feeling increasingly overwhelmed by world events and the outside chance that we may have just unknowingly infected my septuagenarian in-laws with COVID-19 , we suggested they head back to Ottawa that day , instead of Friday .
It didn&amp;rsquo ; t take much convincing .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then we waited .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By Thursday afternoon , wondering if I had been forgotten , I called 811 , only to hear a message saying the line was &amp;ldquo ; unavailable .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Same thing Friday , and no luck getting through to the alternate 877 number that had been set up .
And still no call .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; By Saturday , we had pretty much given up hope .
After 15 days since my return , I was almost over my cough and my wife still hadn&amp;rsquo ; t caught it , so the odds appeared to be on our side .
Still .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And we were worried about her parents .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Finally , at 1:48 p .
, the call came .
I was told to go to the H&amp;ocirc ; tel-Dieu clinic on Sunday evening to be tested .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I write these lines on Monday afternoon , in limbo while awaiting the results , which could take from 24 hours to a few days .
Stay tuned for a follow-up column detailing the testing process , and to find out , along with me , whether I merely had a close call or I have become Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s latest case of COVID-19 .

NewsFitness : Do you have what it takes to be an ultra-marathoner ? http : //montrealgazette .

Is their motivation based on a burning need to test themselves against the trifecta of challenges -- extreme distance , extreme temperature and extreme terrain ? Or is it an overgrown sense of adventure that takes them to the middle of the desert , the outer reaches of the Arctic , deep in the jungle or high in the mountains ? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To find out more about what makes ultra-marathoners tick , &lt;a href= " https : **33;23948;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;a team of Scottish and American researchers gathered information&lt;/a&gt; on 12 competitors ( nine men and three women ) in the 6633 Arctic Ultra , a 120-mile , three-day race through the Yukon where participants pull their food , clothes , sleeping bag and other supplies on a sled as they cross the Arctic Circle in sub-zero temperatures with bone-chilling wind .
The researchers&amp;rsquo ; objective was to document the injuries , sleep habits and mood of ultra-marathoners , thereby determining the degree of mental and physical toughness needed to compete .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Exploring the physiological and psychological fortitude of ultra-marathoners is no small task , given the difficulty and expense of collecting data in real time .
Combine that with the small pool of those who register in each event and the high percentage of those who don&amp;rsquo ; t finish , and it&amp;rsquo ; s no wonder there&amp;rsquo ; s very little that&amp;rsquo ; s known about the psyche of athletes for whom no challenge is too great .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Cynthia Fish , a 59-year-old Montrealer , knows first-hand what it takes to conquer great distances in weather and terrain that would scare most of us silly .
A veteran of 20 ultras , she has tackled the 6633 Arctic Ultra &amp;mdash ; billed as &amp;ldquo ; the world&amp;rsquo ; s most extreme ultra-marathon&amp;rdquo ; &amp;mdash ; twice .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Any mistake you make can be really dangerous , so your mind is constantly busy , &amp;rdquo ; she said of the 193-kilometre trek .
&amp;ldquo ; You also spend a lot of time doing body checks : knees , feet , hips &amp;mdash ; there isn&amp;rsquo ; t a piece of your body that doesn&amp;rsquo ; t hurt .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Turns out her experience is typical for ultra-marathoners .
Ten of the 12 Arctic race participants monitored by the researchers were injured ; eight reported multiple injuries .
Hip , back , knee and shin pain , scrapes , diarrhea , vomiting , blisters and frostbite were typical , with almost half the racers reporting that their injuries lasted multiple days .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The pain moves around the body , &amp;rdquo ; said Fish .
&amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s when it stays there for a long time that it becomes a problem .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Racers averaged four hours of sleep during the three-day race .
Fish says the lack of sleep was the toughest part , noting she got about six hours of shut-eye between the start and finish lines .
Fish counts on sleep to help her recover physically and mentally , which is why she finds ultra-marathons that have a 24-hour running clock more challenging than ones that suspend the race overnight .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As important as sleep is , mental toughness is the secret sauce of ultra-marathoners .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; While previous research has suggested that individual athletes should more adequately prepare sleep strategies in order to enhance their performance , &amp;rdquo ; the research team wrote , &amp;ldquo ; this study provides evidence that strategies improving mental toughness may be more pertinent , particularly as there are performance advantages with spending less time sleeping if it can be handled effectively .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Fish also suggests having confidence in your training is a huge advantage .
When the going gets tough , she knows her body is up to the challenge , which allows her to draw on her mental reserves to keep putting one foot in front of the other .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; If you second-guess your training and ability , you fail , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Also important is having the right gear for the right conditions , which in the case of the Arctic race means knowing how to dress for cold-weather exercise &amp;mdash ; something most Canadians have grown up learning .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; A lot of people show up ( to the race ) thinking that the cold is the problem , but it&amp;rsquo ; s the sweat that gets them in the end , &amp;rdquo ; Fish said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Clothes that are dampened by sweat during the day freeze when the sun goes down or the temperature drops .
The trick to staying dry is knowing which clothes to wear when , and changing on the fly .
Fish practised this repeatedly during winter training sessions .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For those who are well prepared , well dressed and well trained , crossing the finish line &amp;ldquo ; is all mental , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; You have to want to keep going and continually find reasons to keep going , &amp;rdquo ; Fish said of the mentality of a successful ultra-marathoner .
&amp;ldquo ; No one is super-fast in these races , so it&amp;rsquo ; s not exhaustion that causes people to quit .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Fish relies on patience and determination to see the race through to the end .
She also finds a type of serenity during an ultra event , which helps her navigate the tough parts of the course .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s rare that you get that much quality time with absolutely no responsibilities , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
&amp;ldquo ; That&amp;rsquo ; s the pleasure for me .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Said like a born ultra-marathoner .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; This was supposed to be a breakthrough spring tour in Europe and North America for Montreal-based underground electronic music duo Pelada .
Instead , Tobias Rochman and Chris Vargas are stuck in a Brussels hotel , watching show after show get cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Major music festivals such as Coachella in California and &lt;a href= " http : **34;24420;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;South by Southwest ( SXSW ) in Texas&lt;/a&gt; have been postponed or cancelled , depriving already financially precarious artists dependent on touring the ability to make ends meet .
On Thursday , Montreal &lt;a href= " https : **33;24456;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;promoter Evenko suspended all shows with 250 or more people&lt;/a&gt; for the next 30 days based on measures put in place by the provincial government .
The Orchestre symphonique de Montr&amp;eacute ; al ( OSM ) cancelled 11 concerts until April 5 , and their appearance with Kent Nagano at Carnegie Hall in New York March 24 will no longer happen .
Popular Montreal indie band Wolf Parade scrapped its upcoming European tour .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While major concert promoters and venues are feeling the effects , for many smaller local artists the inability to tour can be career-threatening .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; After six years as a group , this would have been our first profitable tour , &amp;rdquo ; Rochman said Thursday via Skype from Brussels , where they had unexpectedly camped the last three days .
&amp;ldquo ; This was our first time working with a more professional agency out of the U .
We were looking forward to this tour as the first major one after being signed and putting out our record .
The shows we&amp;rsquo ; re playing are of a higher profile , with better pay .
We&amp;rsquo ; ve been planning for this tour for more than a year .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pelada , who released the critically acclaimed Movimiento Para Cambio in October , were supposed to start the 15-date first leg of their European tour in Italy .
That show was cancelled , as was their weekend show in Russia , which required they pay for a work visa upfront .
They ended up in Brussels and were due to make their way Friday to Switzerland .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With their shows not going as planned and those expected guarantees &amp;mdash ; normally paid out after the show &amp;mdash ; gone , even an extra $140 for a hotel stay in Belgium can be a financial strain .
Flights , trains and buses are other costs bands pay for in advance , and being able to exchange them for a later date isn&amp;rsquo ; t always a help .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Before we came , we applied for P-2 visa work permits for the United States because while we were gone , we needed it to process before our show April 17 at UCLA , &amp;rdquo ; said Vargas .
&amp;ldquo ; That was around $2,000 we needed to make sure that was processed while we were here .
And it&amp;rsquo ; s not even a guarantee we get the visa .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Added Rochman : &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; d be fine going home , but we don&amp;rsquo ; t even have the means to do that .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The band was set to play high-profile festivals like Primavera in Spain and Rewire in the Netherlands .
With a touring itinerary set to last through the summer , Rochman and Vargas left their day jobs to pursue music full-time .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; When you&amp;rsquo ; re living right on the threshold of profitability , it can be very dangerous , &amp;rdquo ; said Rochman .
&amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re in the gig economy , and the reality of seeing that bubble burst is devastating .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Micha&amp;euml ; l Bardier books and manages local and international artists with his Montreal company Heavy Trip .
He estimates he&amp;rsquo ; s lost $250,000 in guarantees for his acts so far , in addition to flights and other costs .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Honestly , the company has been in a good position lately .
We&amp;rsquo ; ve been booking bigger tours in the U .
and Europe , &amp;rdquo ; Bardier said .
&amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re not going to put the key in the door , but for sure , this is rough .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; An added problem for Bardier and many others is bands route their tours around major North American festivals in the spring such as SXSW , Big Ears in Nashville and Mission Creek Festival in Iowa .
All three have been cancelled .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Honestly , it&amp;rsquo ; s just really bad timing because last year around this time , I really determined March and April to be a really good period for international , experimental , world and jazz to tour in North America , so I really gave everything I had to route these tours , &amp;rdquo ; Bardier said .
Right now everyone is scrambling to move their dates to the fall , when things will presumably be better .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One artist set to play SXSW was Montreal rapper Naya Ali .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s actually been a long time dream of mine to attend , let alone perform at SXSW .
It would have been a solid foot in door in the U .
market , &amp;rdquo ; Ali said .
&amp;ldquo ; However , I completely understand the seriousness of the situation and the measures that are being taken to protect all of our health .

" data-portal-copyright= " Dave Sidaway " **28;24714;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1742332 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; QUEBEC &amp;mdash ; Declaring Quebec in an emergency situation that requires decisive acts and sacrifices by all , the Legault government Thursday announced a series of tough , sweeping measures designed to curb the spread of the &lt;a href= " http : **34;24744;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;novel coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; before it gets out of hand .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And the orders could get more draconian &amp;mdash ; from closing schools and shopping malls to a generalized quarantine of the island of Montreal , Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s most populated city .
The province has the power to do it all if necessary and rules nothing out as it tries to keep the number of cases down .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; &lt;a href= " http : **34;24780;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;I am asking a lot&lt;/a&gt; , &amp;rdquo ; Premier Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Legault conceded at a news conference where the new measures were announced now that Quebec has 17 confirmed cases of the virus &amp;mdash ; thus far all travellers who came home with the virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We have a major challenge and if we want to succeed I need the help of all Quebecers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Today , Quebec must put itself on an emergency footing .
Our challenge in the coming weeks to contain the spread of the virus .
The coming weeks will be critical .
Our goal is slow the spread of the virus to the maximum .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Priority 1 is public health .
We have to protect ourselves and the best way to protect those we love is to protect ourselves .
I am calling on the solidarity of Quebecers , on the sense of responsibility of everyone .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Legault also warned Quebecers to brace for the long haul : months not weeks of disturbances in their lives .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The coming weeks will be critical in terms of the virus spreading .
But we have to be realistic .
We are facing a crisis that will last for months .
We must prepare .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Earlier , in the legislature , he said : &amp;ldquo ; The coming months are going to be very difficult , very difficult for our health network , very difficult for the Quebec economy .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The government plan &amp;mdash ; which was followed by a string of other cancellations and closings by cities and groups across Quebec &amp;mdash ; is stern stuff , but less harsh compared with acts taken by the rest of the planet .
Quebec , for example , has not closed public schools , while Ontario has &amp;mdash ; until April 5 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We are not asking that schools be closed at this time , &amp;rdquo ; Education Minister Jean-Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Roberge told reporters .
&amp;ldquo ; As the premier said , nothing is excluded at this time .
We are assessing the situation .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One reason the province is holding back is because there has not yet been a confirmed transmission on Quebec soil .
It will happen , warned Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s director of public health , Horacio Arruda , who sat at the premier&amp;rsquo ; s side .
It&amp;rsquo ; s just a matter of time .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec estimates between 30 and 70 per cent of the population could be affected by the virus , which Arruda noted is tougher to fight than the regular flu because humans have no antibodies to resist it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He added the very nature of the virus means strong measures are required immediately , even though the chance of getting it remains slim .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Actually , for Quebecers , if they have not travelled outside , the risk is not zero but almost zero , &amp;rdquo ; Arruda said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We are not in a crisis because we have not lost control of the situation , &amp;rdquo ; Arruda said .
&amp;ldquo ; What we want to do is prevent a crisis .
That&amp;rsquo ; s why we went with strong ( measures ) early .
All these things will reduce the risk of having a high curve ( of patients ) .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He warned public health laws also give him sweeping powers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s clear we will be violating the rights of individuals , but it is for the collective good and the good of people , &amp;rdquo ; said Arruda .
&amp;ldquo ; Our system requires the solidarity of everyone .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But for now , the measures announced are as follows : &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash ; Legault is asking anyone who has returned to Quebec from any part of the world or who has flu symptoms to &lt;a href= " http : **34;24816;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;self-isolate for 14 days&lt;/a&gt; to slow the spread of the coronavirus .
The measure is applicable as of Thursday , not retroactively .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash ; Health-care workers have no choice and are &lt;a href= " http : **34;24852;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;ordered to **25;24888;TOOLONG .
Public-sector workers who self-isolate will be paid , Legault said .
Quebec will announce a financial package for the private sector in the coming days , but workers who are able should try and work from home .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash ; The government will announce measures to help businesses who are affected by solvency issues at a later date .
&amp;ldquo ; We won&amp;rsquo ; t leave anyone behind , &amp;rdquo ; Legault said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash ; Organizers of indoor events that attract &lt;a href= " http : **34;24915;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;more than 250 people&lt;/a&gt; are ordered to cancel them for the next 30 days .
Any other events deemed not essential can also be cancelled .
Public schools will not be closed for the time being , but the government is ruling nothing out .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;mdash ; Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s Catholic bishops also announced all Saturday and Sunday masses were being cancelled and the National Assembly suspended all visits from the public , even though parliament itself is still operating .
Overnight , hand sanitizer dispensers were installed at strategic locations and media events staged with a distance between reporters and politicians .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; It all starts with the insidious symptoms , almost masking those of the seasonal flu .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You develop a dry cough and might run a fever .
In more severe cases , you find yourself suddenly with a shortness of breath .
What do you do ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The following is a Q and A , based on information gleaned from the websites of the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Quebec Health Ministry , along with statements from officials about the novel coronavirus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s also based on the assumption that for now , at least , there is no local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus , which causes what the World Health Organization has declared a full-fledged pandemic .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you develop flu symptoms , what do you do ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Call the government phone line ( 1-877-644-4545 ) to seek testing for COVID-19 .
Call the 811 Info-Sant&amp;eacute ; hotline if you want a nurse to go over symptoms with you over the phone .
If you have questions about the coronavirus , you are asked not to call 811 , but to call the general information health line : 1-877-644-4545 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Have you recently travelled abroad ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you have , you will be advised to visit one of the &lt;a href= " https : **33;26031;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;three COVID-19 screening clinics&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What if you have n't travelled abroad ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The 811 nurse will ask you whether you might have come into contact with someone who has travelled .
The nurse will also ask about whether you have any pre-existing medical conditions like heart disease , asthma , diabetes or cancer .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For the moment , Dr .
Horacio Arruda , Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s chief public health officer , has reiterated that there is no local transmission of the coronavirus .
However , authorities suspect that SARS-CoV-2 is probably already circulating in the community .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , authorities have not reported widespread community transmission yet .
When that occurs , the protocols will probably change .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Should the Info-Sant ? nurse book an appointment for you at the screening clinic at the old H ? tel-Dieu hospital at Pine Ave .
and St-Urbain St .
, what is likely to happen ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You will be assessed by a nurse and doctor .
A swab will be taken of your mouth and throat and sent for analysis by the &lt;span class= " st " &gt;Laboratoire de sant ? publique du Qu ? bec .
It should take less than 24 hours to get a result back .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the meantime , you will be presumed to have contracted COVID-19 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What if my symptoms at the clinic are severe ? What if I say I have difficulty breathing ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You will probably be transferred to the &lt;a href= " https : **33;26066;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Jewish General Hospital&lt;/a&gt; for treatment and isolation .
The Jewish General is one of four designated COVID-19 treatment centres in the province .
Ste-Justine Hospital has been designated for children and teens with COVID-19 .
The evidence to date suggests that the potentially lethal respiratory illness has mostly spared young people .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s also possible that if you have difficulty breathing when you first call 811 , you could be transported by ambulance to the Jewish General .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If my symptoms are not severe at the screening clinic , what can I then expect ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You will be advised to return home and to self-isolate pending the results of the COVID-19 test .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; At this time , there is no vaccine for COVID-19 or any natural health products that are authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19 , &amp;rdquo ; according to the &lt;a href= " https : **33;26101;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Public Health Agency of Canada&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Most people with mild coronavirus illness will recover on their own .
Your health care provider may recommend steps you can take to relieve symptoms .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The nurse at the screening clinic will hand you a kit with two pairs of gloves and two N-95 respirator masks , along with &lt;a href= " https : **33;26136;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;five pages of typed instructions&lt;/a&gt; to follow while at home .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What do those instructions say ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Do not go to school or work .
Do not visit a children&amp;rsquo ; s daycare or a long-term care centre .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Do not use public transit .
Postpone any non-urgent medical appointments .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Do not invite people to your home .
Stay alone in your home in the same room as often as possible .
Do not change rooms .
If possible , use a bathroom not frequented by anyone else .
This last instruction arises from preliminary research showing that the coronavirus spreads easiest within families .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Wear a mask whenever anyone else in your home is in the same room as you .
Use a paper tissue to cough , throw away the tissue afterward into a garbage container and then wash your hands .
If a paper tissue is not around , cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds .
Do not share plates , utensils , glasses and towels with any other family member .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;This is important : &lt;/strong&gt; Take your temperature at the same time every day and keep written track of the readings .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe src= " **40;26171;TOOLONG .
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What happens if your symptoms worsen while at home ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Contact the Info-Sant&amp;eacute ; 811 hotline if you have &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the following symptoms : fever , cough , shortness of breath , difficulty breathing , chest pain , severe diarrhea , you have vomited or suffer from unusual , severe fatigue .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And remember to tell the Info-Sant&amp;eacute ; nurse that you are under investigation for COVID-19 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Depending on your answers , the nurse could recommend that you go to a hospital on your own wearing a mask and using personal transport .
It&amp;rsquo ; s also possible that an ambulance might pick you up .
The hospital , in all probability the Jewish General , will be notified in advance of your arrival .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At any time , if your symptoms worsen , and you feel like your life is in danger , the health ministry says call 911 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What if my symptoms do not worsen ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Continue to stay at home until you recover .
To date , officials have advised people to self-isolate for 14 days .
It&amp;rsquo ; s possible you might have to stay at home longer .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What if I get stressed , become anxious or develop obsessive ideas that seem to take over my mind ? &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Call Info-Sant&amp;eacute ; and a psychosocial health professional will provide you with support and counselling depending on your needs .

" data-portal-copyright= " Jim Cole " **28;26905;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1741880 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lung cancer remains the No .
1 cancer killer in the country .
Every year , lung cancer kills &lt;a href= " https : **33;26935;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;far more&lt;/a&gt; women than breast cancer and far more men than prostate cancer .
Its five-year &lt;a href= " https : **33;26970;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt; is a depressingly low 19 per cent , compared to breast cancer ( 88 per cent ) or prostate cancer ( 93 per cent ) .
There is , however , something we can do to improve lung cancer outcomes .
The problem is we just don&amp;rsquo ; t do it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The key to reducing cancer deaths is effective screening .
Screening for cervical cancer ( with Pap tests ) and colorectal cancer ( with colonoscopies and now with FIT testing ) has led to dramatic reductions in both of these cancers .
The point is to catch a pre-cancerous lesion and remove it before it can transform into a more aggressive cancer and metastasize through the body .
Unfortunately , not all cancers are amenable to screening .
For example , screening for prostate cancer with &lt;a href= " https : **33;27005;TOOLONG .
is more complicated than it might seem .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Likewise , screening for lung cancer is not very easy .
Intuitively , you would think that X-rays should catch lung tumours early , when they are still small and easily removable .
But data from studies like the &lt;a href= " https : **33;27040;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;PLCO&lt;/a&gt; trial have shown that regular chest X-rays do not reduce lung cancer mortality .
In fact , most &lt;a href= " https : **33;27075;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend against using chest X-rays to screen for lung cancer because , apart from being largely ineffective , there are also significant downsides .
Cost and repeated radiation exposure are obvious negatives .
But the real danger associated with X-rays is that of over-diagnosis .
What can seem like a mass on an X-ray can turn out to be nothing after more scans and biopsies .
The rate of these false positives can be quite high .
In the &lt;a href= " https : **33;27110;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;National Lung Screening Trial , &lt;/a&gt; the false positive rate with annual X-rays was nearly 95 per cent .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The past few years have shown that CT scans may be a better option .
The National Lung Screening Trial compared low dose CT scans to standard X-rays and found that CT scans picked up more cancers and reduced lung cancer deaths from 309 to 247 deaths per 100,000 person-years .
While the rate of false positives was still high ( over 96 per cent ) , the mortality reduction convinced many people that screening with yearly CT scans was worth the effort .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Critics have pointed out that the reduction in mortality is relatively small , that the false-positive rate with CT scanning is still very high and that CT scans deliver even more radiation than X-rays .
But even if you account for the radiation delivered by CTs , you would still pick up &lt;a href= " https : **33;27145;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;108 lung cancers for every one cancer&lt;/a&gt; caused by the radiation .
In fact , simulation studies suggest that if everyone eligible for lung cancer screening got yearly CT scans , you prevent just over &lt;a href= " https : **33;27180;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;12,000 lung cancer deaths&lt;/a&gt; every year .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **33;27215;TOOLONG .
class= " s1 " &gt;Guidelines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class= " s1 " **36;27250;TOOLONG .
annual screening for three consecutive years with low-dose CT scans &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;for adults ages 55 to 74 ( U .
guidelines say 80 ) who have a history of heavy smoking and currently smoke , or quit less than 15 years ago .
Heavy smoking is usually defined as a smoking history of 30 pack-years ( one pack a day for 30 years , two packs a day for 15 years or three packs a day for 10 years ) .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Unfortunately , a U .
study found that &lt;a href= " https : **25;27288;TOOLONG : //www .
class= " s3 " &gt;seven out of eight **29;27315;TOOLONG who would qualify for lung cancer screening do not get it .
People have suggested that there is a bias against smokers , but I suspect most people are simply not aware of the guidelines .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Given how much attention we pay to breast cancer and prostate cancer screening , it is sometimes surprising we do not talk about lung cancer screening more , since lung cancer is actually more lethal .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;It would be good if people were aware of the guidelines and got screened if they meet the criteria .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class= " s2 " &gt;But&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt; it would be even better if they stopped smoking .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;Christopher Labos&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt; is a Montreal doctor and an associate with the McGill Office for Science and Society .
He also co-hosts a podcast called The Body of Evidence .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; As an increasing number of Canadians enter their middle and golden years , there&amp;rsquo ; s less talk of finding the fountain of youth and more discussion around &lt;a href= " https : **33;27636;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;positive aging&lt;/a&gt; .
This shift in thinking is a welcome change from trying to turn back the clock , moving toward the more attainable goal of maintaining a high quality of life into retirement .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s not just boomers and Gen Xers who are hoping to redefine what it means to age .
Governments and municipalities understand that a healthy community of older adults puts less strain on public resources , which means they have a vested interest in keeping their aging citizens active and healthy .
And given that First World millennials and the generations that follow are expected to live to 100 , it&amp;rsquo ; s more important than ever to pursue a lifestyle devoted to healthy aging .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Philip Pizzo from the departments of pediatrics and microbiology/immunology at Stanford University penned &lt;a href= " https : **33;27671;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;an editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; titled A Prescription for Longevity in the 21st Century .
His goal isn&amp;rsquo ; t just to add years to one&amp;rsquo ; s life , but to make the later decades of life &amp;ldquo ; more meaningful and functional and less attenuated to the morbidities that lead to medical , social and financial dependency .
&amp;rdquo ; In other words , he&amp;rsquo ; s touting the benefits of maintaining a healthy body , social life and bank account as the decades add up .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It seems obvious that Pizzo&amp;rsquo ; s prescription for longevity is directed at those in their middle years and beyond , but investing in longevity early will increase the odds of reaping the rewards from living a vibrant and purposeful life .
So don&amp;rsquo ; t wait until retirement looms to pursue the following life goals &amp;mdash ; it&amp;rsquo ; s never too early to embrace positive aging .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Keep learning&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Individuals with a university education have a greater life expectancy than those without .
Low levels of education often result in lower income ; according to American data , this results in a greater tendency toward declining physical and mental health , as well as an increase in unemployment .
Statistics suggest a 15-year difference in life expectancy between the richest and poorest Americans .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Urging the youngest generations to stay in school has been a common refrain , but catching up on missed education and the opportunities it offers never gets old .
Lifelong learning isn&amp;rsquo ; t just a stepping stone to good fiscal health &amp;mdash ; it&amp;rsquo ; s an important investment in living longer .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Live life with purpose&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Having a purpose beyond oneself &amp;mdash ; like caring for others , improving the world around you , sharing your expertise , getting involved in community groups and following a spiritual path &amp;mdash ; translates into a longer life , according to studies of the young and old .
Starting each day with a sense of purpose and a commitment to contributing to society is like a daily dose of medicine .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With age comes more time to give of yourself , so the idea of creating opportunities for senior members of the community to share their experience and knowledge benefits society as a whole .
While retirement is often viewed as the end of your value , it&amp;rsquo ; s actually an opportunity to give more to society than you get back .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Keep your friends close&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Social connection is associated with a 50 per cent boost in survival .
Loneliness , on the other hand , can lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke .
To put it more simply , &lt;a href= " https : **33;27706;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;having friends is good for your health&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Prioritizing relationships and staying engaged with family , friends , neighbours and co-workers is key to maintaining a high level of connectedness .
Yet there are plenty of times when isolation is common , including changing schools , jobs or cities ; separation from a spouse , partner or other family members ; and retirement .
Maintaining varied social networks allows for support during periods of change and reduces the risk of isolation .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Adopt a healthy lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s well known that exercising regularly , getting enough sleep and eating nutritious food improves health , well-being and longevity .
What&amp;rsquo ; s less understood is that adopting a healthy lifestyle is one of the only proven ways to reduce genetic risk factors like heart disease , obesity and mental illness .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Building healthy habits early also means enjoying the resulting energy , strength and positive mood on either side of middle age .
But the real payback comes during those years when age begins to whittle away at the physical and mental competencies we take for granted in youth .
Putting a priority on exercising , eating well and getting enough sleep slows down the physical decline , and is good for both mind and body .

" data-portal-copyright= " John Kenney " **28;28191;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1738767 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; At first glance , it looked like the two women were performing an elaborate Irish dance ritual at the downtown bar , perhaps in anticipation of their Riverdance moment .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was quite fetching .
They approached one another almost ballet-like , bodies upright before bending down in perfect unison .
Then they stood up erect again .
Their arms bent and firmly tucked into their sides , each next slowly lifted a foot and , ever so gently , did a quick boot tap together .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quite the performance , and so exquisitely choreographed as well .
A few observers felt inclined to applaud .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Curious , I asked about the nature of this impromptu recital .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; No recital , &amp;rdquo ; said one .
&amp;ldquo ; A salutation , &amp;rdquo ; said the other .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whaat ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Say bye-bye to the two-cheek kiss and the fist bump .
And forget about the handshake &amp;mdash ; that&amp;rsquo ; s ancient history these days .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Say hey to the foot pump now .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And say hey to the new reality in our present fearful times .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; I have since seen foot-pump &amp;mdash ; shoe-tap , for the more genteel among us &amp;mdash ; exchanges elsewhere in town .
It is , in fact , a trend that has been sweeping other parts of the planet of late .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Certainly , life is changing fast in Montreal , in what was once among the most touchy-feely spots on the continent .
Credit coronavirus angst for this extreme penchant for personal cleanliness .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Naively , I asked one of the women why they couldn&amp;rsquo ; t exchange elbow pumps .
I should have guessed what kind of response I would get .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Because we sneeze into our elbows , silly , &amp;rdquo ; one explained .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Of course .
My bad .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As someone who spends considerable time pounding hardly antiseptic city pavement , I didn&amp;rsquo ; t have the heart to tell the women they had best wipe down their boots &amp;mdash ; and their hands &amp;mdash ; with disinfectant following a day of foot pumps .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It had to be a first this week when Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann declared that citizens should back off two-cheek kisses , especially to the elderly and those prone to picking up viruses .
For the time being , anyway .
In lieu of handshakes and elbow , fist or foot pumps , McCann suggested simply blowing kisses to people .
Sensible advice &amp;mdash ; as long as one doesn&amp;rsquo ; t blow too hard and inadvertently transmit nasty stuff in one&amp;rsquo ; s breath to others .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not to detract from the importance of personal hygiene these days , but where does it all end ? HAZMAT suits for all ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Some of us can recall our parents telling us to play outside in the dirt in order for us to build up our immune systems .
Were they trying to kill us ? OK , maybe in my case , because , in fairness , I was trouble as a tyke .
But not the rest of you .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s scary now .
Particularly because so many people are so freaked out .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The upshot is that manufacturers of hand sanitizers and face masks are among the few that are profiting these days .
Supermarket shelves are quickly emptying as panicked consumers hoard supplies .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Schools are being closed in parts of the world .
Vacations are being cancelled .
Cruise lines are singing the blues .
Baseball , basketball , soccer and sumo events abroad are being played out in arenas and stadiums that have been closed to the cheering hordes .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How much longer will it be until sporting events on this continent follow suit ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They&amp;rsquo ; ve even postponed the premi&amp;egrave ; re of the latest James Bond flick , No Time to Die , from April to November because of a presumed worldwide fear of assembling in multiplexes .
Hell , James Bond is supposed to save us all from nefarious germs , humanoids or otherwise ! What kind of message is this sending when we put our superheroes on hold ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Environmentally aware java lovers are understandably miffed with a new edict that has come down from Starbucks command-central .
The coffee chain has announced that customers are being temporarily barred from bringing their own personal mugs to its North American stores &amp;ldquo ; to help prevent the spread of coronavirus .
&amp;rdquo ; Instead , patrons will have to make do with paper cups for a spell .
However , the company will offer its 10-cent discount to customers who come in with their own mugs &amp;mdash ; even though they won&amp;rsquo ; t be able to use them .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even the politically incorrect are holding back .
Weird Al Yankovic now refuses to perform My Corona , despite the fact his parody of The Knack hit My Sharona would really go viral .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But no worries about one of my fave concert venues , the Corona Theatre .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s just a name , &amp;rdquo ; Evenko&amp;rsquo ; s Philip Vanden Brande says .
&amp;ldquo ; The theatre has been around a lot longer than the virus .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Vanden Brande notes that Evenko is monitoring the coronavirus situation closely , as it affects its venues like the Bell Centre and Corona , among others .
Should the situation evolve , Evenko will follow the advice of the minister of health and social services .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The health and safety of our fans are our highest priorities and we will implement all necessary safety measures as required , &amp;rdquo ; Vanden Brande says .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the interim , perhaps many would do well to chill a little and kick back with a Corona brew .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And pay no heed to a recent , misleading PR poll of 737 American beer drinkers that reported that 38 per cent wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t purchase the Mexican suds .
It wasn&amp;rsquo ; t the coronavirus dictating their decision , but merely the fact they preferred other beers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Actually , only four per cent of the deep thinkers polled equated Corona with coronavirus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Phew .
There may be some hope for humanity after all .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To combat the spread of the novel coronavirus , the coffee chain is not accepting reusable cups .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s a coronavirus thing , &amp;rdquo ; a barista at a Little Burgundy outlet told a customer on Thursday morning .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The coffee chain is also ramping up regular cleaning practices across all stores , modifying or postponing large meetings and providing info to employees on how to respond to suspected cases of the virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Starbucks has long offered a 10-cent discount to customers who bring their own reusable mugs or ask to use an in-store mug as part of a sustainability initiative .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The company says it will still offer the discount to customers who ask to use their reusable cup , or to use an in-store mug .

target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **25;29318;TOOLONG spread .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; John Brownstein , the chief innovation officer at Boston Children&amp;rsquo ; s Hospital and a Harvard professor , is a founder , creator and head of the hospital&amp;rsquo ; s &lt;a href= " https : //healthmap .
" target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;HealthMap&lt;/a&gt; AI team , which was the first to alert the public , outside China , about some then-unidentified pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan on Dec .
The team then alerted the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to the situation , and now the whole world is abundantly aware .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; ( Full disclosure : John Brownstein is my way , way smarter yet most affable and unassuming nephew , who has been a guest on myriad U .
TV talk shows and interviewed in newspapers across the continent .
) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nor does the coronavirus mark the first time Brownstein&amp;rsquo ; s HealthMap team has delved into deadly viruses .
Since its creation in 2006 , it has dealt with everything from the avian and swine flu to MERS and Ebola .

&amp;ldquo ; But it&amp;rsquo ; s the impact of the coronavirus on the elderly and those who are medically compromised that is of great concern .
All the same , I wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t call this a pandemic just yet .
We would still have to wait a few months to make that kind of determination .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Though some in the field have upped the mortality rate to three per cent of those with the virus , he cautions not to jump to conclusions .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We really have to be careful about the numbers we&amp;rsquo ; re putting out now .
The situation is incredibly fluid at the moment .
It depends on the underlying context , the capacity of the health system and the ability to differentiate between harsher and milder cases .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What makes the coronavirus so complex to comprehend is that so much remains unknown about it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We&amp;rsquo ; re still trying to understand the very features of the virus , how it is transmitted and spread , and whether or not it is symptomatic , &amp;rdquo ; he says .
&amp;ldquo ; The challenge is the transmission is very hard to control .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He predicts a vaccine will become available , but , unfortunately , not soon enough to stop the spread .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Unlike most other major viral outbreaks , the coronavirus has created panic and paranoia in some parts of North America , largely because it&amp;rsquo ; s in the news 24/7 .
Many are scooping up &lt;a href= " https : //wp .
" target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;face masks ( which are n't deemed to be very helpful ) &lt;/a&gt; and hand sanitizers , emptying store shelves and hoarding food supplies , and avoiding crowds and restaurants &amp;mdash ; &lt;a href= " https : **33;29417;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;specifically Chinese eateries&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The resultant hysteria has been linked to disinformation coming from uninformed sources on the internet .
The HealthMap automated system is based on credible online news and social media reports as well as first-hand information from the field .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There is just so much content and confusion out there .
We take all the credible data we have in our computer system in order to make a more accurate analysis of the situation .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Curiously , while his base of operations is Boston Children&amp;rsquo ; s Hospital , the coronavirus has had the least impact on kids , whose immune systems are often more ready for combat .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Our scope is essentially all ages .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Unlike some who have speculated that the coronavirus will disappear with the advent of warmer weather , he is not so optimistic , suggesting that , on some levels , it&amp;rsquo ; s not unlike a flu or cold that can strike any time .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; That&amp;rsquo ; s not really a hypothesis we can support right now .
It&amp;rsquo ; s really about exercising caution .
Certainly , it&amp;rsquo ; s always helpful to have supplies at home , and it can&amp;rsquo ; t be stated enough the importance of washing our hands .
But , honestly , I really believe we will get through this .

The idea is to create both a more humane living environment for this vulnerable group and a convivial working space for the staff who offers care and services .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec Minister responsible for the Montr&amp;eacute ; al region Chantal Rouleau made the announcement on behalf of Quebec Minister responsible for Seniors and Informal Caregivers Marguerite Blais at the Lakeshore General Hospital in Pointe-Claire , Tuesday .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The need is immense for this kind of care , &amp;rdquo ; Rouleau said .
&amp;ldquo ; We are responding with concrete measures .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Described as &amp;ldquo ; alternative housing&amp;rdquo ; , the six-unit construction will house 72 aging adults with special needs .
The project will be built at 825 Dawson Ave .
, on land adjacent to the Batshaw Youth and Family Centre campus in Dorval .
The bilingual facility will have a staff of around 100 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rouleau said the idea is to offer a more sensitive approach to long-term care , to create a facility that feels like a home .
Each resident will have a room with a private bathroom and there will be an emphasis on keeping the population active , both&amp;nbsp ; indoors and outdoors .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; m happy that a facility is being built that respects the dignity of the aging population , &amp;rdquo ; said Liberal MNA for Marquette Enrico Ciccone .
Ciccone is the official opposition critic for sports , recreation and healthy living .
&amp;ldquo ; But with the shortage of manpower , especially in health care , my focus won&amp;rsquo ; t be on the brick and mortar .
It will be on the services being offered .

general director Lynne McVey said the project was great news for the West Island health authority , which serves a population of around 500,000 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There are 834 adults with special needs in our region and 144 of those adults are on a waiting list for special-needs housing , &amp;rdquo ; McVey said .
&amp;ldquo ; To be able to create a residence with a home-like environment for this vulnerable population is a wonderful gift from the government .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; McVey said the West Island CIUSSS had also received funding to subsidize families who want to offer foster care to adults with special needs .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The combination of the two ( initiatives ) works , &amp;rdquo ; McVey said .
&amp;ldquo ; Not all of the special-needs population has lost autonomy .
So they can be cared for in foster homes .
But when they begin to age , they need more help .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The budget for the Dorval project has yet to be determined , but will run somewhere between $35 and $50 million .
Rouleau said the goal is to have the facility up and running by 2022 .

" data-portal-copyright= " Justin Sullivan " **28;30383;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1736779 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; On World Obesity Day , March 4 , organizers hope people will reflect on how obesity and being overweight affects more than 1 .
billion adults and 380 million children .
According to the World Health Organization , deaths worldwide from obesity and being overweight are more common than deaths from being underweight .
Though there are still many questions to be answered about obesity and obesity treatment , one thing seems clear : obesity is a disease that parallels aging .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Children with obesity can develop hypertension , high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes .
These are conditions usually only seen in adults .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; People with obesity , on average , die about seven years earlier than those of normal weight .
We also know having obesity puts you at risk for many conditions and diseases , including Type 2 diabetes , impaired mobility , hypertension , sarcopenia , cardiovascular disease , cancer and Alzheimer&amp;rsquo ; s disease , all of which are also linked to aging .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hit the molecular level and the linkage looks even more intimate .
In both aging and obesity , there is greater free radical formation , energy-producing mitochondria in our muscles start to fail and inflammation becomes chronic .
The immune cells in our body that fight infections also weaken with both obesity and aging .
Even our DNA is affected with obesity .
The telomeres that protect our DNA have been found to be shorter with obesity to a degree that aging is accelerated by eight years .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But obesity is not just a condition that accelerates aging : obesity should be viewed as a disease that accelerates aging .
Obesity clearly changes the function of body systems resulting in adverse health outcomes , but there still is a debate over whether obesity is , in fact , a disease .
If you look at the definition of a disease , part of the controversy may surround the term &amp;ldquo ; normal functioning .
&amp;rdquo ; What is normal ? One could argue that weight gain and the eventual classification of obesity is a normal adaptation to energy surplus .
Here , some view obesity as arising from an unhealthy lifestyle , one that is fraught with too much food and too little exercise .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class= " cat-head short " **40;30413;TOOLONG .

Yes , you can be fat and fit , but that 's not the whole **26;30684;TOOLONG &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet , there is no question as to whether other diseases associated with lifestyle are in fact diseases .
There is no debate over whether cardiovascular disease , cancer or Type 2 diabetes are diseases , even though they have significant lifestyle components .
One might respond that these diseases do not only result from lifestyle choices , but our genes as well .
But genes have also been linked with the development of obesity .
After all , don&amp;rsquo ; t we all have that friend that can eat twice the amount of food than we do and stay thin as a toothpick ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many people think that those with obesity simply need to lose weight to be &amp;ldquo ; cured .
&amp;rdquo ; Is it really that simple ? With obesity , there are a number of changes that occur in our bodies that make it difficult to lose weight .
It is estimated that weight-loss treatment of obesity through lifestyle is successful in only 20 per cent of people .
Most who have kept off the weight will tell you that it is a lifelong struggle .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We would argue that aging and obesity are actually two sides of the same coin .
The fact that so many people are affected means we need to act faster to address obesity .
Understanding obesity as a disease of premature aging might be the spark we need , for example , by applying abundant research in aging to obesity in order to generate new solutions .
Accepting obesity as a disease that accelerates aging will allow us to shift our approach to understanding obesity and its treatment .
And that new framing might bring a new awareness of the urgency to act on such a serious health threat .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Public Health Ontario informed the airline at midday Sunday , according to an internal Air Transat memo dated Monday and signed by president Jean-Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Lemay .
The passenger flew from Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris to Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s Trudeau airport on Feb .

BusinessLocal NewsJoe Schwarcz : Does drinking milk increase breast cancer risk ? http : **35;31384;TOOLONG .

" alt= " Researchers from Loma Linda University concluded that even small amounts of milk , as little as one-third of a cup a day , can significantly raise the risk of breast cancer .
" data-portal-copyright= " Rob Carr " **28;31456;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1736088 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Is milk protective against breast cancer or does it cause it ? Depends on which study you read .
The latest volley in this battle was fired by researchers from Loma Linda University who concluded that even small amounts of milk , as little as one-third of a cup a day , can significantly raise the risk of breast cancer .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;This was not some haphazard study .
It involved following some 53,000 women who were initially free of breast cancer for eight years .
Food frequency questionnaires were filled out at the beginning of the study , and a smaller contingent also periodically filled out 24 hour recall questionnaires that seemed to validate that the whole cohort did not make major dietary changes over the trial period .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Eventually , 1,057 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed and the likelihood of diagnosis increased with increased milk consumption .
When the numbers were crunched , the researchers concluded that if 100 women who drink no milk would start drinking one-third of a cup a day , about 20 would eventually be diagnosed with cancer .
That is a worrisome statistic .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;The subjects were all Seventh Day Adventists , with a large subset consuming either no dairy or little dairy , thereby providing a significant group for comparison with the milk drinkers .
Soy products were also frequently consumed in this population and were not associated with breast cancer .
Substituting these for milk actually offered protection against the disease .
Cheese and yogurt were not associated with breast cancer .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;The researchers suggested several possible reasons why milk can increase the risk of the disease .
Since the lactating cows are usually pregnant , they secrete estrogen and progesterone in the milk and these may play a role in stimulating cell proliferation .
Milk also contains insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 ) , a protein that some studies have implicated as a possible stimulant of cancer cells .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;There is no question that this study was well done .
But -- and there is always a but , is n't there ? -- j&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;ust a few keystrokes can bring up other studies that also seem to be equally well done but come to the opposite conclusion .
In 2015 , Chinese researchers analyzed 22 prospective studies involving over 1 .
million subjects and five case-control studies with a total of 33,000 subjects and found that when the results were pooled , high and modest milk consumption significantly reduced the risk of breast cancer compared with low dairy consumption .
A possible rationale was a protective effect due to calcium .
Then in 2019 , another meta-analysis of case-control studies , published in the journal Medicine , found no association between milk consumption and breast cancer .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;So what do we make of these battling studies ? Basically , that nutritional research , even if well carried out , can not account for all confounders and rarely comes to a conclusion that ca n't be debated .
This is the case not only for dairy consumption , but for such things as artificial sweeteners , saturated fats , dietary supplements , processed meats and organic foods .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;In this instance , the study subjects were Seventh Day Adventists whose lifestyle is significantly different from the general population .
They eat a mostly plant-based diet , shun junk food and drink no alcohol .
Obesity is virtually unknown .
Since both alcohol consumption and obesity are associated with breast cancer , it is possible that elimination of these allows the milk connection to be revealed .
Also , the high milk consumers were likely to also eat more meat and fewer plant products .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Because of possible confounders , no observational study can prove cause and effect .
Still , the Loma Linda study does ring some alarm bells .
It certainly calls into question the wisdom of the common recommendation that consumers drink three glasses of milk a day .
It is also noteworthy that breast cancer rates in Japan have increased significantly with an increase in milk consumption since the Second World War .
Taking everything into account , the link between milk consumption and breast cancer can not be dismissed .

Treat those aching knees and hips with exercisehttp : **32;31641;TOOLONG .
&lt;img src= " https : **33;31675;TOOLONG .
title= " Evidence shows mind-body/flexibility exercises such as yoga are among the most effective at decreasing joint pain and improving joint function .
" alt= " Evidence shows mind-body/flexibility exercises such as yoga are among the most effective at decreasing joint pain and improving joint function .
" data-portal-copyright= " John Mahoney " **28;31710;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1731448 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you&amp;rsquo ; re of a certain age , you probably know all about the aches and pains of osteoarthritis .
A progressive disease found most often in the hips , knees , hands and spine , osteoarthritis is characterized by joint stiffness and pain caused by the breakdown of cartilage and bone in the joint .
Felt largely by the over-50 crowd , it&amp;rsquo ; s been linked to the wear and tear associated with living an active life .
Yet there&amp;rsquo ; s little science to suggest a lifelong love of exercise will lead to sore knees and hips .
In fact , exercise is considered a valuable part of any treatment plan designed to relieve pain and improve the function of affected joints .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As important as exercise is in managing osteoarthritis , there&amp;rsquo ; s no universal prescription guaranteed to make aching joints feel and move better .
So while it&amp;rsquo ; s clear that some exercise is better than no exercise , opinion varies as to whether hitting the pool , gym , track , bike or yoga mat is the best option .
Of course , that doesn&amp;rsquo ; t stop friends , neighbours , co-workers and even physicians from sharing their view on the type of exercise they feel will make the pain go away , including suggesting that you give up the activities you love in favour of those you don&amp;rsquo ; t .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Understanding that individual experiences shouldn&amp;rsquo ; t be mistaken for a universal truth , a team of researchers reviewed 103 published studies , featuring the results of 9,134 study subjects , on the effectiveness of different types of exercise on improving pain and function in osteoarthritic hips and knees .
The studies were separated into groups depending on the type of exercise used in the protocol &amp;mdash ; aerobic exercise ( swimming , running , cycling ) , strength training ( body weight or weight training exercises ) , mind-body/flexibility exercises ( yoga , Pilates ) and mixed exercise ( more than one type performed in a single workout ) &amp;mdash ; and evaluated on how effective they were in reducing pain and improving function and quality of life .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Assessing benchmarks from the start of a regular exercise routine to eight weeks later , all of the exercise protocols demonstrated a positive effect on joint function and pain compared to the non-exercise controls .
But when comparing one type of exercise to another , aerobic exercise and mind-body exercise proved the most effective at decreasing joint pain and improving joint function .
Less effective was strength training , with mixed exercise providing the least amount of positive benefit .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Why do some types of exercise work better than others at making knees and hips feel 10 years younger ? The researchers have a hunch .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear , the effect of both aerobic and mind-body exercise may be attributable to the potential of these exercises to influence altered central elements such as central pain sensitization , sleep disturbance and mood disorders , &amp;rdquo ; they said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Whether there&amp;rsquo ; s enough science to rule out any one type of exercise from the spectrum of options prescribed to reduce osteoarthritis pain is questionable .
But what&amp;rsquo ; s interesting about this review is the lack of effectiveness of mixed exercise .
Given the limited amount of detail regarding the mixed exercise routines included in the studies , it&amp;rsquo ; s difficult to state unequivocally that workouts like &lt;a href= " https : **33;31740;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;HIIT ( high-intensity interval training ) &lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href= " https : **33;31775;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;CrossFit&lt;/a&gt; are ineffective at making osteoarthritic joints move and feel better .
Combined with the fact that exercise adherence is linked to exercise enjoyment , giving up your favourite mixed routine in favour of aerobic or mind-body options isn&amp;rsquo ; t necessary .
But if you&amp;rsquo ; re unhappy with the results of your workout , adding a few more aerobic workouts or yoga classes to your routine might be worth the effort .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On the plus side , it&amp;rsquo ; s clear that staying physically active improves joint health .
That&amp;rsquo ; s great news for exercise junkies who have been told to rest their aching joints , or for those who have been advised to give up their favourite aerobic activity in favour of something less stressful on the joints .
Still , you need to pay attention to your body and what makes exercise tick for you , even in the face of growing evidence that some types of exercise are better for your aching joints than others .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you&amp;rsquo ; re always sore after an aerobic workout , try yoga .
If yoga or strength training makes your joints ache , hop on a bike .
Ideally , your preferred exercise routine dulls joint pain and improves joint function , which means greater range of motion and less stiffness in the morning .
Given that all forms of exercise are osteoarthritis-friendly when compared to no exercise at all , there&amp;rsquo ; s no shortage of options .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One final caveat : give your joints time to get used to a new form of exercise before discarding it as ineffective .
Sometimes a little discomfort arrives ahead of relief , so be patient .
That said , pain is different than discomfort , so don&amp;rsquo ; t ignore your body&amp;rsquo ; s red flags .
The end goal is not only finding an exercise routine that helps your joints move more and hurt less , but one you&amp;rsquo ; ll stick with for more than eight weeks .

Yves Jalbert , deputy head of the provincial public health protection agency , told reporters by phone from Quebec City during the same news conference .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The detection of this case shows that our system is efficient , it&amp;rsquo ; s reliable and our treatment protocols are well established , &amp;rdquo ; McCann said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Results of tests done Tuesday came back Thursday , Jalbert said .
Another analysis of the samples now needs to be performed at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for official confirmation , McCann said .
Results of that analysis will be known Sunday .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We have been very vigilant as a government , &amp;rdquo ; McCann said .
&amp;ldquo ; We have been investigating many people .
The system has worked very well .
So I want to say to the population that we are ready , the network is ready .
All the measures that are necessary to really protect the population , protect the workers and take care of the patients are there .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Added McCann : &amp;ldquo ; There is no cause for concern .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; McCann reiterated that four Quebec hospitals will be used to treat infected patients who need to be admitted .
They are the Jewish General and Ste-Justine&amp;rsquo ; s in Montreal , the Centre hospitalier de l&amp;rsquo ; Universit&amp;eacute ; Laval and the Quebec Heart and Lung Institute in Quebec City .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The days of children being seen but not heard are over , if they indeed ever existed .
Here are a few tips to help ensure an office visit turns out OK .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; No one likes surprises , least of all your child and your boss .
Speak to them both beforehand , discussing expectations , rules and an exit plan .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; Bring lots of books , but if you have a pre-reader , think about how much time you&amp;rsquo ; ll have to read One Fish Two Fish over and over .
If ever there was a &lt;a href= " http : **34;34378;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;time and place for a screen&lt;/a&gt; , this might be it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; Find out if anyone else at the office is having the same problem .
Arrange to sit your kids near each other and to share duties checking in on them .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; Do not let kids mess with anyone else&amp;rsquo ; s workspace .
It&amp;rsquo ; s fun to check out the pictures of Peter&amp;rsquo ; s kids and the dinosaurs on Anne&amp;rsquo ; s desk , but don&amp;rsquo ; t touch .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; Give your kid a job .
They&amp;rsquo ; ll be happier , at least for a few minutes , to be mirroring what you&amp;rsquo ; re doing .
Younger kids can jab away at a spare keyboard ; older kids might be put to use filing or alphabetizing .
Short assignments will help the day go by more quickly .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; If they have a meltdown &amp;mdash ; and who doesn&amp;rsquo ; t have an office meltdown now and again ? &amp;mdash ; see Point 1 re : exit plan .
Even if your family rules dictate not responding to tantrums , take it into the hallway , bathroom or outside as fast as possible .
Your colleagues ( especially the ones who aren&amp;rsquo ; t parents ) will appreciate it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;bull ; Stay calm .
It&amp;rsquo ; s not easy for the kid either .
Check in with them often .

" data-portal-copyright= " Joe Raedle " **28;35218;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1730297 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; It probably won&amp;rsquo ; t be the coronavirus that does us in as a species .
It probably won&amp;rsquo ; t be Ebola , either .
If there&amp;rsquo ; s one infectious disease issue that we need to worry about , it&amp;rsquo ; s &lt;a href= " https : **33;35248;TOOLONG .
resistance .
&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s a growing problem and it&amp;rsquo ; s happening because we prescribe too many antibiotics .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Antibiotic resistance is listed by the World Health Organization as one of the &lt;a href= " https : **33;35283;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;top 10 threats to global health , &lt;/a&gt; and with good reason .
Antibiotics have prevented untold numbers of deaths since penicillin was first used clinically in the 1940s .
Penicillin use during the Second World War saved many soldiers from a battlefield death caused by infected wounds .
But with time and use , bacteria become resistant to existing antibiotics , which then forces medical researchers to develop new antibiotics to replace them .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While investing in research to produce new antibiotics is always going to be necessary , we can slow the process of resistance down considerably by limiting the amount of antibiotics we prescribe .
This idea , called antibiotic stewardship , is becoming increasingly important .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Unfortunately , we appear to be prescribing antibiotics at high volumes and often for no good reason .
A recent paper in the &lt;a href= " https : **33;35318;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt; analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey .
Of the 991 million doctor&amp;rsquo ; s office visits that occurred in the United States in 2015 , about 130 million resulted in an antibiotic prescription .
What was worrisome in their analysis is that only around half ( 57 per cent ) of antibiotic prescriptions had an appropriate reason for the prescription documented in the patient&amp;rsquo ; s chart .
The remaining 43 per cent either had no reason documented or were given antibiotics for inappropriate indications like for the common cold .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When we talk about overprescribing antibiotics , we typically think of antibiotics being handed out to children with mild viral illness .
On average , children have between &lt;a href= " https : **33;35353;TOOLONG .
and seven colds per year&lt;/a&gt; and a common refrain is that physicians and parents should not turn to antibiotics for the common cold , which is after all a viral illness that will not respond to antibiotics .
And yet this research shows that adults , particularly adult males , were more likely to get antibiotics than children , which runs counter to the usual assumptions .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Another big factor in whether patients got inappropriate antibiotics or not was whether patients were seeing their regular GP or some other physician .
Patients who saw their regular GP were much less likely to get antibiotics .
Presumably , if you go see a doctor who is unfamiliar with your medical history they would be more likely to prescribe antibiotics just to &amp;ldquo ; be safe .
&amp;rdquo ; And while this might be understandable , it is clearly sub-optimal .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These types of studies are important because we need to identify factors that lead to unnecessary antibiotics .
One of the biggest hurdles has thankfully already been addressed .
For many years , low-dose antibiotics were given to livestock as a growth supplement and were available over the counter without a prescription .
In fact , some estimates suggested that about &lt;a href= " https : **33;35388;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;80 per cent of the antibiotics we use&lt;/a&gt; were actually used in animals , not in people .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This changed in December 2018 , when &lt;a href= " https : **33;35423;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;new rules&lt;/a&gt; were put into effect restricting the sales of antibiotics for animals unless you had a prescription from a vet .
So while you could still get antibiotics for your livestock if they were sick , the days of feeding animals antibiotics to make them grow faster are essentially over .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Reducing antibiotic use is an important ( but not the only ) part of combating antibiotic resistance .
If nearly half of the antibiotics we prescribe and take are unjustified , then we have a lot of room for improvement .
We have taken significant steps in Canada to limit unnecessary antibiotic use in animals .
Now we just need to do it in people .

Snow-removal fury ? Smiling Philippe Sabourin is here to helphttp : **36;35793;TOOLONG .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; Why is this man always smiling ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; He spends much of his days and nights often getting peppered by the press about slow snow removal and slippery streets and sidewalks sometimes perceived to be less pristine than bike paths .
Not to mention criticism about rampant street construction , broken water pipes , mobility or lack thereof , recycling , composting and , natch , the ever-ongoing Mountain road imbroglio .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Such is the life of city of Montreal spokesperson Philippe Sabourin .
He is on the front line &amp;mdash ; some might even say the firing line &amp;mdash ; in seeking to explain city-hall decisions that some find confounding .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sabourin awakes around 4:30 a .
to see what&amp;rsquo ; s up or down in the city .
He can often be heard on radio at 6 a .
and then on the tube throughout the day .
He can be counted on to send text messages to media up until late at night .
In short , he&amp;rsquo ; s always available .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a job that could give most ulcers .
Not Sabourin .
He relishes it all .
He&amp;rsquo ; s not just a glass-half-full fellow &amp;mdash ; his mug overflows .
I suspect he may even whistle while he works .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s no stress here for me .
I honestly love what I do , and so I remain positive all the time , &amp;rdquo ; says the ever-affable Sabourin , 47 , &amp;nbsp ; who became the city&amp;rsquo ; s spokesperson three years ago .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; m confident because I feel I have the information to understand the situation and make citizens more aware of the challenges we face .
And they are more willing to accept the situation , even if it&amp;rsquo ; s difficult .
They understand there&amp;rsquo ; s no way we can get rid of two-metre-high snowbanks in just a few days .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The stats appear to support Sabourin&amp;rsquo ; s assertion .
Despite frequent media outrage over these issues &amp;mdash ; &lt;a href= " https : **33;35932;TOOLONG .
plead guilty here&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash ; citizen complaints have dropped .
Between Nov .
1 and Feb .
10 , the city received 397 from the 19 boroughs .
That&amp;rsquo ; s down considerably from last year&amp;rsquo ; s 707 complaints over the same period .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sabourin is taking me and Montreal Gazette photographer Allen McInnis on a drive through the city to check out key operational posts on the snow-battle front .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Since Feb .
6 , Montreal has received about 60 centimetres of snow and , as of Sunday , the cleanup was 95 per cent completed .
Sabourin estimates the job will be finished by Monday &amp;mdash ; unless another storm strikes .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But even on a relatively calm day , Sabourin is having to deal with complaints from LaSalle residents about unplowed sidewalks and from irate city motorists who&amp;rsquo ; ve been issued tickets on streets after they&amp;rsquo ; ve been cleaned , but with the No Parking signs still erroneously in place .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the first instance , the problem relates to massive amounts of snow removed from homes and driveways , thus requiring heavier artillery to clear sidewalks .
And while sympathetic to the plight of wrongly ticketed motorists , Sabourin notes this is more a police issue .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then there&amp;rsquo ; s the reality of some boroughs being faster than others in removal operations .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s like we&amp;rsquo ; re running a marathon here .
It doesn&amp;rsquo ; t always matter who is fastest , but more that we all get to the finish line in good time .
Often , we have to work on steeper hills first , as is the case in the Ville-Marie borough .
In &amp;Icirc ; le-Bizard , it&amp;rsquo ; s fast , because they don&amp;rsquo ; t have to transport the snow .
They can blow it on the side .
But in C&amp;ocirc ; te-des-Neiges , they have to load the snow at night , because there&amp;rsquo ; s so much traffic during the day and they&amp;rsquo ; re so far away from the land dump sites .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; What has to be considered is the geographic situation of each borough in relation to the dump sites and the density of the population .
Each borough has to figure out the best strategy .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sabourin disputes a conspiracy theory about bike paths receiving priority treatment .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The point is we use different tools and machinery for the streets , sidewalks and bike paths .
They all start working around the same time but there&amp;rsquo ; s certainly no bike-path priority .
We try to do sidewalks first to ensure pedestrian safety .
We realize it&amp;rsquo ; s not perfect , but we are trying .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The city is a network of 10,000 kilometres , 6,000 of which are sidewalks and only 700 of which are bike paths .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; That&amp;rsquo ; s the equivalent of the distance between Montreal and James Bay , &amp;rdquo ; Sabourin says .
&amp;ldquo ; That&amp;rsquo ; s our challenge , and clearing it is like a military operation .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That would make executive committee member and Verdun mayor Jean-Fran&amp;ccedil ; ois Parenteau the general .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Over 3,000 workers are involved in this operation .
The cost is equally enormous , about $1 million per every cleared centimetre of snowfall , according to Sabourin .
While we&amp;rsquo ; ve already received close to the seasonal average of 190 centimetres , only 120 centimetres has had to be cleared away .
The rest has melted on its own .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The snow-removal budget this winter is about $180 million , but should we get blasted again , there&amp;rsquo ; s still plenty of capacity left to accommodate it at the city&amp;rsquo ; s 12 land and 16 sewer dump sites , which together can handle up to 18 million cubic metres of snow .

" data-portal-copyright= " Allen McInnis " **28;36002;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1723972 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; On the subject of sewer sites , we visit one under the Jacques-Cartier Bridge .
During the height of snow-removal operations , 100 trucks an hour , 24/7 , drop off their loads here .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sabourin explains that the sewer sites save a lot of time , especially in the downtown area , where trucks don&amp;rsquo ; t have to haul snow at land sites farther away .
He also is quick to point out that the dumped snow goes through a water treatment process before being moved into the St-Lawrence River .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; In the old days , the snow , which can contain salt and grease , went straight into the river , without regard to the environment , &amp;rdquo ; Sabourin says .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We also visit &amp;ldquo ; command central , &amp;rdquo ; a small office in an Old Montreal highrise .
Staff here monitors road conditions on 550 closed-circuit cameras throughout the city .
Based on their surveillance , they are able to direct crews from affected boroughs to trouble spots .
They also control traffic lights , in case of emergencies .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The worst scenario is freezing rain and ice pellets , especially in hilly areas , &amp;rdquo ; Sabourin says .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Adds staffer Alain Dupuis : &amp;ldquo ; We see everything that goes on in the city here , and some of it can be pretty crazy .
But the key is not to panic .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That appears to be the prerequisite for a job here .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I love the snow .
It&amp;rsquo ; s like a winter wonderland for me here .
That explains why I&amp;rsquo ; m so positive , &amp;rdquo ; Sabourin says .
&amp;ldquo ; There&amp;rsquo ; s little more beautiful a sight than watching one of our machines at a land site blowing snow 140 feet in the air at sunrise .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Such a romantic .
But surely there must be a downside to the job .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; What&amp;rsquo ; s Philippe doing between the tempests ? Why , he&amp;rsquo ; s dealing with the potholes , &amp;rdquo ; Sabourin says with a sigh .

Too many ringy-dingies ! " data-portal-copyright= " " **28;36425;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1715804 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Are your brains already addled with way too many digits running through them ? Wait , it&amp;rsquo ; s going to get worse as we&amp;rsquo ; ll soon be inundated with yet more area codes to scramble our heads .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In old-timey times &amp;mdash ; before there were cellular phones and that internet thingy &amp;mdash ; most mere mortals had to memorize only a few digits and a couple of letters , generally relating to telephone numbers .
It wasn&amp;rsquo ; t much of an issue .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In those days , it would have been unthinkable to have to remember one area code along with a seven-digit number , which was the norm up until not long ago .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But little could we have known just what kind of pressure was to be placed on our beleaguered hippocampi this century as the numbers to be recalled keep rolling out at frightening speed .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to our elders , humans in the middle part of the last century only had to keep track of two letters and four numbers , then five numbers , before giving their fingers a workout on a now antique contraption called a rotary phone .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The letters referred to the first two in names like Crescent , Dollard , Regent , Wellington .
Then one had to have the faculties to match those letters with the appropriate numbers on the rotary , before following with the four or five numbers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pretty simple stuff , as long as the finger dexterity was there .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was even simpler before , according to the elders of our elders , when one just had to remember &amp;lsquo ; 0 , &amp;rsquo ; which signified the operator , often called Mabel , who upon a caller dialing or cranking up an antique phone gizmo would connect one to the police or your neighbours &amp;mdash ; all while listening in to the call .
( &lt;a href= " https : **25;36455;TOOLONG ? search .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Search YouTube for videos of Lily Tomlin 's ever-snorting operator Ernestine&lt;/a&gt; , from her days on TV&amp;rsquo ; s Laugh-In , for hysterical insights .
) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Before that , one had to use Morse code or carrier pigeons to get messages through to the cops or neighbours .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But life got really tricky , even for the non-numerically memory-challenged , this millennium .
Montrealers had to add 514 to the requisite seven digits for calling within the area .
Tough yet do-able .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then in 2006 , another code , 438 , was created for the Montreal area , because 514 just wasn&amp;rsquo ; t large enough to handle the volume of new numbers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Oh yeah , and then there was the 450 code for those in the outlying &amp;lsquo ; burbs , later to be joined by 579 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And should you have been lucky enough to have family members and friends in the western part of the province , you not only had to remember the 819 code but also 873 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Could it possibly get more complex ? Yes , it could .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Get ready for yet another Montreal code , 263 .
Really ! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the &lt;a href= " https : **33;36482;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) &lt;/a&gt; , the &lt;a href= " https : **33;36517;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;current projected exhaust date for codes 514 and 438 is June 2024&lt;/a&gt; .
So the Relief Planning Committee ( RPC ) is filing recommendations with the CRTC &amp;mdash ; just remembering all these government acronyms is a challenge &amp;mdash ; on the &amp;ldquo ; suitability&amp;rdquo ; of 263 for relief of the soon-to-be exhausted 514 and 438 and on when 263 should be pressed into service .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Similarly , those in the bloated 450 and 579 areas could soon be welcoming 354 .
And those in the 819 and 873 region , say hey to 468 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And don&amp;rsquo ; t even ask about Toronto or New York codes .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The mathematics are way beyond my pay grade , but the bottom line is 514 and 438 are maxed out , thanks in large part to the proliferation of smartphones .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Back in those old-timey times , most folks had only one number , but today many families have one landline and several mobiles for its various members .
According to the CRTC , there were 33 .
million Canadian mobile subscribers in 2018 , up 4 .
per cent from 2017 .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Leaving aside the area codes , remembering just the seven-digit numbers of family and friends today can be nightmarish , unless one stores one&amp;rsquo ; s contacts in the recesses of one&amp;rsquo ; s cell .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Of course , it is much more of a nightmare remembering all one&amp;rsquo ; s passwords for everything from email to ATMs , fridges to Facebook .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to the biometrics company Veridium , millions of American workers have to remember 27 different passwords , many of which are forgotten after Christmas breaks .
This &amp;ldquo ; password fatigue&amp;rdquo ; can be quite expensive , costing companies US$70 per individual password reset .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Could this result one day in the death of the password , replaced by eye or finger scans ? That might be sweet , although I&amp;rsquo ; ve seen one too many horror flicks where forces of evil have non-surgically extracted eyes and fingers to gain access to their owners&amp;rsquo ; computers and bank accounts .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Regardless , such technology will never help on the 10-digit telephone-number front .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Where&amp;rsquo ; s Mabel when we need her ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " **32;36552;TOOLONG " **39;36586;TOOLONG &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **28;36627;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " **30;36657;TOOLONG &; .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; The following is a public service announcement : Please stop stealing masks from your doctor&amp;rsquo ; s office .
I realize that people are worried about coronavirus , but before you commit petty theft , you should probably know that those masks won&amp;rsquo ; t protect you from catching the virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; On the off chance that you haven&amp;rsquo ; t heard , the coronavirus has been declared a &lt;a href= " https : **33;37038;TOOLONG .
health emergency&lt;/a&gt; by the World Health Organization .
To date , it has &lt;a href= " http : **34;37073;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;infected&lt;/a&gt; more than 28,000 people and caused 565 deaths worldwide .
To put this in perspective , the &lt;a href= " https : **33;37109;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; has infected 22 million and killed some 12,000 people during this flu season in the United States alone , which makes it a much more dangerous virus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , the coronavirus outbreak does pose a risk if not properly handled .
It was , after all , a coronavirus strain that caused the SARS outbreak of 2002 and the MERS outbreak in the Middle East in 2012 .
For those who knew people in Toronto during SARS , especially for those who had friends in the health care field who got sick , the memory of that episode is still fresh .
But surgical masks are not going to help .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Many doctors&amp;rsquo ; offices have boxes of surgical masks laid out at reception for patients who come in with symptoms like sneezing or coughing .
These are provided so that sick patients will not spread their germs to others in the waiting room .
But colleagues of mine have told me that some patients are leaving with fistfuls of surgical masks or simply taking the box altogether .
The result has been a &lt;a href= " https : **33;37144;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;global shortage of masks&lt;/a&gt; .
The other day , I went to the pharmacy , and as I walked in the door the clerk told me that they were out of surgical masks and would probably not get more anytime soon .
I told them that I just came in to buy some shampoo .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are several problems with this run on masks .
First , stealing is wrong .
But more important , the regular surgical masks that some people seem to be hoarding won&amp;rsquo ; t actually protect you from coronavirus .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Most common infections are spread via droplets .
In other words , every time you cough or sneeze when sick , tiny water droplets that contain virus particles are sprayed around you .
These can directly infect someone close by , or can land on a nearby surface like a table or a chair .
Someone might then touch that table and put their hand to the eyes , nose or mouth and thus transmit the virus to themselves .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The problem with standard surgical masks is that they are not airtight seals around your mouth and nose .
Someone can still cough on you , and infect you or you can still touch contaminated surfaces and infect yourself .
People often ask why doctors are often seen wearing surgical masks throughout the hospital .
The answer is that the masks are designed to prevent you from infecting someone else with your germs , not to prevent someone else&amp;rsquo ; s germs from infecting you .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If a doctor wanted to protect themselves from an airborne infection , they wouldn&amp;rsquo ; t wear a surgical mask .
They would wear an N95 mask .
The N95 mask actually provides good protection against airborne infections , but it has two drawbacks .
To work , it has to be fitted properly to your face .
Second , I can say from personal experience that after about 20 minutes of wearing a N95 masks you start to become lightheaded and feel unwell , likely because you have been rebreathing increasingly stale air .
It&amp;rsquo ; s not the type of thing you can wear for hours .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s understandable that people are scared about coronavirus , but wearing a surgical mask won&amp;rsquo ; t really do much to protect you .
Though given that only seven people &lt;a href= " https : **33;37179;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;in Canada&lt;/a&gt; are infected with coronavirus , you probably don&amp;rsquo ; t need much protection to begin with .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Valentine&amp;rsquo ; s Day is not a celebration of friendship .
It&amp;rsquo ; s an indoctrination of future expectations : flowers , candies , cards and other unsustainable waste as proof of life of one&amp;rsquo ; s relationship .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We struggle to ensure our children understand consent and to empower them to set their own boundaries with respect to relationships , especially as they gain independence .
According to the Quebec Education Ministry , sexuality education in school should enable students to &amp;ldquo ; better understand themselves ; establish emotional relationships that show respect for themselves and others ; develop critical thinking and good judgment .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet this one day of the year comes with an all-or-nothing requirement that&amp;rsquo ; s meant to foster inclusion : bring something for everyone or no one at all .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That means signing their name to an &amp;ldquo ; I like you beary much&amp;rdquo ; card for a kid who might have bullied them .
It means giving a &amp;ldquo ; You&amp;rsquo ; re a purr-fect friend&amp;rdquo ; card to someone who&amp;rsquo ; s snubbed them during a separate activity .
How does &amp;ldquo ; this is the day you must make a card for the kid who pulls your braids&amp;rdquo ; translate into a lesson about love and compassion ? Let&amp;rsquo ; s rename it Turn The Other Cheek Day .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If we have to do the same thing for everyone , it teaches us nothing about love .
We do not love everyone equally .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet , removing the everyone-or-no-one requirement means there&amp;rsquo ; s a child who&amp;rsquo ; s going to have 15 Valentines and another who&amp;rsquo ; s going to have one &amp;mdash ; and it&amp;rsquo ; ll be from the teacher .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even more troubling are the fundraising events that inevitably accompany the celebration , usually carnations or candy-grams that will be delivered during class time , profiting off the popular kids and leaving the others with a fake smile .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Well , part of learning about love is learning about heartbreak , right ? No , it isn&amp;rsquo ; t .
Not in elementary school .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Are we turning them into little snowflakes who can&amp;rsquo ; t handle disappointment ? Oh , don&amp;rsquo ; t worry , Chad , there&amp;rsquo ; s still soccer and the talent show and spelling bees to keep them from getting too high and mighty .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s not that Valentine&amp;rsquo ; s Day is bad .
It can be whatever a family decides to make of it .
But it doesn&amp;rsquo ; t belong in elementary school .
If schools want to help teach children about compassion and tie it into Valentine&amp;rsquo ; s Day , they should make cards to deliver to a nearby seniors residence .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As classrooms raise flags of inclusion and school walls are papered in anti-bullying slogans , carrying on traditions that have the potential to isolate a child is irresponsible and borders on cruel .

&amp;amp ; ChildParentingFitness : Does your bra support your workout ? http : **32;37840;TOOLONG .

" " alt= " Australian researchers who suggest " commercially available sports bras do not meet the unique needs of elite female athletes across the range of sports they participate in .
" " data-portal-copyright= " YASUYOSHI CHIBA " **28;37909;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1713190 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s a subject not often discussed around the gym , despite statistics suggesting 44 to 72 per cent of women experience breast pain while exercising .
Also not often the subject of conversation is even more women ( 51 to 79 per cent ) complain of sore breasts around the time of their period .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To be clear , not all workouts are painful .
Low-impact activities produce less of a bounce factor , which dials down the discomfort .
But for runners , there&amp;rsquo ; s no doubt breasts move significantly with every footfall .
One-third of the 1,397 female runners ( bra cup size AA-J ) polled prior to competing in the 2012 London Marathon reported experiencing breast pain while exercising .
Eight per cent described the pain as distressing , horrible or excruciating .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For many women who experience pain during exercise , high-impact activities like running , jumping and skipping rope are out of the question simply because the discomfort is too distracting or takes away from the enjoyment of the activity .
Others are forced to modify their workouts in order to minimize the pain .
A survey of 540 elite athletes across 49 different sports reported one-third experience breast pain severe enough to negatively affect performance and/or interfere with their ability to train .
Additional studies suggest pain can cause women to modify their gait and upper body movements to compensate for excessive breast movement .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The incidence and severity of breast pain is more common among large-breasted women , with 51 per cent of women with an F-cup size or larger complaining of discomfort , compared with 24 per cent of women with an A-cup .
Pain is also more prevalent among women who haven&amp;rsquo ; t given birth .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Kristina Ramsay , a Montreal-based fitness enthusiast , says pain is too strong a word to describe what she feels when exercise ramps up the bounce factor .
An avid skier , runner and gym rat , she suggests &amp;ldquo ; discomfort&amp;rdquo ; and &amp;ldquo ; annoyance&amp;rdquo ; better describe her reality .
A D-cup , she relies on a good sports bra to keep her comfortable during high-impact activities .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She&amp;rsquo ; s not alone .
A sports bra is the most popular solution when it comes to dampening the pain associated with exercise .
And while sports bras have come a long way from the first prototype of two jocks straps sewn together , not just any bra will do .
An &lt;a href= " https : **33;37939;TOOLONG .
research team who studied the consequences of breast pain on performance&lt;/a&gt; recommends all female athletes need to be educated on how to select and correctly fit a sports bra specific to their sport ( take the &lt;a href= " https : **33;37974;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;lululemon sports bra fit quiz&lt;/a&gt; ) .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Easier said than done , says Ramsay , who searches running blogs and product reviews for suggestions on sports bras specifically designed for exercisers who need maximum support .
She&amp;rsquo ; s tried more than her share of models claiming to fit the bill , only to be disappointed when putting them to the test at the gym or while out on a run .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s no fun feeling like you&amp;rsquo ; re going to fall out or being chafed , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And then there&amp;rsquo ; s the cost of a good sports bra , which is no small matter .
A quick look at the lineup of most of the popular sports bra retailers and you&amp;rsquo ; ll note bras boasting maximum support are more expensive than bras offering light or medium support .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ramsay&amp;rsquo ; s current favourite is the &lt;a href= " https : **33;38009;TOOLONG .
Bra&lt;/a&gt; made by Brooks , which she says has all the features experts recommend to ensure a comfortable workout .
The straps are wide and adjustable , the band around the chest thick enough that it doesn&amp;rsquo ; t ride up and the cups encapsulate versus binding the breasts .
But there&amp;rsquo ; s one feature Ramsay says sports bra manufacturers still haven&amp;rsquo ; t got right .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; All that support and they finish the bra with a couple of flimsy hook and eye closures , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
According to Ramsay , hook and eyes aren&amp;rsquo ; t rugged enough to withstand the magnitude of breast movement that occurs during high-impact activities .
Add a little wear and tear and the bra has a tendency to become unhooked just when it&amp;rsquo ; s needed most .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Her experience jives with the sentiments of the Australian researchers who suggest &amp;ldquo ; commercially available sports bras do not meet the unique needs of elite female athletes across the range of sports they participate in .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Given the limitations of sports bras as well as the prevalence of breast pain among elite and recreational athletes , it&amp;rsquo ; s clear the industry hasn&amp;rsquo ; t been successful in meeting the needs of a diverse community of exercisers who look forward to pain-free workouts .
And then there are the differences between sports .
Are runners and equestrians equally well-served in the same bra ? And what about soccer players , who use their chest to control and bring down a ball in flight ; is there a bra to fit their needs ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; All female exercisers deserve the right to work out pain-free , even on those days when breasts are tender .
Active women also deserve the right not only to wear a bra that stays clasped when the going gets sweaty , but to buy it at the same price as exercisers for whom support isn&amp;rsquo ; t as important .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; The woman was about to give birth , her baby&amp;rsquo ; s head crowning through the vaginal opening .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But the doctor sensed something was dangerously wrong : the baby&amp;rsquo ; s shoulder was being blocked by the woman&amp;rsquo ; s pelvic bone , a condition known as shoulder dystocia that in rare cases can cause a stillbirth .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In an instant , Dr .
Xingbang Zheng spread the woman&amp;rsquo ; s legs far apart and high into the air as he pressed down on her belly .
Those manoeuvres made the woman&amp;rsquo ; s pelvic bone rotate , allowing the baby&amp;rsquo ; s shoulder to slip through without mishap .
A couple of seconds later , Zheng was holding the infant in his arms &amp;mdash ; or rather , a mannequin designed to look like a baby .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s much easier than in real life , &amp;rdquo ; Zheng remarked after the medical simulation was over .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We speeded things up on purpose for the demonstration , &amp;rdquo ; said Renata De Melo , of CAE Healthcare , who was supervising the simulation .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The MUHC Foundation aims to raise $10 million to establish the network in one to two years .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; This network is going to create more of a patient-safety culture at our hospitals , &amp;rdquo ; Dr .
Elene Khalil , director of education at the MUHC , said of the project .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Ultimately , the patient will benefit .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The Canadian Patient Safety Institute estimates that medical errors account for 28,000 deaths each year in Canada .

But that centre is mostly for student training .
Khalil suggested that setting up simulation centres at the two hospitals will help expose &amp;ldquo ; latent errors&amp;rdquo ; that might not be obvious in a non-clinical setting .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Marc Parent , CAE&amp;rsquo ; s chief executive officer and a member of the MUHC Foundation&amp;rsquo ; s board , said his company is applying the principles of civil aviation safety to health care .
The goal , he explained , is to train surgeons and other health professionals to develop the necessary &amp;ldquo ; muscle memory&amp;rdquo ; to respond instantly to an unforeseen medical emergency , on the same level as a pilot reacts automatically to an engine failure .

Richard Cruess&lt;/a&gt; , the former dean of medicine at McGill , is still involved in medical education at the age of 90 , and marvelled at the latest advances in simulation .
Cruess recalled that as a student in the early 1950s , he and his classmates had to sacrifice about 200 rabbits to learn how to suture .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We would inflict wounds of different types on the rabbits as groups of students , &amp;rdquo ; Cruess recounted .
&amp;ldquo ; One student would be the anesthetist and another student would be the surgeon .
In retrospect , it was awful .
It was a different world then .
Patient rights had not really been well established , much less animal rights .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Today , in contrast , &amp;ldquo ; you don&amp;rsquo ; t even think in those terms anymore .
The revolution in technology , which of course includes simulation , is like magic .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s been a few weeks since &lt;a href= " https : **33;39361;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;the New Year , New You crowd&lt;/a&gt; invaded the gym , which means the grace period for poor gym etiquette is drawing to a close .
As accustomed as the old guard is to the annual January flood of exercise newbies , there comes a time when missteps in decorum are no longer forgiven .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To be fair , most gyms do a lousy job of educating their members on how to foster a safe and welcoming workout space .
A few strategically placed signs outlining one or two basic guidelines is the standard approach , but it&amp;rsquo ; s violations of the unsaid rules that cause eyebrows to raise and words to be exchanged .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So to clear up any confusion around what&amp;rsquo ; s kosher and what&amp;rsquo ; s not , here are nine rules to live by .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The gym&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Respect personal space .
&lt;/strong&gt; Most people try to get into the zone during a workout , which means focusing on the job at hand with earbuds in and playlist setting the mood .
Be sure to give your fellow exercise enthusiasts enough space to do their thing and refrain from striking up a conversation , commenting on their form or peeking at their workout stats from a neighbouring treadmill , bike or elliptical .
Above all else , no matter how funky the workout , don&amp;rsquo ; t stare .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Clean up after yourself .
&lt;/strong&gt; Workouts are sweaty endeavours that call for wiping down machines , mats , balls , weights and benches after use &amp;mdash ; particularly during flu season .
But that&amp;rsquo ; s not the only chore you&amp;rsquo ; re expected to perform .
Re-rack your weights , remove the plates from barbells and return any other pieces of equipment to their rightful place .
As for your personal equipment &amp;mdash ; water bottle , towel and any other accoutrements &amp;mdash ; keep it with you , not littered around the gym .
And for everybody&amp;rsquo ; s sake , stay away from the gym if you&amp;rsquo ; re sneezing or coughing .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leave your phone -- and yourself -- on silent .
&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s fine to use your phone to play music ( earbuds only , please ) , but not to FaceTime friends and family , text while exercising , take workout selfies or upload pictures of those working out around you to Instagram .
And while you&amp;rsquo ; re keeping your phone out of sight , put it on silent so it doesn&amp;rsquo ; t ring , ping or otherwise disrupt the workout of the person next to you .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Keep it scent-free .
&lt;/strong&gt; Strong scents are particularly annoying at the gym , where respiration rate is ramped up and sweaty bodies are working out side by side .
That&amp;rsquo ; s not an excuse to dial back on the deodorant &amp;mdash ; just avoid flowery or heavy scents that linger .
Speaking of unpleasant smells , don&amp;rsquo ; t make the mistake of squeezing in one more workout before throwing your favourite gym T-shirt , shorts or leggings in the wash .
Nobody likes to exercise beside someone with overripe gear .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Indoor shoes only .
&lt;/strong&gt; Hey , it&amp;rsquo ; s Canada , where snow , salt and other abrasives cling to all outdoor footwear .
And no matter how hard you try to wipe the outdoors away , dirt , grit and moisture get tracked into the gym and locker room , and then transferred to machines and other equipment .
Leave your boots at the door , and don&amp;rsquo ; t make the mistake of thinking you can get from the parking lot to the front door in your gym shoes without bringing the outside in .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Do n't hog the equipment .
&lt;/strong&gt; Gyms are communal spaces , which means equipment is shared , not monopolized .
This is especially relevant during peak hours , when there aren&amp;rsquo ; t enough machines and pieces of equipment to go around .
Limit your time on a cardio machine to 30 minutes , and give a nod to indicate it&amp;rsquo ; s OK for someone to use the weight training equipment when you&amp;rsquo ; re between sets .
Just make sure you put a towel down on the weight bench so you&amp;rsquo ; re not sharing more than a set of dumbbells .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The locker room&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cover up .
&lt;/strong&gt; You may be comfortable in your birthday suit , but not everyone is cool with people walking around in the buff .
That doesn&amp;rsquo ; t mean you can&amp;rsquo ; t expose any bare skin , but throw on a towel while heading to and from the shower .
And remember the rule about personal space , making sure not to spread your discarded workout clothes and toiletries around the locker room like it&amp;rsquo ; s your own bathroom .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cover your feet , too .
&lt;/strong&gt; Locker rooms and showers are breeding grounds for germs .
Even the best clubs struggle to keep up the cleanliness of showers , toilet stalls and floors during peak hours .
Opt for flip-flops or slides instead of bare feet , and that includes in the shower .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Get in and get out .
&lt;/strong&gt; Locker rooms aren&amp;rsquo ; t the place to loiter , catch up with a buddy , talk on the phone or grab a quick bite to eat .
Nor are they a place to take selfies : understandably , cameras make people nervous when they&amp;rsquo ; re used in a locker room .
And gawking is never cool .

It has an acceptance rate of five per cent , meaning that only one in 20 articles submitted is judged by experts to be worthy of publication .
That does n't mean the rejected papers are not based on sound research ; most eventually get published in lesser journals .
But the New England Journal looks for the cream of the crop .
That 's why I pay particular attention to papers published in this journal , such as a recent article on the &lt;a href= " https : **33;39757;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt; " Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Health , Aging , and Disease .
" &lt;/a&gt; Even more so when the article is the work of Johns Hopkins University neuroscientist Dr .
Mark Mattson , renowned globally for his research in the area of intermittent fasting .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Intermittent fasting does not mean cutting out a Snickers bar between meals .
It refers to a systematic eating pattern that places emphasis not on what food should be eaten , but rather on when it should be consumed .
Intermittent fasts fall into three general categories .
In " alternate day fasting , " days of very low-calorie intake are alternated with days of regular eating .
The " 5:2 " variety dictates eating normally on five days of the week but restricting calories to under 700 on two non-sequential days .
In " daily time-restricted feeding , " all food is consumed in a six-to-eight-hour window , essentially resulting in a 16- to 18-hour fast .
Most people who engage in this version finish supper by about 7 p .
and do not eat again until lunch the next day .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Of course , the question is why anyone would want to engage in any of these torturous regimes .
Simply put , it is because there is accumulating evidence that calorie restriction provides benefits beyond the obvious weight loss .
It has long been known that reduced food intake in animals results in an increased life span .
The assumption has been that the benefits of reduced calorie intake are due to a reduction in the generation of free radicals as a consequence of metabolic processes .
However , it appears that there is another factor involved .
Typically , in experiments in which rodents are put on a low-calorie diet , they are given their daily allotment of food in one dose that they generally consume within a few hours .
This means that essentially , they are on a 20-hour fast .
This results in " metabolic switching , " a term with which we have to become familiar to understand the benefits that are attributed to intermittent fasting .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;The main source of energy for cells is glucose .
During respiration , glucose serves as fuel , providing energy as it reacts with oxygen to yield carbon dioxide and water .
It is this process that is also accompanied by the production of those troublesome free radicals .
The main source of glucose are carbohydrates in the diet and when these are severely restricted , as in fasting , the body switches to fats as an alternate fuel .
But fats are not used directly , they are converted in the liver to " ketone bodies " that then are metabolized yielding energy .
This is commonly referred to as a state of " ketosis .
" &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;It turns out that these ketones are not just fuel for cells , but are also signalling molecules that regulate the expression and activity of various proteins and other biochemicals that influence health and aging .
It seems that metabolic switching , which is a result of periods of fasting , is perceived by the body as a signal to go into survival mode since no food is coming in .
Cells respond by improving control of blood pressure and blood sugar , producing more antioxidants and curbing inflammation .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Most of the fasting studies that have produced promising results have involved animals , but some human trials are starting to emerge .
Improvements in insulin sensitivity , verbal memory , resting heart rate , and cholesterol levels have been noted in short-term clinical trials .
In rodents , experiments have shown reduced occurrence of spontaneous tumours with daily calorie restriction or alternate-day fasting .
Suppression of the growth of induced tumours has also been observed .
Furthermore , the animals show increased sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy .
Stimulated by these observations , a number of human trials examining the effect of intermittent fasting on breast , ovarian , prostate , endometrial , colorectal and brain tumours are underway .
Pilot studies are also examining possible benefits of intermittent fasting in multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis , surgical outcomes and athletic performance .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Obviously , we have to temper this discussion with the all-too-often-stated disclaimer that more research is needed .
But it is forthcoming .
Valter Longo at the University of Southern California has some interesting results with his " Fasting Mimicking Diet .
" For five days , people consume only special prepackaged foods that provide 1,000 calories the first day and 725 the other days and are said to have a unique combination of nutrients that trick the body into thinking it is fasting .
Repeating the cycle monthly for three months has resulted in weight loss as well as a drop in blood sugar and cholesterol .
But going hungry for five days is challenging and the meals are expensive .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;It is always meaningful to ask experts what change they have made in their life as a result of their research .
Mattson says he eats within a six-hour window every day .
And that 's from the horse 's mouth .

" data-portal-copyright= " Brendan McDermid " **28;40126;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1707094 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; There&amp;rsquo ; s been no shortage of press coverage about the link between baby powder and ovarian cancer .
Johnson &amp;amp ; Johnson has lost a string of lawsuits recently with the biggest ordering a payout of &lt;a href= " https : **33;40156;TOOLONG .
billion&lt;/a&gt; .
But the science isn&amp;rsquo ; t so clear-cut , and a new study in the &lt;a href= " https : **33;40191;TOOLONG .
of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that the risk , if it exists , is very small .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Debates about the safety of talc have been going on for over 40 years .
Talc is a mineral commonly used in cosmetic products , like talcum powder .
So when a &lt;a href= " https : **33;40226;TOOLONG .
report&lt;/a&gt; found talc particles within the tissue of ovarian and cervical cancers , people were understandably concerned .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **33;40261;TOOLONG .
studies&lt;/a&gt; from the 1980s did show a link between talc and ovarian cancer and a number of subsequent studies did the same .
But more recent research from the &lt;a href= " https : **33;40296;TOOLONG .
Health Study&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href= " https : **33;40331;TOOLONG .
Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href= " https : **33;40366;TOOLONG .
Study&lt;/a&gt; was actually negative .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are a few possible explanations for this discrepancy .
Talc , when mined , is frequently contaminated with asbestos .
In 1976 , cosmetic manufacturers permanently &lt;a href= " https : **33;40401;TOOLONG .
all asbestos&lt;/a&gt; from their products .
So one possibility is that earlier studies were seeing the cancer causing effects of asbestos , rather than talc , and the more recent studies showed no risk because products are now asbestos free .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href= " https : **33;40436;TOOLONG .
testing&lt;/a&gt; largely confirms that talc products are asbestos free , although a &lt;a href= " https : **33;40471;TOOLONG .
Reuter 's investigation&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href= " https : **33;40506;TOOLONG .
recall&lt;/a&gt; suggest that asbestos contamination may still happen .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Another possibility for the discrepancy is recall bias .
The earlier positive studies were case-control studies .
These types of studies identify women with ovarian and then ask them about prior talcum powder use .
In effect , they work backward .
The more recent negative studies were cohort studies .
These types of studies record talcum powder use among women and then look to see if they subsequently develop ovarian cancer .
In effect , they work forward .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The danger with backward looking studies is that people with a particular disease may end up scouring their memory looking for reasons why they got sick and then over-report a particular risk factor or exposure .
The problem is made worse if they have a prior reason to believe something is dangerous .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For example the &lt;a href= " https : **33;40541;TOOLONG .
American Cancer Epidemiology Study&lt;/a&gt; found an overall link between talc and ovarian cancer .
For women interviewed after 2014 , talcum powder nearly tripled the risk of ovarian cancer , but for women interviewed before 2014 there was no increased risk .
The year 2014 is significant because it saw a large class action lawsuit against Johnson &amp;amp ; Johnson .
The press coverage may have skewed how women remembered their prior talcum powder use , especially if they were diagnosed with ovarian cancer .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Recall bias may explain why the retrospective backward-looking case control studies were positive and the prospective forward-looking cohort studies were negative .
The problem with cohort studies is that they need a lot of patients to research rare events like ovarian cancer .
Even the recent &lt;a href= " https : **33;40576;TOOLONG .
study&lt;/a&gt; , which analyzed data on a quarter of a million women , said that it did not have enough people in it to exclude a very small increase in risk .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But then again , why use talcum powder at all ? The &lt;a href= " https : **33;40611;TOOLONG .
Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; actually recommends against it , not for any cancer link , but because it can be inhaled by babies and irritate lung tissue .
The &lt;a href= " https : **33;40646;TOOLONG .
College of Obstetrics and Gynecology&lt;/a&gt; is similarly unimpressed by the actual need for talcum powder for any gynecologic purpose .
So even though talc likely does not significantly increase the risk ovarian cancer , we could just stop using it altogether .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For those who do want to keep using it , there is another solution .
They can buy baby powder made from cornstarch , because while all talcum powders are baby powders , not all baby powders contain talc .

on fitness : Is ' load management ' really a thing in sport ? http : **34;40833;TOOLONG .

" alt= " The term load management became popular in the NHL and elsewhere after the Toronto Raptors claimed it as the motivation for sitting a healthy Kawhi Leonard during the regular season .
" data-portal-copyright= " Stan Behal " **28;40904;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1503756 " /&gt; &lt;iframe width= " 100% " height= " 100% " frameborder= " 0 " allowfullscreen= " true " src= " https : **34;40934;TOOLONG .
&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Load management&amp;rdquo ; is one of the hottest terms in pro sports .
A regular part of the Toronto Raptors&amp;rsquo ; lexicon during last season&amp;rsquo ; s run to the NBA championships , the team claimed load management was behind their decision for sitting a healthy Kawhi Leonard during the regular season .
The term has since been picked up by the NHL , with teams using load management to keep goalies fresh over a long 82-game regular season schedule .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The idea of managing training load isn&amp;rsquo ; t new .
It&amp;rsquo ; s been used in the endurance community for years , with runners , swimmers and triathletes establishing weekly training parameters designed to reduce the risk of injury .
Baseball pitchers are also subject to load management , with the number of pitches and starts strictly monitored by coaching staff trying to keep their athletes healthy over the course of a long season .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet despite the tendency for load management to be linked to injury prevention , it&amp;rsquo ; s also linked to performance .
There&amp;rsquo ; s a saying among exercise physiologists : Exposure to load allows the body to tolerate load .
In other words , the physiological adaptations triggered by training and competition are necessary to develop the fitness , strength and resilience needed to withstand the rigours of physical activity and reach peak athletic potential .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Tim Gabbett , an exercise physiologist and high-performance consultant from Australia , addressed the topic of load management in a recent &lt;a href= " https : **30;40970;TOOLONG " target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; .
He suggests the concept is largely misunderstood , especially in team sports , and that many of the practices used to reduce workload are &amp;ldquo ; poorly implemented&amp;rdquo ; by coaches , trainers and medical staff .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Even the 10-per-cent rule , considered the gold standard of load management , is often misinterpreted .
Based on the theory that increases in training volume shouldn&amp;rsquo ; t exceed 10 per cent per week , Gabbett suggests it should be taken more as a recommendation than a rule because it fails to consider an athlete&amp;rsquo ; s current training load .
For anyone who is already training at the top end of their tolerance , a 10 per cent increase in volume is ill advised .
And for athletes who are undertrained , a more aggressive approach to reaching peak performance may be advised .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For healthy athletes with clear performance goals , load management is a relatively easy task as long as the timeline to meet those goals allows for a progressive increase in training volume , intensity and/or frequency .
But for athletes who are coming back from an injury or who have a jam-packed competitive schedule , load management becomes more complex .
It&amp;rsquo ; s not easy to find that sweet spot where training load is sufficient to maximize performance , but not so aggressive that it leads to exhaustion and/or injury .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s not just the time spent training and competing that needs to be factored into load management .
Stress , travel , inadequate nutrition and lack of sleep can increase fatigue and have a negative effect on recovery .
Another important element for consideration is repetitiveness in the workload .
Athletes for whom training and competition demand the same set of movements be performed over and over again ( throwing athletes , such as pitchers , runners and swimmers ) are likely to require more stringent policies related to load management .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then of course there is the very human factor of how tolerant the athlete is when it comes to workload .
Some athletes can endure a packed schedule of training and competition with little in the way of consequences , while others experience a dip in performance and/or a rise in injuries with a much lighter volume of work .
Some of that resilience , or lack thereof , is related to known factors such as age , history of injury , quality of sleep and speed of recovery .
But sometimes there is no easy answer for why some athletes are more or less tolerant of the same volume of work .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Establishing the appropriate &amp;lsquo ; ceiling&amp;rsquo ; of training load can , at times , be difficult for practitioners given that the demands of sport evolve over seasons and are influenced by several known contextual factors ( e .
, winning or losing , margin of victory or defeat , quality of opposition and so on ) , &amp;rdquo ; said Gabbett .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So while there&amp;rsquo ; s no one recipe for load management , there are some basic guidelines that can be followed by amateur and elite athletes alike .
The first rule of thumb is to err on the side of moderation when it comes to training load and to minimize the degree of change from week to week .
Training load should also be in proportion to performance goals , competition schedule and degree of repetitiveness in the athlete&amp;rsquo ; s training protocols and movement patterns .
Also important is to be aware of the individual resilience of the athlete when it comes to volume of training .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; For athletes who are managing their own training schedule and for trainers and coaches who are responsible for dictating the training and competition schedules of their athletes , regular monitoring of fatigue , competitive and lifestyle-related stressors , volume of travel and injury patterns is vital to load management .
Every athlete has a point where workload goes from building tolerance and achieving peak athletic potential to being detrimental to performance .
Getting the best from the athlete without crossing that line is the key to proper load management .

" data-portal-copyright= " Lou Manna " **28;42591;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1701072 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Ask most men whether they are concerned about their ability to have children and the answer will be a resounding no .
Yet they should be concerned , now more than ever .
World-wide sperm counts have declined to less than half of what they were 40 years ago , and the number of abnormal sperm has doubled .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite headlines about the labour shortage and aging population , people remain strangely unaware of this impending fertility crisis .
As well , infertility is wrongly perceived as a female-only health issue .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As a consequence of rising rates of infertility , the number of couples seeking assisted reproductive treatment in western countries is increasing annually at a rate of 5 per cent .
This is good news for the highly profitable fertility industry , but not for those who want to start a family .
In Canada , one in six couples experience infertility .
On average , they will spend $30,000 on treatments .
Few can afford such expensive procedures without incurring massive debt , and existing tax incentives do little to alleviate this burden .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s urgent that we move to ensure fair and equitable access to fertility treatment .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Article 3(a) of the Quebec Health Insurance Act provides that the cost of physicians&amp;rsquo ; services qualifying as &amp;ldquo ; medically required&amp;rdquo ; is covered by the RAMQ .
In 2015 , an amendment to the act voted under the Couillard government uninsured most assisted reproductive treatments in order to &amp;ldquo ; optimize the use of medical and financial resources .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Male and female infertility is a disease .
It is recognized as such by the World Health Organization , among others .
Fertility treatments and assisted reproductive treatment therefore need to be understood as medically required .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yet , existing rules create a regime that is incoherent .
For example , male fertility-restoring procedures such as varicocelectomy are fully covered by the public regime , as is the excision of ovarian cysts , a frequent cause of female infertility .
But &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;many couples with other issues will find themselves needing to pay out of pocket for such treatments as in vitro fertilization .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Also worthy of mention is infertility&amp;rsquo ; s effect as a catalyst for such other afflictions as sexual dysfunction , depression and anxiety .
Ironically , these effects will be treated with full RAMQ support , potentially at a higher lifetime cost than fertility treatments would incur .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Quebec&amp;rsquo ; s exclusion of assisted reproductive treatment coverage also challenges the basic human right to family life , which is recognized in a variety of international instruments , including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Also worth considering in terms of human rights is the unfair health burden placed on women for the treatment of infertility .
&lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;Despite male factors contributing to about half of cases , the diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men is based on old , ineffective methods .
As a consequence , only 4 per cent of infertile men can be diagnosed accurately .
Further , there are few fertility treatments for men .
As a consequence , it is usually the woman who must undergo treatment .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This treatment of women for male infertility comes with increased health risks due to hormonal injections and oocyte ( egg ) retrieval , such as strokes and a possibly heightened risk of cancer .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The remedy is to prioritize funding for research around the causes and treatment of male infertility , and to launch a public health campaign to inform men how lifestyle ( excess weight , poor diet , alcohol and/or cannabis consumption ) can harm fertility .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It is time for our leaders to address this impending fertility crisis , and re-examine assisted reproductive treatment coverage from both an ethical and legal perspective .
Otherwise , we might soon live in a world where having a family becomes limited to top income earners , and where women have to pay the price of an increasingly male-centric issue .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; Like many trendy workouts before it , high-intensity interval training ( HIIT ) has gone from being the next best thing to the greatest thing of all time .
This elevation in status from cool new workout to a workout that does everything for everyone is typical of most exercise fads that take the fitness world by storm .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; With HIIT voted No .
2 out of the top 20 fitness trends for 2020 by the American College of Sports Medicine , more and more people are jumping on the bandwagon , and more and more fitness clubs are offering HIIT workouts .
Yet despite all the hype , consider this a gentle reminder that no one workout does it all .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What&amp;rsquo ; s the appeal of HIIT ? For today&amp;rsquo ; s time-crunched exerciser , it&amp;rsquo ; s the efficiency of the workouts .
Traditional workouts last anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes , whereas HIIT sessions last 10 minutes or less .
Best of all , those 10 minutes pack a mean punch , offering similar fitness and health gains as workouts that take twice as long ( or more ) .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To reap those gains , you have to exercise at your maximum effort , albeit for short periods of time ( 60 to 240 seconds ) .
While there are myriad interval formats , HIIT results are based on repeated bouts of exercise performed anywhere from 80 to 100 per cent of all-out effort interspersed with periods of recovery .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As long as exercisers consistently push themselves into that discomfort zone , research suggests HIIT workouts have the potential to significantly improve cardiorespiratory fitness and deliver all the health benefits that go along with it .
Keep in mind , however , most of the research protocols supporting the benefits of HIIT were performed in a lab , which doesn&amp;rsquo ; t always compare to the type of HIIT workouts offered at fitness clubs or online .
Not to mention that what works on one section of the population may not have the same effect on another .
So not all research results should be taken at face value .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Part of the reason it&amp;rsquo ; s so difficult to translate HIIT results from a research lab to real life is that there are so many workout formats , and no single one has been proved to provide the greatest return .
Some workouts are performed on a stationary bike and some are done on a treadmill .
Some require maintaining 80 per cent of maximum effort , while others demand exercisers push closer to 100 per cent .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite all the debate surrounding the benefits of HIIT , it&amp;rsquo ; s clear there&amp;rsquo ; s one promise that&amp;rsquo ; s continually oversold : HIIT isn&amp;rsquo ; t a magic bullet for losing unwanted weight or body fat .
A recent published review of 47 studies featuring 1,422 middle-aged and overweight individuals suggests that anyone who&amp;rsquo ; s sweating through HIIT sessions in the hope of losing a few pounds is likely to be disappointed .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Our results revealed no evidence to suggest low-volume HIIT was beneficial for improvements in total body fat mass , body fat and lean body mass when compared to a non-exercising control or moderate intensity continuous training , &amp;rdquo ; said the Australian researchers who analyzed the available data .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s likely that what makes HIIT so popular is also what prevents it from affecting body weight and body composition .
Successful weight loss starts with workouts longer than 60 minutes , which far exceeds the characteristics of HIIT .
As for the ballyhooed afterburn of HIIT workouts , any extra calories burned post-exercise are unlikely to be significant enough to have an effect on weight loss .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; What does this mean for those who have switched from longer , steady-state workouts to HIIT ? It depends on your goals .
If you want an express workout that&amp;rsquo ; s guaranteed to improve your health and fitness , HIIT workouts are the way to go .
But if weight loss is your goal , you need far more minutes than what HIIT has to offer before you can buckle that belt a little tighter .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Also worth keeping in mind is that the majority of HIIT studies feature aerobic-type workouts &amp;mdash ; primarily cycling and running .
Most HIIT workouts offered in fitness studios or on YouTube feature a mix of aerobic and **32;42806;TOOLONG intervals , so the results may not mirror those published in research journals .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; No workout checks all the boxes .
But when it comes to improving overall fitness , nothing gets the job done in less time than HIIT .
That said , exercising at the top end of the effort scale isn&amp;rsquo ; t for everyone , so if feeling the burn isn&amp;rsquo ; t your thing , then trendy or not , HIIT&amp;rsquo ; s not for you .

" data-portal-copyright= " PIERRE ANDRIEU " **28;43160;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1695162 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Everyone seems to think , or at least wants to believe , that alcohol in moderation is good for you .
But alcohol increases the risk of cancer , especially &lt;a href= " https : **33;43190;TOOLONG .
cancer&lt;/a&gt; , and the evidence for the supposed cardiovascular benefits of red wine is &lt;a href= " https : **33;43225;TOOLONG .
that great , &lt;/a&gt; either .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Alcohol , in fact , can be quite problematic .
It raises your &lt;a href= " https : **33;43260;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and the high sugar content contributes to &lt;a href= " https : **33;43295;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt; .
As Tommy Schnurmacher has noted , there is a reason we call it a beer belly and not a celery belly .
Also , alcohol itself is toxic to heart muscle cells and can cause heart failure , although the condition , known as alcoholic cardiomyopathy , generally only happens when people drink heavily on a regular basis .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , the idea of one or two drinks per day being good for you persists , despite the mounting evidence against it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A new study in the &lt;a href= " https : **33;43330;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; looked at the effects of alcohol consumption and a type of arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation ( or Afib ) .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Afib is a common arrhythmia that becomes more common as we age .
Interestingly , it often produces no symptoms and its major complication is not cardiac , but neurological .
Afib increases the risk of stroke , and patients often need to be prescribed blood thinners to try to prevent that .
Still , some people , especially younger patients , do feel palpitations when they have an irregular heartbeat .
Medications can control the arrhythmia , but some lifestyle factors can help , too .
Although age is a significant risk factor for developing Afib , obesity , hypertension , diabetes , sleep apnea and a sedentary lifestyle are all &lt;a href= " https : **33;43365;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;risk factors , &lt;/a&gt; as well .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Another risk factor that isn&amp;rsquo ; t always discussed is &lt;a href= " https : **33;43400;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; .
It increases the risk of Afib long-term and also can serve as a &lt;a href= " https : **33;43435;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;trigger&lt;/a&gt; for individual episodes .
How it does this is debatable .
Given that alcohol causes weight gain , high blood pressure and raises blood sugar , it is possible it is simply acting via these traditional cardiac risk factors .
But there is also evidence that alcohol can disrupt the electrical activity in the heart muscle and affect the heart muscle directly in the long term .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; While it has been clear for some time that lifestyle modifications like exercising more and eating healthily can help reduce Afib , the evidence concerning alcohol consumption has been less clear .
This new study tested whether abstinence prevented episodes of the arrhythmia .
In the study , 140 patients who drank on average 16-17 drinks per week were randomized to either give up alcohol entirely or continue as they were .
At six months , the Afib recurrence rate in the abstinence group was lower ( 53 per cent vs .
73 per cent ) as was the hospitalization rate ( 9 per cent vs .
20 per cent ) and the time between arrhythmia episodes was more spread out .
There also a 3 .
kg difference in weight and seven-point difference in blood pressure .
In short , cutting out alcohol helped tremendously .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To be fair , at 17 drinks per week , the patients&amp;rsquo ; alcohol consumption was on the high side and whether someone who drank a more modest seven drinks per week would benefit to the same degree is up for debate .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Also , not everyone in the abstinence group completely gave up alcohol .
Around 40 per cent of them still drank some alcohol though most drank fewer than two drinks per week .
Still , this suggests that completely cutting out alcohol might not be necessary and that cutting back may accomplish quite a bit .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The authors of the study acknowledged that alcohol is ingrained in Western culture .
Getting people to give it up entirely is almost certainly impractical .
But it might be worth remembering that alcohol is not so good for your heart .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fact , the strongest health benefits involving alcohol seem to be from drinking less of it .

" alt= " One study of master athletes noted a 33- to 38-per-cent increase in muscle mass and strength among those who consistently consumed a high-protein post-weight-training snack compared to those who didn't .
" data-portal-copyright= " Dave Sidaway " **28;43691;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1689510 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; The last decade has seen a steep increase in the number of athletes achieving personal bests in their 40s and beyond .
This group of dedicated older athletes has redefined the idea of aging , rewriting the record books with performances in the pool , on the track , and in the saddle .
So remarkable are their achievements , exercise scientists have been busy studying their training and lifestyle habits to see if they can gather more information on what successful aging looks like .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; According to a group of French researchers , &lt;span class= " s1 " &gt;there is still a dearth of published research on the link between nutrition and performance in master athletes&lt;/span&gt; .
In particular , do older athletes have a different set of nutritional needs than their younger counterparts ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We proposed to identify the metabolic challenges that master athletes may face and that require specific nutritional recommendations , &amp;rdquo ; said the French researchers in their article &lt;a href= " https : **33;43721;TOOLONG .
for Master Athletes : Is There a Need for Specific **25;43756;TOOLONG .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of the primary nutritional goals of any athlete is to adequately fuel training and performance .
Active individuals who engage in a high volume of exercise need to consume more calories than someone who is sedentary , based on a greater number of calories expended while training and competing .
But nutritional strategies for athletes go far beyond counting calories .
Knowing when to eat and what to eat is also key to maximizing performance .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A slowing metabolism and gradual loss of muscle mass , estimated to be six to eight per cent per decade after the age of 30 , are two markers of aging that impact performance and nutritional needs .
Optimizing the diet of master athletes so as to slow down the physiological changes that occur as the decades add up is an important strategy when it comes to sustaining the volume and intensity needed to maximize potential .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Master athletes who are able to maintain a high training volume and sufficient energy intake with age could maintain their body composition , metabolism and ultimately , resting metabolic rate ( the amount of energy expended at rest and during the activities of everyday life ) , &amp;rdquo ; said the research team .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To assist in meeting these goals , master athletes need to consume more protein than younger athletes and their sedentary age-matched peers .
The current recommendation for older adults is 30 grams of protein per meal , 10 grams more than recommended for younger adults .
For master athletes however , 35-40 grams of protein at four-hour intervals throughout the day is considered crucial to repair and rebuild muscles utilized during exercise .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Practically , this recommendation corresponds to a minimum of four portions of &amp;gt ; 30g proteins per day , for breakfast ( 8 a .
) , lunch ( 12 p .
) , afternoon snack ( 4 p .
) and dinner ( 8 p .
) for a total of around 120 g protein or 1 .
g/kg body mass per day for an 80-kg athlete , &amp;rdquo ; said the French researchers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In addition , a protein-rich snack should be consumed immediately post-exercise ( within the first 60 minutes ) for master athletes with high training loads or after an intense workout .
A pre-bedtime glass of milk will also aid in muscle recovery &amp;mdash ; especially after a tough day at the gym .
Any source of protein , animal or plant-based will do the trick , though there is some suggestion that protein-rich dairy products may be some of the best options .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; How effective are those extra few grams of protein ? One study of master athletes noted a 33- to 38-per-cent increase in muscle mass and strength among those who consistently consumed a high-protein post-weight-training snack compared to those who didn&amp;rsquo ; t .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Still , as attentive as master athletes are to their diet and training schedules , injury and short-term health issues are common .
A forced interruption from training and competition is a fact of life for athletes of all ages , but for master athletes even brief periods of inactivity can lead to a decrease in precious muscles mass .
Maintaining a protein-rich diet while on the mend can help minimize some of that loss .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As for fat and carbohydrates , carbs should be periodized based on the volume of training with fewer carbs consumed on rest or easy days and greater amounts consumed pre , during and post workouts on days when training volume is high .
Fat should be ingested in moderate amounts with an emphasis on foods rich in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids , like nuts , avocados and fatty fish such as salmon and tuna .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Keep in mind that athletes should always rely on a food-first approach to realizing their dietary goals , versus consuming supplements in the form of powder , shakes , gels or pills .
There&amp;rsquo ; s no replacing the synergy of the macro and micronutrients found in food versus a manufactured product that often promises more than it delivers .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Also important to remember is that older athletes who limit themselves to moderate workouts of less than an hour , need nothing more than a healthy , protein rich diet to fuel their workouts .
But for master athletes with performance goals and a rigorous training and competition schedule , it&amp;rsquo ; s always wise to seek professional advice from a certified dietitian/sport nutrition specialist who can further individualize the special dietary needs of master athletes .

Thirty long years of living in fear of being discovered that someone finds out you&amp;rsquo ; re not as strong as they think &amp;hellip ; of wondering why you never felt love from the man you loved ; why you let him erase you by cheating , by beating you and leaving you for dead when he&amp;rsquo ; s through .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Who knew ? Like so many others who have only recently spoken up about the physical and psychological abuse they had to endure in silence for years , precious few knew .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This is a side of Sweeney that will leave fans and even longtime friends flabbergasted .
Best known for her bubbly stage presence , Sweeney will stun audiences with these revelations .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; No one really knew , &amp;rdquo ; Sweeney says during a rehearsal break .
&amp;ldquo ; I just smiled my way through it .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It was the death of Aretha in 2018 that somehow spurred Sweeney on to write this play .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I wanted to pay tribute to her .
But I realized everyone was going to pay tribute , get up on stage to sing a couple of her songs .
So I decided to listen really closely to those songs , to dig deeply into the lyrics and see how they coincided with her life and my own .
That touched me to the core .
So I simply put my story together with her songs .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I don&amp;rsquo ; t think this is what audiences are expecting .
But that&amp;rsquo ; s the reality .
I&amp;rsquo ; ve been telling the stories of others on stage for so long that I felt it was time for me to tell my own .
I was in an abusive relationship for years upon years .
I felt if I could tell my story , maybe it would help others come forward to say someone is doing something to them that must be stopped .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sweeney met Aretha only once , about 30 years ago , when the latter performed in Montreal .
Sweeney had spotted Aretha&amp;rsquo ; s tour bus outside a downtown hotel and planted herself in the hotel lobby for hours until she came down .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; We spent about four hours together , talking and shopping , &amp;rdquo ; Sweeney recalls .
&amp;ldquo ; I had two portraits made of her .
I gave her one on stage that night and she signed the other for me .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I was a huge fan then as I am today .
When I heard the Queen of Soul died , I cried and cried , and began to reminisce about her life and the effect she had on my life .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not unlike Aretha , Sweeney began her musical career singing in gospel choirs in her hometown of Cleveland .
At 15 , she was already making a name for herself in local cabarets and performing on tour with Ronnie Love and the Drifters .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; When she was 20 , Sweeney was invited by Trevor Payne to join his famed Montreal Jubilation Gospel Choir .
She has stayed put in Montreal the last 35 years and become a staple on the jazz and blues scene here and throughout the country , performing with the likes of C&amp;eacute ; line Dion and Mary J .
Blige .
She stole the show in such local productions as Ain&amp;rsquo ; t Misbehavin&amp;rsquo ; and Eubie , and took on a slew of film and TV roles , sharing the screen with , among others , George Clooney and Wesley Snipes .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I did a lot of laughing in public in those days , but people never know what many must go through in life and how hard it is to just keep it together on stage .
Now the secret is out .
Now people will know why I&amp;rsquo ; m always singing I Will Survive .

" data-portal-copyright= " Dave Sidaway " **28;44350;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1666901 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; At 86 , Normand Plante faces the prospect of death in an almost matter-of-fact manner .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; I have a terminal illness , &amp;rdquo ; the retired federal civil servant says simply .
&amp;ldquo ; Pancreatic cancer .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Plante still has enough energy to get dressed and venture outside with his son , but he knows that he will eventually have to seek &lt;a href= " https : **33;44380;TOOLONG .
care&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And since late November , Plante has been preparing for that eventuality by visiting Montreal&amp;rsquo ; s first palliative day centre , located in C&amp;ocirc ; te-des-Neiges in what used to be the Church of St .
Raphael the Archangel on Lajoie Ave .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite the waning appetite that comes with cancer , Plante has enjoyed lunches prepared by a chef in a restaurant-grade kitchen at the day centre .
His eyes light up when he describes getting a massage to lessen his pain while listening to a music therapist play the harp .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Perfect ! &amp;rdquo ; he says , flashing an OK sign with his right hand .
&amp;ldquo ; They provide us with the utmost care .

Raphael Palliative Care Home and Day Centre opened in November after a $10-million fundraising campaign to finance the renovation and expansion of the greystone building that&amp;rsquo ; s nestled among tall pine trees .
Initially , though , some area residents were concerned that the centre might lead to an increase in the number of ambulances driving through the neighbourhood .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But when the concept was explained to them during a public consultation , residents of the nearby Le Sanctuaire condo complex responded by donating furniture to the 12-bed home .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It was important to have the community buy into this , &amp;rdquo ; said Marco Ottoni , vice-president of the home&amp;rsquo ; s board of directors .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src= " https : **33;44480;TOOLONG .

" data-portal-copyright= " Dave Sidaway " **28;44515;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1666903 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; Despite its Catholic legacy , the centre is non-denominational .
Word spread quickly that a new palliative-care facility would open soon in the heart of the city , based on the concept that small is beautiful , that the terminally ill are entitled to the finest and most dignified care .
All its services would be free .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Within a matter of months , St .
Raphael&amp;rsquo ; s &amp;mdash ; as Ottoni likes to call it &amp;mdash ; lured a top palliative-care specialist from the &lt;a href= " https : **30;44545;TOOLONG " &g; .
University Health Centre&lt;/a&gt; as well as highly experienced staff from &lt;a href= " https : **33;44577;TOOLONG .
Mary 's Hospital&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Dr .
Krista Lawlor said she was won over by the idea of combining a palliative day centre with a hospice .
After practising palliative medicine for 20 years at the MUHC , she joined St .
Raphael&amp;rsquo ; s as its medical director .
Lawlor began her career at the former Royal Victoria Hospital training under Balfour Mount , considered the father of palliative care in North America .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But Lawlor had grown weary of &amp;ldquo ; swimming upstream&amp;rdquo ; in a large hospital setting that prizes &amp;ldquo ; prolonging life at all costs .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Hospitals are not designed for dying well , &amp;rdquo ; she said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; At St .
Raphael&amp;rsquo ; s , it&amp;rsquo ; s hard to tell the difference between the guests of the day centre and the staff and volunteers .
No one wears a uniform .
During lunch , the staff eat at tables with the patients and guests .

The non-profit centre plans to hold vernissages in the atrium to raise funds , connecting the community with those spending their final days within its walls .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; One of those patients was 71-year-old &lt;span dir= " auto " &gt;Nicole L'Archev ? que&lt;/span&gt; , who had lung cancer .
On an early December afternoon , L&amp;rsquo ; Archev&amp;ecirc ; que sat in her bedroom eating yogurt after being given a therapeutic sponge bath by a nurse .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; They are so tender , &amp;rdquo ; she said of the staff .
&amp;ldquo ; They give me hugs .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She peered out a large window at the snow-covered street .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; They say I have three and a half months , &amp;rdquo ; &lt;span dir= " auto " &gt;L'Archev ? que&lt;/span&gt; added .

She died on Dec .
&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Palliative care is not just about easing pain and symptom management .
It&amp;rsquo ; s also about preparing for death .
To that end , patients are encouraged to produce legacy art and to make music and voice recordings .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Anne Lacourse , the music therapist , recalled how a young mother who was dying decided to record something for her children .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; In the recording , she tells her children what to do when they reach a certain age , &amp;rdquo ; Lacourse said .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And when words are hard to come by , it&amp;rsquo ; s the music that soothes their agony and that can help reconcile a son or daughter who might be estranged from a parent .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The music goes very quickly to the heart , &amp;rdquo ; she noted .

" alt= " Ryan Poehling leads stretching exercises at a Laval Rocket practice in October .
Gymnasts , hockey players and swimmers all require different levels of flexibility .
" data-portal-copyright= " Dave Sidaway " **28;44982;TOOLONG " 1 " data-license-id= " 1684498 " /&gt; &lt;p&gt; The last time I wrote a controversial column about stretching , I got a record number of readers questioning the rationale behind eliminating stretching before a workout .
That was 20 years ago , when stretching was an integral part of almost all warmups .
Nowadays , not only has stretching disappeared from most pre-workout routines , American exercise scientist James Nuzzo is recommending removing stretching as one of the foundational pillars of physical fitness .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nuzzo doesn&amp;rsquo ; t believe stretching is irrelevant .
He just wonders why trainers still prescribe stretching exercises for healthy individuals who want to improve their overall fitness , and why evaluating flexibility is still part of the curriculum of fitness tests delivered in schools and fitness clubs .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; To be clear , the type of stretching in question is static stretching , which requires holding stretches for 10 to 30 seconds .
Dynamic stretching , also called range of motion exercises , are movement-based and don&amp;rsquo ; t require any one position to be held for any length of time .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Static stretching does not clearly and consistently improve health and function , &amp;rdquo ; Nuzzo said in a &lt;a href= " https : **33;45012;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;recent online edition of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; .
&amp;ldquo ; Moreover , flexibility can be maintained or improved by exercise modalities that cause more robust health benefits than stretching ( e .
resistance training ) .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Stretching was once heralded as an important element in preventing sports injuries and post-exercise soreness , but many of its fitness and health benefits have been debunked .
Current &lt;a href= " http : **33;45047;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Canadian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href= " https : **33;45082;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;American&lt;/a&gt; exercise guidelines make no mention of stretching in their recommendations for pursuing a healthy , active lifestyle .
Yet assessing flexibility still remains part of most fitness testing protocols , and the American College of Sports Medicine still recommends stretching all major muscle groups two to three days a week , claiming &amp;ldquo ; flexibility training will help to improve balance and postural stability .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Flexibility testing is done using the sit-and-reach test , which entails sitting on the floor with both legs extended out in front of the body and reaching toward the toes .
Flexibility is assessed based on how far the fingers can extend toward the toes .
A single measure of flexibility , the sit-and-reach test evaluates range of motion in the hamstrings and lower back .
Since flexibility differs from joint to joint , it&amp;rsquo ; s possible to demonstrate a lack of mobility through the hips , hamstrings and lower back but still score in the upper percentiles for flexibility through the shoulders or ankles .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Nuzzo performed a scientific review to see if acing the sit-and-reach test has any health or functional benefits , including fewer injuries , reduced risk of falls among the elderly , a longer life , superior athletic performance , improved aerobic capacity , muscular strength or body composition or a better quality of life .
It turns out that whether flexibility is great , good or mediocre , there is little impact on any of these measures of health and fitness .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In fact , when it comes to static stretching , there are plenty of reasons to be cautious .
Stretching temporarily reduces the amount of power the muscles can deliver , thereby reducing overall gains in speed , strength and power .
But Nuzzo says there&amp;rsquo ; s another good reason to forget about prescribing stretching as part of a general fitness program : it&amp;rsquo ; s a waste of time .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Time previously dedicated to stretching can be reallocated to activities that cause more robust health benefits , including improved flexibility , &amp;rdquo ; said Nuzzo .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Strength training exercises that move a joint through its full range of motion can improve flexibility .
In fact , studies have shown weight training has the potential to increase sit-and-reach scores by 10 to 25 per cent .
Aerobic exercise boosted sit-and-reach scores by 10 to 17 per cent .
While those scores are lower than the improvements in flexibility gained through static stretching ( nine to 43 per cent ) , they&amp;rsquo ; re in the ballpark .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Keep in mind that greater flexibility isn&amp;rsquo ; t always a goal worth pursuing .
Joint hypermobility has been associated with joint pain and a greater risk of injury .
A healthy joint is strong and flexible enough to perform sport-specific movements with efficiency and power .
That means gymnasts , hockey players and swimmers all require different levels of flexibility .
The same goes for a hockey goalie , kicker in football and martial arts aficionado .
Each sport has its own requirements when it comes to what kind of stretching delivers the best possible performance with the lowest risk of injury .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; So , should you stretch or not ? The choice is yours .
If your yoga class makes it easier for you to get in and out of a squat , bend over to pick something up off the floor or skate from end to end during your beer league hockey game , then stick with it .
Or if your physiotherapist suggests improving flexibility or range of motion in order to improve movement patterns or fend off specific aches and pains , go for it .
For everyone else who is otherwise healthy but feels guilty about avoiding stretching , consider this a hall pass .

Believe it .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We&amp;rsquo ; re talking burgers and burritos , among other munchies , infused with hemp at Hello 123 , a vegan brasserie in **26;45467;TOOLONG ; ce .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As anyone who has ever attempted to smoke or eat it in search of a buzz , hemp &amp;mdash ; although derived from cannabis like marijuana &amp;mdash ; does not contain the necessary THC content of the latter to get one high .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Hemp , evidently the first crop ever cultivated by humankind 10,000 years ago , is primarily known for its industrial use in everything from rope to paper , beauty products to clothing .
But food ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And so it is that a vegetarian , Gazette photographer Pierre Obendrauf , and an unrepentant carnivore , yours truly , have descended upon Hello 123 with a dollop , bordering on gusts , of skepticism in sampling some of the dozen hemp-laden items on the menu .
We console ourselves with the fact we can take relief , if necessary , from the fully loaded booze bar .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But no gagging here as we bite into the Ezra Burger , a hemp/sunflower patty with pickles , sweet onions , Boston lettuce , tomato , toasted hemp hearts and the Ez Sez Secret Sauce .
It is to die for , save that it won&amp;rsquo ; t kill you .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Unlike those &lt;a href= " https : **33;45495;TOOLONG .

&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s not dry as one might expect , &amp;rdquo ; Obendrauf says .
&amp;ldquo ; And it doesn&amp;rsquo ; t fall apart .

Mine is that neither Hello 123 co-owner Eric Blake or filmmaker Ezra Soiferman , for whom the Ezra Burger is named , will reveal the contents of the secret sauce &amp;mdash ; although they insist it&amp;rsquo ; s all above board .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Obendrauf is even more blown away with the Cauliflower Tahini with Hemp and Sunflower Balls , with , among other ingredients , salsa , pomegranate , quinoa and sesame , served with lemon tahini and chimichurri sauces .
&amp;ldquo ; The sunflower brings everything out , &amp;rdquo ; Obendrauf marvels .
&amp;ldquo ; An entirely new food sensation for me .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We&amp;rsquo ; re both bullish on the Superfood Burrito Bowl , filled with kale , guacamole , cashew cream and hemp seeds .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Then it&amp;rsquo ; s on to the unique Hello 123 Caesar Salad , which packs coconut bacon , oat-seed crackers , tamari almonds and hemp seeds .
But which , unlike most Caesar salads , won&amp;rsquo ; t have loved ones and colleagues dashing away from you due to high levels of garlic emanating from your breath .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; No shortage of hemp-filled brunch and desert items , either : pancakes , waffles , banana French toast , Blue Smoothie Bowl and &amp;hellip ; mmm &amp;hellip ; &amp;nbsp ; an avocado chocolate mousse , also to die for .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The N .
Hello 123 , open since June , has a sister operation , H123 in St-Henri , and two Kupfert &amp;amp ; Kim cousins in the city .
There are also two Hello 123 locations in Toronto .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; The whole idea about introducing hemp to our menus is that it is so high in protein , fibre and nutritional benefits , &amp;rdquo ; Blake says .
&amp;ldquo ; The hemp seed , while not having a distinctive smell , has a bit of a crunch to it .
It&amp;rsquo ; s just a matter of integrating it with the other ingredients to bring out all the flavours .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It&amp;rsquo ; s not just the contents of the food that are striking .
It&amp;rsquo ; s also the presentation .
The colours and composition of each plate hold up with the grandest of those in haute cuisine salons .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There had been this misconception in some quarters that vegan is not very sexy , &amp;rdquo ; Blake says .
&amp;ldquo ; But that&amp;rsquo ; s changing a lot now these days with social media .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; Ten to 15 years ago , many people assumed vegans ate only salads and nuts , but &lt;a href= " https : **33;45595;TOOLONG .

This is wholesome fare that holds its own with any tasty food out there .

He just couldn&amp;rsquo ; t believe vegan could actually taste good .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Wait till he tries the hemp burger .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; But his father might have difficulty reconciling the fact that the same hemp used in the burger was also used in my boots , belt , sweatshirt , socks pants , glasses , wallet and business card , &amp;rdquo ; says filmmaker Soiferman , whose latest doc is Hemp for the Homeless .
&amp;ldquo ; I&amp;rsquo ; m hemp to toe , and eating it , too .

&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;p&gt; Montreal Mayor Val&amp;eacute ; rie Plante gets mail .
Lots and lots of mail .
About 35,000 pieces over 2018 and 2019 until the end of November .
Most are emails , with a sprinkling of snail mail .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But few could possibly guess what leaves the mayor&amp;rsquo ; s letter-writers most in a dander .
Hint : it&amp;rsquo ; s not two-legged life-forms , and it&amp;rsquo ; s not two- or four-wheeled vehicles .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Naturally , one might expect the bulk of the correspondence would deal with such citizen beefs as construction , traffic , public transit , parking , snow removal , sidewalks , bike lanes , &amp;nbsp ; Airbnbs , Camillien-Houde , cal&amp;egrave ; ches , the postponing of Halloween , shutting down of the Jeanne-Mance Park north softball field , Bill 21 and , oh yeah , the budget .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Not even close .
Far and away , the topic that appears to have left Montrealers howling the most over this two-year period has been &amp;hellip ; coyotes ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Yup .
Nearly 2,400 have communicated their feelings on coyotes to the mayor .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Compare that with the mere 353 who had budget concerns in 2018 .
Or how about that hot-button issue of the Camillien-Houde thoroughfare ? Only 292 expressed their views there .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Surely , the ever-slippery issue of snow removal must really resonate .
Not as much as some of us skeptics would imagine .
Just 400 sounded off .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; But there must have been an uproar over the mayor&amp;rsquo ; s &lt;a href= " http : **34;46051;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;suggestion to move Halloween to the following night&lt;/a&gt; .
Yeah , right .
All of 35 people registered their outrage .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There&amp;rsquo ; s no way that the sudden and arbitrary closure of the &lt;a href= " http : **34;46087;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Jeanne-Mance Park softball field&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash ; where there was no public consultation &amp;mdash ; didn&amp;rsquo ; t bring out brickbats by the score .
Would you believe that only a handful bothered to write the mayor and register their displeasure ? But such was the case .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Given the reaction to coyotes , one would have every reason to suspect that the subject of &lt;a href= " http : **34;46123;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;now-banned cal ? ches&lt;/a&gt; would certainly provoke much heated reaction one way or another .
Not really .
Only about 150 writers have made their opinions known on this front .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After coyotes , &amp;nbsp ; the next highest grouping of correspondences dealt with the Technoparc ( 1,248 ) and a zero-waste contest ( 752 ) .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As for the coyotes , residents , particularly in the Ahuntsic&amp;ndash ; Cartierville borough , which has had the highest number of issues , &lt;a href= " https : **33;46159;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;have reason to be alarmed&lt;/a&gt; .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the summer of 2018 , there were an inordinate number of coyote sightings and three attacks on young children in the area .
The city sent out teams to attempt to shoo the coyotes away from certain areas .
The city also advised residents to keep a lid on food waste and not to feed or get chummy with the critters .
But what probably led to the ire of some citizens and animal-rights activists was the plan to euthanize overly aggressive coyotes .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Unbeknownst to many , coyotes have called the island of Montreal home since the early 1970s , and efforts to relocate and/or eradicate them have been mostly unsuccessful .
&amp;nbsp ; Since 2017 , there have been around 1,000 sightings and about two dozen incidents of attacks on humans .
The city set up a coyote hotline to deal with the dilemma , but has come to terms with the fact that coyotes are part of our biodiversity .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jimmy Zoubris , special adviser to Plante , is impressed that about 35,000 citizens took the time to go to the city website to track down the mayor&amp;rsquo ; s email and snail-mail addresses .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; There is a real commitment here , &amp;rdquo ; Zoubris says .
&amp;ldquo ; It&amp;rsquo ; s not like just going to Facebook or Twitter .
It&amp;rsquo ; s people who took the time to sign in and send a message .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Zoubris is also shocked by some of the results .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; People always have strong opinions when it comes to animals .
So it&amp;rsquo ; s understandable the issue of coyotes would touch a nerve for many , especially those who live by the river where the coyotes often roam , &amp;rdquo ; Zoubris says .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &amp;ldquo ; But you&amp;rsquo ; d think other issues , like the budget .
Or Airbnbs , &lt;a href= " http : **34;46194;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;which is a huge issue in the Plateau , &lt;/a&gt; only drew nine letters .
Or bilingualism , in the sense that some think the mayor is speaking too much English , would draw a lot of mail , particularly with Bill 21 in the spotlight , but only 55 commented on this .
&amp;rdquo ; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And in a city where drivers lament they can&amp;rsquo ; t get there from here or there because of all the construction and detours , would you believe only 42 expressed their displeasure on the subject of traffic over the first 11 months of this year ? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Incidentally , all the writers get a response , occasionally from the mayor but most times from the departmental official responsible for the particular issue .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Though they might not be well represented on the mail front , Zoubris does point out that citizens have expressed themselves , often rather vociferously , on Facebook and Twitter when it comes to cal&amp;egrave ; ches , Camillien-Houde and the softball field .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As anyone in the world of politics can attest , few ever write to express their admiration for the person in office .
Even still , it&amp;rsquo ; s somewhat astonishing that Plante&amp;rsquo ; s office has received only 21 notifications of &amp;ldquo ; bons mots&amp;rdquo ; &amp;mdash ; good sentiments in no particular area on a job well done &amp;mdash ; this year .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Don&amp;rsquo ; t know if Mayor Plante can count on getting more &amp;ldquo ; bons mots&amp;rdquo ; for the coming year , but she had better brace herself for plenty of feedback in a couple of other areas , such as her insistence on proposing the naming of an REM station after Bernard Landry .
In November alone , she had already received 300 reactions .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And then there&amp;rsquo ; s the issue that just never goes away : &lt;a href= " http : **34;46230;TOOLONG .
target= " blank " rel= " noopener " &gt;Camillien-Houde Way&lt;/a&gt; .
Wild guess : talk about possibly turning it into a one-way thoroughfare , among other schemes , &amp;nbsp ; could trigger a tsunami of mail .
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Or not .
