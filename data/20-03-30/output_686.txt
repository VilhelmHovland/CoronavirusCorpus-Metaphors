CLEVELAND HEIGHTS , Ohio -- This photo , taken on Ormond Road in Cleveland Heights , depicts a new way of socializing that has emerged during this time of virus .
People are coming out of their homes and gathering in little groups -- while practicing social distancing , of course !  The little lawn party pictured is something I 've been hosting for a few days now .
I call it " Putting the Play in Plague .
"  I find it quite moving that in a time of crisis we are reminded of how much we depend on one another , and how comforting it can be to see one another face-to-face , instead of on a phone or laptop screen .
