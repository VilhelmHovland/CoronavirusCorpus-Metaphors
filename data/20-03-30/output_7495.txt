Smith , who started using gender-neutral " they/them " pronouns last year , took to Instagram Monday to let fans know their upcoming third album , formerly titled " To Die For , " would no longer be released May 1 because of this " weird , upsetting and unprecedented time .
"  " I have done a lot of thinking the last few weeks and feel that the title of my album and imminent release does n't feel right , so I have come to the decision to continue working on the album and make some important changes and additions , " Smith wrote .
" I will be renaming my album and pushing back the release date -- both of which are to be confirmed at this time , " Smith continued .
" Do n't worry , though , there will be an album this year , I promise ! " .
