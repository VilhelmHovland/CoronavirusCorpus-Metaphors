The Three Phases Of Doing Business Through COVD-19  After the initial panic , New Zealand businesses have done what they do best ; adapted their offerings in the face of the life-changing Covid-19 outbreak .
But what will follow ?  Boredom , says two of New Zealand 's employment trend experts .
Jane Kennelly , Frog Recruitment Business Director predicts the three stages of adaptability will become apparent ( or will reveal themselves ) as the world navigates the most significant economic disruption it has seen in almost a century .
" For now , it 's about adapting .
Kiwi businesses are nimble and have responded creatively to the situation , " says Kennelly .
" Businesses have had to , and are , making some tough calls .
They are reshaping teams and adapting their workforce to match the current market .
One of our employers , a pharmaceutical company , has pivoted quickly and hired a temporary backup team to manage the volume of orders -- all within 24 hours .
Another , an IT business , has merged all their employees to form a ' monster IT help team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennelly revealed that in the last week , Frog Recruitment 's communications with more than 2500 businesses nationally including government agencies showed that this first phase , or ' the hit ' , has seen many Kiwi businesses doing well , pointing clearly to the strength of their ' number 8 wire ' ingenuity .
" Millions of New Zealanders mobilised their home offices , education providers moved to online learning , and bricks and mortar businesses amped up their e-commerce offering .
"  Jane Davis , Director of The Flourishing Institute leads New Zealand businesses through workplace wellbeing programmes .
She agrees with Kennelly but says the second phase in the Covid-19 cycle may be complacency .
" As New Zealanders get used to being in their bubbles , boredom will be the issue that needs combatting .
A few industries will emerge as the clear winners in this second phase -- these are likely to be entertainment providers , streaming organisations , app development companies , online training and online services .
" Plugging people into programmes to keep them focussed on positive mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing distractions , thriving through change and building healthy thinking patterns ideal for employees in their home bubble , " says Davis .
According to both Kennelly and Davis , the good news is that if business did n't have enough time to plan for the swift arrival of phase one -- they have time to act quickly for the second one .
" Digital transformation , already a trending pre-Covid-19 topic , is set to become a pillar to reinvent business models .
From gyms and dance studios going to online classes , to medical supply firms exploiting augmented reality to create new training programmes , to landscape design businesses offering video walk-through consultations when the landscaper ca n't be there in person .
"  When the third and last phase happens , a slow ' return to normal ' will occur .
Our way of life may have been disrupted to the extent that previously considered perks , such as working from home , flexible hours and four day working weeks , become the ' new normal ' .
" Kiwis have been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , remote working systems and flexible hours , " says Kennelly .
" Making the right moves now could evolve organisational models , increase productivity , add a competitive advantage to employers and allow business to come out of this extraordinary time as stronger , hardier , more productive and innovative .
