Canada is going through a singular period , the greatest crisis in the lifetime of the very oldest of us .
A pandemic illness , the virulence of which we still do not have a proper measure , has jolted the entire nation .
It has had an impact , literally , on every single Canadian .
The emergency measures that , by degrees , have been put in place -- and the ones which yet may have to follow -- have brought the country to something very close to a standstill .
Canadians have in the main responded with commendable understanding and acceptance to the recommendations of our health authorities , and to the advice and suggestions from all leaders , premiers and the prime minister .
Saying so does not mean they have abandoned their own critical judgment , which is a very good thing .
Canadians are ready to criticize when necessary , and react with spirit -- as we saw with the attempt at political overreach by the minority Liberal government -- when they perceive , or hold serious doubts about , any particularly stray course of action or policy .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single Canadian  That said , at the moment , they are above all concerned with the health of their fellow citizens , their families and loved ones , and themselves .
That concern towers over all others , which is the obvious and just reason they have conceded to the vast changes in daily life and the normal run of everyday matters -- the self-isolation , social-distancing , cancellation of meetings -- the virtual shutdown nationwide of normal social contact and exchange .
For all , it is hard , a time of anxiousness .
Made even more so because it comes attended , and unavoidably so , by other concerns .
Together with the continuous apprehension COVID-19 brings to the minds of everyone , most people have a host of secondary -- secondary , but highly significant -- worries to cope with .
Highest on the list , and right next to the pandemic , is " employment " in the broadest sense -- whether those who work for a living believe they can endure the period of lockdown without their normal wages , even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vital routine of how people have managed their most important financial concerns has been disrupted , and so many must be , even at this stage of the crisis , in continuous worry about seeing it through to the pandemic 's still unknown end .

Paul Chiasson/The Canadian Press  Will their jobs be there at all when matters revert to something like normal ? The " what happens after this ? " question is tormenting many a mind , while those same minds bear the anxiety of the health crisis itself .
There is a whole other group , those whose job is actually their business .
In the case of tens of thousands , even hundreds of thousands of truly small businesses , this shutdown -- and I mean no blasphemy -- is their personal Calvary .
Many have struggled for five , 10 , 20 even 30 years , working the longest hours , living on a very tight personal budget , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair salon , book shop , taxi service -- the list is endless -- come to some stability and profit .
Others are in the " buildup " stage , having more or less recently launched a coffee shop , a boutique , a small repair outfit , a carpentry business .
They have not yet reached the " stability " point and are burdened with debt , overhead , rents .
Now they face a crash .
In some cases this is the cruel end of their life 's ambition .
What worries and grief these good souls must already be bearing .
In some cases this is the cruel end of their life 's ambition  Even all this is to say nothing of farmers , and foresters , and oil workers , the legion of workers in our various resource industries , who were getting hammered even before COVID-19 spread its cruel hand across the global economy .
Even in imagination it is difficult to grasp how they must , in all their great numbers , be feeling .
COVID-19 has had this one massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy of the nation , and thereby paralyzed the personal economies of millions of Canadians .
It has imposed an epidemic of economic stress and anxiety on our whole population .
This is the point at which health and the economy relate to each other .
The economy must function for our health system to function and be sustained .
Personal economic concerns , while obviously not an illness in themselves , will inevitably , if severe enough and widespread , constitute a crisis equal in scale , if not even greater , than that we are now enduring .

Alex Filipe/Reuters  I do not know if it is possible , in the middle of a genuine national crisis , to gather the intellectual and financial resources to deal with a future , but imminent , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing must somehow find the serious attention and planning and urgency we are bringing to COVID-19 .
Even as , in the darkest of ironies , we are still attempting to combat the coronavirus .
It is an inescapable fact , an axiom of implacable logic , that we must deal with the first crisis first .
But the economic crisis to come is already boiling beneath us .
Lives are already being upended .
The stability of normal times is in disruption .
And millions go through their days disturbed in spirit and likely their mental health as well .
In the past social distancing has helped to mitigate the effects of pandemics .
