The Growing Chaos Inside New York 's Hospitals  Health-care workers in New York face a looming shortage of personal protective equipment .
" If we do n't get the proper equipment soon , we 're going to get sick , " one I .

by Misha Friedman / Getty  Matthew Morrison is a thirty-six-year-old E .
doctor at BronxCare , a hospital in the South Bronx , which has a large Dominican population .
He speaks " medical Spanish , " he told me .

" On Wednesday , he treated a woman in her mid-sixties with telltale signs of COVID-19 : fever , shortness of breath , coughing up blood .
She was terrified .
She told Morrison , with tears in her eyes , " Doctor , no me siento bien .
" Before admitting her , Morrison gave her the same speech he 'd been giving all his patients : " You 've come to the right place .
We 're here for you .
Unfortunately , we do n't have a specific treatment for COVID , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People were anxious .
Another likely COVID-19 patient , an older African-American man , had taken a cocktail of medication -- Percocet , Benadryl , an antibiotic -- to treat his aches and fever , before arriving , disoriented , at the E .
New York City has become an epicenter of the crisis , with more than ninety-six hundred confirmed cases as of Sunday , and hospitals are struggling to keep pace .
BronxCare workers were in the process of setting up a separate triage tent , to manage COVID-19 patients .
Until then , the E .
's waiting room would be crowded with the " worried well , " or , in this case , the worried sick -- people with coughs and flulike symptoms that might or might not be signs of COVID-19 , who 'd come because they wanted to get tested .
Most were sent back home , with orders to self-quarantine .
Tests were being reserved for people sick enough to be hospitalized .
" It 's challenging , " Morrison said .
" Nobody has any experience with this at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
We can all read the Wikipedia page on the Spanish flu , but that does n't show what it was like or describe the experience of people who had actual responsibility .
" He was avoiding news stories about health-care workers who 'd died of the virus : the doctor in Wuhan , the one in Seattle .
But it was hard not to think about them as he donned and doffed his personal protective equipment and pictured all the things that could go wrong , the ways he could inadvertently touch a mask or a glove and become exposed .
" The biggest fear is realizing that you 're probably going to get coronavirus no matter what you do .
"  Jessica van Voorhees , a forty-three-year-old E .
doctor at Methodist Hospital , in Park Slope , Brooklyn , found herself watching the disaster with morbid curiosity .
" There is something that 's sort of fascinating about watching a pandemic unfold in real time , and seeing the exponential curve , " she said .
She was working night shifts on March 8th , 9th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" At first , it was a big deal .
Like , ' I think we just had a COVID patient ! ' Then we had three .
And every day it more than doubled .
" When I spoke to her on Thursday , the E .
was getting hundreds of patients with coughs , fevers , and sore throats -- most of whom just wanted to be tested for the virus .
As in the Bronx , they were being sent home , with orders to self-quarantine .
Testing had to be reserved for the very sick .
For that reason , van Voorhees had concluded that the official numbers are " totally off .
Way off ! " She went on , " I think we 're probably testing a small percentage of people who come in here and are clearly positive .
"  They were starting to see " bounce-backs " : people who came to the E .
with a mild illness and returned days later , having swiftly deteriorated .
A forty-two-year-old schoolteacher came in , with the usual symptoms : fever , body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super fit , healthy , and worked out all the time .
Never smoked , " van Voorhees said .
" We said , ' Look , we think you have the virus .
Go home and self-quarantine .
' " The man returned three days later , weak and disoriented .
" He walked into triage and then fell out of his chair , " van Voorhees said .
X-rays revealed a severe viral infection in both lungs .
He was hospitalized and put on oxygen .
" It 's so weird to see these people who are basically healthy struck down by it , " van Voorhees said .
And it was troubling to see sick patients getting worse .
" Normally , when a patient has pneumonia , you hospitalize them and give them antibiotics .
As the antibiotics start to work , they get better .
But , with COVID-19 , there 's no direct therapy , just supportive care , so they get worse .
" Patients were often admitted to the hospital needing oxygen .
" I check on them the next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , they 've been intubated and moved to the I .
"  E .
doctors pride themselves on being able to " flex and surge , " she said -- to adapt to the rush of patients on holiday weekends , or during a normal flu and cold season .
So far , the emergency room had managed to adapt : the hospital had transformed an outpatient surgical clinic into a COVID unit , and built temporary walls in an exam area to create more private rooms .
But the makeshift facilities were starting to fill up .
And anxiety was building around the supply of personal protective equipment -- masks , gowns , goggles .
Van Voorhees had started to think about the prospect of being overwhelmed .
" What 's it going to feel like ? " she wondered , as she contemplated running out of I .
beds , choosing which patient to intubate and which to let die .
She went on , " The vibe at work is this feeling of impending doom .
"  Health-care workers faced an additional threat : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the New York State Nurses Association wrote in a letter to Governor Andrew Cuomo that it was " painfully obvious " that their forty-two thousand nurses did not have the equipment necessary to protect themselves from the virus .
" It goes without saying that if our nurses , physicians and other workers are exposed and taken out of commission ( because they are on quarantine or themselves sickened ) that the hospitals will cease to function , " the letter reads .
At Montefiore Medical Center , in the Bronx , Michelle Gonzalez , a thirty-year-old intensive-care nurse , was monitoring several COVID-19 patients , who were critically ill and on ventilators .
The hospital has multiple I .
, and hers specializes in respiratory issues , making her unit a hot spot .
She was already feeling burned out .
" When you sign up for nursing , you sign up for the possibility of being exposed to certain things -- H .
, AIDS , a handful of bacterias and viruses .
But I never thought I 'd signed up for a pandemic that we 're not prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided information about the supply of items like protective masks and gloves , but the gear was clearly being rationed .
" If we do n't get the proper equipment soon , we 're going to get sick , " she said .
Since the first week of March , when the virus arrived in the city , there had been " confusion and chaos " around safety protocols , she said .
At first , the hospital mandated that COVID-19 patients be put in " negative-pressure " rooms , which keep contaminated air from circulating .
Then word came down that regular rooms were O .
Nurses were told to use only N95 masks , which more efficiently filter out airborne particles .
" Then they said on Sunday we no longer need N95 masks , " Gonzalez said .
" We 're going to switch to surgical masks and a face shield .
" It did n't seem likely that the surgical masks had become safer overnight ; it was the hospital 's way of managing the equipment shortage .
Advertisement  In a " donning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put on personal protective equipment , an instructor introduced a new rule : store your used mask in a plastic bag , so you can reuse it later .
Gonzalez pushed back .
" I said , ' What kind of infection control is this ? Is n't that just incubating germs ? ' " The instructor seemed embarrassed .
" He said , ' Listen , I 'm only telling you what the hospital is recommending .
' And he added , kind of under his breath , ' Does n't mean I agree with it .
' "  Gonzalez was scared .
" My manager told me , ' Michelle , you 're fine -- you 're thirty .
You do n't have anything to worry about .
' But I live with my ninety-year-old grandmother , and my dad , who is sixty-two , diabetic , and immunocompromised .
I want to be able to go home and sleep at night , knowing I did n't give it to them .
" She decided to take matters into her own hands , along with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , " she said .
They obtained a stash of N95 masks and devised a system of working in pairs , so that they could better conserve them .
She began to acquire a reputation .
" Medical doctors from different specialties , and my own doctors , keep coming by and asking me for protective gear , because they have nowhere else to get it .
"  She was most concerned about colleagues in the emergency room , which was short-staffed even before the outbreak .
" It 's always overpacked , " she said .
" Nurses there have sixteen patients .
" A new screening tent had been set up , and " suspected COVID " patients were being shuffled to a waiting area along one wall , where they sat on stretchers , shivering and coughing into the open air .
An E .
nurse had told Gonzalez that she was still wearing a surgical mask .
None of the hospital staff had been tested for the virus .
They were supposed to be monitoring themselves for symptoms .
" It 's almost like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told me that she 's a good nurse .
" I love my job .
I love when I clean a little eighty-year-old person and they tell me , ' Thank you .
' I love providing care not just to a patient but to their family .
" But , in the past week , she 's been having regrets about her choice of career .
" I 'm so in debt because of nursing , " she said .
" I 've paid thousands of dollars for my education , and I 've felt abused throughout this whole pandemic .
It 's like my life and my job -- my well-being and my job -- are in conflict .
" She knew it was about to get worse .
" Right now , it 's the calm before the storm .
Just watch .
