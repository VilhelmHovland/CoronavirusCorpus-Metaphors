( File Photo by Emilie Nadeau via @francoislegault/Twitter )  Quebec 's premier and public health director struck a cautiously optimistic tone on Sunday , saying aggressive physical distancing measures appear to be working to slow the spread of COVID-19 .
Horacio Arruda , the province 's director of public health , said the number of cases announced in recent days falls below what was originally projected .
" Each day now , we have less than we thought we would have , " he said , while declining to share precise numbers .
Arruda repeatedly smacked the back of his hand to demonstrate the concept of " flattening the curve " of new infections .
" The speed with which we 're increasing is spreading out , and the more we do that , the longer we 'll take to reach the plateau , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transmission might mean that the province will take longer to reach a peak , but it would help ensure hospitals stay below capacity .
" I do n't want to choose who I 'm going to keep on a respirator because I do n't have enough , " he said .
Premier Francois Legault said there were 2,840 cases of COVID-19 in the province on Sunday , which is an increase of 342 from the day before .
He noted that the percentage increase was smaller than in recent days , and the number of people hospitalized , at 192 , remains far below the capacity of 6,000 .
The number of deaths remained unchanged at 22 .
" We can see the daily increase in confirmed cases seems to be stabilizing , " he said .
" Public health authorities tell us our efforts are paying off , so do n't give up .
"  However , he said the numbers could rise again , and he urged Quebecers to remain positive .
Arruda and Legault noted that the worst-hit regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health authorities would increasingly need to take a regional approach to fighting COVID-19 .
Montreal reported 1,361 cases as of Saturday night , an increase of 146 from the day before .
Mylene Drouin , the regional director of public health , said that included 82 health-care workers and outbreaks in over 20 health-care facilities , affecting some 240 people .
She said the most heavily-affected neighbourhoods are those surrounding downtown , but stressed that cases were rising all over the island .
" When we look at this data we see that , yes , there are more cases in the central neighbourhoods , but community transmission is sustained , and extends to the whole of Montreal , " she said , while noting there was " a certain stability " in the number of new cases in recent days .
She said the city was asking Montreal police to begin ticketing citizens who are n't respecting orders to isolate or avoid gatherings , or those who test positive and who are n't co-operating with health authorities .
Mayor Valerie Plante , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of emergency it first declared on Friday , partly in response to a need to quickly provide additional support to the city 's homeless population .
Plante and Drouin said they did n't rule out tougher measures , such as limiting movement off the island or between neighbourhoods , if the situation worsens , but stressed that further restricting personal freedoms would be a last resort .
On Saturday , the province announced that eight regions of the province would be off limits with police checkpoints on major roads in and out of those areas as of that afternoon , with travel only allowed for essential purposes .
