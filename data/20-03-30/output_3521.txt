CLINICIANS at University College Hospital and engineers at University College London have designed a new breathing aid that has been approved for NHS use .
The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) device helps coronavirus patients with serious lung infections breathe more easily without the need for oxygen ventilators that are in short supply .
It has been used " extensively in hospitals in Italy and China " where they are credited with allowing 50 per cent of coronavirus patients to be treated without mechanical ventilation .
One hundred were delivered to the Euston Road hospital today ( Monday ) ahead of mass roll-out across the country .
UCLH critical care consultant Professor Mervyn Singer said : " These devices will help to save lives by ensuring that ventilators , a limited resource , are used only for the most severely ill .
" While they will be tested at UCLH first , we hope they will make a real difference to hospitals across the UK by reducing demand on intensive care staff and beds , as well as helping patients recover without the need for more invasive ventilation .
"  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Formula 1 motor-racing industry has been involved in the manufacture , using technology normally designed for building the fastest cars on the planet to manufacture of medical devices .
" F1 's ability to respond rapidly to engineering and technological challenges allows the group to add value to the wider engineering industry 's response , " a statement said .
