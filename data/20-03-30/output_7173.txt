I am pushing forward , but I am afraid .
I am waking up , getting breakfast ? my son always wants chicken broth and rice for some reason , which ' is not the hill I 'm going to die on right now ? working , always keeping my head down and attending to the next task .
The next post , the next increment of time to try to be a good parent who does n't rely too heavily on screen time , the next meal that needs to happen , the need to be at least a little active so my son will sleep and I will not spin screaming into a mess of pent-up energy .
But then I am not going to sleep , anyway .
