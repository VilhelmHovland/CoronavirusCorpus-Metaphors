The ' brain ' : Emergency Coordination Center at the heart of Spokane 's COVID-19 response  Mon .
, March 30 , 2020  Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich , at top , visits the operations and planning room at the Spokane County COVID-19 Emergency Coordination Center , Friday , March 27 , 2020 .
Based in the Spokane Fire Department 's Training Center , the Covid-19 ECC brings local law enforcement , government and civilian agencies together to facilitate a coordinated response to the local coronavirus pandemic .
( Colin Mulvany / The Spokesman-Review )  There are no flames to spray water on .
There is no criminal to handcuff .
In an unassuming , out-of-the-way building near Spokane Community College , scores of elected leaders , emergency responders and public health officials coordinate their response to the crisis facing Spokane County .
But in the Emergency Coordination Center , the current challenge is unlike any its leaders have ever taken on before .
" Let 's face it , we usually have something to go out and fix .
Knock that fire down .
Deal with the snow event , the earthquake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us are law enforcement , firefighters .
now we 're coordinating an effort of a public health emergency and an economic emergency .
"  The task is two-pronged , to address the increasing public health crisis presented by COVID-19 and the economic fallout caused by tight restrictions needed to limit the virus ' spread .
" This is a public health emergency that is unfortunately causing a social emergency , and the only way that the public health emergency and the social emergency can be addressed is by us working collectively through this kind of structure , " said Bob Lutz , health officer of the Spokane Regional Health District .
As health officer , Lutz sits atop the power structure of the Emergency Command Center .
Knezovich looks to the doctor for his marching orders , and the sheriff 's task is to marshal the resources public health officials call for to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus .
Those efforts have been headquartered at the emergency coordination center , which Knezovich likens to the " brain " of the emergency response system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was launched two weeks ago , just as Spokane County was receiving its first positive test results for COVID-19 .
But the virus was rapidly spreading in the Puget Sound area before that , and local leaders were dusting off their own pandemic response plans in preparation for its eventual impact east of the Cascades .
" A lot of groups were working on things independently rather than interdependently , " Lutz said .
That , Knezovich warned , is dangerous .
The more those silos are formed and entrenched , the more difficult they are to break down .
Spokane City Council President Breean Beggs and Knezovich agree that at least initially , the city of Spokane and its regional partners were not working hand-in-hand .
" It is getting better .
It has to get better because there 's not enough resources in this community to run dual operations .
We will not survive , " Knezovich said .
The city and county started in " two different places , " Beggs said .
" It 's easy to look back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had that ECC stood up a week earlier , " Beggs said , but he added " I 've noticed an improvement in the quality of the meetings in terms of people being on-task and effective and coordinated .
"  The city of Spokane had already formed its own incident management team prior to the establishment of the regional effort and had made progress in its own response plan .
But it soon realized " we 're more impactful when we 're working together on this , " said Mayor Nadine Woodward .
" We 've been able to integrate all of the cities within the county so that we can work collaboratively , " Woodward added .
The progress the coordination center has made in just two weeks is " remarkable , " Lutz said .
The emergency coordination center is helmed by the county 's health officer , medical program director and medical examiner .
Beneath those three is a network of support services , including Greater Spokane Emergency Management , the regional emergency response network overseen by the sheriff .
Local hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the system .
Since its launch two weeks ago , the number of employees physically present in the coordination center on any given day exceeds 50 , but the total number of employees among partner agencies is far greater .
They include emergency management professionals , financial experts , planners , public information officers and more .
Knezovich likens the scope of operations to an accordion .
The greater the emergency , the wider he 'll expand the coordination center 's resources .
" We 're into new ground .
This is one of those hundred-year-type events , " Knezovich said .
This week , leaders worked to establish a three-part , long-term plan for the next 30 , 60 , and 90 days .
Woodward said the center had some time to do long-term strategic planning last week , but Friday brought news of the county 's first death attributed to the virus as the number of confirmed cases eclipsed 100 .
Though they 've planned through 90 days , officials have no idea how long the coordination center will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely predict how long it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to run its course .
" We will be here as long as the need is here , " Knezovich said .
" I 'm hopeful we 're not here 90 days from now .
"  There are myriad challenges regional officials are still working through .
Lutz announced plans for an alternate care facility at the county fairgrounds in Spokane Valley .
The concept is to have a space where people who are sick , but do not yet or no longer require hospitalization , can be isolated and receive treatment in a place that is n't their home .
The details of the alternate care site remain a work in progress , and officials hope to release more information in the upcoming week .
The coordination center is also where local leaders , particularly elected officials , are trying to wrap their heads around the economic impact of the coronavirus .
With so many Americans already living paycheck to paycheck , Knezovich said the true brunt of rapid layoffs will begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do we take care of not just the homeless , but how do we take care of these newly laid off , unemployed people ? " Knezovich asked .
As both the public health and economic crisis worsens , volunteer efforts have sprouted up throughout the area .
In Knezovich 's view , that 's a testament to the people of Spokane .
But to be efficient , Knezovich argued these volunteer drives -- everything from food collection to mask-sewing -- should be coordinated .
" There has to be a single clearinghouse for all of that , " Knezovich said .
The coordination center has also become a single source of information related to the region 's response to COVID-19 .
Its Facebook page , Spokane COVID Response , has already attracted more than 2,600 followers , many of whom tune in for daily 10 a .
briefings that are livestreamed .
" The most important thing we can do is keep people informed , " Knezovich said .
" My biggest concern is the level of panic and fear we 're facing .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
But Knezovich hopes its impact sticks in the minds of local leaders .
" Once this is over , I hope you just do n't put us back on the shelf and forget about us .
I hope that you take a look at what we have and what we do n't have and truly invest in the needs that we have , " he said .
