As he grappled with the spread of the novel coronavirus , he turned to the unusual hobby he has elevated to art .
Story continues below advertisement  Four years ago , he enlisted his children to help build 100 scenes with Lego plastic bricks about the life of Harold Ballard , the irascible former owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs .
Last week , he unveiled his latest project : the story , told entirely with Lego , of the infamous Peter Pocklington , the former Edmonton Oilers owner .
On March 16 , Cadieux began to post a different scene on Twitter each day , and says he will do so for 100 days .
" It 's a good time to do this , " the lifelong Oilers fan says .
" People need a diversion .
As long as there are people out there that enjoy it , it makes my day .

" I play with them more now than they do , " Cadieux says .
" I consider myself a creative guy .
I am not good musically but when it comes to Legos , I can put everything down .
"  A script accompanies each representation with material gleaned from The Puck Stops Here : The Amazing Life and Turbulent Times of Peter Pocklington .
Each scene fits on a 12-inch by 12-inch base and uses roughly 250 colourful interlocking pieces .
He sketches it first , and then constructs it over an hour or two .
" I have more free time now than I have had in a long time , " Cadieux says .
" Just because people are socially isolating , that does n't mean artists have to stop creating .

, Pocklington sold his Christmas presents to friends .
At 15 , he sold his father 's car while his dad was out of town .
By 25 , he was the youngest Ford dealer in Canada , and by 29 , he owned the most successful dealership in the country .
It supplied Pocklington with the capital he needed in 1975 to purchase a half-interest in the Oilers , then a fledgling franchise in the World Hockey Association .
It was n't long before Pocklington bought out co-owner Nelson Skalbania and acquired the rights to a teenaged Wayne Gretzky , whom he used as a bargaining chip to gain entry in the NHL .
The Oilers won four Stanley Cups in a span of five years -- and then Pocklington shocked the sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and lives in California , has always been a wheeler and dealer and at times has run afoul of the law .
" I try to be creative and grab the context in one snapshot , " Cadieux says .
He launched his previous project on the acerbic Ballard in March , 2019 , after working on it at his home in Red Deer for four years .
He originally hoped it would turn into a Lego coffee-table book , but after publishers showed little interest , he began to post the scenes online .
" I thought it would get a ton of attention , but it drew a small niche crowd , " Cadieux says .
" A few people got a kick out of it , but maybe for Maple Leafs fans it was just too painful .
"  Pocklington won a poll Cadieux posted on Twitter with M ? t is leader Louis Riel , Terry Fox and Gretzky as the other Lego candidates .

Although he does not want to spoil the surprise , he says future dioramas will feature the Oilers winning their first Stanley Cup and the incident in which Pocklington was held hostage by a gunman at home in Edmonton .
When the kidnapper was released from prison , Pocklington gave him money to start a new business .

Cadieux did not plan to release his Pocklington stories until later in the year , but pushed up the publication date after the coronavirus left people isolated at home with no sports to watch .
