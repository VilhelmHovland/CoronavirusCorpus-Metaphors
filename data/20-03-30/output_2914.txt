In a statement issued here , the Oxfam gave a five-point plan that would enable poor countries to take action to prevent the spread of disease and build the capacity of health systems to care for those affected .
The pandemic has caused widespread suffering in rich countries , overwhelming some of the best healthcare systems in the world .
But with the disease now spreading to many poor countries where high levels of poverty and inequality risk accelerating the disease , the public health challenges are even greater .
Nearly 3 billion people across the developing world do not have access to clean water , millions more do not have access to adequate healthcare and live in crowded slums or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up 70 percent of health workers and carry out most unpaid care work , it will hit them the hardest .
Jose Maria Vera , Oxfam International Interim Executive Director , said : " In Mali there are three ventilators for one million people .
In Zambia , one doctor for 10,000 people .
We know from Oxfam 's experience of fighting Ebola that with rapid action , this disease can be stalled and its catastrophic impact stopped .
But we must act now and on a scale never seen before .
" Without urgent , ambitious and historic action , we could easily see the biggest humanitarian crisis since the World War Two .
"  The Imperial College estimates that in the absence of interventions , the coronavirus could have caused as many as 40 million deaths in the coming year .
The Imperial College estimates that at least 40 million people across the globe could lose their lives unless urgent action is taken .
Oxfam calculates that doubling the health spending of the 85 poorest countries , home to nearly half the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than 10 per cent of the US fiscal stimulus to fight Coronavirus .
While some donor institutions have begun to increase funding , the scale is not anywhere near the immense size of the challenge .
Oxfam is working with local partners , ministries of heath and key UN agencies in 65 countries to respond to the crisis and help save lives .
In Cox 's Bazaar , Bangladesh , where over 855,000 Rohingya are living in makeshift camps , Oxfam is already scaling up preventive measures like soap distribution and handwashing stations at communal facilities to help 70,000 refugees .
In the Zaatari camp , Jordan , the largest Syrian refugee camp in the world , Oxfam has already started hygiene and hand washing awareness for 2,000 children and aims to reach 78,000 people with water , hygiene and sanitation .

Oxfam is calling for the G20 and other national governments to tackle the virus head on by agreeing to an ambitious Global Public Health Plan and Emergency Response .

We can only beat this pandemic if we act in solidarity with every country and for every person .
No one is safe until we are all safe .
