Because of the COVID-19 crisis , the Linn and Johnson County courthouses , starting this week , will not allow the public inside , except those needing emergency orders such as protective orders and involuntary commitments .
Sixth Judicial District Chief Judge Patrick Grady issued the order late Friday for Linn County and Monday for Johnson County .
People needing a domestic abuse protective order or attending a domestic abuse hearing or an involuntary commitment order for someone with mental health or substance abuse issues will be allowed in the courthouses .
Anyone citing either reason may bring one nonlawyer with them .
Other individuals allowed access , Grady ordered , will be those seeking emergency orders for hospitalization , elder abuse and dependent adult proceedings ; those seeking motions to quash garnishments of wages ; and landlord/tenant hearings in which the landlord alleges the tenant poses a clear and present danger .
Some of these proceedings also require two individuals to attend , and they will be allowed .
Grady , in his order , said anyone who needs to electronically file documents on the public computers in a court civil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other documents in the clerk 's drop boxes , may have access .
Those attending magistrate court for initial appearances , turning themselves in on a warrant or needing to go before a judge for an initial appearance in associate District Court also will be allowed to enter , but they can not bring another person with them .
Others allowed in the courthouses will be those who need to appear for a criminal plea or sentencing hearing .
All these individuals will be directed to the court clerk 's office when they arrive .
Nobody under age 16 will be allowed , unless they are a defendant in a criminal case or traffic court .
Grady said people should tell court security at the entrances why they are in the courthouses , and they may be directed to call the clerk 's or county attorney 's office .
People coming into the buildings also will have their temperature taken with a digital thermometer and/or asked health screening questions .
Linn County and Johnson County sheriff 's deputies have the discretion to refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not comply with Grady 's order .
