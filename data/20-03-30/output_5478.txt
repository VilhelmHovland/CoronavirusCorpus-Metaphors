In over 15 years of writing opinion pieces in newspapers , very few have had such a positive response as this AFR column today proposing that the Prime Minister pivot his current virus response paradigm ( including almost 1,000 immediate likes on LinkedIn ) .
It is now enclosed for your benefit below :  What we do not need is a national lock-down for six months , or any suggestions of such .
Many businesses are confused by the current narrative , which implies that they need to go into hibernation for half a year .
On the information available to us , that is totally wrong .
The prime minister has done an excellent job of quickly closing the borders and conservatively managing community expectations .
But a six-month hibernation paradigm will dramatically accelerate Australia 's move towards outright depression and mass unemployment , which is where we are heading .
This will have vastly greater economic and human costs than the demonstrably superior strategy of a short-term lockdown followed by a modified " new normal " that only quarantines the minority of vulnerable Australians over the age of 70 that represent less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different tests we can carry out .
The first , called a PCR test , evaluates whether the virus is currently in our bodies .
A second , antibody test , assesses whether we have had a past infection that make us immune to it .
We are doing the first , not second , test currently , which means we are missing all the recovered individuals and hence materially underestimating the population-wide infection rates .
The consequence of this is that we are overestimating fatality rates because of the massively underestimated denominator pertaining to infections .
In the one country with a large outbreak , expansive PCR testing , and a decent history of fatalities , we know that for anyone under the age of 50 the death rate is comparable to the flu at circa 0 .
per cent .
And this is , again , an upwardly biased estimate of the true fatality rate .
Conversely , for anyone over the age of 70 or 80 , the South Korean data tells indicates that fatality rates are much more serious at 6 .
per cent ( 70-79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectively .
We also know that within the next few months we are likely to get access to mass-market anti-viral drugs , such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir , that nascent empirical data suggests could further reduce fatality rates .
These drugs are already being used on an experimental basis in hospitals throughout the world .
And speaking to scientists who are currently working on coronavirus vaccines , they are emphatic that effective vaccines will be available within a year .
What this tells us that we do not need to shutdown , or hibernate , the entire economy for three or six months to combat the virus .
Yes , we need to permanently change human behaviours in the immediate term by quickly embracing a hard lockdown for , say , one month .
This is not because the virus is a problem for most Australians .
It is about radically reducing the transmission rate , or so-called " R0 " , from two to three people per infection to ideally less than one person per infection , which would in theory kill-off the pathogen .
While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward pressure on the transmission rate slows the number of infections ( ie , flattens the curve ) and disperses pressure on our health system over time to avoid overwhelming it .
Interestingly , our real-time COVID-19 tracking systems demonstrate that Australia is outperforming its North Atlantic peers both in terms of the growth of new infections , and , more importantly , in respect of the increase in fatalities .
Once human behaviours permanently change through the much-needed shock of a hard lockdown ( eg , we learn not to congregate in high densities , shake hands , and so on ) , most of Australia needs to quickly get back to work via a " new normal " that ruthlessly mitigates transmission .
The new normal must involve extremely aggressive testing for both the virus and anti-bodies to identify who is immune .
One of the problems with existing testing for the presence of the virus has been delays in obtaining results .
The US has , however , addressed this challenge through a new 15 minute test .
If Australia can get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we could regularly evaluate most of labour force every three months .
This should get easier over time as immunity rates increase , reducing the need for re-testing .
The new normal should also encompass an ongoing lock-down , or quarantine , of anyone over the age of , say , 70 , who should be strongly encouraged to avoid human contact until we secure tractable anti-viral drugs and/or a cheap , mass-market vaccines .
The alternative to this approach is an economic depression that could result in one-quarter of working age Australians losing their livelihoods .
This will have much greater adverse economic , health and welfare consequences than a short lockdown followed by a new normal that protects vulnerable persons on a targeted basis until the virus is eliminated .
My team has constructed real-time forecasting models for the peak in new virus cases that condition on the intensity of the containment strategy each nation adopts .
On the basis of the currently available information , the peak in America 's new infection numbers should be realised between April 9 and April 18 assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korea and 75 per cent as effective as Italy .
In a more gloomy scenario where the US is only half as effective as Italy , the peak new infection numbers materialise around the end of April .
Applying the same assumptions to Australia , we find that the peak in new infection numbers is likely to be between early to mid April .
If we do a really poor job at containment , this is deferred to around April 20 .
It is important that Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg quickly embrace the short containment strategy proposed here to minimise the permanent damage that is being done to the economy .
Numerous small businesses have advised me they are shutting down for half a year because they have been told that is what they should do .
This is madness , and throws 90 per cent of the population under a bus to protect a small minority .
Daniel Ball 30th March , 2020  There is always quite a difference between theory and the practice .
For example : Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are they going to be put in large Aged Care Facilities ? Does this mean no visits from Family and friends ? The mental health of &gt;70 's will deteriorate quickly without family contact , and i would think many elderly people would prefer to die with their family with them in their last days .
Matt Daniell 30th March , 2020  Nice work Chris , and thank you for sharing both your AFR article and your team 's research .
If we work on the idea that the virus is n't going to be a big problem anymore , ( say end of April ) , then how much damage is already done ? Both virus dependent and independent .
Easier to see the independent factors at the momo - the price of crude is probably going down much more ( and there is no storage capacity left ) and the FRA-OIS spread is still saying there is mistrust amongst the global lending giants despite QE infinity .
That is n't a virus related problem , yet it will have an impact on markets .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mental health of individuals ) wo n't take a month let alone 6 months of hibernation that the PM proposes .
Where are the business leaders to advise him on this crazy idea ? The high risk cohort ( over 70s ) requires most of the ICUs and hospital resources ( flattening the curve idea ) hence self-isolation of this age group should be no brainer ( I , as a 68yo would gladly do it ) .
It should immediately be followed by testing for immunity before being released ( with a proof ) for normal living .
Majority of this age group are retirees and have no need to go to any work place anyway .
Mark 30th March , 2020  It would n't only be &gt;70 that you would need to quarantine but would it ? it would be anyone with a co-morbidity .
Also possibly anyone in hospital for other conditions or recovering from major ailments/surgeries .
Not to mention a lot of these people will still need food , medical and other types of care .
Who will give that to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have addressed spread between the general population ? Jury is still out on Hydroxychloriquine , Azithromycin , Z-Pack .
Plenty of the countries you mention using it are still seeing deaths &amp; in some cases many deaths .
For all we know those it 's helping reduce the severity and duration of symptons in , were going to survive anyway and it 's not otherwise making a difference to the clinical outcomes of those that are dieng .
Upon some digging there remains questions marks about the French Doctor and study .
The chinese study was not in the affirmative .
In NY some doctor 's are prescribing a course to ever person that walks in the door , so hard to determine efficacy as most people would still be expected to survive anyway .
It 's good to have hope , but lets keep an open mind and not pin it all on one cure before the works been done .
Tony Sved 30th March , 2020  A prescient and exceptionally well written analysis .
This should be forwarded immediately to the PMs office Dr Anthony Sved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions are made in this article that have not yet been definitively backed by peer-reviewed science and could significantly skew data and projections : 1 .
Once you 've contracted covid-19 and recovered , you are forever immune .
Additional waves of virus spread once lock-down rules are relaxed will have minimal impact .
The antiviral drugs actually work .
Let 's hope for humanity each of the assumptions above come to fruition , but banking on that today is a gamble  Lloyd C 31st March , 2020  Laughable to think there will be no permanent damage given 30 years of no recession .
First we had the bushfires after decades of inadequate burns now we 're going to have the economic equivalent .
Mark Dawson 31st March , 2020  Always nice work .
Thanks Chris .
I believe we need around twenty five million test kits .
One for every man woman and child .
Then we 'd know for sure if we had the virus or not and whether to isolate .
Winter is approaching and you 're not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something more ? Until this happens mass confusion will remain .
Allan McDougall 31st March , 2020  And the PCR test is not demonstrably accurate .
It can not determine the amount of the virus in the body .
It overstates the rate of infection .
