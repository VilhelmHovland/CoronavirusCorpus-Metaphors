Photograph : Anthony Wallace/AFP via Getty  We already have two silver bullets to control the spread of coronavirus .
Those weapons are soap and our own forbearance .
It 's not a lot .
But with more than half a million cases of infection reported worldwide , and in the absence of anything more muscular on the immediate horizon , we 're going with it .
Hands are being washed until knuckles are stripped bare .
Front doors are staying shut , bar emergency runs for toilet roll , burger buns or a jolt of fresh air .
Throughout the crisis , Ireland 's approach has been decisive and measured .
One day , though , decisive and measured might not be enough .
We are only at the beginning of the curve .
Mathematicians can debate whether its course is exponential or quadratic , but no one is arguing about the direction in which it is going .
Fear has turned us into a self-policing state , a nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next stage , the medium term , when the virus is still raging , but fatigue and distress have set in ? What other sacrifices might we be asked to make ?  The steps we have already taken have been extraordinary and unfathomable .
The norms on which our interactions depend -- social mores , delicately negotiated over centuries -- have been upended overnight .
Fear has turned us into a self-policing state , a nation of rule-followers and quarantine-shamers .
We step into traffic to avoid passing too close to one another .
We tut at hapless space invaders in supermarkets .
For some , the climate of self-correction has provided an irresistible excuse to take their frustrations out on others -- like the woman who messaged me on social media describing children as like " germ-ridden animals " , their parents as " shameless single mothers " .
Mostly , though , this revolution has unfolded with astonishing ease and solidarity .
Things we once thought were unaffordable , unconscionable or even unconstitutional are materialising into being overnight .
Trollies disappearing from hospital corridors .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote .
Fifty thousand people volunteering to the health service .
Rents frozen .
Airbnb apartments flooding rental sites .
In these very early days , before our new temporary mortuaries fill with people we love , you could almost forget the rest of it .
The economy shuddering to a stop .
Hospital staff pleading on social media with businesses to donate personal protective equipment .
Draconian new measures allowing the Minister for Health to detain people indefinitely or quarantine entire areas , passing through the D ? il on Thursday with virtually no resistance .
Resistance would have been crass and futile .
The video footage from Italy of vulnerable , naked backs of patients lying leaden on hospital trolleys , fighting for every breath , was deterrent enough for the most stout defender of civil rights .
The Irish Council for Civil Liberties said the measures were " necessary to protect our rights to life and health " .
Terror has made the most bullish of us acquiescent .
If the steps we 've already taken prove not to be enough , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullet we could use , one deployed early on and with remarkable efficacy in China , South Korea , Taiwan and Singapore .
It 's the track-and-trace strategy , using citizens ' personal data .
Murmurings are already beginning here from academic groups , tech companies and some European governments that elements of this technology could be used elsewhere .
Up to 60 per cent of transmissions happen before someone is aware they are infected .
Just think , it 's suggested , how much easier contact tracing would be if you did n't have to rely on flawed human memories .
We need to tread carefully .
Temporary measures have a way of becoming permanent .
Rights ceded are not easily recovered  In South Korea , when someone is diagnosed , potential contacts get a text alert allowing them to click through for more details about their movements .
China 's Alipay Health Code , a subsidiary of Alibaba , uses a traffic light system to instruct people when they can go out or have to stay in .
No explanation required or given : just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also reportedly sends information to the police .
In Hong Kong , foreigners arriving into the country are issued with tracking bracelets .
Israel is mobilising the country 's domestic security agency to track people potentially infected with the virus  All over the world , another red line is being washed away .
Covid-19 is helping to normalise to mass government surveillance of citizens .
Here , the European Commission has moved to permit the use of aggregated phone data to fight Covid-19 , as a temporary measure , with the promise that the data will be deleted once the crisis passes .
Google and Facebook are both looking at how anonymised location data could be used to help stop the spread .
The pandemic will pass , but the measures we take now might not  Right now , in our state of heightened fear , it might feel reassuring to know that this technology is already in our pockets .
There may even be genuinely non-invasive ways it could be used -- anonymised data used to identify clusters , say .
But we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent .
Rights ceded are not easily recovered .
Now , precisely when we are panicked , is the time when we should decide where our next red line is .
If the European Union decides that tracking the movements of individuals with coronavirus would be beneficial -- is that a red line ? Or if the data is shared with law enforcement -- is that one ?  As technology advances , it never becomes less invasive .
It never demands less of us .
Even now , our privacy is not some pesky impediment to the greater good .
It 's not some trip to Cheltenham .
The pandemic will pass , but the measures we take now might not .
The writer Yuval Noah Harari posited this scenario recently : " If corporations and governments start harvesting our biometric data en masse they can .
not just predict our feelings but also manipulate our feelings and sell us anything they want -- be it a product or a politician .
