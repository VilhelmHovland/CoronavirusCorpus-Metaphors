Netanyahu in quarantine after close aide contracts coronavirus  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is self-quarantining after a close aide tested positive for the coronavirus , his office said Monday .
The prime minister was expected to take a test by Tuesday , officials said .
Results from a previous test that Netanyahu took March 15 were negative for the virus .
Israeli media said the infected aide was at a Parliament session last week attended by Netanyahu and opposition leaders with whom the prime minister is trying to build an emergency coalition to combat the coronavirus pandemic .
" The preliminary assessment is that there is no need for the PM to self-isolate as he was not in close contact with the patient , nor did he meet with her , " an Israeli official said , according toReuters .
In a statement that followed , the official said Netanyahu had " decided that he and his personal staff will be in isolation until the epidemiological investigation is completed .
