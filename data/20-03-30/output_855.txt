In Spain , thousands on coronavirus front lines become infected  Medical staff in Madrid react as neighbours applaud from their balconies .
Health workers currently account for 14 percent of all coronavirus cases in Spain Sergio Perez/Reuters  Granada , Spain - Spain 's uphill struggle against coronavirus showed worryingly few signs of easing on Monday , as government officials confirmed 12,298 health workers had now been infected by the virus , and the country 's total number of cases - 85,195 - is now greater than that of China .
As Spain moves into its third week of lockdown , with further restrictions on non-essential workers set to be enforced on Tuesday , the daily death toll from coronavirus eased slightly compared with 24 hours earlier , down from Sunday 's record total of 838 to 812 .
Percentage-wise , the increase of recorded new coronavirus cases appears to be dropping a little as well .
More :  But medical resources to combat the pandemic are widely reported as running dangerously low in some areas .
On Monday , the Spanish daily El Pais published data indicating hospital intensive care units in eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowing .
And there are fears that any let-up in the pace of infections may come too late .
As for the high number of infected health workers , " this is arguably the most alarming news of all " , said Jose Hernandez , assistant professor of sociology and specialist in social health policies at the University of Cordoba .
Exclusive : Inside hospital battling coronavirus in Spain 3:01  " It indicates that either they do n't have the sufficient resources to fight it , or the measures to avoid contagions are not sufficiently enforced because the staff are so overloaded with cases , " he told Al Jazeera .
" Or , as I fear , both .
"  " The health system is getting overwhelmed , and the ratio of staff per patient is far lower than is desirable .
"  In what risks becoming a vicious circle , " this will lead to an increasingly precarious health system because the staff working in areas like intensive care are specialised " .
" And if they 're the ones that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical students in their final year " - as has been proposed by Spanish authorities - " sounds like good news " .
" But they 'll need time to adapt to the work here , and that can contribute to a greater shortfall in the service , " says Hernandez .
Unconfirmed reports on Monday suggested conditions for patients and staff in the new 5,000-bed field hospital that opened last week in Madrid 's gigantic IFEMA trade centre were , in some cases , dangerously precarious .
Data also suggests the number of health workers affected by coronavirus already represents around 14 percent of all cases .
That is much higher than in Italy , the European country initially worst hit by coronavirus , but where , as of March 29 , official figures showed the number of infected health workers stood just below nine percent .
Neighbouring Portugal , which has roughly 20 percent of Spain 's population , has 853 infected medical staff .
Spain 's current total is more than 12 times that number .
In China , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures - whereas here , a certain number of strategies for passive resistance to it are emerging .
Jose Hernandez , University of Cordoba  Hernandez warns that , given data is being collected with widely varying criteria in different countries , it is hard to establish real comparisons between , for example , China and the United States .
In Europe , he points to Italy as the best reference point for Spain , because " the healthcare system there is very similar , as is health workers ' education , and socially we 're not that different either " .
" In China , too , there seems to be a general acceptance of the confinement measures - whereas here , a certain number of strategies for passive resistance to it are emerging .
"  While Spain 's director of emergency health services , Fernando Simon , who has been the public face of the government 's handling of the pandemic so far , himself tested positive for coronavirus , the country is bracing for an intensified state of emergency set to start on Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Saturday that all non-essential economic services would be suspended for two weeks .
The tougher lockdown , initially planned to begin on Monday , was partially delayed at the last minute to allow businesses more time to prepare , a move that Hernandez argues does little to raise the public 's faith in the government 's planning .
" More than the decision itself , the way it was announced so quickly could make people think that they 're not being fully informed of the real situation .
But some may also wonder , if they were largely following government instructions previously , why these new measures have to be taken at all .
