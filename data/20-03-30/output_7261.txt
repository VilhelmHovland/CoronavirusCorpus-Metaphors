I texted my very good friend , a microbiologist and professor/researcher in immunology .
He knows his shite .
I texted and asked him if he had any retort to those who think the Covid -- 19 crisis is overblown and not any more serious than the flu .
His verbatim response : " Yeah , tell them they 're a fricking idiot " He 's a serious straight shooter , not at all political , and as far from a " sky screamer " as you can get .
Sorry , I just had to take the pulse of someone I know personally and trust .

Do people who say it 's just the flu still exist ? Best I can tell , tons of the loudest people saying that nonsense quietly shifted on that point about 10 days or so ago .

His verbatim response : " Yeah , tell them they 're a fricking idiot "  Is this supposed to make people less weary about their economic situation ? I think most people understand the illness is serious , but its worth discussing whether the economic impact is even worse .
