Pope backs UN chief 's call for global ceasefire  Pope Francis delivers weekly prayer on Sunday .
It was streamed over the Internet from inside the Vatican  Urges for focus on Covid-19 ; says the disease knows no boundaries  VATICAN CITY Pope Francis on Sunday backed a call by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a global ceasefire so the world can focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic .
Speaking at his weekly blessing , delivered from the official papal library instead of St .
Peter 's Square because of the lockdown in Italy , Francis specifically mentioned the appeal Guterres made in a virtual news conference on Monday .
Saying the disease knows no borders , Francis appealed to everyone to " stop every form of bellicose hostility and to favour the creation of corridors for humanitarian help , diplomatic efforts and attention to those who find themselves in situations of great vulnerability " .
More than 6,62,700 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus across the world and 30,751have died , according to a Reuters tally .
About a third of the deaths have been in Italy , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an extension of a national lockdown almost certain .
Confirmed cases in Italy stood at 92,472 , the second-highest number of cases in the world behind the United States .
The Vatican , a 108-acre city-state surrounded by Rome , has had six confirmed cases and on Saturday spokesman Matteo Bruni said tests were carried out after a priest who lives in the papal residence tested positive .
Bruni said the pope and his closest aides did not have the disease .
The social effects of the pandemic have drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two , the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide .
The United Nations has been trying to mediate an end to conflicts in countries including Syria , Yemen and Libya , while also providing humanitarian assistance to millions of civilians .
Guterres warned that in war-torn countries health systems have collapsed and the small number of health professionals left were often targeted in the fighting .
In his Sunday address , Francis also appealed to authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisons around the world , many of them overcrowded .
UN chief appeals for ceasefire  UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had last Monday issued an appeal for ceasefire .
" The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war " , he said .
" That is why today , I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world .
It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives , " he said .
Guterres issued his ceasefire call in a bid to protect civilians in war-ravaged countries like Yemen and Syria -- largely spared so far by the virus -- whose barely functioning health care systems could not handle its spread .
