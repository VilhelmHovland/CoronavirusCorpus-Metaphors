Myths , distribution , unions : Newspapers and challenges during the pandemic  Share Via :  Mumbai is not getting its daily dose of newspapers lately , but things could change starting tomorrow .
Did you get your newspaper this morning ? If you live in Mumbai then you definitely have n't .
As far as other parts of the country go , it seems iffy .
Though journalists are braving the COVID-19 outbreak and stepping out to do their reporting , readers seem to have decided to stay away from broadsheets .
In some parts , readers believe that newspapers can carry the virus and , therefore , have decided to maintain a ' safe ' distance .
In urban areas , many societies have banned the entry of delivery boys altogether .
Meanwhile , in Mumbai , the vendors association had a fallout recently , and newspaper distribution has completely stopped .
The " myths "  " Let 's not go by rumour mills and fear mongers .
The newspaper delivered to your home is safe .
And this fact is endorsed by several reputable authorities .
WHO , perhaps , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has stated that couriers or packages delivered to homes ( and that would include newspapers ) carry a very low risk of infection , even if they come from an infected zone ! " This statement was issued by Raj Jain , CEO , Bennett Coleman and Company ( BCCL ) , recently .
Maharashtra and Kerala are the worst affected states in terms of those who 've tested positive for the Coronavirus .
And , this seems to have affected the newspaper industry in the two states .
Almost all districts of Kerala have been hit by the pandemic , " Overall , people are getting influenced by various myths and rumours circulating in social media about newspapers being carriers of COVID-19 , " says M V Shreyams Kumar , joint managing director , Mathrubhumi  M V Shreyams Kumar  To tackle the issue , Kumar says , they decided to make a video , " We have produced a video , which depicts our efforts in the hygienic production of the paper .
The video showcases the hands-free , automated process of printing , sanitised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distribution of our newspapers .
The entire transportation and handling , right up to the newspaper distribution , is done in fumigated trucks with masked and gloved handlers .
" Kumar feels one should only go by WHO or the Ministry of Health , government of India recommendations , and not WhatsApp forwards and social media buzz .
" Neither the WHO , nor India 's Health Ministry , has issued any directives against the distribution of newspapers to arrest the spread of the contagion .
On the contrary , both the central and state governments have lauded the role of the print industry in disseminating authentic and curated information , and updates on the pandemic , " he asserts .
Mumbai : Most affected  After they get printed and bundled , the newspapers get transported to various depots .
In Mumbai alone , there are 80 depots from where the vendors collect the newspapers and display them at their stalls for over the counter sale .
Most of these stalls are in railway stations , near bus stands , or in busy public places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best service in Mumbai is disrupted and no one is stepping out .
So , that channel of distribution is completely defunct .
Sanjeev Bhargava  The other important channel ( or , the most important channel ) is the network of delivery agents who pick the newspapers up from the depot and deliver it to your doorstep .
" The lockdown has , naturally , impacted the lives of the delivery boys , and because of that , our delivery system has got impaired , " says Sanjeev Bhargava , director , brand - TOI .
He adds , " Mumbai is the worst hit .
The distribution will start only by April 1 ( tomorrow ) .
"  The Brihanmumbai Vruttapatra Vikreta Sangh ( BVVS ) , the union which represents all 80 depots in Mumbai , had decided that it will stop distributing newspapers for two days on March 23 .
The distribution has not resumed since .
Hari Pawar , principal secretary of BVVS , says their demands were not met by the publishers and that is why they had to stop distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , travel allowances for the safety and security of vendors .
We also made it clear that if any of the delivery boys , or vendors , who will have to step out to distribute newspapers , get infected , the publishers will have to bear the entire treatment cost .
The publishers and we could not reach an agreement , " says Pawar .
" The Times Group is at the forefront of discussions with the trade unions that manage the last mile .
We are also at the forefront of getting the most relevant concessions for the delivery boys in terms of movement permits , " counters Bhargava .
It is not only the Corona scare that is an issue in Mumbai , says Pawar .
" In Maharashtra , the vendors get 30 per cent commission , while we get 25 per cent , and it has remained the same for so many years .
Our demand is that the commission must be increased , especially during the pandemic , we must get more , " he adds .
April first onwards  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting between Maharashtra 's industry minister Subhash Desai , Pawar and the publishers , it has been decided that the circulation must continue .
So , from April 1 , the vendors will let the publishers know how many copies they want and , if some remain unsold , the publishers will buy them back .
