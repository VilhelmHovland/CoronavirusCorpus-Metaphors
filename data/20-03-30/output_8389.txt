Answering Kids ' Questions about COVID-19  Breadcrumb  What better way to learn about how to talk with children about COVID-19 than getting a child 's perspective ? In a seven-minute video from Children 's Hospital Colorado , a 9-year-old asks two of the hospital 's physicians -- a pediatric psychologist and a pediatric infectious disease specialist -- such pressing questions as : What is the coronavirus ? Is it safe to go outside with other kids ? Will grandma and grandpa be okay ? What about my little brother/sister ? What do I do if I get sick ?  The clinicians share information and guidance with a clear , calming tone .
Some of their advice : It 's not usually necessary for children and parents to wear masks .
Greet family and friends with elbow bumps at a distance , instead of high-fives .
And the Baby Shark song is perfect to time handwashing .
The video is appropriate and enjoyable for children and adults of all ages .
