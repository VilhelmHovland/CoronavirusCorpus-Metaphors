Follow the author of this article  Follow the topics within this article  As the UK hunkers down , puts the kettle on and braces itself for what 's to come , in China we 're emerging from our burrows and blinking in the spring sunshine .
The vibe in the Middle Kingdom is one of guarded optimism ; that the worst of the virus is behind us .
It 's taken almost two months of unprecedented , coordinated action the likes of which , one imagines , few other countries would have the resources or stomach for .
Wuhan in Hubei province , a city surely forever to be stigmatized with Covid-19 , was sealed off on January 23 , two days before Chinese New Year .
In Beijing , under snowy skies , the Forbidden City heaved closed its mighty vermillion gates , living up to its name once again a century after it ceased to be a palace and became a public museum .
This year marks its 600th birthday celebrations , but the bunting is still in the box .
The first snow in China during the Year of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scurried in with an inaudible squeak .
After some debate , my partner 's extended family opted not to cancel the annual New Year shindig in Xuchang , a city in Henan province bordering Hubei , and so ensued a chaotic day of dumplings , drunkenness , mah-jong and the giving of red envelopes stuffed with cash .
Apart from one daring dinner party since , that was the last time I did anything fun , I realise as I write this .
At the risk of sounding facetious , coronavirus is bloody boring .
In Beijing , where I live , we 've been shielded from the worst of it .
Official figures report just eight deaths and 496 cases in an area covering some 20 million people .
It 's a different story in Hubei province , 600 miles to the south , still barricaded off from the rest of China .
There , under perpetual lockdown , disillusionment simmers , despite Chinese leader Xi Jinping 's choreographed visit on March 10 , a move to show the Party has got the virus under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
With cases in China flatlining , the majority of new infections are ' imported ' -- people coming back to China , mostly students and workers deciding that the homeland is a safer prospect than remaining in Europe , Southeast Asia or the United States .
Schools are starting to reopen in some provinces , to the gasping relief of parents .
Not yet in Beijing , though , judging by the factions of masked boys waging war with their toy guns in my compound .
At least some people are having fun .
The apartment complex where I live , called Noble Quadrangle , has become a protected little kingdom , off-limits for non-residents .
It 's the same story across the country .
For many , the short walk to the front gate to collect packages or takeaway meals is their only daily flirtation with the outside .
After my years here , I 've realised that Chinese people are n't too dissimilar to us Britons .
They wo n't balk at the prospect of a comfy sofa , copious cups of tea , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV box set .
The lockdown , arriving as it did in winter during the Chinese New Year break , meant that the country had already decompressed .
Imagine if the gap between Boxing Day and January 2 was extended for two months , and you get a sense of the drawn-out inertia that has reigned in China since , at least for most of the country not severely affected .
Two months of hand-washing , sofa-lounging , rolling news-addicted monotony .
Wake up , check the latest infection rates , make coffee .
I now believe that slavishly reading every news update is potentially worse for one 's well-being that contracting the damn virus in the first place .

Heavyset , brusque , with that characteristic judgemental smirk , it 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haunt me .
Only this bloke is n't scrutinizing footwear , but what 's on your face .
In China , everybody wears a mask covering the nose and mouth .
While not strictly mandatory , if you opt out , the sour looks and nervous sidesteps will make you regret it .
Recently , I took my five-month old daughter for a walk in her pram .
Clearly , she 's too little to don a mask , I thought .
We passed a lady coming in the other direction , pushing a pushchair .
In it was a poodle .
Wearing a mask .
It was only the first of two masked dogs I 'd see that day .
Assuming every person ( and their dog ) has a mask in China , that 's a billion or so that hospitals could be making use of elsewhere in the world .
In all honesty , though , seeing everyone taking precautions is exceedingly reassuring .
I think I can speak for my fellow supermarket shoppers and say that we 're all very grateful to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite feel like it 's returning to normal ; more like a new normal .
For one thing , there are no tourists .
The Great Wall is walled off .
Shanghai Disneyland has ordered Mickey and Minnie to work from home .
Anyone coming into the capital now , whether from elsewhere in China or overseas , is required to submit to two weeks of quarantine , most likely at a government facility , with family members confined to separate rooms .
Understandably , people are staying away .
In recent days we 've visited a blissfully quiet Jingshan Park , strolling past the spot where the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty hanged himself from a tree as rebels stormed the gates .
We took a Didi ( China 's Uber ) to the mall , sitting behind a polythene sheet jerry-rigged between the front and back seats .
We were the only customers in a Japanese restaurant , ordering grilled mackerel from a pared-back menu and drinking cold Asahi , baby snoozing in the pram .
The mechanical efficiency with which China has deployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , community volunteers in red armbands police access to side streets , alleyways and residential compounds .
The lane connecting Noble Quadrangle to the main road has been gated off .
We must flash a special pass ( only issued to residents ) and have our temperature taken every time we come and go .
Cars have their boots inspected for fugitives , after news emerged of a stowaway who made it all the way from Wuhan to Beijing .
A historian friend pointed out that it 's like a return to Qing dynasty days , when every hutong ( Beijing 's inner-city lanes ) had its own gates , and aliens were kept at bay by the nightwatch .
In dark moods I look at the red armband gatekeepers , zapping people with their temperature pistols , and think , ' you 're loving this , are n't you ? ' .
On several occasions I 've been required to scan a QR code with my Chinese phone , which instantly divulges my whereabouts during the past two weeks .
It 's tempting to imagine part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population controls on a level even China 's authoritarian leadership , with its formidable surveillance apparatus , would n't have dreamed of before .
Covid-19 might not end up killing too many , in the scheme of things , but it might have silenced any lingering calls for the right to privacy in China .
And yet , the stoicism , fortitude and good humour of Chinese people through the worst of this crisis has been hugely inspiring .
The dragon wags its tail and people deal with the fallout .
I was moved almost to tears by videos showing the haunting shouts of ' Go Wuhan ' echoing from forests of monolithic apartment blocks at night in the stricken city .
And , on a lighter note , the clips revealing the creative ways people are enduring the desperate isolation , like dance-offs with neighbours in opposite apartments , or mates pretending to hand each other cigarettes between video chat windows .
If there 's anything two months of Covid-19 in China has revealed to me ( apart from how to attach a surgical mask on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living , above all else , is spending time with other people .
As someone inclined to shun company and embrace solitude ( less so since the baby , admittedly ) , I 've learned something about myself .
Which makes me dare to hope that , at the end of all this unnatural social-distancing , Covid-19 might just bring us all a bit closer together .
