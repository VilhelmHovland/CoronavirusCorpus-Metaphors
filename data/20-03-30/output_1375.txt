Stripped down team of councillors to make key decisions  Team of just three Brighton councillors will make planning decisions  FOR THE next four months , a team of three councillors will make the most urgent planning decisions .
Brighton and Hove City Council 's three party leaders agreed one councillor from each of the Labour , Green and Conservative groups will make urgent decisions rather than leave them to officers .
Three councillors sitting as the Planning Committee on Monday , 23 March , agreed to create the urgency sub-committee to decide on any major developments that need a decision during the Coronavirus ( Covid19 ) pandemic emergency .
At the moment all planning decisions made by councillors must be made by members present in the council chamber or committee room .
Until new laws come into place it is illegal to vote remotely or by proxy .
He also said planning discussions must be held in public so people can see the decision-making process .
Committee chair , Councillor Hills said she wanted members to have the chance to discuss issues in a wider group because planning is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only committee which does n't operate in terms of the groups where you have the opportunity to seek the views of the wider group .
" Three people can make a decision based on what they think .
I want more people making the decision one way or another .
We need to explore what we can do .
"  Green councillor Sue Shanks said she wanted to hear other committe members ' opinions after feeling nervous when she ended up being the deciding vote on a development of student flats in Hollingdean Road .
She said : " I 'm happy to have the urgency committee , but when you have the three of us it makes a difference to your decision making .
I feel quite exposed .
" In a committee of ten you can hide behind others on a five to four vote .
We need safety of decision making .
"  Councillor Miller said he felt uncomfortable with a three-member urgency committee making decisions on major projects .
He said : " My preference would be to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help members who are self-isolating or are over 70 , to be present at those meetings .
" If work could be done to make that possible , I appreciate it might be difficult .
"  Major applications , such as the redevelopment of Preston Barracks in Lewes Road and the former American Express building in Edward Street , always go before the Planning Committee .
Minor applications , such as the recent proposals to build a house on former pub garden at the Dyke pub in Dyke Road , go before the committee when there are enough objections , or letters of support should officers want to refuse a scheme .
The majority of planning decisions are made by council officers as they are usually minor and not controversial .
During the current coronavirus crisis , public access to council meetings held at Hove Town Hall will be limited to those directly involved .
The majority of public meetings are webcast on the authority 's website **45;2487;TOOLONG .
