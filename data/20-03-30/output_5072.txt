Countries around the globe have postponed elections due to the coronavirus pandemic but in Queensland , top officials say you are more at risk in the supermarket aisle than the polling booth .
The State Government is pushing ahead with Saturday 's planned local government elections and two state by-elections on the advice of its chief health officer .
Authorities said measures like physical distancing , plus a record number of pre-poll and postal votes , meant the risk was low compared to other day-to-day activities like grocery shopping .
The Electoral Commissioner flagged State Emergency Service ( SES ) volunteers could even be called upon to help maintain physical distancing at the booths during " these extraordinary times " .
But the move to go ahead with the elections has baffled some doctors and scientists in the community who believe it is a gathering " we should n't have " and is inconsistent with other messages to stay home .
" It 's yet another inconsistency that confuses people and lets people feel it 's OK to do other things .
" This is not a flattening of the curve exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process .
"  Gold Coast Medical Association president Philip Morris agrees .
" I think it 's a disaster and should n't be going ahead .
The Government should postpone the elections , " he said .
Another doctor who works in a hospital in the state 's south-east -- and sits through planning meetings about COVID-19 -- said they had been trying to get in contact with all levels of government to ask why it was necessary to go ahead .
" I think encouraging people to congregate is the last thing we should be doing at the moment .
and I 've got plenty of colleagues who feel the same way , " the doctor said .
Can it still be postponed ?  Multiple countries , including England , Bolivia and Spain , have already delayed slated elections , while the New South Wales Government announced it was postponing its September local government elections as COVID-19 cases grow .

"  He said then-premier Anna Bligh pushed back the local government elections by a month in 2012 to wait for the flood inquiry to deliver its report .
What if you ca n't vote ?  Voting is compulsory but Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said people who were holed up in self-isolation or ill -- and legitimately could not vote -- should not be fined for not being able to do so .
" Unlike any other election , there are people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , genuinely are concerned about their health , and that certainly needs to be taken into account in this election , " he said earlier this week .
" By all means if you 're fit and healthy , there are plenty of opportunities to vote -- and we 're encouraging people to do that -- but there needs to be leniency for people who simply ca n't vote .
"  He said he had written to the Electoral Commissioner to seek clarification and assurance that fines would not be issued for genuine health reasons for not voting .
The ECQ said telephone voting was available for certain eligible voters , with registration open until midday on election day .
It said it had boosted capacity " 10-fold " to help those who have been told to self-isolate because of COVID-19 but warned the telephone voting service was being clogged with requests from people who were not eligible .

"  What the experts are saying about coronavirus :  " The schools have maintained a rigorous approach to hygiene at all times and with ECQ unable to provide an appropriate clean before school reopens for staff and some students on Monday , the schools decided against participating on Saturday , " a BCE spokesman said .
An ECQ spokeswoman said there was an agreement between ECQ and schools that " the area be thoroughly cleaned prior to set up of the polling booth , and then again following election day " .
