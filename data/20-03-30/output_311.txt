OTTAWA -- Its land mass is about the size of Mexico 's and its deaths from respiratory disease are five times higher than the Canadian average -- yet it 's one of the last jurisdictions on Earth without a single reported case of the coronavirus .
Tuberculosis is still a legitimate health threat across Nunavut , the medical system is limited and in so many cases families of 10 people or more live under one roof .
Then there 's its sheer remoteness -- much of its tiny population is scattered in small hamlets across a massive area .
" We know that this virus can have a really nightmare effect in our community , so we 're trying to do everything we can , " Merlyn Recinos , mayor of the Nunavut hamlet of Igloolik , told POLITICO on Friday in a phone interview .
" We had to take preventative measures because once it 's in our community it will spread really quickly just because of how the communities are set up .
"  Canada 's latest Covid-19 data reported 4,018 cases Friday across the country and 39 deaths .
The virus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its three territories -- except for Nunavut .
The territory may be living proof that social distancing works .
A unique feature of Nunavut is that its capital of Iqaluit and its 25 communities are only connected to each other -- and to the big cities in southern Canada -- by air .
This makes it easier to keep the virus from entering the territory , but it could complicate any emergency response if the coronavirus finds its way in .
" I think the fact that we have fewer entry points than anywhere else in the world is one of the reasons why it 's the last place , " Nunavut Premier Joe Savikataaq told a press conference Wednesday in response to questions from POLITICO .
" We do n't have any roads , it 's air access only .
"  Savikataaq used the public event to urge his citizens to practice physical distancing even though there have been no reported cases of the virus .
He warned that ignoring the directive is " selfish " and " irresponsible .
"  " Once it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is when we 'll have our biggest challenge , " Savikataaq said .
Michael Patterson , Nunavut 's chief medical officer , told reporters at the same event that the public should approach the situation as though they 're hunkering down during a piqsiq , or blizzard .
It means , he added , they should only come out for things like groceries .
" It will be a very long blizzard , but that 's a way to keep us all safe from spreading the disease , " hesaid .
Nunavut has a population of about 39,000 , including close to 8,000 people in Iqaluit .
Around 85 percent of Nunavut 's residents are Inuit .
To protect the region , the territorial government has implemented strict restrictions on travelers from other parts of the country .
This is unique in Canada .
Despite widespread emergency declarations , Canadians in the rest of the country are still free to travel across provincial and territorial borders .
Since Wednesday , only Nunavut residents and critical workers are permitted to enter the territory .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must undergo a 14-day isolation period and get official clearance from Patterson 's office .
" Nunavut haswhat are probably the most-stringent travel and isolation rules in place in all of Canada right now -- these are drastic measures , but for the safety and well-being of all Nunavummiut , " George Hickes , Nunavut 's health and finance minister , told Wednesday 's press conference .
" I still believe we 're not safe even with the measures we 've taken -- we need to make sure that when it does appear in Nunavut that we can control and isolate it .
"  The federal government has announced a C$305-million Covid-19 aid package to help First Nations , Inuit and M ? t is leadership .
Savikataaq said Nunavut will get around C$22 .
million from the envelope .
On additional support from Ottawa , he said he asked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to have medical supplies ready to deploy at any time -- because if the time comes they 'll need them right away .
He said he 's also requested federal economic support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial airlines .
The vulnerability of Nunavut 's population is also a concern .
It has long struggled with high levels of respiratory illness compared to the rest of Canada and internationally .
A Conference Board of Canada report said between 2009 and 2011 the territory 's mortality rate from respiratory diseases was five times higher than the rest of the country .
The region 's history with tuberculosis has been a major factor , said Recinos .
Last year , Trudeau offered an official apology on behalf of the federal government for its handling of tuberculosis in the Arctic between the 1940s and 1960s .
Recinos , whose Igloolik hamlet is home to 1,900 people and does n't have a doctor , said this is a big reason why the territory has taken the situation " very seriously " from the start .
" We needed to be very proactive just because we had a possibility of a really nightmare scenario in our heads , " he said .
