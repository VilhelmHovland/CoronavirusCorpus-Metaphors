( 4 ) comments  Here 's a question , when will all the information about the infecteds locations be shared ? Also , sure people will be fined for breaking the law like having a house party or something like that .
But maybe people need to be incentified to tell the authorities .
There are a lot of people not listening and this is going to get a lot worse ? ?  How do we stop the companies NOT COMPLYING with the stay at home order .
Both in Cowlitz AND Clark county ? These people have spouses IN the active medical field being recklessly exposed because their jobs have been threatened .
