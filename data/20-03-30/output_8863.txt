Corvin said many of the complaints can likely be resolved in a matter of days , but others may take more time .
" Where there are areas we can work with an employer up front to get things addressed , we will do that , " Corvin said .
" Where there are areas where there 's going to be a necessary on-site inspection , we 'll conduct that as well .
"  Companies found to be violating workplace safety rules will be required to correct the problem and could face a fine .
