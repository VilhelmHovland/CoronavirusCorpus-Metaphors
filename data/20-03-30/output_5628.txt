Migrants flee shelter in Indapur , while Daund faces resource crunch  District administration stares at a new crisis of how people from other states can be kept safe in makeshift facilities ; collector promises funds so that no one suffers  Finding a humanitarian solution to the major crisis of migrant workers during lockdown in this part of the state has led to another disaster as many of them have either escaped or are about to do the same with the key resource of food depleting at the shelter homes .
While in Daund , about 90 km east of Pune , government officials feel funds should be immediately made available to run the shelter homes , at least 150 such workers have run away from a makeshift facility in Indapur , around 140 km from the city , in spite of cops keeping an eye on them .
While workers from TN are housed at a shelter in Daund , the social worker feeding them ( far left ) said that their food reserves are close to the end ; he is even using his own LPGs to cook  Across the district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people sheltered .
In Daund , about 235 youngsters , originally from Tamil Nadu , have been staying at Sindhi Marriage Hall since three days .
All of them were working with an agriculture marketing company and had arrived in the town for training .
Though they had rented houses in various parts of the town the company chose to shut its operations after the lockdown and these youngsters , who used to receive money based on the number of products they could sell every day , ended up struggling to survive .
As they could not pay the rent , they were asked to vacate their houses and had to move into this facility created by the local government authorities .
But living there seems a different struggle for them .
Sitting close to each other on mats they had brought from their homes with their bags doubling as pillows , these youngsters keep waiting for food to arrive .
Some 150 migrants fled from a shelter in Indapur despite police vigilance ; many said the place was dirty  " We sit through the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , we are getting a bit more on Monday after taking this up with authorities .
But all we want is to get out of here and go home , " said Kannaswami Karthik , who has now turned into the leader of the lot .
While all 235 of them were kept in two halls of a wedding venue till Sunday , the authorities have now moved a few of them to nearby Sheth Jotiprasad Vidyalaya to maintain social distancing .
But providing meals every day seems a huge challenge for the authorities .
Social worker Rajesh Patil , who the district administration had requested to provide food to the workers , told Mirror , " I am cooking meals twice daily apart from serving them tea and biscuits .
Initially , they were 235 but other migrants keep on coming here .
Now , I have to cater to the needs of 1,000 people .
I am not even able to procure gas cylinders ; whatever we had at our homes have been brought here .
My initial thought was to be able to continue it till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run .
"  Mangesh Shinde , the chief officer of Daund Municipal Council , said , " There was a government resolution that the funds will be sent to local authorities .
However , we have not received them yet .
"  Indapur , the bordering town with Solapur district , faces a different problem with people escaping the makeshift shelters in the cover of darkness .
Several migrant workers have been detained in the past few days and put in two facilities as the district border is sealed .
Several migrant workers were brought in limping from their long walk home to the shelters in Indapur , bordering Solapur  The first facility is Nikita Lawns on the outskirts of Indapur while Atharva Lawns is at Sardewadi , just behind the toll naka in Tembhurni .
Around 3 .
pm on Monday , a police van brought in 30-odd youngsters , including a few who were limping due to the long walk , to Atharva Lawns .
Claiming that they are planning to stay here only for a day they started cleaning the hall which was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dirty , how can we stay here ? " said Vishnu , a migrant worker who had come all the way from Baramati .
On Friday , almost 150 people , heading towards Andhra Pradesh from Mumbai in a tempo , had been stopped by local cops .
The daily wagers provided them with shelter and food at Nikita Lawns but they eventually managed to escape from there .
The officials claimed that they had escaped in the night despite the cops being deployed .
Since they also had a vehicle at their disposal , they could easily leave the area in no time , said property owner Mangesh Patil .
Asked why they were allowed to go , RJ Bansod , nayab tehsildar from Indapur , said , " They had no intention of staying here .
We deployed cops and had also allocated a talathi on duty but they escaped after staying for two days .
" Highlighting the funds crunch , Bansod added , " When they came here we chipped in and bought biscuits and got tea prepared from our homes .
We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date .
"  District collector Naval Kishore Ram said , " This problem has multiple angles .
Sometimes people are leaving since they just need food and have places to stay .
They keep telling us to provide grains but are not in a frame of mind to stay in the shelter .
So we have instructed the authorities to provide food so that they do n't go hungry .
We are also working on a grain distribution plan .
As far as the funds are concerned , tehsildars have been instructed that all the money they spend will be reimbursed from the disaster relief fund so that should not be a reason for worry .
Tehsildars are personally expected to take care of these camps .
