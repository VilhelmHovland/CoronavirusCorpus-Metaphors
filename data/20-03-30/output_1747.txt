Share this :  Over recent weeks , the global business system has been heavily impacted by the outbreak of Covid-19 , obliging companies to activate strategies in line with governments ' directives .
Decision makers have been tested by the increasing pressures stemming from the international arena , where uncertainties put them in a risky position along the supply chains , emphasizing that operating in such global environment certainly means getting access to a larger number of opportunities , as well as being victim of a domino effect in front of turbulent circumstances deployed far away .
These changes could also lead to a rethink of some paradigms and dynamics that have typically characterized companies -- even at the top level .
In this framework , the technological trends that have transformed business realities over recent years could knock on the boardrooms ' doors to strengthen their responsiveness and resilience before , during and after an emergency .
Indeed , even if these bodies have been an under-researched " black box " for a long time , the moment to revitalize their role has come .
When crises occur , boards of directors are greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the organization to manage risks and the robustness of the management ' modus operandi ; to set the right " tone at the top " with the stakeholders ; and to support the executive team even with a renewed strategic vision .
The potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning could revolutionize the dynamics that shape corporate boards , shifting the attention from how AI and ML will impact the strategy to how these technologies will affect their structure , composition , and decision-making processes .
Director selection  In 2018 , professors from Ohio State University , the University of Colorado and the University of Washington co-authored a research paper to present a machine-learning approach to selecting the directors of publicly traded companies .
The authors worked on the construction of the XGBoost algorithm to forecast whether an individual would have been successful in a particular board ; compared econometric and machine-learning approaches to evaluate the performance of board members thanks according to the votes received ; and adopted the results provided by the algorithm as benchmarks for the directors ' recruitment .
Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these sophisticated models would support the improvement of the recruitment process .
In particular , tracking those directors whose competences and networks would benefit the board could leverage the body 's effectiveness -- especially if studies are applied to build specific committees that must demonstrate excellent capabilities in promptly responding to situations of crisis .
In addition , it is reasonable to think that algorithms could provide a solution to overcome barriers that are typical in the boardroom .
Some of these relate to the debates raised around the chief executive officer 's influence in appointing sympathetic directors ; the limited time many directors invest in the development of in-depth knowledge of the industry they are operating in ; and the lack of diversity in term of gender , nationality , and competences .
Diversity plays a big role in coping with unpredictable scenarios because , thanks to its contribution to the group 's robustness and its ability to respond to " external disturbances , " it brings to the table a wider spectrum of identities , ideas and experiences crucial to identifying alternative solutions .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boards must also be able to make consistent decisions based on the analysis and elaboration of huge amounts of information that are shared among authorities , partners , suppliers , retailers and customers .
Identifying valuable patterns according to the timing dictated by an emergency is not an easy task .
Even in relation to this dimension , AI-powered assistants could find vast application to foster the boardroom 's agility .
In fact , they can study various types of real-time and historical data , making them accessible to read the internal and external environment without suffering from personal judgments .
The advantage is represented by the speed at which key information can be collected in a fast-changing context , improving the quality and accuracy of the decision-making process .
In addition , it benefits the creation of " collective knowledge .
" Every person has his or her own way to decipher a situation , and collecting a vast amount of data improves the chance of identifying alternative patterns among various set of partitions of the reality typically adopted .
Obviously , innovating corporate boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It is rather about opening the door to the benefits deriving from the full potential of board intelligence .
There is still a large part of the boards ' soft skills that is equally fundamental and can not be impacted ( but only supported ) by AI and ML : the acumen and the ability of a director to be perceptive in front of complicated and complex issues in order to find the best way to solve them , and to additionally position the company as a community player able to offer support at the time of dramatic changes .
