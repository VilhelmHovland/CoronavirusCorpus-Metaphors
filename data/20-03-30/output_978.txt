Why reporting the number of COVID-19 tests is a farce  By Cheryl Austin Freelance science and medical reporter living in Madison .
We 've heard recently how our testing capacity ( number of tests performed ) has now outstripped other countries .
I urge you to take those numbers with a VERY large grain of salt , and here 's why .
Let 's take a look at the testing process .
Step 1 : obtaining a sample from the patient .
That 's the nose or throat swab .
Each swab is placed in its own test tube containing saline .
Now , technically , that 's one patient but it produces 2 tubes , so is that 2 tests ? Probably , since each tube is tested individually .
So already we can cut the number of tests in half from what is being reported .
More recently , due to a shortage of supplies , they 've started only taking a single tube containing only a nose swab from each patient , so these numbers MAY now not have to be halved going forward .
Step 2 : transporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run .
How long the tube is in transport or is sitting before it is run is anyone 's guess .
Recently , the edict went out that labs were to prioritize testing for currently hospitalized patients , so if you were home sick with symptoms , your tube(s) may be waiting a long time to be assayed ( tested ) .
Step 3 : running the assay to determine if the contents of the tube is positive ( contains the virus ) or negative ( does not contain the virus ) .
Step 4 : reporting the result back to the doctor , the state health department , and CDC .
Step 5 : your doctor notifies you of the results .
This is the only step you actually care about .
It is the only step that matters with regards to limiting the spread , because it is only at this point that you will take precautions seriously ( although you should have been taking them seriously all along ! ) and notify others with whom you 've been in contact so they can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test a " test " ( for counting purposes ) at about Step 4 , after the test has been run and a result obtained .
But for the most part , the government has been counting a test a " test " at Step 1 .
So when they report that almost a half a million tests have been done , what they mean is half a million individual samples have been gathered .
80 percent of them might be in transit or just sitting at the lab waiting to be tested ( at Step 2 ) , but they 're still counting it as if the testing has been completed .
The government needs for the testing numbers to look good to make up for the fact that they were so slow getting the tests out .
As for me , it has been 11 days since my sample was sent to the lab and I still have not gotten the result ! I 've called my doctor every day beginning 4 days after the sample was taken , and they keep saying the results are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient , my samples ( I had both a nose and throat swab ) are at the bottom of the stack .
The lab may be so overrun with the continuing influx of hospitalized patients , they may never get to my sample ! I 'm even wondering if by now the sample has deteriorated to the point that the assay would n't be valid anyway .
But as long as a sample was taken , they figured the public is placated that testing is being done .
that they were able to get tested .
But I do n't feel like I was tested .
I only feel like I was sampled , and that 's something entirely different ! And that 's why when you hear them quote the vast numbers of tests that have so far been done , the numbers are a farce !
