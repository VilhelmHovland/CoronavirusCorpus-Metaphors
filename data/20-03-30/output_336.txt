New Zealand police are responsible for the maintenance of law and order during a state of national emergency and are also granted special powers to order any person to stop any activity that contributes to the emergency .
Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare said extending it ensured the government had all the powers needed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
Each week , Stuart-Black will provide the minister with advice on whether the State of National Emergency should be extended again .
After the annoucement , a legal expert called for clearer rules of how emergency discretionary powers should be applied .
Victoria University 's associate law professor Dean Knight said that with so much discretionary power , there was a risk that discretion could be used in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner .
Dr Knight said some people had been unclear about the signals they were getting from the Government .
