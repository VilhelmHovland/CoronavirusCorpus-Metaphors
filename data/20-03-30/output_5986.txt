The cops have reported higher self-quarantine compliance -- essentially people with travel history or those who were in close proximity of a person who tested positive not venturing out of their homes .

" That task of identifying and isolating potential coronavirus carriers has been so much simpler in a city in lockdown .
Everybody is at home , so the number of people a covid-19 positive person can infect is much lower , " she said .

Then the Sunday 's janta curfew placed the city in a lockdown like never before and the state government evoked secction 144 of CrPC , which prohibits gathering of over four persons at public places .

" The incubation period of the coronavirus is 14 days .
If we manage to get all the people who are supposed to be in home quarantine to be at home , we can prevent a larger covid-19 outbreak since the virus is only spreading from those who are coming from abroad to those who come in contact with them .
So we need to break the chain and that can only be done by being in quarantine and a lockdown , " Pardeshi said .
Health Minister Rajesh Tope and Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta believe the lockdown is preventing the rapid spread of the virus and by March 27 to 28 , the cases will be contained .
But a lot will depend on Mumbai maintaining discipline .
