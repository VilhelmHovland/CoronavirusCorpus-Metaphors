by Saharareporters , New York Mar 29 , 2020  President Muhammadu Buhari has banned the movement of persons in and out of Lagos , Ogun and Federal Capital Territory as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak .
He made the declaration on Sunday evening during a nationwide broadcast .
According to the President , the decision was taken because Lagos and the FCT had recorded the most cases of the pandemic in the country due to the international airports in both cities , which had allowed travellers from high risk countries for the virus to come into the country .
Buhari said Ogun State was included in the restriction because of its close proximity to Lagos and the fact that it bordered many other states in the South-West .
The President asked Nigerians to put aside their personal comfort to help combat the pandemic , adding that citizens should stay at home to reduce the risk of the virus spreading further .
