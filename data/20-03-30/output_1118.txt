In terms of Footsie laggards on the day , house builders were largely in the red , unsurprisingly , as many banks have pulled a lot of mortgage products as the government is not encouraging people to move to a new house during the virus outbreak .

Given the recent surge in US first-time jobless claims , it is a matter of debate how many of those pending home sales will actually go through .

Whilst it is too early to say if the relentless efforts from central banks and governments to support the global economy would be enough to cushion economic recession and support stock markets , underperformance of stock markets rarely last for a long-time , " claimed Marija Veitmane , a multi-asset class research senior strategist at State Street Global Markets .
" The quarters that experience negative returns tend to be followed by positive ones ; and the stronger the sell-off , the stronger the rebound in the next quarter .
One potential explanation for the rebound in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets to maintain target allocation .
Looking at the size of the sell-off and balanced funds ' assets under management , rebalancing flow can be upwards of half a trillion dollars-worth of buying stocks , " Veitmane advised .
In the UK , a welcome absence of volatility on the Footsie has enabled investors to catch their breath a little .

" Using British taxpayers ' money to prioritise the rescue of foreign shareholders would be questionable for any government ; it is particularly difficult for one that prides itself on putting British interests first .
Ryanair is Irish ; EasyJet 's major shareholder is a Greek family now domiciled in Monaco ; Virgin Atlantic is owned by a consortium of foreign airlines , with its nominal figurehead residing on his remote Caribbean island .
Even the owner of British Airways is an Anglo-Iberian conglomerate with its biggest shareholder , an Arabian airline .
A bad smell is coming from the cockpit of government , " Norris claimed .
: Economic sentiment Indicator for March tells only half the story  The European Commission 's Economic Sentiment Indicator ( ESI ) for the UK declined to 92 .
in March , from 95 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average .
" The relatively small fall in the ESI in March almost certainly understates the damage to confidence caused by Covid-19 , " suggested Samuel Tombs , the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
" On past form , a re-weighted version of the ESI , where the component 's weights refer to their shares of UK output , suggests GDP gross domestic product still is growing , at a 1 .
year-over-year rate .
Meanwhile , the composite indicator of consumers ' confidence dropped merely to -8 in March , from -6 in February , and simply matched its average level since 1985,2 he continued , before adding that the survey was conducted in the first half of March , before Covid-19 infections grew strongly and restrictions on everyday life were introduced .
" The 83 .
level of Italy 's ESI in March probably is a better guide to the state of sentiment in Britain right now ; that would be the lowest level since mid-2009 .
Accordingly , we feel under no pressure to alter our forecast that GDP is on course for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline of about 13% in Q2 , " Tombs added .
The FTSE 100 was down 40 points ( 0 .

" Households ' finances were in relatively good shape on the eve of the Covid-19 crisis .
Households ' broad money holdings rose at a 3 .
year-over-year rate in February , as income growth remained strong but spending lagged behind .
Consumers were cautious and preferred to build up a precautionary buffer of cash , instead of splurging all their income , " observed Samuel Tombs , the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics .
" Households also continued to borrow cautiously ; net consumer credit grew at a 5 .
year-over-year rate in February , the slowest rate since June 2014 .
The economy is less vulnerable to a pullback in consumer credit than on the eve of prior recessions , " he declared .

" The data provides further evidence that the housing market was benefiting markedly early on in 2020 from increased confidence and reduced uncertainties following December 's election .
This was also evident in survey evidence .
The February RICS survey reported that ' New buyer enquiries , agreed sales and fresh listings all reportedly increased over the survey period , extending a run of positive readings going back to December ' , " reported Howard Archer , the chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club .
" However , there were already signs in the surveys that coronavirus was starting to have some impact on housing market sentiment in February .
The February RICS survey also observed that ' although near term sales expectations remain positive , optimism has moderated somewhat , with anecdotal evidence suggesting concerns over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some extent .
'  " It is clear that housing market activity has been impacted from coronavirus during March , reflecting the mounting restrictions on people 's movements as well as the hit to confidence and economic activity .
Hometrack reported on 26 March that demand for houses was down 40% over the past week and that ' demand is set to fall further now the UK is moving into a 3+ week period of partial lockdown ' , " he added .
: A market in which a 1 .

The oil market is expected to be in surplus during the second quarter of the year as Saudi Arabia and Russia remain locked in a price war , " he added .
Jack Allardyce , an oil and gas analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe , warned that oil could hit storage capacity within two months .
" With major producers pumping barrels freely and the IEA suggesting that short-term demand could fall by a fifth due to travel restrictions , global storage is likely to hit capacity over the next two-to-three months .
This is likely to be particularly damaging for US crude , with prices in the Permian region potentially hitting single digits , " Allardyce said .
" While we believe that current levels are unsustainable in the medium term given achievable breakeven prices , the ongoing uncertainty around COVID-19 and apparent stalemate between Riyadh and Moscow is likely to cause continued downward pressure over the coming weeks .
" While prices have not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2008 , the rate of the crash is unprecedented , and the pain looks far from over , " he added .

" This week has kicked off with a new precedent .
It is n't the volatile performance of stocks , bonds , or currencies that are grabbing all the attention , but the moves in oil prices .
US crude has tested levels below $20 for the first time in more than 17 years , with traders continuing to bet that the combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OPEC+ will continue to weigh on prices , " said Hussein Sayed , the chief market strategist at FXTM .
" It is widely believed that the oil surplus will reach 25 million barrels a day by April , a level that could even make it difficult to find storage for this excess supply .
While it 's becoming unprofitable to higher-cost producers , many of them are still hoping others shut off production first .
This game of attrition is likely to drag prices even lower and even a price of $10 per barrel is no longer unimaginable .
At such a level , higher-cost producers will have no choice but to shut production ; however , long-term demand is what will determine where prices will be by year-end , and that will depend widely on how deep the recession will be and the shape of the recovery afterwards , " Sayed said .
