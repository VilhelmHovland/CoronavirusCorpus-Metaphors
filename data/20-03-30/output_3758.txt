JCB to produce ventilators  By Euan **32;706;TOOLONG  JCB is poised to re-start production at a factory closed as a result of the Coronavirus crisis , to join the UK 's national effort to manufacture ventilators .
JCB received a direct appeal from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier this month to help plug the national ventilator shortage and to help save lives of Coronavirus patients .
Following the approach , JCB chairman Lord Bamford immediately mobilised a research and engineering team to examine potential ways to assist .
Now , the company is ready to restart production at its Cab Systems factory that two weeks ago made cabs for JCB excavators .
Instead , it will produce special steel housings for a brand new design of ventilator from UK manufacturer Dyson .
A minimum of 10,000 of the JCB housings are earmarked for manufacture once Dyson receives regulatory approval for its design .
The first prototypes of the housings have already been delivered to Dyson after rolling off the production line at the factory in Staffordshire .
The factory fell silent on 18 March , along with eight other JCB UK manufacturing plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Mass production of the housings could start in a matter of days .
Today JCB chairman Lord Bamford said , " When we were approached by the Prime Minister we were determined , as a British company , to help in any way we could .
" This project has gone from design to production in just a matter of days and I am delighted that we have been to deploy the skills of our talented engineering , design and fabrication teams so quickly at a time of national crisis .
" This is also a global crisis , of course , and we will naturally help with the production of more housings if these ventilators are eventually required by other countries .
"  JCB 's response to the national call to action would see the return to work for around 50 employees affected by an extended company shutdown announced last week .
JCB suspended production at its nine UK production plants until at least the end of April as a result of the Coronavirus crisis and furloughed the vast majority of its 6,500 workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are being paid 80% of their basic pay for the next month .
Employees returning to work to help manufacture the ventilator housings will be paid 100% of their normal pay .
