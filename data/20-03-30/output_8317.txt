Marcia Clutter 's wedding dress is hanging in her closet , ready for the big day in two months .
The one-of-a-kind wedding invitations -- created by a friend on an antique letterpress as a gift to the couple -- arrived Wednesday .
Clutter is n't sure when , or if , either will be used .
With the global coronavirus pandemic altering everyday life , Clutter and her fiance Stephen Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream wedding to fit the restrictions of our new reality .
Stephen Hall and Marcia Clutter of Indianapolis at a wedding they attended last summer .
The coronavirus outbreak canceled their planned May wedding in Carmel .
( Photo : Marcia Clutter )  " What was is just not to be , " Clutter told IndyStar .
" But there were no tears shed and we were pretty pragmatic about the whole thing .
And you really ca n't complain about too much if you 've got food on the table and family that is healthy right now .
That 's kind of the attitude we have .
"  At the beginning of March , the plan was still for a wedding at the end of May with about 40 guests , then a trip to Hall 's native United Kingdom so Clutter could meet his family .
Things changed quickly .
Hall , an employee of Eli Lilly , was instructed to work from home in early March .
Then Clutter was laid off from her position at Best Buddies International , a nonprofit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities .

( Photo : Marcia Clutter )  " During that time when we realized what was happening , we immediately said we did n't feel like continuing to plan this event .
Because even if we could have it there are going to be people who ca n't come or would be afraid to come , " she said .
Clutter said the couple managed to keep a level head despite their best-laid plans falling to pieces .
She credits their maturity , pointing out that she is in her late 50s and Hall is in his early 60s .
But she is also thankful to the local vendors and wedding professionals she is working with for being flexible doing everything they can to meet their needs .
" Our lives are changing , " Clutter said , " so you may end up kind of wanting a completely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  But a marriage means more than a party .
It 's also a legal status that can have important implications on all aspects of life -- including health insurance .
Getting a marriage license  When Clutter was laid off , it created another problem : she would n't have health insurance after the end of the month .
Once they were wed , she could be added to Hall 's insurance , but the closure of government offices statewide made it initially unclear when they would be able to obtain a marriage license .
Dan Henkel , the professional wedding officiant Clutter and Hall have been working with , said couples can still get married during the statewide stay-at-home order .
In Marion County , marriage licenses can be obtained on Friday 's after making an appointment with the county clerk 's office .
COVID-19 : Resources  The Indiana State Department of Health hotline is 317-233-7125 from 8 a .
to 8 p .
and 317-233-1325 afterward .
Officials at the Hamilton County Clerk 's Office told IndyStar that getting a marriage license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointment and complete a portion of the application online to get their license there .
Licenses are good for 60 days , meaning they can be used immediately , or held onto should a couple choose to wait out the pandemic and officially get married at a later date .
Clutter and Hall are working with the Marion County Clerk 's Office to determine when they can obtain their license  The wedding industry  " Even in normal times , planning a wedding is an extraordinary challenge .
Most people have never planned an event of that scale , of that cost or that important to them , " he said .
The most common alternative is getting married on paper now and celebrating later .
But Henkel added that in the age of livestreaming , something like a digital ceremony where guests " login to attend " is also an option .
" I have been so moved by the artists who are streaming and choral groups who will put a song together with everyone recording their parts at home , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to affirm your commitment while we 're confined to our homes .
"  Jean Rivers , owner of Blue Llama Events , said there are a few things couples can do to make the reality of a postponed or canceled wedding less painful .
The most important is cancellation insurance which can be crucial for both weddings and corporate events slated for this spring or summer .
While it may be too late to add that protection post-booking in many cases , Rivers said it is situational and you should contact your insurance provider to see what your options are .
She also urges couples to closely look at any the contracts for any vendors they 've secured so they can go into the conversation of adjusting dates with confidence .
Rescheduling  When it comes to dates , River said the year itself may make things a bit trickier .
" Because 2020 is one of the most popular wedding years I have ever seen , dates are minimal .
And you want to go far enough out because you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
" You do n't want to schedule something out to June because we do n't even know if it 's going to be over by that time .
"  Another tip Rivers offers is selecting a Friday or Sunday as your new wedding date if given the opportunity .
" These are non-prime wedding days , so there is a huge likelihood all of your vendors will be available and nobody will charge any additional fees to rebook to those dates , " she said .
And remember : just because a mandate is lifted does n't mean your guests will be ready to party .
" For example we have a very large corporate event in mid-May , " Rivers said .
" Yes , you may be able to have that .
But the perception of bringing 1000 people together in mid-May might be reason enough to cancel or postpone .
"  Jennifer Hanshew , a general manager with Circle City Expos , said it 's also not too late to bring on a wedding planner .
With that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide couples someone who knows what small details might be overlooked if you begin to panic .
Hanshew said in her role , she also has the unique task of working with both couples , and wedding industry professionals .
While the COVID-19 outbreak creates uncertainty for brides and grooms , it does the same for photographers , DJs , venue owners and others who are having their livelihoods put on hold .
Hanshew said the prospect of changing dates can be intimidating , but coming to an agreement is mutually beneficial for both client and vendor .
What is encouraging , she said , is what she calls countless examples of " community over competition " in the local wedding industry .
She gives an example of photographers who may be unavailable during a couple 's new wedding date referring that couple to another photographer who they know to be of a similar skill level , style and price point .
" I 've lived in Indiana for 20 years , I 've been in this industry 18 of those years .
and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together , " she said .
" Each small business owner is concerned about themselves , but they 're also concerned about their fellow photographer , their fellow venue , their fellow DJ or entertainer or emcee business .
We all work so hard together in this community .
" Right now this is crushing because we 're in the middle of it , but there 's light at the end of the tunnel .
It 's not going to go on for years and years and the most important day of your life is the most important day because of who you share it with .
