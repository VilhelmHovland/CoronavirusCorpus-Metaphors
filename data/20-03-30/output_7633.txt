Well-funded Democratic nonprofits and super PACs are adjusting their messaging and tactics in response to the coronavirus pandemic as they pour tens of millions of dollars into ad campaigns and digital platforms in an attempt to beat President Trump in November .
The left-leaning groups have spent months polling , interviewing voters in battleground states and building digital outreach operations to avoid any missteps from 2016 .
Now that the pandemic has shut down traditional canvassing and campaigning , the groups say they are leaning more on that digital infrastructure .
The result : Voters who are more dependent than ever on technology for social connection can expect to see more Democratic-boosting content on Facebook , Instagram and even videogame platforms .
And while ads focus on everything from the cost of prescription medication to the impact of tariffs on Wisconsin dairy farmers , many of the Democratic groups are putting Mr .
Trump 's coronavirus response at the forefront .
" Ads are even more important than they were before , " said Josh Schwerin , spokesman for Democratic super PAC Priorities USA , which is spending on advertising earlier than it did in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Convention in July .
" People are sitting at home , and getting information in front of them is critical .
"  According to political ad tracker Kantar/CMAG , Priorities USA is on pace to spend $12 million on general-election television ads in battleground states by mid-May , which was when the group started such activity in the 2016 presidential election .
The group is putting $6 .
million into ads featuring early quotes from Mr .
Trump playing down the virus outbreak .
His campaign has asked TV stations to stop airing it .
" It used to be that Americans faced national adversity with unity , but Joe Biden and his allies have abandoned that principle in favor of rank , despicable politics , " said Tim Murtaugh , spokesman for Mr .
Trump 's campaign .
Another group , American Bridge 21st Century , which has field offices in Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania , has been collecting stories from people who voted for Mr .
Trump after supporting President Obama .
It is part of a $50 million ad campaign ahead of the convention to persuade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominee .
Earlier in March , the group added a new digital ad showing all the times Mr .
Trump minimized the pandemic .

Trump 's effort has proven itself to be a fundraising machine and is pouring millions of dollars into online ads and a vast , data-guided turnout operation .
From the beginning of 2019 through the end of February , the Trump campaign , Republican National Committee and allied joint-fundraising committees have raised more than $607 million .
The re-election effort started this month with $225 million in the bank , according to the RNC .
In 2016 , Mr .

" What 's been heartening since 2016 is that all hands have been on deck from all Democratic allies , " said Bradley Beychok , president of American Bridge , which focused on opposition research in the past but is now expanding its efforts .
Both American Bridge and Priorities recently said they would start working on behalf of former Vice President Joe Biden , who has a hefty delegate lead over Vermont Sen .

Biden will also have the support of Unite the Country , a super PAC that , according to Kantar/CMAG , has spent $9 million on TV ads to help him during the primaries .
Unite the Country launched an ad buy worth at least $1 million last week criticizing Mr .
Trump for his handling of the pandemic and announced a new partnership with American Bridge with plans to spend a combined total of at least $100 million .
Another super PAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and says it will focus on helping the former vice president in Arizona and other Western states that have recorded Democratic gains since 2016 .
Meanwhile , Acronym , a nonprofit progressive digital strategy organization , is planning to spend $75 million against Mr .
Trump this cycle across Facebook , online video and other digital platforms , with a large portion of that spending occurring before the party 's convention .
The group , through its political-action committee , was one of the first to seize on the president 's response to coronavirus in its messaging to swing-state voters .
That campaign began in late February and has about $5 million behind it .
It features promoted news stories , digital ads and video mashups , some of which include Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson criticizing the federal government response .

"  Acronym is also planning to invest several million dollars in online voter-registration efforts targeting young and minority voters across eight battleground states including Arizona , Texas , Florida and Georgia .
