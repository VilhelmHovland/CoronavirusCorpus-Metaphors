Reacting to the news , IOA Secretary Rajeev Mehta said , " IOA welcomes the decision of the IOC .
Discussions were held by the IOC with organisers and all stakeholders prior to this .
Soon after the lockdown is over , IOA would be holding meetings with athletes , federations , sponsors , to revise plans .
This decision today , relieves our athletes of worries of having to train during the pandemic and perform their best in four months from now .
"  The Union sports ministry , too , welcomed the decision .
Sports Secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya told THE WEEK , " It 's a good and timely decision .
We should not do anything to risk the health of our athletes .
"  The decision was widely hailed by athletes , international sports federations and various national Olympic committees .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision is taken , the focus should be on ensuring every athlete 's mental and physical good health .
" Now that the scenario around the Tokyo Games is clear it is paramount to Safe Guard Athletes , suspend training camps immediately and make athletes feel like contributors to the community by being socially responsible .
Their health and of those around them is what matters , " he wrote on Twitter .
He also had a message for all athletes : " To all athletes - stay safe and healthy now that 's the best you can do for yourself and your country .
When we all rise we will be behind you all even more .
And your achievement will mean everything ! "  Welcoming the decision , World Athletics , in a statement , said it is working with IOC to decide on new dates for Olympics .
" It is what athletes want and we believe this decision will give all athletes , technical officials and volunteers some respite and certainty in these unprecedented and uncertain times .
" Athletics will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor season of one-day meetings in 2020 , starting and ending later than usual , so athletes , when they are able and it is safe to , will have access to competitions in every region .
This will help them benchmark their performances and adjust their training accordingly for an Olympic Games in 2021 .
" In light of this announcement , we will also expedite our current review of the Olympic qualification system , in cooperation with the IOC , and release any changes to the process as soon as possible so athletes know where they stand , " the statement said .
Wrestler Bajrang Punia , javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and boxer Vikas Krishan Yadav , all welcomed the postponing of the Olympics .
" It would have been difficult for all countries if Olympics had happened now .
Let 's follow the instructions given by the government and fight coronavirus together first .
And then , we will all prepare for the Olympics with renewed vigour , " said Punia .
Yadav said that the postponement will affect his preparation but the extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day , humanity has to trump sport .
So , I 'm happy that the decision was made to postpone the Olympics amidst the coronavirus situation .
Obviously , the postponement will affect our preparation , but I think the extra time can help me prepare even better for my goal to win an Olympic Gold for India .
I think it is important for all athletes to keep their focus and motivation and use this time to do whatever we can in terms of diet , nutrition and training so that hopefully , when the Olympics comes by next year , we will be in an even better condition to win medals for the country , " he said .
Chopra , too , agreed that the environment would not have been appropriate for the Games .
" While we were looking forward to Tokyo 2020 , the environment would n't have been appropriate for the event to be celebrated the way it should be .
I would say we should look at this positively as it would allow us a year more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest sporting event for many athletes .
There will be some impact on preparations over the next few months till the situation is brought under control , but that is something that all athletes are facing equally .
For now , I 'm not thinking about the qualification ; there are experts at the IOC and World Athletics who will take everything into consideration before making a decision .
So , I think it would be best at this point for us to all focus on overcoming this challenging situation with our health intact for now , and then work towards the Olympics next year depending on the eventual decision that is taken .
"  Team GB ( the Great Britain and Northern Island Olympic team as it is known and run by the British Olympic Committee ) tweeted : " A message to Tokyo : When the timing is right we will come and celebrate the Games with you .
To our athletes , the nation and the world : Until then , stay safe and look after each other .
