Dr Gerry Burke : ' The threat is grave and the task the community faces is daunting and urgent '  Reporter :  Dr Gerry Burke  24 Mar 2020  0  SOMEHOW , in the face of an unprecedented threat , we have rallied ourselves .
We have organised in response to a virus that is moving through Europe with astonishing speed .
The coronavirus pandemic has scythed its way from Lombardy , through the densely populated cities and regions of Switzerland , Germany , France and the Low Countries , through Spain and Scandinavia , and it has reached Europe 's far flung places : Greece , Ireland , Iceland , and the Faroes .
By March 19 , Italy 's death toll had surpassed China 's .
In Ireland , as elsewhere , the number of cases has been increasing by 30% per day ( although that declined to 15% at the weekend of March 20th ) .
At 30% , 600 cases become 8,000 in ten days , and 150,000 in just three weeks .
So the threat is grave and the task the community faces is daunting and urgent .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coronavirus : by keeping the numbers of new infections each day at the lowest possible level .
When each infected person passes the virus on to fewer than one other person on average , then the virus can start to die out in the community .
That is what happened in China - and this is the path we must follow .
The principle is simple : avoid getting infected by another person , and if you do get infected , do not infect anyone else .
In particular , do not infect anyone vulnerable .
This can only be achieved by rigorous physical distancing -- stay away from other people , do not mingle , stay at home , keep a two-metre distance when you must have an interaction with another person ; and by meticulous cleanliness - wash your hands , clean the surfaces and objects you use , do n't touch your face , cough and sneeze with due care to minimise the dispersal of possibly infected droplets , dispose of tissues immediately and carefully .
A Conversation With Our Community  Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first responsibility is to provide acute medical care to our communities .
But they are also important repositories of scientific knowledge , and centres of learning .
These additional roles include the public dissemination of information on health topics , including the one that we all are grappling with now .
Our communications department has produced and distributed on social media several short videos about hygiene ; and clinicians and executives are making themselves available for radio and television interviews .
We are thankful to the media for facilitating and moderating this part of our work , and we recognise the importance of journalism at this critical time .
Many readers will have seen one of UL Hospitals ' consultants , Dr Catherine Motherway , giving important messages to the nation in very blunt terms on RTE 's Prime Time on March 19th , messages that need to sink in and change behaviour quickly .
The interview has been viewed by over one million people world-wide .
Prioritising the most ill among our patients is a fundamental concept in the social justice that governs medical care .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informs the development of our clinical services .
The Covid-19 outbreak shows us exactly how necessary it is to adhere to so simple a principle .
This is why Ireland , the HSE and UL Hospitals are working flat out to increase Intensive Care Unit capacity quickly .
We are preparing for the arrival of very many extremely ill patients .
Widely Distributed Leadership  Good care is the result of countless actions by skilled and diligent doctors , nurses , health and social care professionals ( HSCPs ) , and health care assistants ( HCAs ) , at the bedside , in the ICU , in the resuscitation room and throughout our hospital system .
At this time also , the medical scientists and personnel of our Department of Pathology have been doing Trojan work in diagnosis of Covid-19 cases .
In the coming weeks it will be really important that clinical experts take on key leadership roles .
What we have seen so far is an impressive national response to Covid-19 , complimented by an equally impressive response at local level , particularly in critical care preparedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executives who deserve enormous credit for their hard work and meticulous attention to detail .
The important tasks of recruiting additional staff , securing supplies of ventilators , oxygen , drugs , personal protective equipment and such like , and the ramping up of critical care capacity , fall to these valuable colleagues .
How Can I Help You ?  Public hospitals operate in the Samaritan tradition and their mission is to help people .
UL Hospitals Group is deeply committed to this tradition and mission .
The question ' How Can I Help You ? ' is at the core of our ethos .
It applies to patients , to colleagues , and to the wider community .
In the current crisis , it is essential that it is observed .
We appreciate the way the community has supported and encouraged our staff , and heeded our advice .
It makes a real difference .
Mid West Together  In this terrible springtime , we have seen exceptional unity in the community .
All sectors of society , public and private , have come together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The calm , obstinate resolve , the kindness in the words spoken to us , and indeed the fear in people 's faces , are very moving .
My friends and colleagues at UL Hospitals are immensely grateful for your unstinting goodwill as we face into the most difficult days of our lives .
We have prepared as well as we can .
We will do our best .
