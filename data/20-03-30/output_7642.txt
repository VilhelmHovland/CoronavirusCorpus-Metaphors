Wait ' til next year : NCAA approves extra year of eligibility for spring-sport athletes  The NCAA Division I Council approved a measure Monday afternoon to extend an extra year of eligibility to spring sport student-athletes following the cancellation of the remainder of their seasons earlier this month .
A bit a curveball , many of those around the collegiate sports water cooler speculated as last as minutes before the council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final vote on the matter back to June as they are several layers to the issue that need to be ironed out .

" I 'm excited from the players ' perspective , " Louisiana-Monroe head baseball coach Mike Federico told The News-Star Monday afternoon after the vote .

" I could n't believe it .
This is a great decision for our seniors as well as our juniors .
"  For schools like Louisiana Tech and ULM , what it would cost for seniors to accept an extra year of eligibility all the while welcoming a new class of freshmen across all spring sports an aspect of this debate that they hold great interest in .
Whether rosters for college baseball and softball teams will be expanded was not initially clarified , but where the NCAA goes from here as well as if sports later in the calendar , specifically football -- most schools highest revenue generating sport -- are affected by the coronavirus could pave the way for tough times for many institutions .
USA Today reported last week that it 's estimated that Power 5 schools could spend anywhere from $500,000 to $900,000 to let senior spring sport student-athletes come back for another season .
" The tricky part is how we can manage our rosters , what coaches can do with that and what our numbers can be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Federico said .
" With all this stuff with the virus , there 's so much uncertainty with that , I thought that they would delay their answer .
I did n't think there 's any way they come have come up with an answer , especially if this thing keeps going and it football season gets cut short .

The unknown future of this year 's Major League Baseball amateur draft , which could be held as late as July and could be as short as five rounds , is another aspect where there 's much fluidity in this issue .
But with the extra year of eligibility , college seniors and junior gained some leverage with the NCAA 's ruling .
" From a professional standpoint , our juniors have a little more leverage now .
I was feeling for some of our junior guys , " Burroughs said .
" With the possibility of the draft only being five or 10 rounds , they would have not bargaining chip or leverage .
These guys , if they do n't get drafted or sign a free agent contract , they can come back and play another year .
This bodes well for them .
"  Federico said he was shocked the NCAA arrived a decision today , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have to put the student-athlete first .
It 's obvious the committed looked at it and the experience for these guys playing is important , " he said .
" This proved that there are a lot of people fighting for this .
This benefits the kid and that 's our job as coaches is the provide for the student-athlete .
