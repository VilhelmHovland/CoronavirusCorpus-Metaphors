If you value what we are doing , you can help us by making a contribution to the cost of our journalism  The UK government is said to be one of a number of countries lining up to buy Chinese ventilators as it looks abroad to find life-saving equipment to deal with the coronavirus outbreak .
But Tice took to Twitter to say he would rather the government bought British ventilators than those from overseas - suggesting the Chinese could not be trusted to sell uncontaminated life-saving equipment .
The Brexiteer tweeted : " Should we trust the Chinese to sell us uncontaminated ventilators ? Or will they repackage and sell us used ones ? I 'd rather buy BRITISH ventilators made by our great manufacturers .
Thoughts welcome .

"  " I 'd rather buy ventilators that work , " replied Andrew Lilco .
" Wherever they come from in the world " .
" Pin a note to your clothes that you only want to be supported by British-made equipment if you 're in hospital .
That 'll sort it " , another told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Really doubt those struggling to breathe are going to be too concerned about the origins of the machine which could well save their life , you xenophobic pr*ck .
