Les Leyne : Health system could bend out of shape , but not break  British Columbia 's health-care system would have to stretch to the snapping point if the COVID-19 outbreak turns into a northern Italy style catastrophe .
But briefings Friday on the planning to brace for the worst-case scenario suggest the system could handle it .
It would bend completely out of shape compared to normal times .
It already has , with the emptying of 3,900 hospital beds .
But it would n't necessarily break .
The modelling was based on using the experience of three countries , notably the northern Italy disaster .
Numbers and rates were transposed to B .
, particularly the number of hospitalizations .
But officials stressed the model is n't an expectation of what will happen .
It 's an estimate of what would be needed if it did happen .
And the prospect of the worst-case scenario coming to pass in B .
was downplayed for a number of reasons .
One is that B .
is a few weeks behind Italy and has had the time to learn from the shortcomings there .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty the hospitals and brace for the onslaught .
has cancelled elective surgeries and reduced the hospital occupancy rate from the usual 100% to about two-thirds .
That creates surge capacity for what might come .
The other reason to downplay the worst-case is the slight bit of encouragement in B .
's virus rate .
The health ministry briefings said the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in B .
has been positively impacted by the severe health measures put in place over the past few weeks .
The trajectory changed from a 24% average daily increase to 12% this week .
A change in the testing strategy to concentrate where the highest risk is contributes to the drop , as does the closed border that stopped new cases from elsewhere coming to B .
But the hope is that social distancing is contributing to slowing the spread .
A hypothetical model of the caseload had social distancing not been mandated puts the number of cases today far higher than it actually is .
It stands at 792 as of Friday .
The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B .
will follow .
The drastic social distancing measures started getting imposed March 13 and it took several days for people to comprehend them .
The virus has a 14-day incubation period .
So what the daily count does in the next few days will confirm the first wave of restrictions are having effect .
Comparing around the world , B .
and Canada are currently closer to the South Korea experience than the much more severe situations in northern Italy and China 's Hubei province .
Nonetheless , planning extends to the Italian scenario , which means B .
's system is bracing for an onslaught .
The 17 biggest hospitals in B .
-- Nanaimo General and Royal Jubilee on Vancouver Island -- are designated to treat primarily COVID-19 patients .
Officials said the principle is to keep patients and care teams together , to keep the risk of transmission confined .
Children with the virus who need ICU ( expected to be very few ) would go to B .
Children 's in Vancouver .
Other hospitals would be used as need arises .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other public facilities -- if need be .
In the worst-case , Health Minister Adrian Dix said B .
" would have to use all sites to meet bed demand and implement increased transportation of patients between sites .
"  It 's all based on the assumption based on current rates that 14% of patients with the virus will need hospitalization for two to seven days , and 4 .
will need critical care .
There are 73 currently hospitalized .
Which explains the urgency of the repeated social distance warnings , the duration of which Henry is referring to in months .
" I never ever thought that I would have to do those types of things , " she said .
" But right now this is what we need to do .
