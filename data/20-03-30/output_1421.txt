After all , the FTSE 100 index has shed around 30% of its value since the start of the year .
However , caution must be exercised in a market crash .

A gloomy outlook for the property market  The UK government has recently urged anyone buying or selling property to delay moving .
This comes as the wider housing market struggles to cope with the effects of the coronavirus .
Rightmove , the UK 's largest online real estate website , has warned that sales have started to fall through .
The housing market is facing a sharp slowdown in activity caused by house buyers ' uncertainty over the pandemic .
This is bad news for UK housebuilders , especially Taylor Wimpey ( LSE : TW ) , one of Britain 's largest housebuilding companies .
The firm has closed all sales offices and construction sites and is now implementing measures to preserve cash .
Dividends have been scrapped and earnings are forecast to drop substantially .
I think it 's relatively easy to see that the coronavirus pandemic will paralyse the UK housing market .
It could also mean a long-drawn-out process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , I 'm inclined to stay away from Taylor Wimpey for the time being .
The same goes for other UK housebuilders listed in the index .
There are many bargains to be had elsewhere , with more favourable prospects of recovery and growth , I feel .

I just do n't think it will happen any time soon .
Nobody 's watching films  With many countries around the world in lockdown , leisure and entertainment activities have ceased .
While online streaming providers look set to profit from this , cinemas can expect to take a big hit .

The company itself recognises the danger it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the Group 's ability to continue " .
In other words , the company faces going bust within months if lockdown measures remain in place .
I 'm not ruling out the possibility of Cineworld staging a comeback , but I think there are better companies out there to invest in during times of economic uncertainty .
It goes without saying that companies with healthy balance sheets , free cash flows and low debt levels are the ones to focus on right now .
Cineworld does n't match this description , so I 'm staying away .
And with the Covid-19 virus now beginning to spread beyond of China and Italy , it seems very likely that the bull market we 've enjoyed over the past decade could finally be coming to an end .
Against such a backdrop of market worry , it 's little wonder that many investors are starting to panic .
