Canadian military ready to mobilize 24,000 troops for COVID-19 : Minister  Chief of Defence Staff Jonathan Vance looks on as National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan speaks during a news conference in Ottawa , Monday , March 30 , 2020 .
THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld  OTTAWA -- The crews of two Royal Canadian Navy vessels were ordered to sequester in a Halifax hotel for two weeks as the federal government announced Monday that it is ready to mobilize up to 24,000 Canadian troops at the drop of a hat to help with the COVID-19 pandemic .
Rear-Admiral Craig Baines , commander of Maritime Atlantic Forces , ordered sailors from HMCS Ville de Quebec and HMCS Moncton as well as the crew of a maritime helicopter detachment to sequester to ensure they are clear of the respiratory illness .
Efforts are underway to find an appropriate hotel , Baines said in a letter to sailors and their families , adding the sequestration wo n't begin until April .
After two weeks , the vessels and helicopter will head out to sea where they will be ready to respond to a domestic emergency as needed .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community spread within one of the ships should someone have contracted the virus at the last minute due to natural family interactions , " he said in his letter .
" I recognize this decision will be very challenging for our sailors and their families .
In many ways , it will be like they have left on deployment , while in reality they will be very close by .
"  The U .
Navy has seen COVID-19 infections on two of its nuclear-powered aircraft carriers over the past week , where close quarters have allowed the illness to spread like wildfire among the crew .
Baines could not say how long the Ville de Quebec and Moncton would remain at sea , suggesting it would largely depend on the pandemic .
The sequestration order came as the federal government promised the military is ready to respond should a formal request for assistance come from a province , territory or municipality , whether it is to help with COVID-19 or a natural disaster such as a flood .
" To date , the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories , " Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in French during the daily news conference outside his Ottawa home on Monday .
" If that were to change , the Armed Forces would be ready to answer the call as they have done throughout our history , whether it is to transport medical equipment or protect your homes during the flood or forest-fire season .
Those who wear the uniform will be there for you .
"  Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan later revealed Ottawa is ready to mobilize up to 24,000 Canadian troops to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic .
That represents about a quarter of the entire force and would be one of the largest peacetime mobilizations in Canadian history .
Those on standby include 10 Canadian Army units as well as Navy ships and Air Force aircraft and crew .
Reservists and Canadian Rangers are also being put on notice , Sajjan said , with the Rangers ready to conduct patrols to northern and Indigenous communities .
" These flexible teams are capable of operating as local response forces to assist with humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks as required , " said Sajjan , adding requests for assistance will be prioritized based on need .
The minister added that the government has been in touch with some remote communities to assess their needs .
The military has in recent years provided assistance , including evacuations due to flooding and forest fires , to Indigenous communities and others in the north .
Sajjan also left the door open to military personnel helping enforce quarantines while chief of the defence staff Gen .
Jonathan Vance said the Armed Forces could provide medical support and engineers if required .
Vance last week essentially put all Canadian military personnel on a war footing by telling them to stay healthy and be ready to respond .
He also asked members who were in the process of voluntarily leaving the Forces to reconsider and encouraged veterans to rejoin .
Meanwhile , military commanders have been working to be ready to help with COVID-19 at the same time as they could also be asked to respond to natural disasters , with many communities across Canada having experienced extreme springtime flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also being asked to maintain its presence in several overseas missions while guarding against any potential attack .
The federal government is looking at all its overseas missions and making adjustments where needed , Sajjan said .
It is also working closely with its allies and " looking at any adversaries that might take advantage of the situation .
