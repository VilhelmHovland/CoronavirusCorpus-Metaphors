NCDC tracing 6,000 contacts of COVID-19 cases  The Director- General of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control ( NCDC ) , Dr .
Chikwe Ihekweazu , said on Monday the agency was now tracing 6,000 people who reportedly had contact with COVID-19 cases in the country .
Chikwe , who stated these during an interview on Channels Television , also threw his weight behind President Muhammadu Buhari 's decision to impose movement restrictions in Lagos , Ogun and Abuja .
He said the best way to prevent further spread of COVID-19 is to limit movement and contact between people .
He said : " We appeal to Nigerians to bear the few weeks of pain to come and let 's see whether we can get on top of this .
" These weeks will allow our teams to have access to the contacts that are living around Lagos and FCT .
We are following over 6,000 contacts of these 111 confirmed cases across these two cities .
Every time we have a new case , we add about 50 to 60 contacts that we then have to follow every single day for 14 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time to buy some time to get ahead of the cases and ultimately see that curve start going down .
But in the next few days , we still do expect an increase in cases .
" We have currently tested well over 2000 people and we will update those figures today or tomorrow .
We have increased the number of laboratories in our network to six .
We are activating Abakaliki today .
There will be a seventh laboratory in our network .
" We are maximizing the opportunity of the equipment that we have and at the same time rolling out new laboratories .
We 're very focused on increasing the testing capacity .
We are being boxed down by people who do not require the test .
