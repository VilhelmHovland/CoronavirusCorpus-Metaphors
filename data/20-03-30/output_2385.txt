Sherlock Holmes , the Boer War and Sam Steele : tracing the connections  Doug Wrigglesworth was all set to talk to the Bradford West Gwillimbury Local History Association on Saturday , about Canadian involvement in the Boer War .
The self-described " history nerd " was especially excited to talk about one of the heroes of the Boer War , Canadian Sam Steele , born in Medonte Township , near Orillia .
Then COVID-19 happened .
Social gatherings were cancelled , public buildings like the Bradford West Gwillimbury Public Library , where the association meets , were closed and social distancing became a necessity .
The public talk may have been cancelled , but Wrigglesworth was happy to chat about his interest in the Boer War , and in Steele .
The Boer War of 1899 to 1902 was fought between the South African Dutch settlers ( Boers ) , and the British .
It was a brutal war of the late 19th century , driven by colonialism and the thirst for resources .
Wrigglesworth 's interest was sparked not so much by British military history , although that is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sherlock Holmes .
Wrigglesworth is a ' Sherlockian ' -- a fan of author Arthur Conan Doyle and his creations , Sherlock Holmes and Dr .
John Watson .
Sherlockians " play the literary game , in which Sherlock and Watson were real , " he explained -- which involves following connections to real people and real events contemporary with the action in the stories published largely between 1887 and 1927 .
When Wrigglesworth was reached for this story , he was addressing copies of Canadian Holmes , the journal of The Bootmakers of Toronto , a chapter of the Sherlock Holmes Society of Canada .
He also took time to explain the Boer connection .
In 1900 , Conan Doyle " picked up his stethoscope , that he had laid down ten years before , and volunteered for a hospital in South Africa , in the midst of a typhus epidemic , " in support of the British forces .
Conan Doyle also wrote several books , in the years that followed , justifying the British actions against the Boers -- and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes , that earned Conan Doyle a knighthood from King Edward VII .
" It all connects , " Wrigglesworth said .
The topic was also , he said , " an excuse for me to make up a talk on my particular Canadian hero , Sam Steele .
"  Wrigglesworth remembered going to the movies as a kid , " and having Gene Autrey and those guys and not having any Canadian heroes .
"  Then he discovered Steele , the " man of iron , " in the history books .
Born just outside Orillia in 1848 or 1849 , Steele " did n't do well on the farm , " Wrigglesworth said , but he was passionate about following a military career .
He joined the Militia while still a teen , to fight the Fenian raids , and later joined the Red River Expedition in 1870 .
Fascinated by the west and the tales of James Fennimore Cooper , in 1873 he became the third officer sworn in by the North West Mounted Police -- rising swiftly through the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian Pacific Railway was constructed -- and suppressing Riel 's North-West Rebellion , in 1885 .
He arrived too late for the Battle of Batoche , but " he went and did his thing , won a couple of battles with his small troop , " said Wrigglesworth , and was promoted to Superintendent .
When the Gold Rush hit the Yukon in 1896 , it was Sam Steele who commanded a contingent of the North West Mounted Police to block the passes between the Alaska panhandle and the Yukon , requiring all miners to have at least a year 's supply of food before they could enter .
Steele also brought order to a corrupt and lawless Dawson City , although his tough stands did n't always make him popular .
Steele 's connection to the Boer War ? He had met Lord Strathcona , then Donald Smith , while the CPR line was being built , and impressed Smith with his ability to keep order .
In 1900 , he was offered the command of Lord Strathcona 's Horse , a mounted regiment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted police , " Wrigglesworth said .
Strathcona 's Horse proved to be one of the most effective battalions in the fight against the Boer forces .
While in South Africa , Lt .
-Col .
Steele met and impressed Major General Baden-Powell -- and in 1901 , was offered command of a division of South African Constabulary .
Baden-Powell , later the founder of Boy Scouts , had one more connection to Steele : he borrowed the Stetsons worn by the Strathcona Horse and based on those worn by the Mounties , for his scouting movement .
Steele returned to Canada in 1907 but remained active .
He was 66 when World War I broke out , and was promoted to Major General .
He travelled to Britain , only to find the British felt he was too old for active command , and his appointment as C .
of the British Army South-Eastern Division was the source of continuing conflict , until he was sent back to Canada .
" He was an interesting guy , " said Wrigglesworth : a flawed hero , with the prejudices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stetson guy that Gene Autrey and Roy Rogers were .
He was tough , and took no nonsense " -- and was memorable , blemishes and all .
Wrigglesworth is looking forward to the day when he can share stories of the Boer War and Sam Steele with the Bradford West Gwillimbury Local History Association once the COVID-19 crisis is over .
