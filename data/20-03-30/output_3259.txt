According to the CBN monthly Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers ' Index ( PMI ) report for March 2020 released this week , Nigeria 's manufacturing sector expanded for the thirty-sixth consecutive month while the non-manufacturing sector contracted for the first time , after thirty-four consecutive month of expansion .
A PMI reading below 50 index point indicates sector contraction , while PMI reading of 50 index point indicates neutrality , and PMI above 50 points indicates sector expansion .
According to the data released , the overall manufacturing PMI reading for March settled at 51 .
index point .
This is 720bps lower than the 58 .
index point expansion recorded in the previous month .
Of the five major sub-components of the manufacturing PMI , New orders and Production Level saw weaker expansion at 52 .
and 54 .
index points in March compared to 59 .
and 58 .
index points in February .
This could be attributed to the partial closure of some manufacturing firms in other to contain the spread of Covid-19 .
On the other hand , there was a contraction in Supplier Delivery Time ( 49 .
index point ) , Employment level ( 47 .
index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) as against 58 .
, 56 .
, and 58 .
index points in the preceding month respectively .
This we believe was in reflection of the preventive measure paced in other to contain the spread of CoViD-19 such as travelling restriction placed by some countries in the world as well as some states in Nigeria , social distancing and closure of schools .
Similarly to the manufacturing PMI index , the Non-manufacturing PMI went into contraction from 58 .
index point in February to 49 .
index point in March .
The contraction was attributed to a contraction in three ( 3 ) out of four ( 4 ) diffusion indices , namely ; New Order ( 47 .
index point from 58 .
index point ) , Employment Level ( 47 .
index point from 57 .
index point ) and Inventories ( 49 .
index point from 58 .
index point ) save for Business Activities which recorded slower expansion by 52 .
index point from 59 .
index point in February .
Owing to the rising number of the global mortality rate of Covid-19 and increase in the number of infected cases in Nigeria which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could force the federal government to go for a tougher measure such as total lockdown , we expect both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMIs to go into contraction in the coming months as a result of low business activities , a low number in the inventory , high supplier delivery time and low order of new goods and services which could arise from the action .
