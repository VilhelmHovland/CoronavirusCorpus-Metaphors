Leading in a crisis : strategic crisis leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic  The COVID-19 pandemic has become the ultimate stress test for communities , countries and the world .
It falls into the ' once in a lifetime ' category , but the dynamics and challenges it will entail have been studied for years by researchers investigating " super wicked problems " , " transboundary crises " and " mega crises " .
Time is at a premium .
Political and public service leaders must deliver their ultimate performance in the face of exceptional threats , gaps and flaws in the available data , and high levels of uncertainty about how any interventions will play out .
They must do so in the full light of media , and under the forensic scrutiny of experts , business owners and worried citizens .
The costs of failure are high for all concerned .
Offering steadfast strategic leadership under these circumstances appears to be a daunting prospect .
But it is not impossible .
Based on extensive research over decades , we identify key current and future leadership challenges , while offering recommendations for leaders seeking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detecting incoming issues in a fast-changing situation  The speed and scale the COVID-19 threat have surprised most , if not all , governments .
By the time it became an ' official ' crisis , the virus and its impact were already cascading across national borders and economic sectors from health to tourism and hospitality .
It is very difficult to call a crisis when the public , experts and politicians are mentally not ready to accept the emerging threat as one .
The COVID-19 crisis will give rise to new crises , some of which will be hard to imagine now but will seem conventional wisdom next week .
Recommendation : Accept that you are now in new territory , where the normal rules of problem emergence and problem definition are not valid .
Leaders will have to grasp the evolving nature of the crisis in a timely manner to stay ahead of the curve while avoiding suggestions that they seek to exploit or manufacture it .
Timing and framing are everything .
It has proven frustratingly hard to understand the speed , scope and consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information .
Experts disagree on escalation rates and the impact of proposed measures .
Seemingly dramatic predictions are based on modeling efforts that make use of disputed input variables .
As a result , leaders are navigating in semi-darkness .
Recommendation : Accept , as the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte put it , that ' with 50% being uncertain you still have to make 100% of the decisions ' .
There are major limits to what you can know in the here and now , which makes it important to ensure you have whatever is available .
Gather as much feedback as possible from statistics on testing and hospital bed capacities , to issues of societal resilience and the extent of compliance with new laws , regulations and guidelines .
But realise that the data may prompt new questions .
Be aware of what happens in other countries but recognise that threat trajectories and success measures do not automatically translate into valid prescriptions for different environments .
Deep uncertainty is the essence of the crisis .
Accept major limitations to your information flow rather than waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Making life-or-death decisions  The COVID-19 crisis brings all the dilemmas that crisis experts fear most : choosing between who will live and die ; weighing how much economic damage we will take to save the lives for a select category of fellow citizens ; balancing unpopular measures against the necessity of legitimacy .
These are defining choices that determine how history is written .
They can also be lonely moments for leaders .
Recommendation:Avoid the temptation of heroic leadership -- the historic model of the ultimate decision that demands the ultimate sacrifice .
Stick with the limited hard data that you have , but realise that experts will not take all values into consideration .
Making value judgments and weighing the balance of interests are what prudent political leadership is about .
In charting a course , take a pragmatic approach by trying to avoid irreversible decisions as long as you can , and create mental and political space for adjusting and reversing decisions that turn out to be counter-productive or wrong .
Challenge 4 : The art of strategic coordination  In a global crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and societal -- will need to do their part .
They must work together , as the integrity and effectiveness of the overall response is highly dependent on them joining up their individual responses .
They are usually willing to do just that , but they may need guidance .
The same is true for citizens , many of whom are keen to volunteer .
There is much societal resilience on offer , but it needs to be given a license to operate through explicit facilitation , public encouragement and regulatory flexibility .
Recommendation : Think about this crisis and the responses to it across sectors , across levels , across boundaries .
In a crisis such as COVID-19 , formal competencies and institutionalised boundaries can be navigated with surprising ease , as long as the skills of people and organisations are recognised and respected .
Leaders need to reach out and bring everybody on board .
That is the art of strategic coordination .
Office-driven or agency-centric command and control are overrated .
Challenge 5 : Keep worried publics and wary workers on side  Crisis communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It emphasises the need for clear , timely , consistent and repeated messaging and actionable advice , delivered by credible sources .
Yet it remains surprising how often crisis communication turns out to be an Achilles heel of crisis response .
Government communications may be ' behind the curve ' or offer ambiguous messages that seek to balance competing priorities .
Leaders often fail to convince and can be disconnected from people 's experiences .
They may also be overly cautious in avoiding panic among citizens and therefore refuse to communicate the whole truth .
Fifty years of crisis research has shown this almost never happens as most citizens can handle ominous information when given clear guidance on how to act .
Recommendation : If you get it wrong , rumours and intensifying criticism will soon let you know .
Do not let it get to that point .
Fill the hunger for information and the need for guidance , informed not just by expert knowledge and incoming data but also by grasping the public 's evolving mood and spirit .
All messaging has to have a clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the message and measures should be aimed at protecting the elderly .
If ICU beds are in short supply , leaders should explain where they will come from or who will get to use them .
Treat citizens ( and staff ) like adults .
