In Lombardy , Italian authorities are using cellphone location data to determine what percentage of people are obeying a lockdown order .
The New York Times  In South Korea , government agencies are harnessing surveillance-camera footage , smartphone location data and credit card purchase records to help trace the recent movements of coronavirus patients and establish virus transmission chains .
In Lombardy , Italy , authorities are analysing location data transmitted by citizens ' mobile phones to determine how many people are obeying a government lockdown order and the typical distances they move every day .
About 40% are moving around " too much , " an official recently said .
In Israel , the country 's internal security agency is poised to start using a cache of mobile phone location data -- originally intended for counterterrorism operations -- to try to pinpoint citizens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries around the world race to contain the pandemic , many are deploying digital surveillance tools as a means to exert social control , even turning security agency technologies on their own civilians .
Health and law enforcement authorities are understandably eager to employ every tool at their disposal to try to hinder the virus -- even as the surveillance efforts threaten to alter the precarious balance between public safety and personal privacy on a global scale .
Yet ratcheting up surveillance to combat the pandemic now could permanently open the doors to more invasive forms of snooping later .
It is a lesson Americans learned after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 , 2001 , civil liberties experts say .
Nearly two decades later , law enforcement agencies have access to higher-powered surveillance systems , like fine-grained location tracking and facial recognition -- technologies that may be repurposed to further political agendas like anti-immigration policies .
Civil liberties experts warn that the public has little recourse to challenge these digital exercises of state power .
" We could so easily end up in a situation where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures in response to this pandemic that fundamentally change the scope of American civil rights , " said Albert Fox Cahn , executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project , a nonprofit organisation in Manhattan .
As an example , he pointed to a law enacted by New York state this month that gives Gov Andrew Cuomo unlimited authority to rule by executive order during state crises like pandemics and hurricanes .
The law allows him to issue emergency response directives that could overrule any local regulations .
This month , Australia 's health minister publicly chastised a doctor whom she accused of treating patients while experiencing symptoms of the virus -- essentially outing him by naming the small clinic in Victoria where he worked with a handful of other physicians .

" That could extend to anyone , to suddenly have the status of your health blasted out to thousands or potentially millions of people , " said Chris Gilliard , an independent privacy scholar based in the Detroit area .
" It 's a very strange thing to do because , in the alleged interest of public health , you are actually endangering people .
"  But in emergencies like pandemics , privacy must be weighed against other considerations , like saving lives , said Mila Romanoff , data and governance lead for United Nations Global Pulse , a UN programme that has studied using data to improve emergency responses to epidemics like Ebola and dengue fever .
" We need to have a framework that would allow companies and public authorities to cooperate , to enable proper response for the public good , " Romanoff said .
To reduce the risk that coronavirus surveillance efforts might violate people 's privacy , she said , governments and companies should limit the collection and use of data to only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added , " how much data is enough ? "  The fast pace of the pandemic , however , is prompting governments to put in place a patchwork of digital surveillance measures in the name of their own interests , with little international coordination on how appropriate or effective they are .
In hundreds of cities in China , the government is requiring citizens to use software on their phones that automatically classifies each person with a color code -- red , yellow or green -- indicating contagion risk .
The software determines which people should be quarantined or permitted to enter public places like subways .
But officials have not explained how the system makes such decisions , and citizens have felt powerless to challenge it .
In Singapore , the Ministry of Health has posted information online about each coronavirus patient , often in stunning detail , including relationships to other patients .
The idea is to warn individuals who may have crossed paths with them , as well as alert the public to potentially infected locations .
" Case 219 is a 30-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's site , who worked at the " Sengkang Fire Station ( 50 Buangkok Drive ) , " is " in an isolation room at Sengkang General Hospital " and " is a family member of Case 236 .
"  On Friday , Singapore also introduced a smartphone app for citizens to help authorities locate people who may have been exposed to the virus .
The app , called TraceTogether , uses Bluetooth signals to detect mobile phones that are nearby .
If an app user later tests positive for the virus , health authorities may examine the data logs from the app to find people who crossed their paths .
A government official said the app preserved privacy by not revealing users ' identities to one another .
In Mexico , after public health officials notified Uber about a passenger infected with the virus , the company suspended the accounts of two drivers who had given him rides , along with more than 200 passengers who had ridden with those drivers .
In the United States , the White House recently spoke with Google , Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured from Americans ' mobile phones for public health surveillance of the virus .
Several members of Congress subsequently wrote a letter urging President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to protect any virus-related data that companies collected from Americans .
The digital dictates may enable governments to exert more social control and enforce social distancing during the pandemic .
They also raise questions about when surveillance may go too far .
In January , South Korea 's government began posting detailed location histories on each person who tested positive for the coronavirus .
The site has included a wealth of information -- such as details about when people left for work , whether they wore masks in the subway , the name of the stations where they changed trains , the massage parlours and karaoke bars they frequented and the names of the clinics where they were tested for the virus .
In South Korea 's highly wired society , however , internet mobs exploited patient data disclosed by the government site to identify people by name and hound them .
As other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concerned that privacy invasions might discourage citizens from getting tested for the virus , health officials announced this month that they would refine their data-sharing guidelines to minimize patient risk .
" We will balance the value of protecting individual human rights and privacy and the value of upholding public interest in preventing mass infections , " said Jung Eun-kyeong , director of South Korea 's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .
That is a tricky balance that some US officials may need to consider .
In New York this month , Mayor Bill de Blasio posted details on Twitter about a lawyer in Westchester County who was the second person in the state to test positive for the virus -- including the name of the man 's seven-person law firm and the names of the schools attended by two of his children .
A few hours later , The New York Post identified the lawyer by name and was soon referring to him as " patient zero " in the coronavirus outbreak in New Rochelle .
In a response posted on Facebook , Adina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , Lawrence Garbuz , pleaded with the public to focus instead on the personal efforts the family had made to isolate themselves and notify people who came into contact with them .
" We would have preferred this all remain private , " Garbuz wrote in the Facebook post , " but since it is no longer , I wanted to at least share some truths and allay people 's fears .
