Ms Watkins , one of Australia 's top businesswomen , is now running the $6 .
billion drinks giant from the pool room in the " old rambling " farmhouse on her farm in south-west Victoria .
Coca-Cola Amatil boss Alison Watkins is running the company during the COVID-19 crisis from the family farm in south-west Victoria , instead of the company 's North Sydney HQ .
Douvis  Her desk has been strategically positioned in the corner of the room , which she likens to the pool room in the famous 1990s Australian movie The Castle , after her tech-savvy 25-year-old son identified it as the best location for Internet reception .
Across the pool table her daughter , a university student , often sits at her own desk .
The farm , a cattle and cropping property near Camperdown , puts Ms Watkins about 1000 kilometres away from Coca-Cola Amatil 's ( now de-populated ) headquarters in North Sydney .

" I always love being here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here for quite a bit of the time , " she says .
Ms Watkins is speaking almost daily with the company 's chairman or directors , and the entire board is meeting either weekly or fortnightly via the WebEx platform .
While Ms Watkins is comfortable with her working-from-home arrangements , she acknowledges she is in a fortunate position compared to many others , who might have young children , pets or partners at home to contend with .
" Increasingly , it 's going to be a really stressful time for a lot of people , both because of these confined conditions that we 're all operating under , but you add on top of that the reality of people losing their jobs , right as we speak , " she says .
" I know a number of people whose families are directly impacted by that .
So , adding in the financial stress , the uncertainty , I think it 's such a really challenging time , " she says .
The unravelling of the Australian stockmarket and the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have happened in a flash .
The market responded positively , pushing its shares up 8 .
per cent on a day the Australian market hit a record high of $13 .
They have since lost almost 40 per cent of their value .
And on that day , Coca-Cola forecast mid-single digit earnings per share growth in 2020 .
But the guidance was withdrawn within four weeks following an escalation in the coronavirus outbreak , a string of profit warnings from other companies , increased restrictions imposed by governments and great uncertainty about the impact of the virus .
Ms Watkins says 2020 is now a year of " protecting the business .
" " It 's really quite unthinkable , the speed of the change that 's happened , " she says .
" We mentioned at that time that we were alert to the ongoing economic effects of the bushfires and also COVID-19 .
but I think none of us appreciated just how , within the space of a matter of weeks , it would reshape our world .
And certainly our humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

:  However , she emphasises that Coca-Cola Amatil is a strong cash generator , profitable , and has a good balance sheet .
" We 've got a very secure financial position and I think for us 2020 is now all about protecting what it is that makes us strong as a business and making sure that we , to the extent we can , protect the jobs , protect our workforce , protect our business continuity and protect our customer relationships .
And try to come through this health crisis stage intact , and able to reshape and accelerate , " she says .
Loading  " I do n't think we 're going to come through this stage with the economy and our customer base looking the same .
There 's certainly going to be some changes and so we will need to reshape , " she says .
A key determinant is how customers that have been hit hard by shutdowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " I suspect it 's going to be quite a different landscape that we 'll be dealing with , because unfortunately quite a number of them wo n't be around , or it will take quite some time for them to really be able to get going , " she says .
" Our resources are lined up behind our customers .
And so a reshaping of our business will reflect the way that our customers and channels might be reshaped , " she says .
Ms Watkins says Coca-Cola Amatil has already " been through a lot of cost reductions , so it 's not likely to be so much about that for us .
It 's more about what does the customer landscape look like " .
The company 's delivery operations have already been altered .
Normally , it delivers to supermarket distribution centres on B-double trucks , with the retailers then organising loads to stores .
But now it is delivering direct to supermarkets in smaller trucks , and sending out staff to help unload and put products on shelves .
