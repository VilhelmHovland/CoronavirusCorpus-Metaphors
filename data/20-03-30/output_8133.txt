( Photo : Keith Srakocic , AP )  WEST LAFAYETTE - Spring sport athletes who had their seasons cut short by the coronavirus outbreak will receive an additional year of eligibility .
The NCAA 's Division I Council voted to allow schools to provide another season of competition and an extension of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include athletes in winter sports .
The ruling for spring sport athletes applies to all classes , granting seniors another year and preventing underclassmen from losing the season .
The NCAA also adjusted financial aid rules to allow schools to carry more scholarship athletes in 2021 to account for newcomers and returning players .
The NCAA , though , did not guarantee financial aid .
Monday 's decision gives athletic departments the flexibility to match , lower or eliminate scholarship aid for returning senior athletes that would have exhausted eligibility in 2020 .
With the NCAA sending less money to schools following the cancellation of the men 's basketball tournament and the 2020 college football season in jeopardy , the financial support is n't available for additional scholarships .
The NCAA announced last Thursday the direct distribution to Division I conferences and schools is $225 million - $375 million less than originally forecasted .
If the college football season is canceled or shortened due to COVID-19 , it would cause financial hardship across all of intercollegiate athletics with the loss of ticket sales and media rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Student Assistance Fund to pay for additional scholarship needs during the 2020-21 academic year .
" The Council 's decision gives individual schools the flexibility to make decisions at a campus level , " said chair M .
Grace Calhoun , athletic director at Penn .
" The Board of Governors encouraged conferences and schools to take action in the best interest of student-athletes and their communities , and now schools have the opportunity to do that .
"  The decision also removed a limit on baseball rosters , which was 35 , to handle the increased number of athletes expected to return .
Baseball is the only spring sport with a roster limit .
Winter sports were not included in the decision , even though a statement from the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee encouraged the council to include those athletes .
SAAC also recommended the NCAA provide immediate support for housing and food and returning seniors should have their scholarships renewed and those scholarships should not be counted towards financial aid limits .
