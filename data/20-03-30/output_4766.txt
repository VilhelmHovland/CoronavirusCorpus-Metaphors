States and territories are closing borders to slow COVID-19 , but is it legal ?  As Australian states and territories move to seal off their borders to slow the spread of COVID-19 , questions have been raised over whether the extreme action is legal under our Constitution .
So far Western Australia , South Australia , Tasmania and the Northern Territory have closed borders , meaning anyone who arrives from interstate will need to self-isolate for 14 days with exemptions for essential services and health workers .
Queensland 's borders will be closed from midnight on Wednesday , while Victoria , the ACT and New South Wales remain open for now .
So , are state and territory border closures allowed ? .
customs , trade , commerce , and intercourse among the states , whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation , shall be absolutely free .
' '  This means Australians should be " absolutely free " to move across state and territory borders .
But Anne Twomey , a professor of constitutional law at the University of Sydney , said the term ' absolutely free ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been subject to an understanding that the states and Commonwealth can enact laws that protect things like public health , " Professor Twomey told The New Daily .
Although the prospect of state border closures might appear dramatic , the measure is nothing new .
During the devastating Spanish flu pandemic in 1919 , the border between Victoria and NSW was closed after a soldier contracted the disease from an infected passenger during a train journey from Melbourne to Sydney .
" The Spanish flu is the last time such an incredibly serious type of pandemic happened , so that 's a reasonable comparator , " Professor Twomey said .
" It just goes to show that in a crisis , things change .
" Most of these crises are defence issues , like in World War II .
The way the High Court has interpreted the defence power is that it waxes and wanes and expands during a time of war .
And in times of peace , it shrinks .
"  More recently , before the coronavirus reached Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and territory to stop diseases or pests from infecting crops .
For example , interstate travellers are banned from bringing certain fruits into Queensland due to fruit fly epidemics .
How far can the border closures go ?  Of all the states and territories that have introduced border closures to manage the spread of COVID-19 , Queensland has the toughest rules .
In other states like Tasmania , border restrictions mean visitors must spend two weeks in self-isolation .
But in Queensland , visitors will be denied entry .
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the state 's border would only remain open to freight and essential travel , and some residents who work on either side of the border .
Professor Twomey said the move was " a bit more controversial " .
" I think Queensland has gone further by saying they 're not going to let certain people in , " Professor Twomey said .
" If there is going to be a ( legal ) challenge , it 's more likely to be the types of laws that prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you can come in , but you need to self-isolate .
" I suspect at this stage in the game , people are more concerned about protecting their health than running off to court .
