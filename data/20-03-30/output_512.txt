Share this story  There 's a scene somewhere in the middle of a new flat Earth documentary that acts as a metaphor for so much that surrounds it .
Two of the central figures of Behind the Curve are visiting a spaceflight museum that pays tribute to NASA , an organization that they believe is foisting a tremendous lie on an indoctrinated and incurious public .
One of them , Mark Sargent , sits in a re-entry simulator that suggests he should press " Start " to begin .
He dutifully bangs away at the highlighted word " Start " on screen , but nothing happens .
He wanders away muttering even more about how NASA 's a giant fraud .
Meanwhile , the camera shifts back to the display and zeroes in on the giant green " Start " button next to the seat Sargent was in .
Into the fringes  It 's hard not to think back to two earlier scenes in the movie .
In the first , Sargent talks about how he started having suspicions about the globe when he spent weeks watching a flight tracker for flights crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit with his favored model of the Earth 's disk , one with the North Pole at the center and the continents spread out like spokes from there .
This would place the southern continents much farther apart and make air travel prohibitive -- just as the lack of flights suggested .
A short while afterward , Behind the Curve shifts focus to a Caltech astronomer who brings up a flight tracker on her laptop and quickly finds planes in the middle of the southern oceans .
It 's not clear how Sargent missed these or why he did n't skip watching and just check a travel site for nonstop flight offerings ( I easily found routes from Auckland to Santiago and Sydney to Johannesburg ) .
Head-scratching scenes like this abound as the film crew follows a number of flat Earth community members in the build-up to a major convention .
The community is tight-knit , supportive , and willing to overlook details like having completely incompatible ideas about how the world is actually structured -- as long as it 's not spherical , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them to break with physical reality and join the community , and they candidly discuss the losses of family , friendships , and marriages that accompanied that break .
It 's clear that , for many of the subjects , their beliefs provide them with access to the benefits of being part of a community , something they might struggle to get through by any other means .
The one thing that does seem to cause problems is the community 's tendency to see conspiracies behind everything .
That tendency eventually gets focused inward toward its own members .
At one point , a prominent source of flat Earth YouTube videos accuses two other videomakers of being plants by the nefarious powers behind the spherical conspiracy .
But that thread ca n't be followed further , because the individual making the accusations demanded a large fee and creative control over the documentary in return for appearing in it .
Where do things go wrong ?  Behind the Curve is n't all fringe perspectives , though .
Sprinkled among these characters is a handful of actual scientists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounded in physical reality .
As in the flight-tracker example , they frequently provide information that raises the question of how a belief system could get so divorced from an easily checked reality .
Fortunately , researchers in social and behavioral sciences have identified various ways in which we selectively filter information based on our cultural identity , how the Dunning-Kruger effect gives us misplaced confidence in mistaken conclusions , and how some people get bogged down in conspiratorial thinking and start seeing everything as a facade hiding the truth .
All of that is there in spades -- the movie 's subjects make a compelling case that behavioral scientists know a lot more than they 're often given credit for .
And a few of those behavioral scientists get to speak on camera for those who are n't as up to date on the academic literature in this area .
Behind the Curve 's editing and source material gets all of this across without being preachy or going out of its way to make its subjects look bad .
It 's compelling viewing and refreshing to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life .
For those who are n't as up on this research , it 's a fantastic illustrated introduction .
But I 'd argue that there 's value to Behind the Curve beyond that .
To begin with , it 's easy to see that a general acceptance of conspiracies is a key factor for many in the flat Earth community ; Patricia Steere , one of the other focuses of the film , rolls off a list of other things she 's skeptical of , including vaccines , GMOs , chemtrails , and 9-11 .
So why -- out of all those options she 's prone to view as the product of a conspiracy -- is she putting her efforts into proving the Earth flat ?  Hearing so many origin stories over the course of the film provides some hints about common features among people 's journeys into the fringes .
And that 's important to know if we 're ever going to catch people before those journeys are complete and things like cultural cognition and Dunning-Kruger issues lock them into their destination .
Not strictly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on the reality-based side of the flat Earth issue may have their own irrational belief : that erroneous beliefs wo n't survive contact with reality and that the supposedly anti-science attitudes of the people who hold them will crumble in the face of evidence .
Behind the Curve makes clear that flat Earth proponents are not anti-science , a point driven home by an astronomer who 's given the chance to riff on science communication .
The film itself includes at least two experiments meant to show that the Earth is flat , one of them involving the purchase of a $10,000 gyroscope .
The gyroscope naturally shows that the Earth is rotating .
Rather than admitting defeat in the face of evidence , the person behind the experiment convinces himself that the gyroscope must be picking up something else that 's rotating ( maybe the stars above the Earth ? ) .
He goes to increasingly ludicrous methods of trying to isolate it from that influence .
How to get reality to break through that level of commitment is a serious challenge for people who care about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to bang your head against the wall , I think there 's a lot to recommend in Behind the Curve .
It 's found a great collection of sources and edited the material provided into some compelling narratives .
And there 's more here than just the opportunity to laugh at people with silly beliefs , provided you 're willing to invest some time in the ideas that are n't always described overtly .
In fact , the conspiracy minded might think that 's what the filmmakers were hoping you 'd do .
Behind the Curve is currently streaming on Amazon , Google Play , and Netflix .
