" In watching our numbers here locally and in Region 8 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police Jury President Shane Smiley said Monday .
" I do n't know that I would feel comfortable saying we 've flattened the curve , but it does seem like our numbers are not coming in as high as I thought they would late last week .
"  Smiley said hospitals are staying prepared for an increase in cases as more test results are processed .
There is currently a four to five day turnaround .
Medical supplies , such as masks , also remain scarce .
Smiley acknowledged receiving several large contributions from business owners and the community last week but said donations are still needed .
He also advised residents need to continue to follow the stay-at-home order and limit visits to stores and other essential businesses .
" We are going to continue to pray that our numbers here stay pretty much flat or go in the other direction , " Smiley said .
Ouachita , Union , Lincoln and Franklin are the only four northeast Louisiana parishes reporting five or more COVID-19 cases as of Monday .
