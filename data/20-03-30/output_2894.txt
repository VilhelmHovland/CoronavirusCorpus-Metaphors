Okpe was Benue 's first recorded case of Coronavirus , also known as COVID-19 .

According to a family source , Mrs .
Okpe ran series of tests before leaving the United Kingdom with all results showing negative to COVID-19 .
" When she arrived Benue State on the 23rd of March , she was running temperature , perhaps , due to the fatigue of traveling , an experienced Doctor was contacted and tests were conducted and she was being treated for malaria and typhoid .
" When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benue State government , I gave my consent that she should be tested .
But as I speak with you , none of us has seen the test result , not even the Medical Director of the Cottage Hospital who assisted the NCDC to get samples , has seen the result .
We only got to see through the television where the Governor announced her name " , the source told reporter .
Meanwhile , in a message sent via WhatsApp to our reporter , Mrs .
Okpe appealed to the Federal Government and the UK Government to move her out of Benue State .
" I have kept my cool , but am now sick with swollen gums , being stooling throughout the night , no nurses or medical attention .
My crime is that am a British who came into Nigeria , particularly Benue State ; felt feverish , took myself for check up because I have travelled longer than usual .
" After examinations , I was told by the doctor my temperature was high and I said keep me for observations as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagos to Abuja my temperature was like any other passenger was being monitored by the authorities .
" Back to my self presentation and request for isolation which was done , I was told by the doctors that the standard procedure was to call for a test from the state ministry of health of which two gentle men came to do a throat and nose swoop .
" After two days , by now my temperature has normalised from 38:2 to 36:4 the record are there to be verified .
Only to be told by the Doctor after asking why am I still kept in the hospital , a friend now came in to tell me that a press conference is being done with my name that I have Covid-19 , on air , on social media , without my knowledge .
" I went mad as a human being and demanded to see the Medical Director who told me he was fighting for me ; how , why and for what and with who I do n't understand , still fuming the next thing was armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to be removed for what I do n't know .
" As someone who knows the principles of the law ( weather it works in Nigeria or not I ca n't tell ) , I said I was not moving without a reason , I was surrounded and to stop the embarrassment to my family and poor junior sister who I think is not fair on , I went down to speak with the Deputy Governor for thirty minutes and he assured me I was safe , will be cared for , though not sick with any symptoms , also that the following day the health commissioner and medical doctors from the state will come and see me .
" I told him that if the state is insisting that am ill I should be taken to Abuja to be tested , I have never in my life seen a staged played drama with human life and politics like this before , I want the world , Nigerians , Benue state to hear my side and verify am not a Covid-19 positive , left my children behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs .
Okpe cried out .
She pleaded with the authorities concerned to take her to any standard center and verify her claims , as there was no single facility in Benue to even handle or manage any case , should it be true that Benue had a case .
According to reports , the Consulate General of the UK in Nigeria had been contacted by Mrs .
Okpe , whose fundamental rights have been grossly breached and arrangements were underway to get the Presidency to help the British Embassy evacuate her citizen from Benue State , before it results in her death .
