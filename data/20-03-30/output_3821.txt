Visions of regime change in China and Iran due to Covid-19 represent a strain of Western callousness .
The year 2020 began with Iranians witnessing the downing of a civilian airliner and their country emerging as the epicentre of an epidemic .
As Iranians in the Islamic Republic and Iranians around the world commemorate Persian New Year , it is a solemn occasion for them , including my family as our first relative there passed away from Covid-19 .
Despite these twin traumas , there was an American callousness to the Others ' suffering , particularly in the early phases when Covid-19 was only an epidemic in China and Iran and had not evolved into a pandemic .
When it began , it was metaphorically " Asian virus , " then " Middle Eastern virus , " and it continues to be regarded as a " Chinese virus " by America 's president .
During these initial phases , there were projections of how China and Iran 's public health catastrophes would bring down the Communist Party or the Islamic Republic , a geopolitical schadenfreude of sorts .
In both cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was the virus itself , which went on to infect the US .
The vilification of China as " the Sick Man of Asia "  One of the first salvos of American schadenfreude was launched in mid-February from the Wall Street Journal , with a piece entitled , " China Is the Real Sick Man of Asia , " written by Walter Russell Mead , who writes a weekly column on foreign affairs for the paper .
The headline was criticised for its insensitivity , and the editors of the paper issued a justification : " Most Americans , however , understand the phrase in the context of the dying Ottoman Empire as ' the sick man of Europe .
' That was our historical analogy .
"  If one were to read between the lines , the editors were asking that no offence be taken , because they really meant to offend in the past tense .
Nonetheless , the sick man reference to the Ottoman Empire was a term invoked by European powers on the eve of World War I to carve up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anatolia , and the Arabian peninsula .
At the same time , European powers had pounced on the " sick " Ottoman Empire , they were doing the same to the Qing Empire of China , exploiting it in the mid-19th century to force the sale of British opium on the Chinese population , or carving it up in zones of influence in the aftermath of the Boxer Rebellion around the turn of the twentieth century .
Regime change fantasies  One might argue what the harm in a headline with an insensitive historical reference is ? The problem , according to one Princeton academic , is that there is a " cottage industry of Western experts " who assumed that the collapse of the Chinese Communist Party would occur as the coronavirus catastrophe would serve as China 's version of Chernobyl , the nuclear meltdown that contributed to the decline of the USSR .
Such claims can be found in Robert D .
Kaplan 's Wall Street Journalarticle " Coronavirus and the Tragedy of Iran , " which writes , " The Islamic Republic has missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , late-Soviet stage .
"  In two cases , The Wall Street Journal reveals itself as a cheerleader for regime change of China and Iran .
A similar vein is found in Graeme Wood 's article , " Coronavirus Could Break Iranian Society , " published in The Atlantic , describes the epicentre of the outbreak , the shrine city of Qom , as " a Shiite Disneyland .
"  In the article he criticised Mohammad Saeedi , the head of the Fatima Masumeh shrine who allegedly opposed a quarantine , " but begged people to visit the shrine , calling it a ' place of healing .
' " Wood writes , " At some point , incompetence and evil become indistinguishable .
"  Yet Wood takes Saeedi comments out of context .
The tweet reads as follows - Seyyed Mohammad Saeedi , the representative of Khamenei in #Qom : the epicenter of #cronavirus , " We call this holy shrine ( #cronavirus epicenter ) Daralshafa , means people come and heal from mental &amp; physical illnesses so they must be open ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saeedi 's entire statement , he said : " We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing .
That means people should come here to heal from spiritual and physical diseases .
but of course , we also exercise caution and comply with health and safety procedures .
"  Neglecting to mention the last line is a significant omission .
The suggestion is that the cleric prioritised faith over science , neglecting the fact that the shrine has been sterilised just as other countries , including the US , seek to sterilise its mass transportation system .
From Saeedi 's single statement Wood generalises that it reflects the Islamic Republic 's frailty : " Urging visits to Qom , I fear , is the reaction of a government that has at last recognised its own limitations and has , at some level , embraced the virus .
"  The problem with articles like this is it focuses the fault of the Covid-19 outbreak on Iran 's government while neglecting how sanctions imposed by the Trump administration that targeted humanitarian trade with Iran would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the outbreak than a shrine remaining open .
The sick man of North America  The projection of regime change in China and Iran were written at a time when the virus seemed at a safe distance from American shores .
A month later , entire American states , ranging from California to Illinois , would be shut down .
New York City has become America 's Qom and the US has surpassed the number of total cases in Iran and is on track to catch up to China .
Just as writers sought to analyse how the virus reflected the failure of public health governance in China and Iran , the outbreak in the US revealed the inadequate measures Trump administration took to prepare , eliminating pandemic experts from his staff , and failing to heed intelligence warnings in January 2020 about the virus ' potential impact , and finally the lack of testing equipment and ventilators .
While it was hoped that the virus might have resulted in regime change in China and Iran , it might result in one in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The viewpoints expressed by the authors do not necessarily reflect the opinions , viewpoints and editorial policies of TRT World .
