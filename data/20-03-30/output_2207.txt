Vijaya and partner Lyle Brulhart , and their rescue dogs Zoey , Valentiny and Perula , had made a mad dash up the U .
West Coast after leaving Mexico six days earlier .

"  They got their first inkling North America was on its way to lockdown when they arrived at the U .
border on March 18 .
The roads from Nogales , Mexico , to the U .
border at Arizona were eerily empty , and the couple had the easiest border crossing they 'd ever experienced .
" We entered the building and it was almost empty , " said Vijaya , noting that the U .
border officers were jovial and telling jokes .
" I thought , ' Oh my God , what 's happening here .
' "  But , as soon as they crossed into Arizona , things got serious .

" We started stopping in stores and started realizing there were no supplies anywhere , " Vijaya said .
Sanitary items such as gloves , masks and alcohol were non-existent .
By the time they arrived in Phoenix that same evening , they were outright scared .
All the restaurants , pubs , casinos , stores and public venues in the state 's capital city of 1 .
million were shut down .
The only food to be found was sandwiches at a gas station .
" That night we could n't find a bathroom open anywhere , " said Vijaya .
" From that day on , we drove as fast as we could .
"  The couple was glued to news on the radio for the next two days .
They avoided all contact with cities along the highways north .

She had confirmation of her permanent residency from the Canadian government , but she was obliged to have it validated at the border , and she 'd been told immigration services were no longer available .
" I knew there was a risk the validation might not happen , and I was scared I 'd be trapped outside Canada .
"  But when she got to the border , officers let her cross with no delays .
" They apologized that immigration was n't able to give me those services at the border , " Vijaya said .
" Oh my God , I cried .
"  Vijaya and Brulhart were some of the thousands of travellers struggling to return to Canada after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a call for citizens to come home or risk getting trapped abroad .

Quadra resident Kent Macaulay flew back to Canada , cutting his trip to New York short , as COVID-19 began to ravage the city and state .
He decided to go home March 10 , prior to the Canadian advisory , as the COVID-19 crisis began to unfold in the U .
All public schools and numerous universities in the state had shut down the day before , and the city of New Rochelle , in the suburbs of New York City , was in full lockdown after a cluster of COVID-19 cases cropped up .
" Things had really begun to ramp up on the East Coast of the U .
, so I made a quick decision to book a flight back that night , " said Macaulay , who was on alert for signs he should head home .
Quadra resident Kent Macaulay went into self-isolation after he returned from New York , which currently is the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York to salvage what meetings he could as a representative Servas International , a non-profit dedicated to peace through travel , after the conference for the UN Commission on the Status of Women he was slated to attend was cancelled .
During his trip home , Macaulay did n't see any signs of the pandemonium that would ensue at airports a week later , as countries around the globe began restricting flights as a response to novel coronavirus .
The U .
has 140,904 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2,405 deaths as Monday , according to U .
Centers of Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
Residents of New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut should refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately to stem transmission of the massive outbreaks in the region , the health agency stated Saturday .
When Macaulay travelled , he was n't worried about getting home .
" It was n't so much I thought I might get trapped , " he said .
" It was rather , I do n't want to contract this virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Quadra .
"  As a result , Macaulay went straight into self-isolation when he got home .
" At that time there was no talk about it being mandatory , it was just good practice at the time and seemed a wise thing to do .
"  Vijaya was perfectly happy to go into mandated self-isolation after her trip home , which she described as stressful , humbling , exhausting and surreal .
" I 'm really enjoying this peacefulness , " she said .
" At the same we 're doing our part .
I 'm not afraid of the virus for me , but I do n't want to be responsible for anybody 's death , so we 're taking all precautions .
