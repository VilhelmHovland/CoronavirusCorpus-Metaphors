Tennessee Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota ( 8 ) leaves the field after the Titans beat the New England Patriots in an NFL football game Sunday , Nov .
11 , 2018 , in Nashville , Tenn .
The Titans won 34-10 .
( AP Photo/James Kenney )  Jason Fitz appears on a variety of programs across ESPN .
He also once covered the Titans in Nashville , Tennessee , where he came to know a quarterback who was chosen No .
2 overall in the 2015 draft .
Marcus Mariota never fully reached the expectations that come with such placement , which has led him to signing with the Raiders as a free agent to back up Derek Carr .
At least in the beginning .
Fitz suggests those in Las Vegas are getting much more than a backup .
" Marcus is not only capable of playing quarterback in the NFL , but is one of the most quality human beings I have ever interacted with in any capacity , " Fitz said .
" You are getting someone that to a man , in any organization , will tell you is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe you 're going to see a true quarterback battle in the most supportive way from Marcus .
He 's a quiet leader who does whatever is asked of him .
It 's a fantastic signing for the Raiders , at the very least to create a better culture top-to-bottom in any locker room .
"  Character is forever .
More than any trait , it 's a true measure of self .
Fitz is n't the only one who speaks about Mariota with such admiration .
Pretty much everyone who knows him does .
If it had a choice , any NFL team that could assemble an entire roster of players with Mariota 's reputation and still be good enough to win the Super Bowl would immediately do so .
Nobody wants bad headlines -- especially those generated off the field -- if they can be avoided .
But few fairy tales lack a villain , and often on winning teams a handful of them contribute .
Some exceedingly so .
As much as those in the NFL would prefer champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of bad ones to win a ring .
Put it this way : If this were an episode of " Game of Thrones ' and winning big meant the difference between signing the honorable Jon Snow or the treacherous Ramsay Bolton , well , say hello to the guy who keeps others captive and tortures them .
As for the Raiders , they have for a few seasons now under Jon Gruden espoused a desire to sign and draft players of high character .
Mike Mayock as general manager also banged such a drum upon arriving , and yet he understands the reality of existing in a win-at-all-costs world .
" At the end of the day , " Mayock said upon the Raiders signing troubled offensive lineman Richie Incognito prior to the 2019 season , " you ca n't have all Boy Scouts .
"  Maybe the Raiders -- who have made the playoffs once in 17 years -- need fewer merit badges .
It 's certainly a noble goal , teams trying to avoid potential headaches when it comes to building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the NFL when assessing skill and fit , and I believe most teams also have good intentions in evaluating a player 's mental makeup .
Winning is just more important .
The Raiders through this cycle of free agency seem to have added more character than not .
One exception could be Eli Apple , a cornerback who had some serious locker room issues with the Giants ( 2016-18 ) , so serious he was suspended by the team for conduct detrimental .
And yet his biggest problem with the Saints the last two years was penalties .
He commits far too many .
AB buffoonery  Still , things to this point appear less hectic with the Raiders than last season .
That 's when , seemingly seconds after preaching about character , they brought in Incognito ( who actually caused zero problems , played well and is back in 2020 ) , oft-disciplined linebacker Vontaze Burfict ( limited to just four games after being suspended by the NFL for a helmet-to-helmet hit ) and wide receiver Antonio Brown .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exited it with frozen feet , did n't like his helmet , had his contract voided by the team and was gone before taking a regular-season snap .
A real head case .
So far -- with the draft yet to come -- such buffoonery is absent .
" We are trying to strengthen and improve our locker room with character , hard-working guys , " Mayock said this time last year .
Tell you what .
With the signing of a certain free-agent quarterback , it sure looks like they have done that now .
