-- Florida officials have arrested the pastor of a megachurch after detectives say he held two Sunday services with hundreds of people and violated a safer-at-home order in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus .
According to jail records , Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne turned himself in to authorities Monday afternoon in Hernando County , where he lives .
He was charged with unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order .
Bail was set at $500 , according to the jail 's website .

"  " Shame on this pastor , their legal staff and the leaders of this staff for forcing us to do our job .
That 's not what we wanted to do during a declared state of emergency , " Chronister said .
" We are hopeful that this will be a wakeup call .
"  The church has said it sanitized the building , and the pastor said on Twitter that the church is an essential business .
