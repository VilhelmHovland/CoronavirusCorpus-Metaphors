MASS MoCA opened two decades ago in the city of North Adams .
( Beth J .
Harpaz/AP )  This story has been updated .
The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams announced it would lay off 120 of its 165 employees , citing lost revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic .
The staff cutback goes into effect April 11 .
With its announcement , Mass MoCA became the first major Massachusetts museum to institute wide-scale layoffs since the pandemic began .
The state 's cultural sector has already been hit hard by coronavirus closures , with nonprofit cultural organizations reporting more than $55 .
million in lost revenue in the first week of the health crisis , according to the Massachusetts Cultural Council .
" Our mission is to gather large numbers of people together around moments of individual and group creativity , and that 's obviously impossible to do now , " Mass MoCA director Joseph Thompson said in an interview .
" And we do n't know when it will be possible to pick up and work again .
So our decision was to tuck in as tightly as we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strong .
"  It was a devastating development in what has already been a difficult year for the museum .
In June 2019 , Thompson was charged with vehicular homicide for his involvement in a 2018 traffic collision , in which the director hit and killed a motorcyclist while driving his car in North Adams .
His trial is set for early May .
Asked for comment , Thompson said , " I ca n't wait for my day in court .
"  In its statement , Mass MoCA said that laid-off employees would receive their regular paychecks through March 27 and after that receive at least 70% of their normal pay through April 10 .
Employees covered through the museum 's healthcare plan would remain covered through July .
The reductions touch every department , including management .
Mass MoCA 's remaining staff will work in fundraising , facilities management and " contingency planning for the organization 's relaunch , " according to the statement .
The museum said the remaining employees would take voluntary reductions in hours or salary .
" We 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see all these buildings and probably assume that we have a big fat endowment .
We do n't .
While many museums have endowments that are five or 10 or 15 times their annual budget , ours is more like one-and-a-half times .
"  Thompson said salaries cost the museum a little over half its annual operating budget of $12 million .
Mass MoCA 's endowment provides 7 .
of that income .
The museum draws 28% of its budget from private and foundation donations and less than 2% from government grants .
What makes Mass MoCA particularly vulnerable is its reliance on earned income , which makes up about two-thirds of its budget in the form of concert tickets , entry fees , concessions and space rental .
The museum has distinguished itself as one of the region 's destinations for performing arts .
Ordinarily , it operates a full calendar of concerts and other performances , including the Bang On A Can new music festival , the bluegrass-adjacent FreshGrass and Wilco 's Solid Sound Music and Arts Festival .
The museum began canceling events on March 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will remain closed until at least May .
Mass MoCA is an unusual museum by any measure .
Opened in 1999 , it occupies 6 massive buildings and 200,000 square feet in an old electrical factory compound in North Adams , a former industrial town in the Berkshires .
In the course of two decades , it has transformed one of the poorest towns in the state into a cultural destination , though its economic impact on the still relatively depressed region has been less than anticipated .
Mass MoCA specializes in large-scale works by contemporary artists , some of which it houses long-term , like a retrospective of the wall drawings of the American artist Sol LeWitt that is scheduled through 2043 .
The museum has no permanent collection .
Most of Mass MoCA 's curatorial staff have been retained to address the looming question of the museum 's exhibition calendar .
Two upcoming exhibitions have been postponed , frozen mid-installation .
Everything else hangs in limbo .
Part of the problem , Thompson said , is that they simply do n't know when the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make a big difference if we come back to life in late spring or early summer versus midsummer versus next fall .
"  But Thompson was adamant the museum would survive .
" Whatever the date is , " he said , " we 'll be here and we 'll reopen .
