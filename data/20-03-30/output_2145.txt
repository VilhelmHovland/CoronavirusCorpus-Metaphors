Here are today 's Ottawa Sun letters to the editor .
Ontario nurses remain on the job in the face of COVID-19 .
Overworked and understaffed , these women and men are putting themselves at risk for us all .
Ontario teachers , on the other hand , are on paid March Break , followed by as least two more weeks off with full pay and benefits .
Hopefully , before this is all over , nurses will get the additional staff they need .
Nurses are taking care of their patients .
And teachers might realize that they are well paid , have great benefits and lovely retirement pay for the teaching of children .
Please concentrate on your students .
KEVIN CHAPPELL  STITTSVILLE  ( Point made .
)  SHARE ETHANOL  We 've been reading in the Sun how small distilleries are switching their production output to make ethanol-based hand sanitizers because of the shortage .
Kudos to them for deciding to take a hit on the bottom line in order to aid the community in this challenging time .
Along Merivale Road and West Hunt Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local gasoline and diesel supplies .
Placed with those petroleum tanks are ethanol tanks holding tens of thousands of litres of the precious sanitizing agent .
As a society , we have been browbeating hoarders for stocking up on essential items , but it 's time that we call on the petroleum distributors to do the right thing and dip into their hoarded ethanol stash and aid the community in this time of need .
ANDR ? PIMAT  OTTAWA  ( An interesting idea .
)  HANG IN THERE  I am concerned that the self-isolation Fear Factor will quickly turn to the Fed-Up Factor and people will start returning to public spaces .
If this happens , then we will be ordered to shelter in place , with the possibility of arrest if we wander .
We know it 's hard , we know it 's stressful , but just hang in there until we get the OK to go back out .
Short-term pain for long-term gain .
JUDY WARREN  OTTAWA  ( We 're all in this together .
) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , letter , March 21  Regarding the letter writer 's comments that the Senators should be stating who the player ( now players ) who tested positive for the novel coronavirus is , I guess anyone who gets a common cold in the future should notify Health Canada and all media when they catch something .
You can get the flu and pass it on to someone , and it leads to pneumonia and they pass away .
This thing is out of control , but so is society .
Hopefully , we make it out of it and get back to normal sooner than later .
MARK DAVIES  ORL ? ANS  ( Normal may need to be redefined .
)  TRUDEAU LEAVES US SHORT  Re : We gambled on wrong threat -- climate change , column , March 22  Truer words were never spoken , especially with the Trudeau government going all in on fighting climate change , doing irreparable damage to the Canadian economy .
Trudeau 's green policies have brought the economic engine of Canada 's economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invaluable revenue source would be helpful when Canada tries to recover after this pandemic has passed .
At the same time , our struggling health-care system has been left wanting , as we are now seeing with shortages of ventilators and just about every other health supply .
To further complicate things in the health sector , mind-bogglingly , the Trudeau government shipped tons of medical supplies to China last month in a very short-sighted decision .
No doubt the trillions of dollars being spent on fighting climate change around the world could have been better spent on research into finding cures for infectious diseases like the one we are facing now .
