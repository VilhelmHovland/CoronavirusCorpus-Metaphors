Coronavirus relief : Spend 30 minutes a day on your emotional health  There 's a lot of talk about the need to keep your stress levels down now that we 're living under siege in corona-ville .
Then there are the children to think of .
How do we help them to keep calm , let alone empowered , when everybody seems to be living with a riotously unquiet mind ?  Who better to ask than a stressed top of the tree expert in frontline medicine and public health .
How does he go about it ?  Rob Moodie is Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne 's School of Population and Global Health .
As a doctor he worked in refugee health care in the Sudan for Save the Children Fund and Medicins Sans Frontieres , and later for an Aboriginal Community controlled health service in Central Australia .
Professor Rob Moodie , advisor to the World Health Organisation , meditates every day o stay calm and focused .

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pays attention to his breathing .
It 's often described as training in awareness , gaining perspective and learning to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgement .
" It took me 20 years to work out you need to do it daily for it to have an effect , " he told The New Daily .
" I 'm what you might call gently addicted to it .
Particularly now , it 's been really useful , in terms of just being able to maintain balance .
so that I can respond more appropriately to all the stresses that are around .
I find it enormously useful .
" That can be meditation or yoga or prayer or walking in the forest .
Whatever it is , we need something regular to nurture our soil and spirit : something that helps us maintain a sense of balance .
This will become even more essential as life gets a bit harder around us .
"  The benefits during a life under viral siege  Lonely older people : In 2012 , researchers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple meditation program lasting just eight weeks reduced loneliness in older adults .
The program involved a technique called mindfulness-based stress reduction ( MBSR ) , which teaches the mind to simply be attentive to the present and not dwell in the past or project into the future .
Easing non-clinical anxiety : Well , that 's most of us .
A 2013 study revealed that meditation-related anxiety relief is a real thing as far as the brain is concerned .
It took 15 healthy volunteers , and taught them mindfulness meditation .
Brain scanning revealed the parts of the brain associated with controlling worrying was more active during meditation -- therefore , helping control anxiety levels .
Improved problem-solving capabilities : We are in an era of adaptation to new circumstances .
This means we have to draw on our problem-solving capabilities .
A 2012 study found that mindfulness meditation can help people dig themselves out of a stubborn hole ( more formally known as cognitive rigidity ) and change strategies for problem solving .
Sharper thinking , less emotional reactivity : In 2018 , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Institute at Trinity discovered how breath-focused meditation directly affects the levels of a natural chemical messenger in the brain called noradrenaline .
This may explain why breath-focused meditation and yogic breathing practices has long been associated with increased ability to focus , decreased mind wandering , improved arousal levels , more positive emotions and decreased emotional reactivity .
Boost energy and brain function in the kiddies : Whether your children are at school or confined at home , their energy levels and learning ability are bound to be flatter than what we think of as the good old days ( a few weeks ago ) .
A 2017 study found that practicing just 25 minutes of Hatha yoga or mindfulness meditation per day can boost the brain 's executive functions , cognitive abilities linked to goal-directed behaviour and the ability to control knee-jerk emotional responses , habitual thinking patterns .
A 2013 study demonstrated that meditation before class seemed to help students focus better and retain information .
A random selection of students followed basic meditation instructions before a lecture , and the students who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed than students who did not meditate .
May we suggest that families put 20 minutes aside each day and give this stuff a try .
There are plenty of resources online .

Mindfulness Meditation , step by step  According to mindfulness .
: Take your seat .
Whatever you 're sitting on -- a chair , a meditation cushion , a park bench -- find a spot that gives you a stable , solid seat , not perching or hanging back .
Notice what your legs are doing .
If on a cushion on the floor , cross your legs comfortably in front of you .
( If you already do some kind of seated yoga posture , go ahead .
) If on a chair , it 's good if the bottoms of your feet are touching the floor .
Straighten -- but do n't stiffen -- your upper body .
The spine has natural curvature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can comfortably rest on top of your vertebrae .
Situate your upper arms parallel to your upper body .
Then let your hands drop onto the tops of your legs .
With your upper arms at your sides , your hands will land in the right spot .
Too far forward will make you hunch .
Too far back will make you stiff .
You 're tuning the strings of your body -- not too tight and not too loose .
Drop your chin a little and let your gaze fall gently downward .
You may let your eyelids lower .
If you feel the need , you may lower them completely , but it 's not necessary to close your eyes when meditating .
You can simply let what appears before your eyes be there without focusing on it .
Be there for a few moments .
Relax .
Bring your attention to your breath or the sensations in your body .
Feel your breath -- or some say " follow " it -- as it goes out and as it goes in .
( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreath , and for the inbreath you simply leave a spacious pause .
)  Either way , draw your attention to the physical sensation of breathing : the air moving through your nose or mouth , the rising and falling of your belly , or your chest .
Choose your focal point , and with each breath , you can mentally note " breathing in " and " breathing out .
"  Inevitably , your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places .
Do n't worry .
There 's no need to block or eliminate thinking .
When you get around to noticing your mind wandering -- in a few seconds , a minute , five minutes -- just gently return your attention to the breath .
Practice pausing before making any physical adjustments , such as moving your body or scratching an itch .
With intention , shift at a moment you choose , allowing space between what you experience and what you choose to do .
You may find your mind wandering constantly -- that 's normal , too .
Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practice observing without needing to react .
Just sit and pay attention .
As hard as it is to maintain , that 's all there is .
Come back over and over again without judgment or expectation .
When you 're ready , gently lift your gaze ( if your eyes are closed , open them ) .
Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment .
Notice how your body feels right now .
Notice your thoughts and emotions .
Pausing for a moment , decide how you 'd like to continue on with your day .
That 's it .
That 's the practice .
It 's often been said that it 's very simple , but it 's not necessarily easy .
The work is to just keep doing it .
Results will accrue .
