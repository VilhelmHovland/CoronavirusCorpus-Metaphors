Amid the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak , the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India ( IRDAI ) has kept the motor third party ( TP ) insurance rates unchanged beyond March 31 .
Earlier in March , the insurance sector regulator had released a draft proposal to increase TP premiums by 2-10 percent from April 1 .
IRDAI revises premium rates on a yearly basis , except long-term policies for cars , bikes where it changes every three years and five years , respectively .
Third party motor insurance is required for protection against financial liabilities in case of an accident .
The insurer pays the claims if an individual 's insured vehicle hits another vehicle passenger or pedestrian causing death or disability .
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , companies have announced a temporary shutdown .
There have also been pay-cuts announced by firms and a motor premium hike would have adversely impacted individual vehicle owners , according to a Moneycontrol report .
