The NCAA will permit Division I spring-sport athletes -- such as baseball , softball and lacrosse players -- who had their seasons shortened by the coronavirus pandemic to have an additional year of eligibility .
The NCAA Division I Council voted Monday to give spring-sport athletes regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season they lost , but it did not guarantee financial aid to the current crop of seniors if they return to play next year .
Winter sports , such as basketball and hockey , were not included in the decision because many athletes in those sports had completed all or most of their regular seasons , the council decided .
The council is made up of college sports administrators representing all 32 D-I conferences , plus two members of the student-athlete advisory committee .
Voting is weighted to give the Power Five conferences more say .
Chairwoman Grace Calhoun , who is Penn 's athletic director , declined to reveal the final vote .
" At the end we really did coalesce around all of the decisions that we made today , " Calhoun said .
" They were strongly supported .
"  How much scholarship money will be made available to each athlete whose college career would have ended this spring will be determined by the athlete 's school .
The amount could range from nothing to as much the athlete received had been receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of dollars more than it would usually spend on spring-sport athletes .
The extra expenses come at a time when athletic departments could be facing cutbacks .
The pandemic forced the cancellation of the NCAA men 's basketball tournament , which cut the association 's distribution to members by $375 million this year .
" We had long discussions around the fact that this does not avoid substantially difficult circumstances , but what we felt was important was to localize that decision-making and to ensure that we were as permissive as possible , " Calhoun said .
" At the end of the day , each institution is going to have to figure out what it can do .
"  Schools will be able to use the NCAA 's Student Assistance Fund to pay for scholarships for students who take advantage of the additional eligibility in 2020-21 .
Roster and scholarship limits for teams will be adjusted next season to fit returning seniors and incoming freshman .
Katie Hoeg , an All-American lacrosse player from North Carolina , said she has a teaching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now plans to return for another season as a graduate student .
" I 'm choosing my passion , " she said .
" I ca n't imagine ending my lacrosse career the way this season is going .
I was pretty hopeful this would be a possibility .
I 'm really excited this decision has been made .
"  Nebraska-Omaha softball player Hailey Bartz was planning to graduate in December and move on from school .
Now she 's not so sure .
" I 've been speaking with my family about it and trying to figure out pros and cons .
Do I want to take advantage of that year ? Do I not ? " Bartz said .
" Some of my teammates have their schooling set up , full-time jobs .
You have your life planned out and then this kind of pushes everything back another year .
At the same time it 's really hard to pass up because it 's a game of love .
"  NCAA Division I rules allow athletes to have four seasons of competition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for waivers to restore one of those seasons for any athlete who competed while eligible in the spring season shortened by COVID-19 in 2020 .
After the 2021 spring season , scholarship and roster limits will apply to athletes granted the waiver .
" This has a four- or five-year effect depending on how you want to count it , " said Marquette athletic director Bill Scholl , whose school fields track , lacrosse , tennis and golf teams in the spring .
" So the roster management piece is just something our coaches , we 're going to have to figure out and work our way through .
"  Calhoun said the council did not consider the possibility of the fall sports season , including football , being interrupted .
Football generates billions of dollars , especially for Power Five conferences .
Losing that would be potentially devastating to schools that play major college football .
" There was an acknowledgment that we do n't know the future and if other seasons are canceled other things happen in the future we 'll have to take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Calhoun said .
