Photo by Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile  He had the dubious honour of taking part in one of the games played on the last weekend of organised football in England , so Irish striker Aidan Keena is getting used to the notion of normality being put to one side .
But while the Westmeath native and his team-mates at non-league side Hartlepool United grapple with the impact of Covid-19 , such as the inability to play games or even train as well as a 20-per-cent pay cut , he feels the idea of football returning with games being played behind closed doors should not be considered .
" In a league like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Keena , who was involved for Hartlepool United in a 1-1 draw away to Sutton United , a game played just two weeks ago , a week after the rest of football in the UK had been shut down .
" In this division most of the clubs ' income comes from the gate receipts and other money they make on match day .
How can clubs carry on playing and paying wages when they have no money coming in , clubs would get into bother very quickly .
" I do n't know any player who would want to play behind closed doors for any reason , it 's not natural to play games like that .
Football is for the fans , not just for TV .
"  There is a fear in some quarters that players would be pressurised into making a return to action before the full picture on Covid-19 is clear : a few ex-players ( who should know better ) and other commentators in Britain have suggested that , harking back to the Blitz , getting football back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Keena , a former St Patrick 's Athletic player who joined Hartlepool from Hearts in January , says that ca n't be considered .
" That would be ridiculous , " he says .
" If everyone else is being told to stay home and not go to work because the risks are still high , why should footballers be the ones asked to go out and take those risks ?  " What about the families of footballers , if the players contract the virus at a game and bring it back into the house ? "  Keena and compatriot Gavan Holohan both played during the last bout of action on March 14 , while the League of Ireland , and the main leagues in England and Scotland , had been postponed a week earlier .
" It was a strange build-up to the game , " he recalls .
" On the day we were on the bus down to London , expecting to get a text saying the match was off .
And the game itself was odd , it had more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  There was uncertainty over how long the break would last but it soon became clear that it would not be brief , so the Hartlepool players were allowed to leave the area and join family if they wished , so Keena headed to Scotland so he could be with his girlfriend .
" The club gave us a fitness programme to work on but we could n't train as a group , clearly , so it was a case of finding a field somewhere and trying to do some training there , " he says .
Keena says the squad wo n't expect to recoup lost wages .
" A lot of clubs are struggling big time , so everyone has to take a hit , " he says .
" We do n't know how long this will last , it could be two months , it could be half a year , all we can do is wait .
" We know how serious it is , we all have families who are affected , my brother was let go from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in university but he has no idea when he can go back .
"  The move to Hartlepool , from Hearts , was a chance for Keena to spark a career which had stalled in Edinburgh as he was included in a mass clearout of Irish talent from Hearts : in the space of a few days Glenn Whelan , Jake Mulraney and Keena departed while Cork-born keeper Colin Doyle was told he could leave .
" It was a big Irish exodus , " Keena jokes .
" I was playing one week and not in the squad the next week , my head was all over the place up there .
"  He scored on his home debut for the Pools but has started just four games .
Before Covid-19 halted the season , Hartlepool were ninth in the league and in the race for the promotion play-offs but those play-offs may not now happen .
" The season could be over , they could bring it back for a shortened season in June , we do n't know , " added Keena , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week in their Euro qualifiers but those games have been postponed .
" I am fortunate in that I have two years left on my contract here but I have team-mates who are out of contract in a few weeks , it 's harsh on them .
" This is a crisis that goes beyond football and there 's no easy way out of it .
