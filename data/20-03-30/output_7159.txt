Former Vice President Joe Biden , a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful , launched a new podcast on Monday -- and it seems everyone online has got a joke about it .
The podcast , which was paid for by the campaign , is pretty much exactly what you 'd expect a presidential hopeful 's podcast to be like : simple , not too much flair , and some pretty straightforward questions to answer at the end .
The first episode features Biden talking with Ron Klain , the former White House Ebola Response Coordinator , about the coronavirus and the government 's response to it so far .
