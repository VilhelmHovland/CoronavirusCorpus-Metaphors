Altona town council is holding the line on municipal property taxes in its 2020 operating budget .
Overall spending in this year 's financial plan is $10 .
million , which represents a $2 million increase over last year .
However , in what could be described as a late hour decision , town council agreed to freeze municipal taxes for this year .
That 's a change from the original plan and is an attempt to help ease the financial burden on taxpayers because of the COVID-19 pandemic .
" Council was in the final stages of approving a financial plan that included a 2 percent tax increase , " said Mayor Al Friesen .
" However , we felt strongly that under the current circumstances a tax increase was not in the best interests of the community .
We have trimmed the budget to reflect a zero percent municipal tax increase , and have challenged our administration to scrutinize expenditures to obtain the best value for our residents ' tax dollars and will make ongoing decisions accordingly for the 2020 tax year .
