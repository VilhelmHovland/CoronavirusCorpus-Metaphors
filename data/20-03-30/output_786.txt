SALT LAKE CITY -- If you do n't yet have a license or ID card with a gold star in the corner , you have an extra year to make sure you get it .
" Due to circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the national emergency declaration , the Department of Homeland Security , as directed by President Donald J .
Trump , is extending the REAL ID enforcement deadline beyond the current October 1 , 2020 deadline , " acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf said in a prepared statement Thursday .
The new deadline for obtaining a REAL ID with a gold star in the corner is Oct .
1 , 2021 -- a year after the original due date .
Because federal , state and local officials are working to limit the spread of the new coronavirus , the Trump administration extended the deadline to " remove any impediments to response and recovery efforts , " Wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country are temporarily closed or restricting access , which could prevent some from applying for or obtaining their REAL ID .
" Extending the deadline will also allow the Department to work with Congress to implement needed changes to expedite the issuance of REAL IDs once the current health crisis concludes , " Wolf said .
If you do n't have a REAL ID by Oct .
1 , 2021 , however , you wo n't be able to do things like board an airplane .
Those who attempt to board a flight with a non-starred driver 's license after October 2021 may be stopped by the Transportation Security Administration -- though passports can still be used as ID for air travel .
But you do n't need to schedule a trip to the Driver License Division just yet .
If your license expires after the original October 2020 deadline , the division has probably automatically mailed you -- or will mail you -- a new license with the gold star .
That wo n't change because of the deadline extension , Department of Public Safety spokesman Lt .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renew your license before the original October 2020 deadline , your new card will come with a gold star .
Anyone who renewed or received their license after Feb .
3 , 2019 , also received a license with the gold star .
The new policy that requires REAL IDs came after a long-running dispute between Utah and the Department of Homeland Security to conform to the standards set by the department 's Real ID Act , part of which requires a gold star to be printed on all licenses .
Utah lawmakers decided to push back against what they believed was an unfunded mandate from the federal government .
The total cost of reprinting and sending out the IDs will be about $2 .
million .
