There are lots of ill winds blowing at the moment , but one that seems to have blown me some good is the wind of self-isolation .
While I sympathise with anyone who is constantly craving exercise and vegetables right now , I have been craving those things for a while .
The current lockdown might be driving you stir crazy , but some of us are used to it .
We do n't like it , do n't get me wrong , but before there were wellness apps on tap and supermarket home delivery , we were already trying to change things up to cope with our new reality of isolation .
It is actually lovely having you in our world .
We wish you were n't though .
One of the worst things about any long-term condition is the uncertainty everyone is currently experiencing .
Do n't let uncertainty get you .
We need you on the other side .
My particular " underlying condition " ( to coin the current phrase ) is Multiple Sclerosis .
We are all different , of course , because we are a diverse group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing we have in common with everyone else in the moment ( to coin another more zeitgeisty phrase ) is uncertainty .
Lots of us have an underlying condition .
Many people are in this demographic -- from those with asthma and diabetes , to those who have had an organ transplant or are in recovery from cancer .
We all have different degrees of immunity .
Ah , difference .
We are all different .
If this crisis helps us to face that fact , then a good wind will have blown some cobwebs away .
Admittedly the more soul-destroying reports of the ravages of Covid-19 are accompanied by the term " underlying condition " , yet if the waves of kindness sweeping over us are anything to go by , everyone has the backs of anyone with an underlying condition and we can all relax .

I have started to listen to people who can do different things in different ways .
People who are experts on difference have taken me under their wing .
They are brawlers because we have made them fight for their right to exist .
No one needs an uncertain fight over a ventilator at this stage , but if anyone can fight , I do n't fancy your chances !  Being back in the game as people have grasped a new reality has been lovely .
The Irish Times Features WhatsApp group that knuckles down at 8 .
on my phone with its zingy banter and sparkly ideas is a gift .
It is just lovely hearing the usual voices expressing themselves so differently .
Irish Times readers will definitely have their itches scratched remotely .
The energy is palpable .
For a woman with energy issues , the gift of those virtual meetings keeps on giving .
As my " moveability " has become more challenged , I have added activities that have enriched life with people who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do these most-unexpected activities now with the shut-down and staying mobile will be challenging , but I am ready to accept that gauntlet .
And I have learned lots about living in a smaller world .
