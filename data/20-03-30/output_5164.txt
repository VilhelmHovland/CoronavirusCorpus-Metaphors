Despite decades of social and legal reforms and activists working on the issue violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all parts of the world .
According to Oxfam India , the global figures indicate that almost 1 in 3 or the 35 per cent of women worldwide have " experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime .
"  NGOs and organisations all across Europe , working with the victims of domestic violence have sounded the alarm after Europe overtook China to become the epicentre of the pandemic .
" For many people , their home is already not a safe place , " news agency AFP quoted the German federal association of women 's counselling centres and helplines ( BFF ) said .
The association warns that the stress caused by social isolation is exacerbating tensions and increasing , " the risk of domestic and sexual violence against women and children " , the association warns .
As the people are stressing about losing jobs , and fear of economic insecurities , factors that would increase the likelihood of conflicts , apart from confinement at homes alone where violence is already a problem .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Florence Claudepierre , head of the FCPE parents ' federation in the Upper Rhine , a region hit hard by the pandemic in France .
She said she is hearing stories of " parents who are cracking , who ca n't carry on " in families that have not previously had any problems .
In China , which is slowly emerging from several weeks of total lockdown , the women 's rights organisation Weiping has reported a threefold increase in reports of violence against women .
Spain also reported an incident where a 35-year-old mother of two was murdered by her partner last week .
The country has the second-worst outbreak in Europe after Italy .
For children , young people and women who are victims of domestic violence -- mental or physical -- the current situation means " being constantly available " for abuse by the perpetrator , the German federation stresses .
The help centres everywhere , too are reporting a drop in calls , which is not necessarily seen as a good sign either .
Decisions to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to curb the spread of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overrun , acknowledges Rainer Rettinger , who heads a German child protection association .
As governments pour billions into their economies and health services , they should " not lose sight of the importance of equality and fundamental human rights , " Beatrice Fresko-Rolfo , the general rapporteur on violence against women for the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe , pointed out recently .
Domestic violence associations are facing a double-edged sword : With many social workers having to work from home , they are unable to reach victims ; and when people need to be brought to safety , there are often not enough places in the refuges .
Canan Gullu , from Turkey 's federation of women 's organisations said , " Women have called us and told us they are experiencing violence at home .
They are asking : Where can I go ? "  In Germany , families minister Franziska Giffey has called on municipalities to organise alternative reception facilities if necessary , while neighbouring Austria provides guaranteed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members from quarantined households .
In the countries with the strictest lockdowns , such as Italy , victims are exempt from some of the rules -- such as the requirement to carry a document justifying why they are leaving their home -- if they need to visit a refuge centre .
" The current situation is unprecedented , " says Adriana Havasova , a psychologist from Bratislava .
She hopes the confinement will be limited to two or three weeks .
If it goes on for several months , " I ca n't imagine how much more domestic violence could increase , " she warns .
In India , the 21- day lockdown is in it 's fourth day and with domestic violence still accepted as normal and not even reported , in everyday life , it would be difficult days ahead for many families .
