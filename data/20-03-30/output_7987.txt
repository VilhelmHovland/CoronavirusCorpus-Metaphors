Manufacturer and designer , Placon , has increased production in two of its manufacturing facilities to help get plastic Personal Protective Equipment ( PPE ) to healthcare workers during this pandemic .
Placon received a call from University of Wisconsin professor Tim Osswald , who was helping local manufacturers to get PPE face shields to local healthcare workers .
Placon quickly agreed to donate plastic die-cut sheet to the project and worked over the weekend to create the products by hand .
The process to die-cut the sheet is extremely manual and labor intensive .
As more people became aware of the project , there was an increase in the number of requests for the die-cut plastic sheets .
John Rhoades , director of engineering , Placon , commented : " We knew we had to automate the process if we really wanted to deliver a significant number of visors quickly to make a positive impact , and protect our healthcare workers and first responders battling the coronavirus , " .
