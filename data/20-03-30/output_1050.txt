Menu  Beware of COVID-19 scams  Unscrupulous criminals are exploiting fears about COVID-19 to prey on members of the public , particularly older and vulnerable people who are isolated from family and friends .
National Trading Standards is warning people to remain vigilant following a rise in coronavirus-related scams that seek to benefit from the public 's concern and uncertainty over COVID-19 .
Members of the public should ignore scam products such as supplements and anti-virus kits that falsely claim to cure or prevent COVID-19 .
In some cases individuals may be pressurised on their own doorsteps to buy anti-virus kits or persuaded into purchasing products that are advertised on their social media feeds .
In addition , some call centres that previously targeted UK consumers with dubious health products are now offering supplements that supposedly prevent COVID-19 .
