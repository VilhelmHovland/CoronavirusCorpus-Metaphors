New York City 's emergency management office plans to build a 350-bed facility at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park as efforts intensify to supplement hospital space as the U .
battles the coronavirus pandemic .
Construction could begin as early as Tuesday at an indoor training center at the facility , which has multiple courts and wide spaces , according to a spokesman for the U .

@  WASHINGTON -- To meet the dislocation the coronavirus pandemic unleashed on the economy , Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has mobilized the central bank to move faster and farther than ever before .
In the short weeks since financial markets seized up , Mr .
Powell has placed the Fed on wartime footing .
He took up the central bank 's playbook from the 2008 financial crisis and then some -- cutting rates to near zero , purchasing huge quantities of government debt and , breaking a taboo , lending to American businesses .
The pace left no time for the deliberative policy process the Fed prefers .
Officials can spend weeks tweaking a few words in a heavily parsed statement .
This time , the team saw the need for immediate action .
When Fed officials met Sunday morning , March 15 , infections were rising along the East Coast .
Powell and his colleagues left empty seats in between them at the central bank 's oval boardroom table , made of Honduran mahogany and granite .
Two screens suspended from the two-story boardroom ceiling showed 12 reserve bank presidents and others who dialed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would usually take two days .
" We learned our lesson .
Moving early and aggressively is really important , " said Patrick Harker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .
" We needed to get the markets functioning .
"  It 's another transformation of the Fed 's traditional role in American finance , as banks ' lender of last resort , in a time of crisis .
Congress has encouraged the Fed , working with the Treasury Department , to invent new ways to stem the damage , pushing the Fed into fiscal policy choices it has long preferred that elected officials decide .
Powell and his colleagues have rolled out new programs at all hours of the day to keep markets functioning and otherwise-solvent businesses afloat .
They are preparing to facilitate lower-cost lending for cities and states .
Adding to the challenge , they have done much of this from their homes , as a health precaution , instead of from a Fed war room .
The current situation has no precedent in postwar America .
Economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medically induced coma , to slow the virus .
That means the Fed , rather than trying to kick-start growth , is instead focused on preventing credit from drying up to preserve the economy 's capacity to produce once activity resumes .
The big challenge for the Fed is that so much about the economy 's future remains out of its control .
If the virus overwhelms the Fed 's power to preserve businesses ' access to money , the result could be defaults and bankruptcies that turn a severe , synchronized global recession into a full-bore depression .
The Fed 's actions appear to have helped core pillars of the financial market to function for now .
The danger is that new programs , even those launched very quickly , wo n't be ready in time to help revenue-starved businesses already burning through cash .
Designing new programs also raises fundamental questions about which firms should get help and on what terms .

economy to experience a severe recession .
Goldman Sachs economists see it contracting at an annualized rate of 24% during the April-to-June quarter .
Morgan Stanley sees the unemployment rate rising to 12 .
this spring -- the highest on records that date to 1948 .
The economic outlook is more dire than after the 2008 financial crisis , making it easier for Mr .
Powell to cast aside the nagging concerns that his predecessors faced as the housing bubble burst .
Back then , officials were reluctant to cut rates as quickly because they were n't sure how bad the housing bust might get .
Some were concerned that untested tools to purchase government debt might fuel excessive inflation .
Others worried about the effect near-zero rates would have on markets .

trillion in late February .
Officials unveiled six new lending facilities , lending not only to banks , its primary role , but also to businesses .
As part of its rescue package , Congress kicked in $454 billion so that the Fed can take on more risky lending , with programs expected to support trillions of dollars of borrowing .
With credit markets beginning to rally last Monday , Mr .
Powell fielded a phone call from President Trump , who earlier in the month had disparaged the Fed as " pathetic , " the latest in a yearlong string of insults over his desire for lower rates , even when the economy was on a stronger footing .
" I said , ' Jerome , good job .
You really did it , ' " Mr .
Trump recounted later to reporters .
" I was proud of him .
That took courage .
"  Mr .
Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
People who work with Mr .
Powell , a 67-year-old lawyer who is n't an economist , say he has carried a calm demeanor throughout .
That , they say , reflects his comfort with the team inside the central bank , the relationships he has cultivated across Washington and his experience studying the economy and financial markets during a career in private equity and a stint in the Treasury Department during George H .
Bush 's presidency .
From his home office in the Maryland suburbs , Mr .
Powell fields early-morning calls with central-bank counterparts abroad and late-night consultations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin .
He relies on a specially configured laptop to access his Bloomberg data terminal , Wall Street 's ubiquitous trading-desk tool .
Powell has made clear that even with interest rates at zero , the Fed 's firepower is limitless .
" When it comes to lending , we are not going to run out of ammunition , " he said Thursday in an interview on NBC 's " Today " show .
" That does n't happen .
"  Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Depression , was praised by economists and his peers in government for being the right person to lead the Fed during the 2008 crisis , current and former colleagues say Mr .
Powell is proving more decisive than more academic-minded colleagues in a job that is becoming more political .
His feel for markets " is more second nature , and that gives him a greater level of confidence , " said William Dudley , a former president of the New York Fed who served alongside Mr .
Powell for six years .
" If you 're not as confident you tend to want to get more evidence before you move .
He 's responding very aggressively , and that 's appropriate .
"  When Mr .
Powell traveled to Riyadh for a Feb .
22 summit of Group of 20 ministers and central bankers , the virus was tearing through Italy , Iran and South Korea , and markets had started to turn from record highs .
Powell began emailing staff back in Washington that their policy plans would need to change .
school closures and travel restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothetical , were quickly becoming a reasonable base case .
By the end of that week , with markets down more than 14% from their highs of one week earlier , Mr .
Powell issued a rare statement under his name signaling rate cuts were likely .
Fed officials met March 2 to agree to the first emergency rate cut in 12 years .
By March 11 , the uncertainty about economic disruptions panicked markets .
Financial institutions began selling U .
government securities , typically considered a haven , to raise cash after markets for corporate debt , mortgage-backed securities and other assets began seizing up .
Powell concluded the Fed could n't wait until its regularly scheduled interest-rate policy meeting the following week to act .
Fed officials decided to move up the policy meeting by two days to March 15 .
In between , the Fed accelerated previously planned purchases of Treasury securities in a bid to prevent strains from worsening .

They also encouraged banks to tap the so-called discount window for emergency loans by reducing the rate on those loans to 0 .

Powell then deployed the rest of Mr .

Bernanke had broken the seal on a little-used but powerful provision -- section 13(3) of the Fed 's charter -- that allows the Fed to lend broadly during a crisis .
Powell now kept that section tabbed on his computer screen .

At 8 a .
Monday , March 23 , Fed officials unveiled their latest package : open-ended bond purchases and three new lending facilities for business debt markets .
In moving so aggressively to keep the economy from being overwhelmed by the coronavirus , Mr .
Powell has also transformed the Fed 's role to being the lender of last resort not only to banks , but to businesses .
To fend off criticism the lending favors big business , Mr .
Powell is planning a new facility to help smaller firms .
The Fed 's task now is to get these programs working quickly .
