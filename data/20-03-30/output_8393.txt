NEW YORK ( AP ) -- New York 's governor issued an urgent appeal for medical volunteers Monday amid a " staggering " number of deaths from the coronavirus , as he and health officials warned that the crisis unfolding in New York City is just a preview of what other communities across the U .
could soon face .
" Please come help us in New York now , " Gov .
Andrew Cuomo said as the state 's death toll climbed by more than 250 in a single day to a total of more than 1,200 victims , most of them in the city .
He said an additional 1 million health care workers are needed to tackle the crisis .
Even before the governor 's appeal , close to 80,000 former nurses , doctors and other professionals in New York were stepping up to volunteer , and a Navy hospital ship , also sent to the city after 9/11 , had arrived with 1,000 beds to relieve pressure on overwhelmed hospitals .
" Whatever it is that they need , I 'm willing to do , " said Jerry Kops , a musician and former nurse whose tour with the show Blue Man Group was abruptly halted by the outbreak .
He returned to his Long Island home , where he volunteered to be a nurse again .
Kops has been waiting to be reinstated since mid-March and said Monday that the state has sent him an email survey or questionnaire several times , without acting on it .
In the meantime , he has been helping at an assisted living home near his house in Shirley , N .
, and is considering sending his resume himself to hospitals .

Gavin Newsom said .
" If you 've just retired in the last few years , we need you .

government is sending an additional 1,000 ventilators over the next two days to Michigan , New Jersey , Illinois , Louisiana and Connecticut .
" Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days , and this is a very vital 30 days , " Trump told reporters .
" The more we dedicate ourselves today , the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis .
"  In Europe , meanwhile , hard-hit Italy and Spain saw their death tolls climb by more than 800 each , but the World Health Organization 's emergency chief said cases there were " potentially stabilizing .
" At the same time , he warned against letting up on tough containment measures .
" We have to now push the virus down , and that will not happen by itself , " Dr .

The U .
reported nearly 160,000 infections and over 2,900 deaths , with New York City the nation 's worst hot spot , but with New Orleans , Detroit and other cities also seeing alarming clusters .
" Anyone who says this situation is a New York City-only situation is in a state of denial , " Cuomo said .
" You see this virus move across the state .
You see this virus move across the nation .
There is no American who is immune to this virus .
"  Dr .
Anthony Fauci , the U .
government 's top infectious-disease expert , similarly warned that smaller cities are likely about to see cases " take off " the way they have in New York City .
" What we 've learned from painful experience with this outbreak is that it goes along almost on a straight line , then a little acceleration , acceleration , then it goes way up , " he said on ABC 's " Good Morning America .

Luca Richeldi , a lung specialist .
At least six of Spain 's 17 regions were at their limit of intensive care unit beds , and three more were close to it , authorities said .

In a sign of the mounting economic toll exacted by the virus in the United States , Macy 's said it would stop paying tens of thousands of employees thrown out of work when the chain closed its more than 500 department stores earlier this month .

But for others , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , the virus can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia .
More than 160,000 people have recovered , according to Johns Hopkins .
The crisis in China , where the outbreak began in late December , continued to ease .
