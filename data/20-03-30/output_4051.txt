GITAHI : Brace yourselves , it 's going to be months of social distancing in Kenya  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes social distancing as " remaining out of congregate settings , avoiding mass gatherings and maintaining distance ( approximately 1-2 meters ) from others when possible .
The coronavirus pandemic is not a short term social disruption but it is going to take months before our lives go back to normal and start social gatherings .
May and June is likely to be the peak with thousands of infected people .
This is a marathon .
Brace yourselves fellow humans .
It is going to be months of public health measures of physical distance with banned gatherings .
Months ! !  My conservative guess is 4-5 months from now .
That will be followed by probably 12 to 18 months to recover from the social and economic effects ( I am no economist -- just my lay estimates ) .

Even as his health advisers warned of dire consequences if Americans were allowed to return to large gatherings or crowded workplaces , Trump appeared intent on allowing a return to normal life .
On Sunday , however , Trump seemed to acknowledge that the spread of the virus had not slowed , at least not yet .
He said that modeling shows that the peak of the death rate will likely hit in two weeks , but stressed that he hopes the country will be on its way to recovery by June 1 .
" We can expect that by June 1st , we will be well on our way to recovery , we think by June 1st .
A lot of great things will be happening , " he said .
Trump reiterated his intent to return life to normal .
" I want our life back again , " he said .
