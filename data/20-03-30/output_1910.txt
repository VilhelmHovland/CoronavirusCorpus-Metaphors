Germans could soon be issued " immunity certificates " that would allow them to leave the country 's coronavirus lockdown earlier than the rest of the population if they test positive for antibodies to the virus .
However , researchers at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig want to send out hundreds of thousands of antibody tests over the coming weeks that could allow people to break free of the lockdowns , Der Spiegel reported on Friday .
If the project is approved , the researchers will test 100,000 people at a time starting in early April , Der Spiegel said .
The tests are designed to detect whether a person has developed antibodies to the COVID-19 virus , indicating that they were at one time a carrier and may have built up immunity .
A positive test could allow the person to leave the lockdown while many positive tests could allow governments to ease restrictions in areas with " herd immunity .
"  Gerard Krause , the epidemiologist leading the project , told the magazine that people who are immune " could be given a type of vaccination card that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " restrictions on their work .
"  The United Kingdom has similar plans to roll out antibody testing to loosen its lockdown .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's government has ordered millions of at-home coronavirus testing kits that , if approved for use , could be sent to frontline workers over the coming weeks and sold in pharmacies and through online retailers like Amazon .
