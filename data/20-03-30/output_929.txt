Sports has still not quite shut down entirely around the world .
In Minsk on March 19 , FC Energetik BGU shocked BATE Borisov 3 -- 1 in the opening match of the Belorussian premier league .
That remains the last football league standing in Europe .
In Australia , Melbourne City won the women 's soccer championship , beating Sydney FC 1 -- 0 last Saturday .
And in England , well , this is how rugby play-by-play man Nick Heath described a championship final contested recently .
Stefan Fatsis : You started posting these videos on Twitter about a week ago with the hashtag #lifecommentary , and they 've taken off .
The dogging finals is closing in on half a million views .
Were you just bored ? Or was doing play-by-play of people shopping for crudite in a supermarket a lifelong dream ?  Nick Heath : Totally .
It 's proved to be the very zenith of my career .
Yeah , no -- it was a sense of seeing basically all of my actual sporting engagements as a play-by-play commentator falling out of the calendar as more and more sport got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a walk , filmed a couple of guys playing a bit soccer on the common , and then thought , well , I could just sit here and do a bit of voiceover on this and use a kind of old ham commentary voice that I used to use , sort of , 15 years or so ago as a bit of a joke .
Thought basically about five or six of my followers might find it slightly entertaining , and then I 've gone more viral than coronavirus .
So yeah , I 'm also actually quite interested , I need to ask you guys on that side of the pond : Do you know what dogging refers to ?  Joel Anderson : No , I 'm unfamiliar with the term .
Heath : Excellent .
I 'm going to let you look that up in Urban Dictionary .
And obviously it was a nice reference to there being a couple of dogs running around .
But to Brits , that word has a slightly different meaning .
I thought if it reached an international audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American side of the pond to perhaps not quite know what it 's referring to .
Josh Levin : A research project for all of us .
So you 're creeping on people who are just out and about , and then are you recording the commentary afterward when you get home ?  Heath : The first couple I did in situ , and then as I was a little closer to people , I thought it might be less acceptable for me to be talking about them or at them or around them .
So I took them home and then just whacked out a quick voiceover and stuck them up .
Did n't take too much time over them to be honest .
I think part of the nature of wanting it to sound as live and spontaneous as possible is not to sit here scripting it ; it 's just to stick it down and away you go .
Although , it 's interesting .
As it 's gone more viral , and the demands from people are increasing .
" We need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented times ! " It 's like , OK , this is good but A ) people are going into quarantine and B ) people are going to start noticing me standing on street corners just filming them randomly .
So there 's a bit of trickery to it that I need to master if I 'm going to produce any more material .
Heath : Yeah , three-time champion .
Yeah , no , they have n't is the answer .
I 've sort of tried to film them in a way that does n't really show people 's faces too much , because I think that 's only considerate .
Nobody has authorized themselves to be in these videos in a modern release-form world .
If anybody had a problem with it , I would quite quickly take the video down .
I do n't want to infringe on anybody .
But the idea is to just get the backs of people or be slightly further enough away that nobody feels too exposed by what they 're seeing .
But that hopefully the film and the cadence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into thinking there 's some kind of real sporting occasion taking place .
Levin : The economics of coronavirus are devastating for people around the world .
You 're losing work ; you 've lost work .
What is your situation ? Do you typically work on a contract basis ? Or do you have any kind of income coming in at this point ?  Heath : Well , the gig started to go , and I could see the equivalent of , let 's say , four or five months worth of mortgage payment were disappearing from my income , which obviously , it was worrying .
I think many of us hoped that this could be a two- , three- , four-week hiatus and then , OK , some things might be canceled or postponed .
But most of it would come back straight away .
But obviously we 've seen seasons now been canceled full on .
And I think some tournaments and championships might try and resurrect themselves in the summer .
But , I think for a lot of them there 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming back .
And it 's a case of sort of trying to keep the faith .
Also the further these life commentary videos go , I do n't know if anyone 's going to ever take me seriously as a commentator again .
But it 's a really uncertain time .
What 's been incredibly humbling is that I put a post up just to my PayPal link that said , " Look , if these things have made you laugh , you 're very welcome to stick the equivalent of a price for a cup of coffee or a beer into the pot .
" And a lovely amount of people have done ; it 's certainly probably put in a couple of months worth of income for me , which has been extraordinary .
So I found a way to make a bit of revenue .
I 've also done a couple of little online livestream pub quizzes from my YouTube channel .
Which I sort of did for family and friends , but the word spread after I did the first one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I 've sort of , out of nothing , managed to find a way to get a bit of income .
But beyond that , sport and the whole surrounding area is huge .
And whether it 's on the production side , whether it 's people in radio and TV and the people who operate the cameras .
And then in the sports teams themselves , the people in the social media departments , the marketing , the security -- there are so many jobs that rely on sport .
And it 's devastating for huge amounts of people who are now locked away , sad at home .
And for many of them , in the gig economy , they are seeing their livelihoods put on hold .
Fatsis : And as entertainment , it sort of refocuses us all as to how much sports matter to us and what role they play in our lives .
And I 'm curious a little bit over here in the States : The NBA kicked things off when Rudy Gobert tested positive and the league immediately shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League and other sports to acknowledge the reality of the spread of the virus and how it was going to impact sports and whether they should continue .
Did you notice a difference over there in terms of how people reacted to the loss of sports ? And did they want it to continue despite the news ?  Heath : I think there was a bit of a split .
You 've always got a section of people in society around these kinds of things that think they 're impervious to it , that think that they 're bulletproof , and I think you guys have had it over there with the film , with videos that we 've seen of all the kids out at spring break who seem to be paying no attention to it .
We 've had similar people out in the bars here at times who 've just said , " Look , this is a bar in the middle of Manchester .
There 's no way the virus is in there .
" And you just -- head in hands .
Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing needs to be contained , and you 've got no idea where it is .
Sportswise , my last women 's Six Nations game -- the annual rugby union international tournament that takes place in February and March -- my third game of the five-game series was , or five weekends series , was towards the end of Feb .
I then had a weekend of premiership highlights commentary the week after that .
And then my next game was due to be Scotland against France , and there was a Scotland women 's player who tested positive for COVID-19 .
So that one got wiped .
In a very similar time , we started seeing everything else going down as well .
So yeah , I think at that stage the fans and most people started to go , " Look , we should n't be going to live sporting events here .
We should n't be getting into big crowds .
" And I think it did take a few governing bodies a little longer to believe that they had to take that action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be .
And I think we 're all discovering how hand-to-mouth sport can be despite the revenue , despite the TV money , despite the sponsorship .
Actually once you stop having people coming in through the gates , these clubs are struggling to make ends meet .
Levin : What is your philosophy on sports commentary ? Because we get the sense that watching these videos , it 's not necessarily the same Nick that we would hear in a rugby union match .
But this is just one of the many things in sports that I think we do n't realize how important it is and how much we miss it and how integral it is : a broadcaster .
Because I think there 's some school of thought that the commentator is best when he kind of blends into the background and is n't noticed , and that 's not what you were trying to do in the **44;46912;TOOLONG qualifier .
But what has this made you think about or realize in terms of your job and how you try to do it ?  Heath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I think I have long seen commentary as being a part of the big picture .
I think most of our greatest moments in sport are as great as they are because the right commentators have said the right lines at the right moment .
I do n't think that the commentator should be front and center .
Certainly he is in the clips I 'm doing , because I think he 's bringing the sporting sound and cadence and ambiance to it where there is none .
And I think that 's the kind of juxtaposition with the banality that 's making it work .
