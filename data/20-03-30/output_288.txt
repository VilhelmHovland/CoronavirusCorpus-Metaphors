Photo : RNZ / Richard Tindiller  If you suspect a business or individual is breaching the Covid-19 level four isolation rules you can now head online to fill out a report .
Launched yesterday , the new service has proved an immediate hit with 4200 reports made in the first 24 hours .
Police Commissioner Mike Bush said it was clear people were not just passionate about following the rules , but enforcing them too .
" The vast majority of Kiwis or people inside New Zealand are complying brilliantly .
they know that to stay home saves lives .
At the same time , those people who are complying are very passionate to ensure that others comply .
"  The new system received so many reports after being launched at 1pm yesterday it crashed , Bush said .
" Again , it shows how determined Kiwis are to ensure that everyone complies with this .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's working .
"  Of the 4200 reports so far , 1000 related to businesses suspected of breaching the essential services rule while the rest of the reports related to individuals , Bush said .
LB  If you have symptoms of the coronavirus , call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 ( +64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs ) or call your GP - do n't show up at a medical centre  The new website was set-up to ease pressure on the 111 line after 2000 calls related to Covid-19 breaches were made last week .
The figures did not come as a surprise to clinical psychologist and senior lecturer at Massey University 's School of Psychology , Ian de Terte .
He said people following the rules would be annoyed others were not .
" People get frustrated by other people doing what they 've been told by the government .
Some people ca n't tolerate differences when people do n't do what they 've been told to do .
"  Dr de Terte said people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect how long the lockdown lasted .
The current level four restrictions are in place for four weeks but will only be lifted when it is safe to do so .
" Some people will realise that if we do n't do this the lockdown or level four period might go on longer than the four weeks .
"  Police have the power to arrest and detain people for breaking the rules and have so far arrested three people found breaching them even after official warnings .
Some people have taken matters into their own hands as iwi in some parts of the country have asked the public to stay off their land during the lockdown .
Bush said police were not using checkpoints themselves but were supporting others to do so lawfully .
" We 're working with a lot of local communities .
A lot of people want to set up checkpoints and keep people out of their places , areas and towns .
We want to work with them to make sure that 's absolutely lawful .
"  Dr de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an already heightened sense of stress and anxiety at this time .
He had two pieces of advice for anyone struggling with rule breakers ; the first to focus on what you can control and the second to lead by example .
" You can only control what you can control , if you 're doing the right thing by staying away from people that 's good , and also modelling to people what you should be doing .
"  Authorities are clear that if it is an emergency you can still call 111 , but if you are calling to complain about a gathering you have spotted or a park or beach overrun with people , your first port of call is the police 's website or calling the non-emergency number 105 .
