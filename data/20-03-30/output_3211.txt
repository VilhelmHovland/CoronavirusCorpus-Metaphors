JUPITER , FL / ACCESSWIRE / March 30 , 2020 / Dyadic International , Inc .
( " Dyadic " , " we " , " us " , " our " , or the " Company " ) ( NASDAQ:DYAI ) , a global biotechnology company focused on further improving and applying its proprietary C1 gene expression platform to speed up the development , lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales , today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31 , 2019 , and recent developments .
" I am pleased to report that 2019 was another successful year for Dyadic as we achieved several important scientific and business milestones and expanded our global presence .
While still early in 2020 , we are seeing continued momentum .
During 2019 , we entered into six new proof of concept research collaborations to express different types of biologic vaccines and drugs for both human and animal health and entered into two research licenses .
As a result , Dyadic 's pipeline of opportunities is getting larger and more diverse .
Last week , we entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading global Contract Development Manufacturing Organization ( " CDMO " ) and another fully funded feasibility study with a leading animal health company .
We are now working with three of the top four animal health companies , " said Mark Emalfarb , Dyadic 's Chief Executive Officer .
He further commented , " To assist in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic , we are working with the Israel Institute for Biological Research ( " IIBR " ) , Ufovax , a spin-off vaccine company of Scripps Research , as well as a group of coronavirus experts from Erasmus Medical Center , Utrecht University , and the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover ( TiHo ) along with a clinical contract research organization , CR20 .
We expect to use C1 to express a growing number of potential coronavirus vaccine and antibody candidates for a number of different parties .
Our involvement in these COVID-19 initiatives further highlights the broad application potential of our C1 technology by helping to immediately address the coronavirus outbreak , be better prepared for future infectious diseases , pandemic and epidemic outbreaks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower the cost and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs to make healthcare more accessible and affordable to patients globally .
"  " Supporting our growth strategy is our robust scientific data , solid financial position with approximately $36 million in cash and investment grade securities , and on-going R&amp;D collaborations funded by our partners .
Our visibility in the investment community has significantly increased as well .
In 2019 , our shares were up-listed to the Nasdaq and we joined the Russell Microcap Index ? further reinforcing the continued growth of our Company .
We look forward to sharing additional new developments throughout the year as we remain confident in our vision of creating more efficient and commercially cost-effective healthcare solutions , " concluded Mr .
Emalfarb .
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Dyadic entered into a funded collaboration with another top four animal health company to engage in a feasibility study regarding the production of two proteins using our C1 platform .
Three of the top four animal health companies are currently funding research programs to evaluate C1 .
Dyadic entered into a nonexclusive research license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Manufacturing Organizations .
The Israel Institute for Biological Research has expanded its collaboration with the Company to explore the potential of C1 to express gene sequences and targets developed by IIBR into both an rVaccine candidate and monoclonal antibodies ( " mAbs " ) that may potentially help combat the COVID-19 outbreak .
Data presented at the 15th European Conference on Fungal Genetics ( " ECFG15 " ) demonstrated that Dyadic 's C1 strain has been glyco-engineered to achieve a core human-like G2 glycan level over 76% .
Data also showed excellent progress we made in reducing the extracellular protease background by 50 times in C1 .
The elimination of protease activity makes the C1 cell line more efficient and stable , leading to even higher expression levels and lower cost .
Dyadic entered into a new feasibility study with the University of Oslo on influenza vaccine .
In response to COVID-19 , the Company submitted proposals to various funding agencies and parties to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates up to and through a Phase 1 trial .
SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS  Demonstrated further success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmallenberg virus ( " SBV " ) with a yield of 1,780 mg/l ( time point 121h ) or 17 times the initially targeted expression level or more than 35 times baculovirus , the next closest expression platform .
In December , Dyadic received positive preliminary results for the ZAPI animal studies and expanded the funded research collaboration to express two additional proteins .
Recent results shared with us from the ZAPI consortium indicated that Dyadic 's C1 antigen demonstrated very strong performance in protecting both cattle and mice from the SBV .
A publication reporting these results is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2020 .
Dyadic extended its research and development contract through June 2022 with VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd ( " VTT " ) .
Data generated through the collaborative scientific research efforts has exceeded our initial expectations and produced record levels of productivity for several different types of proteins .
This was demonstrated by the very high expression level reached of a full-length monoclonal antibody of approximately 24 .
grams per liter in seven days or approximately 3 .
grams per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Data presented at the PEGS Lisbon conference demonstrated that our C1 strain has been glyco-engineered to achieve a core human-like G0 glycan level of about 95% .
In our collaboration with The Israel Institute for Biological Research , it used C1 technology to express a proprietary IIBR Fc-fusion enzyme .
The recombinant IIBR Fc-fusion enzyme provided longer lasting protection against nerve agents such as sarin and VX gas than Acetyl Choline Esterase which is commonly used .
With regard to the Company 's Sanofi collaboration , Dyadic has achieved or exceeded the targeted expression levels for a number of different types of biologic vaccines and drugs and we are currently in discussions regarding next steps .
2019 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS  In 2019 , we entered into six new proof of concept research collaborations including the Serum Institute of India , two leading animal health companies , and three top tier human health companies , as well as an expanded collaboration with ZAPI .
In addition , we signed two sublicensing agreements and two non-exclusive research license agreements .
Dyadic announced a research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will apply Dyadic 's C1 technology to express up to 12 proteins - eight MABs and four rVaccines and will undertake commercially best efforts to fully develop and commercialize the proteins expressed from Dyadic 's C1 technology .
Dyadic has agreed to grant Serum the option to obtain an exclusive commercial sublicense for each of the 12 proteins in return for certain research funding , milestone payments and royalties for 15 years from the date of the first commercial sale .
To date , more than half of the 12 gene sequences from the Serum Institute of India PVT .
, Ltd have been transferred to Dyadic .
Dyadic entered into two animal health collaborations with two of the top four animal health companies to demonstrate the C1 technology for expression and production of therapeutic proteins for companion and farm animal diseases .
One of the animal collaborations has been expanded to express additional proteins .
Dyadic entered into a sub-licensing agreement with Luina Bio Pty Ltd .
an Australian-based drug development and contract manufacturing organization with more than 20 years of contract manufacturing experience , to develop and commercialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treatment of various ailments for companion animals .
Dyadic will receive a 20% equity stake in a new joint venture company , Novovet Pty Ltd ( " Novovet " ) , plus royalties on future sales .
To date , Novovet has not raised the capital required to move this opportunity forward , and therefore , the Company has not transferred its C1 technology to Novovet .
Dyadic entered into a sub-licensing agreement with Alphazyme LLC ( " Alphazyme " ) , a biotech company focused on producing molecular biology enzymes addressing markets for custom DNA and RNA molecules , genomic medicines and genetic testing .
Dyadic will receive a 7 .
equity stake in Alphazyme upon the successful transfer of the C1 technology , and additional milestone payments and royalties will be payable to Dyadic upon successful commercialization of C1 expressed products .
However , efforts to complete the last step of their internal qualification of C1 has been delayed partly due to the travel restriction under the COVID-19 pandemic .
Dyadic entered into two nonexclusive research licensing agreements with the University of Iowa and another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies tools for life science research .
The nonexclusive license allows for our collaborators to perform certain experiments and manipulations to C1 cell lines to create potential licensed products , and for any other internal noncommercial purpose determined by our collaborators to be necessary to evaluate the C1 technology .
The collaborators will invest their own resources to evaluate C1 technology for research and their customers globally .
