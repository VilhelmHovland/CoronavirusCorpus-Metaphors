"  Investigations are underway to ensure baggage can continue to be offloaded while staff are in quarantine .
QANTAS has been ordered to undertake a " deep clean " of the airport .
" If you have come off a flight today or in the last 24 hours it may be worth giving your bags a wipe over and also monitoring yourself for symptoms , " Spurrier said .
" We do know that it is normally human-to-human contact for COVID-19 , but as many people are aware , the science is not all out on other ways of transmission and we do know that the virus can survive on hard surfaces .
" Do n't panic , but if you have developed symptoms , we would look at testing you .
"  Rush to sign up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Federal Government 's $130 billion plan to subsidise wages during the coronavirus pandemic .
About 113,000 businesses have signed up for the scheme since it was announced on Monday afternoon .
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg expects the plan will help six million Australian workers .
" Australia 's never seen income support like this , " he told Sky News on Tuesday .
Employees will receive a flat-rate payment of $1500 per fortnight through their employers in a bid to lessen the economic blow caused by the virus .
It applies to full and part-time workers , sole traders , as well as casuals who have been on the books for at least 12 months .
The subsidies will last for six months .

billion .
At the same time , the government is working to immediately double and then triple the number of ICU beds with ventilators .
At the moment there are about 2200 ventilated intensive care beds available -- although only about 20 are being used by coronavirus patients at the moment .
Deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said that was being immediately expanded to 4400 by repurposing other ventilators , such as those used for anaesthetics , and the private sector 's capacity .

The government 's overall target is to have 7500 beds with ventilators and accompanying staff .

NSW police tell cruise ships to go away  Police are urging foreign cruise ships floating off NSW to immediately go home rather than risk flooding the state 's hospitals with coronavirus patients .
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says there are nine cruise ships either docked in the state or waiting off the coast .
" There are thousands of people , potentially , in cruise ships off our coasts that are n't members of our state and if we take them in , then that could well flood our system unnecessarily , " Fuller said .
" All the hard work we 've done could be over .
We will continue to allow them to have fuel and food .
but it is time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were on Monday night 285 coronavirus infections in NSW linked to cruise ships , including 189 from the Ruby Princess .

Fuller says health authorities will continue to treat stranded cruise passengers on humanitarian grounds such as two pregnant women who have asked to come ashore .
" We are receiving people sensibly back into NSW .
They get the required healthcare , then go into mandatory isolation , " he said .
Following the Ruby Princess fiasco , NSW has banned all cruise ship passengers from disembarking until new protocols are in place .

"  Strict social distancing and personal hygiene measures will be enforced at rest stops allowed to stay open .
