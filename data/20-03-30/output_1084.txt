You need ALL MPs to work in the NHS ? Er , Ossiedamage , I think you 're being a wee bit unrealistic .
I 'd like to see more STEM MPs as the lack of scientific nous within the Commons is part of the reason it gets science &amp; tech so wrong ( from climate change to the 5G nonsense ) .
And while people might not like it , having quite a few lawyers in Commons where we make our laws is n't a terrible idea .
Im sure they give thanks to the great god Blair , who let us not forget opened the borders promising us a net influx of 10k per year .
and of course had a refurendum in his 2005 manifesto .
this was swept away as his 10k multiplied to 250,000 pa .
All hail the savior  The UK already has a mixed-mode funding model .
Fully 10% of the population has private health insurance , mainly from employers .
And over 90% of primary care is provided by the private sector , a lot of it with co-pay ( dentists , opticians , et al ) .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an optimist today ) until we are hearing about cuts to public services  Eighteen months ? I doubt if there was an election in 6 weeks that most of England would vote for tax rises ( at least , ones that would affect them ) .
We could start to fix society with 5p or more on the base rate , but I do n't see the bloke down the Spoons voting for it , ever .
On the mention of Johnson it is interesting that Cummings who ran away from Downing Street on Friday in an unusual manner only discovered the symptoms of this virus at the weekend .
That seems an unlikely sequence of events .
? ? So you are saying that the 6th richest economy in the world does not have money for its garbagemen ? Jesus wept ! How stupid do you think we are ! ?  No I think a 3p in the pound increase in income tax , the extension of National Insurance contributions to the retired and a large reduction in VAT could be a starter , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours .
And I was n't aware that there was a great shortage of refuse collectors , to give them a more polite and respectful name .
This site states ? 31,001 ( GBP ) Average Salary , ? 15/hr Average Hourly rate and ? 443 Average Bonus for London .
Now retired I was , for a little over 40 years an HGV driver , in the Uk we were always treated as semi-illiterate scum , a step or two up the ladder from warehousemen , bin men and general labourers , some , I freely admit did n't help the cause , but this opinion was , and still is , reflected in our pay and conditions .
Many years ago , a work colleague of mine , having had enough of being treated like scum , moved to The Netherlands to work , where his pay and conditions were vastly improved , where he was viewed by society and by his employers as " a professional " , and that was reflected in his pay and pension .
And yet , if you bought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 12 : hilarious thing about how bored and wacky I am *send tweet*  Be nice if these people instead got off their arses and applied for an actually useful job that might once have been ' beneath ' them .
Courage is being displayed every day in this country now , and the usual snide lot are predictably lacking .
Stack shelves , volunteer , contribute something genuinely valuable for once .
Can you provide a link ? Applauded ? Do you remember what was the vote about ? Do you remember who suggested what ? With so many things to blame present government for there is no need to invent things that did not happen  A change was offered - possibly it was not clear what was on offer as there were too many things and , we learn now , some were concepts , some were ideas , some were aspirations , and few were costed and real action points .
Possibly the change was not one society was ready to understand or prepared to support .
And , possibly , you should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it is not only discussion about the leader but a discussion about leadership .
I do nt really understand this line and sort of faux demand for change .
This is what they do at faux left-leaning newspapers .
The New York Times and the Guardian often take these noble positions , write against inequality , and against the depredations of corporations , shed crocodile tears for the working people .
And when some political contender appears on the left , such as Corbyn or Sanders , who would offer a genuine chance at a better society , then they move in for the kill .
It 'll take more than an horrific virus and the collapse of the economy to change that  I second that .
After the corona drama is over , expect the mother of all austerity programs .
It will last for the rest of your life , and you will be asked to spit back even the fish bone your cat has swallowed .
Someone has to pay for the costs of the pandemic and that someone most certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th , there were 456 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 8 deaths , all of whom had serious underlying health issues .
This in a population of over 67 million .
There are some here and I suspect in the world at large who are now claiming that the lockdownnow being partially practised by that population should have been in place much earlier , like three weeks ago , along with all the other emergency measures ; I 'm one of them .
It 's difficult to imagine the outcry there would have been if instead of a budget speech the Chancellor had announced an immediate lockdown in order to deal with the health , economic and social devastation that the country would be experiencing by the end of the month .
And now with that wonderful gift of hindsight , " The omission is worth thinking about : not in order to condemn Mr Sunak with the benefit of hindsight , but because it reflected a mindset that paid too little attention to the vital but unglamorous types of work that knit our communities together .

Are there no economics or finance experts on the editorial team ?  It 's a pity the same respect and praise was n't shown for the scientists who produced the government 's strategy , as is now belatedly being shown for the low paid and low status key workers , rather than concentrating so much on their spokesman , who now demonstrates so clearly the value of their advice on social distancing .
But as the good book says , there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents , than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant and let daddy foot the bill or illegally deport our own citizens .
Now you can see the dissolution openly upon our faces  And then despair as we realize history will rightly treat us as the worst Prime Ministers ever .
We created three national crises out of hot air .
Austerity , Brexit and Coronavirus mismanagement .
We are the PMs who failed to prepare for three exams .
Austerity , Brexit and Coronavirus .
You , the Light Brigade must prepare to be failed by the duly elected but unable to multi-task government cabinet in any crisis .
And such is life , que sera sera , that we send the under prepared and under resourced Light Brigade of key workers , retired medical staff and final year students to charge into the valley of death , Austerity to the left and Brexit to the right with Coronavirus straight ahead .
W shall watch , finally and now sadly from the bandstand .
I , Boris Johnson , am the prophet of my own doom .

Grant me my sacrifice and may David Cameron and Theresa May be my companions on our final journey .
