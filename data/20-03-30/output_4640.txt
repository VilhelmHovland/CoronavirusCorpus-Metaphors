In three short months , more than half a million cases of the novel coronavirus , COVID-19 , have been reported worldwide .
The US now has the highest number of COVID-19 cases worldwide and Italy has reported more than twice as many COVID-19 related deaths as China .
Deaths from COVID-19 in Spain have surpassed China in recent days , and it wo n't be long before France and the US follow suit .
COVID-19 has well and truly taken hold in the West .
While most people are being encouraged ( or ordered ) to stay at home to reduce the spread of COVID-19 , this is not an option for frontline healthcare workers .
Healthcare workers have been infected at an alarming rate  In countries whose health infrastructure has been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of severe COVID-19 cases , healthcare workers have been infected at an alarming rate .
In Italy , more than 6,000 healthcare workers have been infected , making up 9% of the total COVID infections .
In Spain , 17% of female COVID-19 cases are healthcare workers ( 12% of all COVID-19 cases are healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had laboratory confirmed COVID-19 , with 88% occurring in the worst affected Hubei province .
In Australia , COVID-19 patients are cared for in single rooms where available .
However , soon it will be necessary to care for COVID-19 patients in wards and ICUs alongside other COVID-19 patients -- known as " cohorting " -- as a patient with COVID-19 can not catch the same disease from another patient sharing their ward .
COVID-19 is transmitted primarily by virus-containing droplets that are expelled when an infectious person sneezes , coughs or talks , contaminating others in close face-to-face proximity and nearby surfaces .
This underlies the general advice to stay more than 1 .
metres away from others , practice good cough etiquette and hand hygiene , and avoid touching your face with your hands .
The number of masks , goggles , gloves and gowns we 'll need is staggering  Some procedures that are required when caring for critically ill patients can generate smaller virus-containing particles called aerosols , which can be inhaled .
In circumstances where aerosols could be generated , PPE requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a P2 or N95 mask ) and a negative room pressure , where a slight vacuum is created to prevent contaminated air escaping the room .
The volume of PPE required to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic is staggering .
The WHO has estimated frontline healthcare workers will require at least 89 million masks , 30 million gowns , 1 .
million goggles , 76 million gloves , and 2 .
million litres of hand sanitiser every month during the global COVID-19 response .
Hoarding and misuse of masks puts healthcare workers at risk  The WHO has also noted panic buying , hoarding and misuse of PPE are putting lives at risk from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases .
Healthcare workers are most at risk if they do n't use appropriate PPE when caring for a COVID-19 patient , such as before the COVID-19 infection has been recognised .
This is how a number of unlucky Australian healthcare workers have already been infected with COVID-19 at work , including four from the Werribee Mercy Hospital in Melbourne 's outer west .
Early recognition of potential COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPE , will protect healthcare workers .
Routine use of surgical masks in high-risk clinical settings such as emergency departments , ICUs and COVID-19 screening clinics is now recommended in many places .
PPE supplies in many countries have reportedly been exhausted , forcing healthcare workers to care for COVID-19 patients without adequate protection .
Inappropriate and irrational use of PPE , including use of masks in situations where there is no risk of droplet or airborne transmission , accelerate consumption of a finite PPE supply .
The urgent work of securing more PPE  The federal , state and territory governments are working hard to secure enough PPE to prevent this scenario in Australia , including boosting domestic production and manufacturing capacity .
Local industry has stepped up with companies previously making other products now making hand hygiene products and masks .
This is urgent work because it 's likely a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases would consume current PPE supplies quickly .
Crisis strategies being employed internationally to deal with mask shortages include prolonged use , re-use by a single healthcare worker , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not standard practice .
Work is also taking place around sterilisation of masks for re-use by health care workers , which again is not standard practice .
Healthcare workers are also at risk if PPE is used incorrectly , due to inadequate training , inattention , or fatigue .
Training healthcare workers in correct use of PPE is a critical part of our emergency response .
Like everyone else , healthcare workers are at risk outside work .
In China , outside Hubei , the majority of healthcare workers ' infections could be traced to a confirmed COVID-19 case in the household .
As community transmission of COVID-19 becomes more widespread in Australia , more healthcare workers will be infected at home and in the community .
When healthcare workers ca n't work  It 's vital the healthcare workforce is maintained for the duration of the pandemic .
Perversely , some of the actions taken to prevent COVID-19 transmission might result in healthcare workers ' workplace absenteeism .
Often healthcare workers would work through a mild upper respiratory tract infection , but with the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthcare workers are being encouraged to present for testing if they have fever or acute respiratory symptoms such as sore throat , cough and difficulty breathing .
They are usually unable to return to work until a negative COVID-19 test result is received and symptoms have resolved .
This can take several days .
If a healthcare worker is exposed to a COVID-19 case when not wearing PPE ( meaning they spend more than 15 minutes face-to-face or more than two hours in the same room as a case ) , they will be classed as a close contact and will be home-quarantined and unable to work for 14 days after they were exposed .
And carer responsibilities -- either for someone unwell with COVID-19 or for children unable to attend childcare or school due to closures -- will keep many healthcare workers away from work .
In the current climate , healthcare workers have been described as " every country 's most valuable resource .
" Governments , employers and the public need to do everything they can to protect and support healthcare workers throughout this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shaken to my core , and now you may be too .
It turns out that I 've been moving apps around on iPhones the hard way .
Not only was I an early adopter on smart phones , I literally review them for work .
Fortunately , I 'm not the only tech writer to admit this .
