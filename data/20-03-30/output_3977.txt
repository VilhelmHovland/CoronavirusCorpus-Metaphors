Human-centred thinking in a time of crisis  The importance of human workers to keep the world turning in a crisis has been shot into the spotlight .
Remembering our humanity will get us through these challenges , writes Elaine Burke .
We at Silicon Republic are so keen on the concept of putting humans at the centre of everything that we even named our revamped flagship event after it .
This is n't a radical idea and has been adopted in many forms , from human-centred design frameworks to human factors research .
The gist of it all is that focusing on people makes for better products and services -- and , generally , a better society for all .
Economics tends to be more dispassionate .
It 's aware of humans , but more as a labour input and a cost .
What 's good for the economy is not always what 's good for humans overall , as can be seen in political arguments against decisions that lean heavy on economy-first principles .
When economic needs lead policy , it is typically those who benefit the least from its progress who suffer .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Covid-19 .
Public health -- or human health -- is at the forefront of decision-making for the most part .
Yes , this too has its economic argument , but one need only look to the leader across the Atlantic for an example of extremely human-agnostic decision-making .
The callousness with which 100,000 lives ( minimum ) were written off by US president Donald Trump bears no resemblance to human-centred thinking .
That 's not to say there are n't humans being forgotten about on this side of the ocean .
There has been a worrying lack of attention paid to the risks facing those dependent on homeless services ( or , indeed , living on the streets without them ) , as well as those tightly contained in direct provision centres .
Let 's just hope this powder keg does n't set off .
But , in this new normal , we are increasingly aware of the necessity of human service .
Those in the employ of the long list of essential services will continue to go out and work amid the pandemic so that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no small ask from those enabled to work at home .
We have always been supported by these people , only now this support is at its most visible and our gratitude should be just as prominent .
' One need only look to the challenges facing content moderation in the time of physical distancing to see how essential humans are to our technological services '  At Silicon Republic , we have long advocated for putting humans at the centre of science and technology .
They need not be dispassionate projects operating at a distant remove from the people they serve .
Progress for progress ' sake , benefitting only the few , is nothing much to boast about .
Stories of how work can be transformed by science and technology often centres on how humans might be dispensed with .
From automation and algorithms to hardware and robotics , we puny humans simply ca n't compete with the machines -- or so some headlines would have you believe .
But , for our part , we 've long heralded the augmenting , not the erasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the human touch will always be necessary .
Indeed , the skills we require that machines ca n't muster test our empathy over our methodologies .
These are soft skills indeed and this present crisis is honing them just as much as our pragmatic ability to work remotely .
One need only look to the challenges facing content moderation in the time of physical distancing to see how essential humans are to our technological services .
Since the mass movement to work from home took place around the world , the way social media is moderated has taken a huge hit .
As much as these platforms populated with user-generated content tout their algorithms ' abilities to moderate , it is human decision-making that keeps these efforts in check .
These are services that have proved difficult -- for many practical reasons -- to shift to remote workers .
And so , social media may be at the whim of automated moderators , much to the frustration of many users .
' Team leaders must remember , during this reluctant remote working revolution , that humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their full best during a time of crisis '  Just as Big Tech is being forced to acknowledge the importance of the humans at the front lines of moderation , supply and other work that sustains their billions in profit , employers around the world are going to have to learn the importance of human-centred thinking to manage their remote teams .
Team leaders must remember , during this reluctant remote working revolution , that humans are not machines and ca n't be programmed to operate at their full best during a time of crisis .
Between wavering mental health , the sickness caused by the coronavirus , and the challenge of balancing work and home life when all are now trapped in the same four-walled box , the fact that we are even managing to keep the lights on is a small miracle .
The most effective public health messaging on Covid-19 reminds us that we need to look after one another .
Stay at home so others can safely go to work .
Wash your hands so you do n't transmit infection to others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others .
The most human thing we can do in these circumstances is show empathy , do our best and remember that we are not machines .
