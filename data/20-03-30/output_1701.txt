Clare Foges in The Times  " There will be those who argue that the couple have no obligation to this country at all , because their royal ' contract ' is now up .
But the deal the Queen reached with the Sussexes left them with royal titles to enjoy , their security bill footed , the use of Frogmore Cottage - and thus a reasonable expectation that even though they might not be cutting ribbons on rainy days in Wigan , they would show some solidarity in a time of national crisis .
Simply staying in Canada would at least have been inconspicuous ( and would have made more sense given that coronavirus is rampaging through Los Angeles ) .
Instead they have chosen this time to move to Hollywood and lay the foundations for lucrative new careers , not out of the spotlight but firmly in it .

Daniel Falush in The Guardian  " In my own opinion , the costs of suppressing the outbreak are absolutely worth it .
What many people on the right in the west , including Donald Trump , have failed to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Until a country has shown that it has brought transmission under control , normal economic life can not resume .
Tourists will not visit and international travel will not be permissible -- meaning that , until they get coronavirus under control within their own borders , countries will not be able to again join the world community of freely trading nations .
That community today seems to consist of China alone .

Philip Johnston in The Daily Telegraph  " The exit strategy from this nightmare can not be zero new cases because that is not going to happen .
We have to get people who will be affected mildly back to work and soon , provided they do not interact with the most vulnerable .
Once the NHS has the intensive care capacity to deal with all new serious cases this will become less of an issue .
But if this goes on for long , the economic and social damage will have dire consequences for future spending on health , welfare , care and all the other public services that extend life now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I was growing up in the 1960s , the great flu pandemic of 1919 barely registered .
Even the war seemed like ancient history by the time England won the World Cup in 1966 playing a country reduced to rubble just 20 years before .
We recovered from these calamities and we will from this .
So , when my grandson turns 18 , how will he look back on this time ? Will it be remembered as the great coronavirus pandemic that wiped out swathes of humanity or a relatively minor contagion to which we grotesquely overreacted ? "  4 .
Editorial board at the Financial Times  " The speed and scale of the emergency has taken everyone by surprise .
Chief executives must tread a fine line between protecting their employees and keeping their companies solvent .
The hard truth is that many companies will not survive - and there is not much point in showing compassion to employees if it kills the company that employs them .
There are many significant decisions that lie between the extremes .
In the UK , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are due .
One of the consequences of the pandemic must be a redrawing of the relationship between business and society .
The huge sums of money being committed by the UK government and others to support companies will inevitably lead to a larger role for the state .
This should not become the norm once the virus abates .
But it does , as a new report by the Social Market Foundation think-tank says , demand reciprocity by business -- one that , in time , should lead to a ' new social contract ' between British business , government and society .

Ani Maitra on Al Jazeera  " COVID-19 has ushered in a US state of exception that is internally split , one in which the imperative to save lives through quarantining ( in the face of a broken healthcare system and a completely collapsed welfare structure ) is jostling against the inclination to do everything possible to revive the financial market .
While these cracks and divides may well be coloured by the fact that this is an election year , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that neither presidential hyperboles , nor neoliberal buzzwords ( like ' freedom ' , ' democracy ' , or ' the market ' ) will be able to fix .
It is too early to tell if the ' disaster socialism ' of the just-passed $2 trillion stimulus bill is anything more than a re-election strategy .
On the one hand , it promises much-needed economic relief to state governments , hospitals , and industries .
On the other hand , the bill 's priorities are telling : $500bn for businesses , $100bn for healthcare , $150bn for state and local governments , and little relief for .
