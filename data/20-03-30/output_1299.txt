WORKING FROM HOME : Our guide to making it work .
The dos and don'ts of working from home  With millions of us forced to work from home because of the coronavirus outbreak -- often juggling childcare , or sharing desk space with our partner -- what is the best advice for managing the workload , keeping in touch with colleagues , and looking after our wellbeing ? MAXINE GORDON seeks some sound advice .
Rachel Goddard runs PR firm Intandem Communications , York  Our team has decamped from our office and , so far , it has worked well .
We are remaining positive and although we 've had our ups and downs , we have adapted and are embracing our new ways of working .
At a strange and challenging time for businesses and their teams , here are some of our top tips on working from home .
Embrace technology  Setting up your home office and making sure your mouse works and that you can connect to the VPN and you have a good internet connection is one thing , however using apps and video conferencing software such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is crucial .
Keep in close contact  Of course , technology is the key to keeping in touch while working remotely and , while we will never again take for granted asking quick questions across the office , we recommend scheduling in regular catch-ups as a team and with clients .
Face-to-face ' contact ' is going to be key in the coming weeks and we 've found it 's just as important to have informal conversations as well as ' meetings .
'  We 've had chats about ' toilet-roll gate ' , how over-caffeinated we are and even how slow the kettle -- all things that put a smile on our face , help to boost morale and make you feel less alone during these times .
Structure  We have set regular times at the beginning of the morning and in the afternoon for our catch-ups , just as we would if we were in the office .
It helps to still feel like we are working as a team .
Working space  We have each created our own working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to get in the right headspace for our working day .
Although it may be difficult , it is also important to set firm boundaries with your family or housemates .
A great tip is to create a ' I 'm in a meeting ' sign and hang it outside your door as a polite nod to prevent anyone from interrupting your calls !  Take regular breaks  To stay focused and avoid procrastination , it is important to take regular breaks and get away from your desk , just like you would do on your normal lunch break .
We 've been taking dogs for a walk or even just walking around the garden to help us .
It pains me to say it , but a very large number of people who are married right now are going to find themselves making plans to be unmarried when we return to normality .
That is certainly the expectation of a leading UK divorce lawyer -- and in China , the number of applications for divorce has already reached record levels in the places worst affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be that way .
I work with my husband -- here are six key things you can do to make working from home work for you .
Organise your work space  You may discover that your work styles are polar opposites -- neat desk versus lots of piles .
That 's fine if you have your own space and can close the door but it can become a source of frustration if you have to share the same space .
Organising and containing your stuff will help your partner and others at home feel more considered and minimise opportunity for resentment .
Discuss expectations around roles and responsibilities around the home  Household chores are already one of the main sources of arguments between couples , so best to nip this one in the bud .
Instead of assuming , have the conversation around who will do what in this new reality .
Create healthy boundaries  One thing that I 've found works well for me and my husband is agreeing a general schedule around when we are working , when we are available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we need thinking time without interruption .
Also , while you 're creating healthy boundaries , remember that ' start time ' and ' stop time ' for work are important so that work does n't bleed into home life .
Choose your battles  The fact that you are spending more time around each other means that you will bump up against each other more , notice differences and irritants more , and have more moments of conflict .
Do n't panic -- this is normal and as long as there are no underlying issues , you will find your equilibrium again .
Choose your battles .
Will it matter in a month 's time ?  Make time for each other and for your relationship  It 's easy to get stuck in a routine of work , chores , organising children ( if you have any ) and not make time to enjoy being a couple .
You might not be able to go out for a while but you can still ring fence time together for date nights in , finishing work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can enjoy having fun together .
Take action now  It is important to note that if there already is an underlying issue , now would be a great time to get professional help .
The quality of relationships at home and the level of skill in discussing and agreeing ' new normals ' will determine how well we survive the next few months as couples , families and as a nation .
If ever there was a time to get good at building strong relationships at home , it 's now .

Natalia Willmott , North Yorkshire businesswoman and mother-of-three who works from home  Working from home with children around is a challenge but can also be a lovely experience -- if you look at it the right way .
I have three daughters , aged 16 , 13 and nine , and have been running my businesses for the past ten years from home .
I have always had to adapt to a new routine come the school holidays .
We are now facing unusual circumstances that keep us more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative and know that new routines take time to implement .
Here are some more tips :  Create a schedule everyday  Children love routines .
You can give them a timetable , depending on their age or they can create their own .
If you have meetings or calls , plan them around the activities you allocate to them and let them know .
When they were young I tended to work later in the evenings and , now that mine are older , I start work early .
Schools should allocate homework and activities , but you can also organise them to do crafts , challenges , put a film on , read , do some baking and of course be bored .
It is amazing what children can come up with -- and what they can do with a cardboard box .
Limit electronic devices  Limit these to pockets of time during the day .
Encourage face-time and interaction , whether it 's playing a game or tidying up their bedrooms .
Get creative  If you have several children -- ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or play a game of cards .
Try something new , everyday can be exciting -- search for a new game to play , a new recipe to try , an online dance or exercise class to do .
Fun and smiles can take you a long way .
Helping hands  Give them mini jobs to do where they can earn pocket money ( setting the table , emptying the dishwasher , sorting socks , vacuuming , mopping the floor , preparing sandwiches ) .
The important thing is to be grateful and appreciative of the things they have done -- even if they are not to your standard .
Why not let them help you redecorate a room or paint a wall ?  Quality time  Make sure you spend quality time with each child , even if it 's 15 minutes each , to listen , to play , to interact or to watch a bit of TV together .
Reaching out ( safely )  Help the community and people around you however you can -- by calling , writing a review on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved too .
Children love receiving items in the post , so why not get them to write to friends , family members and experience the joy of snail mail .
Be realistic  As an adult , really focus when you are working and switch off social media so that you are really efficient and using your time wisely .
You ca n't expect the same results as if you were working in an office but you can learn from your children and create a fabulous bond .
So do n't put too much pressure on yourself and let go of everything being perfect -- you need to feel the best you can .
