BAGHDAD ( AP ) -- The U .
coalition in Iraq withdrew Sunday from a military base in the country 's north that nearly launched Washington into an open war with neighboring Iran .
The K1 Air Base is the third site coalition forces have left this month , in line with U .
plans to consolidate its troops in two locations in Iraq .
A rocket attack on the base in late December killed one American contractor and lead to a series of tit-for-tat attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks culminated in the U .
killing of top Iranian Gen .
Qassem Soleimani and a senior Iraqi militia leader , Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis .
Coalition forces handed over the K1 base in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk to Iraq 's military , according to a coalition statement .
At least $1 .
million of equipment was transferred to the Iraqis as 300 coalition personnel departed .
Until last month , there were some 7,500 coalition troops based in Iraq , including 5,000 U .
forces .
Withdrawals are planned " in the coming days " from two bases in western Iraq , said Col .
Myles Caggins , a coalition spokesman .
He said troops have so far been relocated to other bases in the country and some will head home in the coming weeks , but did not specify how many .
He said the two bases are the Nineveh Operations Command in Mosul -- Iraq 's second-largest city and which was under the Islamic State group 's control from 2014 until 2017 -- and the Taqaddum military airport outside the city of Habbaniya , on the Euphrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to launch operations against IS in nearby mountainous areas .
Areas south of Kirkuk , and north of neighboring provinces of Diyala , Salahuddin and Nineveh remain hotbeds of IS activity .
The stretch of territory is also disputed between the federal Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish region , which has created security gaps benefiting IS militants .
The coalition 's presence had at times been a mediating force between the two competing authorities .
A senior coalition official earlier this month claimed IS forces were n't as able to exploit the " security gap " between Iraqi and Kurdish forces , as the militants did in the past .
" That ( gap ) does n't necessarily mean that Daesh is free to operate in the way that they wish , " said the official , using the Arabic acronym for IS .
" They 're still pretty constrained .
"  The coalition official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations .
forces have already withdrawn this month from the Qayara base in Nineveh province followed by the Qaim base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line with plans to pull out from bases across Iraq and consolidate coalition forces in Baghdad and at the Ain al-Asad Air Base in the country 's western desert .
The plan has been in the works since late last year , the senior coalition military official has said , and accelerated when Iraqi forces proved they were capable of facing the IS threat with limited coalition assistance .
Coalition officials said they would still assist Iraqi forces with air support and surveillance , but significantly cut back on training and ground operations , as the limited withdrawal continues .
