The Liberals ' 75-per-cent wage subsidy may have prevented many layoffs , CFIB says .
MONTREAL ? A quarter of Canada 's small and medium-sized businesses wo n't be able to make rent on the first of the month this Wednesday , according to a survey from an industry group .
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business ( CFIB ) , which represents 110,000 privately owned businesses across the country , surveyed nearly 10,000 of those companies over the weekend , and found only one in five is still fully open for business .
Forty-two per cent said they are worried about having to close their business permanently .
Statistics Canada defines a small or medium-sized business as having fewer than 500 employees , but some CFIB members are larger ? the only standard for membership is that it be a privately owned company not traded on stock markets .
The CFIB is calling on provincial governments to offer eviction protection for commercial tenants , in much the same way British Columbia and Ontario enacted residential tenants protections .
It 's also asking provinces for property tax relief in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax rate would be in place for the duration of the crisis .
The federal government announced last week that it is increasing its wage subsidy for businesses impacted by COVID-19 to 75 per cent of wages , back-dated to March 15 .
CFIB executive president Laura Jones believes that this move may have prevented many layoffs .
The federal government was expected to announce Monday which businesses will qualify for the wage subsidy .
There is some concern that some businesses will be passed over because of the nature of their product .
For example , the Business Credit Availability Program has been criticized for not allowing bars and cannabis retailers ? some of the hardest-hit companies ? to access funds .
" The devil is in the detail , and the concern is , are we doing enough to help those businesses that are hardest hit and may have trouble getting a loan ? " Jones asked .
" The last thing you want is a nail salon owner going to the bank and hearing ' Sorry , you 're not eligible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  The CFIB is calling for the government to loosen the rules for borrowing through the fund .
Currently a business has to borrow $40,000 in order to qualify for $10,000 in loan forgiveness .
The CFIB want businesses to draw up to $10,000 in forgiven loans without borrowing the full $40,000 .
But in the meantime , the rent is due Wednesday .
The CFIB is calling for landlords and tenants to stay in touch , and to work together to come up with solutions .
" We 're hearing some examples of tenants coming to landlords and saying ' I 'm struggling , ' and they are working something out .
We are encouraging that .
Protecting livelihoods is gon na be a group effort .
We 're all going to have to step up .
