Last week , the Union government and the Reserve Bank of India or RBI , in sync as it were , pronounced back-to-back measures to head off the challenge posed by the rapid spread of Covid-19 .
While the pronouncements of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman were essentially a social safety net to mitigate the hardships of those at the bottom of the pyramid -- who have been blindsided by a spike in the disease that has taken the snuffing out of the informal economy .
RBI , on the other hand , sought to alleviate the impact of the lockdown -- an effort FFto flatten the spread of Covid-19 -- on economic growth and ensuring financial stability .
The moves of the duo were , however , dwarfed by the humanitarian crisis that has begun unfolding in the metros , Delhi in particular , as scores of migrant workers displaced from their jobs after the 21-day lockdown was initiated chose to head back home .
Their otherwise daily trade-off between lives and livelihood suffered a rude reset following the lockdown .
Seized with panic , the migrants , ignoring norms of social-distancing -- the only proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outskirts of Delhi seeking their way home in the adjoining states ; not to avail of leave , as is being argued in some quarters , but to escape contact with the infected .
Overnight the unfolding tragedy brought home the tragic sub-text of Covid-19 disease in India : it is ( at least in origin ) a rich man 's disease and a poor man 's burden .
After all the disease originated in the second-largest economy in the world in the industrial cluster of Wuhan , China and travelled first to places like Italy -- deeply connected commercially with each other .
We have to accept a basic truth .
It is not the poor who get to travel abroad or stay in hotels ; the high-profile example is a Covid-19 infected member of the aspiring Bollywood fraternity who fraternized with the elite both in India and abroad .
She in many ways represents the privileged class who have blatantly disregarded the risks they pose to others in violating social distance norms .
On the other hand , you would rarely see such disdain on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their dire economic circumstance does not lend itself to any false sense of security .
Undoubtedly , the administration , both the Centre and the state , have failed these migrants in Delhi .
To be sure though , such a surge in the gathering of crowds , unless tackled early , will no doubt overwhelm even the best prepared administrations .
Worryingly , a similar exodus should logically be playing out in the metros in south India -- the new destination for migrants since the turn of the Millennium .
Census data reveals that in 2011 , Bengaluru and Chennai migrants accounted for one in two residents ; in 2001 their proportion was a third of the population for Bengaluru and a fourth for Chennai .
More stunning is Hyderabad where the data shows that migrants in 2011 account for three out of four residents in the city .
Predictably on Sunday , reports of a crowd of migrants assembling in Kottayam have begun to emerge .
It is true that the current circumstance is unprecedented -- given that this pandemic is like a once-in-a-century crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a fact that the administration of most state governments overwhelmed as they are by sloth following years of neglect , underestimated the extent of the challenge .
Exactly why the migrants would rather risk their lives in reaching home than trust the state support mechanism .
It is time then for us to go back to the Father of the Nation for inspiration and guidance .
Especially this maxim : " Whenever you are in doubt , or when the self becomes too much with you , apply the following test .
Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest person whom you may have seen , and ask yourself , if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him/her .
Will they gain anything by it ? Will it restore control over their own life and destiny ? "  Anil Padmanabhan is managing editor of Mint and writes every week on the intersection of politics and economics .
