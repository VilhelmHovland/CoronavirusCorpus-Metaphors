Editorial Courtesy The Island  Tuesday 31st March , 2020  Time was when there were retail shops , or sillara kades , at every nook and cranny of the country , selling various commodities , including grocery items , at reasonable prices .
Catering as they did mostly to low income groups , they could keep prices low as they had no overheads as such .
They were open , from morn till night , daily .
They stood the ordinary people in good stead in that essentials were available at affordable prices .
But , most of these small businesses could not withstand the tide of consumerism , which paved the way for the rapid expansion of giant supermarket chains .
The need for ensuring the existence of the sillara kades is felt today more than ever , thanks to the current countrywide lockdown , coupled with a strictly enforced curfew .
When the curfew , which is in force to prevent mass gatherings on account of the spread of Covid-19 , is relaxed , people , desperate to buy essentials , throng streets and line up near supermarkets , which get stripped bare in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of people near the existing retail shops , where goods are cheaper than at supermarkets .
Fashionably dressed men and women also join these queues , which are not long , for want of a better alternative .
We have , in this space , urged successive governments to take action to protect retailers as their elimination will place the ordinary public at the mercy of giant businesses .
Supermarkets are , no doubt , necessary , in the modern society , and the state is duty bound to look after their interests , as well , but the existence of small businesses , which cater to the ordinary people , must also be ensured .
It may be recalled that the Rice Mafia is now exploiting both the farmer and the consumer , having driven most of the small-time millers out of business .
No government can control the big-time rice millers , who have become a law unto themselves .
This is what happens when small businesses go belly up .
We peddle no argument that retailers are driven by altruism ; they , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game , but they are capable of keeping prices relatively low and making goods freely available at the grassroots level .
Hence the need to protect them .
Meanwhile , what would have been the situation if Sathosa had been privatised and the co-operative outlets closed down ? The state would have had no way of controlling the distribution and sale of essential commodities .
Sathosa is playing a vital role in making goods available to the ordinary people at the prices prescribed by the government .
Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa , who is heading the Presidential Task Force , appointed to manage the current situation , said , the other day , that the co-operative outlets had to be strengthened to streamline the distribution of essential commodities , at the grassroots level .
Following the 1977 regime change , which led to the unbridled economic liberalisation , the co-operative movement was neglected and left to wither on the vine .
Its survival has been a miracle .
Now that the country has realised the value of the co-operative outlets and Sathosa , once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Similarly , action should be taken to help retailers stay afloat .
It is hoped that the lessons learnt during the Covid-19 crisis wo n't be forgotten when normalcy returns .
Let all political parties make a written pledge , in their election manifestos , to develop Sathosa and the network of cooperative outlets and ensure the protection of retailers .
