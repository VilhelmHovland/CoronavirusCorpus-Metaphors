MODI SEEKS FORGIVENESS FOR IMPOSING LOCKDOWN E X P R E S S N E W S S E R V I C E @ New Delhi PRIME Minister Narendra Modi on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardships they have to endure due to the 21-day lockdown , while explaining that there is no other option to fight the deadly coronavirus .
" Certain decisions had to be taken , resulting in myriad hardships for you .
My poor brothers and sisters must be wondering what kind of Prime Minister they have got .
My wholehearted apologies , especially to them , " he said .
He said the fight against the virus is one between life and death and , hence , the country must win .
Acknowledging that many people are annoyed at being confined to their homes , he appealed to them to be obey the lockdown rules for a few more days .
Do n't panic , we can conquer it : Dr Nageshwar Reddy the Padma Bhushan in 2016 and currently serves as the Chairman of the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology takes us through why , the coronavirus may not withstand the scorching heat of the Indian summer .
" Regarding temperature , there was and there is still a lot of controversy , but recently , a paper was published by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this virus .
Above 32 degrees , this virus is unable to exist for long pe- tive and is undergoing treatment at the IRT Hospital .
The man reportedly visited the Erode Railway Hospital where this doctor was practising .
A press release stated that the four persons who tested positive at ESI Hospital , were previously residing at Railway Colony in Erode .
On Sunday morning , the area was P2 sealed and disinfected .
Every house to be tested every day in 9 city areas EXPERT 'S TAKE E X P R E S S N E W S S E R V I C E @ Hyderabad help -- have also tested positive .
They are under isolation at the ESI Hospital .
Her 31-year-old husband and two-year-old child have tested negative .
Sources say she could have contracted the virus from a former railway employee who was in contact with the Thai nationals .
The employee , a 63-year-old man , later tested posi- riods , " he says .
In India , most places average well above 32 C in April .
" But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature levels are cool , the problem still persists , " he adds .
The MIT research is peer-reviewed , which means it has not been completely published but the initial reviews look positive .
Dr Reddy explains that the spread of Covid-19 in India may not parallel that of Italy or China because its strain is different .
" In the Indian virus , there is a single mutation occurring in the spike protein of the genome .
Spike protein is the area that attaches to the human cell .
Only one small mutation has happened , making that attachment weak .
" That is why he believes the current 21-day lockdown should not extend .
" In my opinion , we should limit it to three weeks .
It looks like , to some extent , the community spread is being controlled , " he opines .
