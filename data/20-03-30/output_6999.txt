A Jackson law firm is embracing social distancing by offering curbside legal services  " ( It 's ) something that I never truly thought would take place in the law business , but it 's turned out to be a really helpful tool , " Angela Snider , an attorney at Byrd and Byrd Attorneys at Law , said in a Facebook Live video on Wednesday .
The spread of the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deemed " non-essential " throughout Tennessee and the nation as officials attempt to prevent a spike in infections and hospitalizations due to the highly contagious respiratory disease .
But legal services are deemed essential , and people still have urgent legal needs , including cases involving adoptions , child custody and domestic violence .
Byrd and Byrd no longer takes walk-in clients at its North Jackson office , but clients can still call the office to set up consultations through online video chat .
Legal documents for everything from real estate transactions to divorces to wills can be signed without clients having to leave their car .
Legal services , to-go  Snider said clients call the law office when they arrive in the parking lot and an attorney delivers legal documents to their vehicle , standing at least six feet away after transferring the paperwork .
Attorneys can answer questions via telephone and witness the signatures for notarization purposes , all while maintaining proper distance .
Usually , clients wear gloves and bring their own pen to sign the papers , cutting down contact even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jackson area for about 20 years .

It reminds her of her first job as a carhop at a Jackson Sonic at 16 years old , though she said she no longer wears roller skates .
Jokes aside , she thinks her waitress past helped her come up with the idea .
" We 're very mindful of anything we can do just to stop the spread , " Snider said .
" Our mayors , city and county have been so diligent and our health department .
We 've got to integrate that into every business practice and every part of our lives .
"  At their North Jackson location , Byrd and Byrd offers several curbside signing services , including :  Real estate closings  Wills  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support  Child custody  Conservatorships  Curbside legal service does not extend to their Church Street office , which deals mostly with criminal cases .
Snider said she handles between eight to 10 curbside signings each day .
On Tuesday , one client will sign adoption papers in the law office 's parking lot , a step crucial to getting the child health insurance .
Snider handled a divorce mediation Monday morning via video chat , and papers will be signed and notarized curbside .
Snider has also seen an increase in clients creating and updating their wills , likely because the pandemic is bringing mortality into sharp focus for many .
" I think people are just more aware when there 's a pandemic just to get their affairs in order , just in case , " Snider said .
" ( Mortality ) is something that all of us ultimately face , but these pandemic times just trigger .
the sense of urgency to get those things taken care of .
"  Angela Snider , an attorney at Byrd and Byrd Attorneys at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients who want to update or create a will during the novel coronavirus pandemic .
( Photo : File image )  Changing the legal landscape  " After 20 years of practicing law , it 's been interesting to sit back and watch your profession shift and change and embrace the new technology that 's there , " Snider said .
Courts in Tennessee are still open and operating , but they are limiting in-person hearings in accordance with a mandate issued by the Tennessee Supreme Court on March 13 .
Emergency hearings and hearings that concern civil rights are exempt from the order , and other proceedings can still be conducted via telephone or video .
Those who are in the middle of a divorce , need child support , or those who have found themselves locked down in a domestic abuse situation during the pandemic still have access to the legal system , Snider said .
And the limitation of in-person proceedings during non-emergency situations has spurred other changes .
Courts that have been resistant to allowing electronic document filing are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform notary services using two-way video , an option that went into effect in July .
" ( These practices ) are efficient , they are cost-effective and they are time-sensitive , and I think a lot of these practices will be here to stay , " she said .
" I think that 's a good thing .
