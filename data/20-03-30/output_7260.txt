Letter : Cuomo 's coronavirus talk is hypocritical  Given his recent statements on the coronavirus pandemic quoted here , one might be led to believe that Gov .
Andrew Cuomo should be nominated for a " Defender of Life " award : " We 're not going to accept a premise that a human life is disposable " and " if all of our sweeping , expensive measures to stem the coronavirus saved one life , it would be worth it " .
Cuomo 's actions and track record clearly speak otherwise , clearly demonstrating his complete disregard for the most vulnerable in our society , the unborn .
Recall Cuomo 's egotistical decision last year to light up the World Trade Center pink to celebrate his signing of the country 's most heinous abortion bill , allowing abortion up until the day of birth .
This set a precedent soon followed by other states .
Cuomo and others ( including Gov .
Raimondo ) have worked tirelessly to dehumanize the child in the womb .
Let 's also not forget Cuomo 's strong advocacy of physician-assisted suicide .
Rather than a defender of life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most vulnerable and hypocrisy at its greatest .
This opinion piece is not intended to focus on the coronavirus or society 's actions to contain it .
At some point , the world will win that battle .
Equally certain will be the ongoing , relentless attack on the sacredness and dignity of all human life that will be continued to be waged by Gov .
Cuomo and all those who share his depraved ideology that the sanctity of life is merely relative and not an absolute .
