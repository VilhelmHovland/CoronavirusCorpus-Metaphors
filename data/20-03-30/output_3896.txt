Mahan A310 crew overran after displaced threshold blunder  By David **40;6983;TOOLONG  Iranian investigators have found that a Mahan Air Airbus A310-300 crew mistakenly landed long and overran at Yerevan after failing to check which end of the landing runway was subject to a displaced threshold .
The A310 , arriving from Tehran on 26 May last year , had been cleared for an ILS DME approach to runway 09 .
This deviation was deliberate and intended to extend the distance for flare and touchdown to account for the imagined threshold displacement , says the Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation inquiry .
But the misunderstanding meant the aircraft landed just short of the end of the runway , marked by the displaced threshold for runway 27 .

Investigators state that the crew had been given NOTAM data for Yerevan Zvartnots airport during a briefing and through delivery to the electronic flightbag in the cockpit , but the crew had " not enough time " to review the information .
Both pilots were experienced in flying to Yerevan but were preoccupied by matters including a flightpath adjustment for weather .
Although they reviewed the NOTAM data , the pilots were " not focused on the runway limitation " , says the inquiry , and a terminal information broadcast advising of the restriction similarly failed to register .
The first officer also acknowledged an approach controller 's reminder of the threshold displacement as the A310 conducted its descent to runway 09 .
None of those on board the aircraft ( EP-MNV ) was injured but the jet needed a tyre change before it could be released for the return flight to Tehran .
