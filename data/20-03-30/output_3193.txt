Now three weeks since the pandemic effects were really felt in Canada , the Grande Prairie Food Bank has seen an uptick in the demand for food hampers , and their shelves are running bare as a result .
With that , the Rotary Club has launched an interim food drive , similar to their annual drive every fall , to help create food hampers and help those in need during this time .
" The Food Bank is seeing a huge increase in the need and their shelves are running bare , " said Lauri Pollock , the Co-Chair of the food drive .
" The Rotary Club of Grande Prairie wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know our communities are so generous and geared to help when they can .
"  " When we talked to the Salvation Army , they thought that would be the amount that would hold them off until we are able to do our annual ( food ) campaign in the fall , " said Pollock .
Because of social distancing measures put in place by the government , the club is asking for monetary donations only .
This will ensure that person to person contact is limited and the Food Bank can work with grocery stores in the region to help stock up their supply and get the items necessary to create food hampers .
