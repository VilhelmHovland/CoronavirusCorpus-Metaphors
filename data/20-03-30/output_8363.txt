What 's on the menu at the new Just Cookin ' ? Tenacity , endurance and carryout  First , the self-made woman was moved out of her Just Cookin ' restaurant in the West End in 2018 to make way for FC Cincinnati 's Major League Soccer Stadium .
She fought the establishment over the upheaval and landed some startup dollars that she put to immediate use readying a whole new space in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The new coronavirus had other plans .
You ca n't keep a good woman down .
Williams is now set to open as open her doors at 1144 California Avenue in Bond Hill for carryout only .
It 's a plan that 's in sync with Ohio 's stay-at-home order and will put her -- and her staff -- back to work .
The small seating area she 's created in the new restaurant is surrounded by inspirational quotes and photos of people who inspire her .

( Photo : Phil Didion )  No one will be sitting there on Wednesday when she opens but Williams will be where she was always meant to be , cooking , feeding people , anchoring a community .
" I 'm opening up in Covid-19 , " Williams said .
" It 's not the big bang I wanted with door prizes and cupcakes .
But no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still going to do this "  She 'll begin lunch and dinner carryout of her signature soul food , from the new Just Cookin ' .
Williams grew up in the West End on Cutter Street , in a Cincinnati Metropolitan Housing project .
She was always ready to answer the call of her grandmothers who needed her to help in the kitchen .
She credits that time with keeping her safe from streets that were becoming increasingly violent .

Many never would return , but Williams and her family did .
" Coming back and bringing my business to the West End meant everything to me because I wanted to be an inspiration to some of the youth , " Williams said .
" We started seeing a rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wrap my mind around it because that was n't the community that I knew .
"  She was a mail carrier .
She worked at Butternut Bakery .
She did in-home childcare .
And she cooked .
Friends and family urged her to open a restaurant .
She opened Just Cookin ' in 2012 on 15th Street in the West End , in a small , graffiti-covered building that also housed a church .
There was no fancy sign .
She focused on the soul food she grew up eating , the kind of soul food her customers grew up eating .
" Food was a way for me to connect with my hometown and back into my community , " Williams said .
By 2017 Just Cookin ' was thriving , she said .
She heard rumors that a stadium would be built , but she was assured she might be able to stay and , at worst , it would mean moving elsewhere in the West End .
" I did n't grasp the fact that we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place , " Williams said .
When her landlord sold the building she and a few others were offered $20,000 .
She said OK .
" It 's like your whole life has been snatched away from you , " she said .
" Losing so much made cooking that much more personal .
It was like I lost everything and , I thought , I ca n't lose this .
"  Community activist Brian Garry rallied supporters to push FC Cincinnati and City Council members , who had stadium approval power , to do more .
He watched as Williams laid off staff .
He watched as she was forced to take a third-shift job at Kroger to support herself .
" I had a very strong feeling in my guts that we had to bring justice because this was so unjust for her , " Garry said .
Dozens of people showed up at Cincinnati City Council meetings to speak on Williams ' behalf .
Council listened .
Williams at first thought she would move elsewhere in the West End or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with help , there were no places she could afford .
Enter The Ropers , Gardenia and Jesse , who owned Roper 's Southern Cooking Restaurant .
They were looking to retire .
" We sat and we talked and I just felt like , ' This is it , ' " Williams said .
" Looking at the space , seeing all the equipment that the Ropers had left for me .
I knew that with the funds I was given , I can build on it .
"  She bought it last October .
The Ropers left tables and chairs and pots and pans .
All the building needed were Williams ' recipes and loving touch .
There 's a plan for a food truck too , but not yet , Williams said .
She dreams of turning her enterprise into a place where up-and-coming cooks can hone their craft alongside her .
Garry said the new Just Cookin ' will be like the old one .
" It 's much more meaningful and much deeper than simply going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about community .
"  Cincinnati City Councilman Greg Landsman , who pushed to get Williams city help , said Williams , " pushed through every obstacle , overcame every disadvantage , and never ever gave up .
Hers is a story of deep belief , perseverance and the power of hope and optimism , and it could not have come at a better time .
