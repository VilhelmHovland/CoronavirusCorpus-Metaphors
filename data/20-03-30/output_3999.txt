: Facebook  As the number of COVID-19 patients continues to dramatically climb , with a cure or vaccine yet to be discovered , and with negative vibes engulfing households around the clock , we will all be forgiven to feel this is just a bad dream .
But while we can not run away from the severity of the situation , there are reasons for optimism .
There is light at the end of the tunnel to warm our hearts .
In the wake of an invisible enemy that has infected more than 472,000 people and claimed over 21,000 lives worldwide , the palpable panic and desperation that has lately engulfed the country has been justifiable .
But with the first fully recovery on our land , and in the hands of local doctors , we have all the evidence we needed that the enemy we are facing is not insurmountable .
We now know the infection is not a death sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the clearest indication yet that Kenya will conquer this devastating global pandemic .
Assurances by the Health Ministry that most of the patients are doing well are equally a timely antidote to the prevalent panic .
More still , the COVID-19 crisis had demanded impeccable leadership .
Kenyans are lucky that Uhuru has risen to the occasion and boldly led the country in tackling this killer by the horns .
He has been a symbol of not just power but also national unity during this trying moment .
Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe , who many have described as ' heaven-sent ' , has also played a central role in instilling calm amid gloom .
One Kenya living in Germany early this week opined that Kenya was dealing with the crisis better than many European nations that are being ravaged by the disease after adopting a wait and see approach .
Such reassuring reports are critical at this time ; they make us know that we are in the right hands .
The measures announced by the president on Wednesday , March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronavirus marked yet another laudable presidential intervention that will help tame the virus .
Among others , the president scrapped tax for individuals earning up to KSh 24,000 and offered a raft of tax concessions on other individuals and business entities .
The Pay-As-You-Earn tax was reduced to 25 % , corporation tax to 35 % while turnover tax for micro and medium enterprises was reduced from 3 % to 1 % .
VAT was also reduced from 16 % to 14 % while Kenya Revenue Authority was directed to pay out VAT refunds amounting to KSh 10 billion .
There is no doubt that these measures directly apply to millions of Kenyans and will come handy in offering reprieve to a worried public that is facing unprecedented uncertainty amid tough economic times .
With the intervention , many individuals now have the calming assurance of an extra shilling to take them though the crisis .
The tax breaks , not to mention the lowering of CRB rates to 7 .
% , will also help keep companies afloat .
They will help business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This will be vital in ensuring traders continue to access essential goods and services they direly need .
The other measures imposed by the president , including a dusk-to-dawn curfew that adds to earlier public health guidelines such as social distancing and regular hand washing , will further go a long way in combating coronavirus .
It is now upon Kenyans to dutifully embrace these interventions in a national effort to overcome this unprecedented threat .
The World Health Organisation has warned that the coronavirus pandemic is " public enemy number one , " and made it clear that countries and their citizens have a fast-narrowing window of opportunity to limit the final death toll of the pandemic by taking aggressive actions to slow its spread .
It is a warning all Kenyans must heed by rallying behind Uhuru and devotedly playing their individual and collective roles if we are to win this war with the least , if any , casualties and agony .
