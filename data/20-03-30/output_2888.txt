Coronavirus : NAFDAC orders emergency stock of Chloroquine  The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control ( NAFDAC ) has ordered the manufacture of Chloroquine for an emergency stock and clinical trial for the treatment of coronavirus(COVID-19) .
The Director-General of NAFDAC , Prof .
Mojisola Adeyeye , made this known in a statement on Monday .
According to her , " In a very recent publication , chloroquine was reported in a press briefing by the State Council of China , indicating that chloroquine phosphate had demonstrated marked efficacy and acceptable safety in treating COVID-19 associated pneumonia in multi-center clinical trials conducted in China .
" The study involved 10 hospitals in Wuhan , Jingzhou , Guangzhou , Beijing , Shanghai , Chongqing and Ningbo , and 100 patients .
The investigators reported that chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control in inhibiting pneumonia associated with COVID-19 , and shortening the course of the disease .
" Chloroquine was discontinued in Nigeria many years ago for use as antimalarial because of the resistance that the parasite developed against the drug .
Therefore , sourcing the raw material -- active pharmaceutical ingredient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " About four weeks ago , I approached a local manufacturing company ( May and Baker ) , a member of Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Group of Manufacturing Association of Nigeria ( PMGMAN ) , whose flagship product in the past was chloroquine to make a batch of the drug for emergency stock .
The company had NAFDAC approval for the production of the drug as antimalarial many years ago before the discontinuation .
" The Managing Director expressed possible difficulty in getting the API due to the fact that the drug has been discontinued .
He called shortly after that he was able to get the API and was asked to manufacture a batch for emergency stock just in case more people become exposed and infected with the virus .
The batch has been manufactured and the company plans to make more batches if needed " .
" As stated in my press briefing on March 20 , 2020 , NAFDAC is giving expedited provisional approvals for the manufacture of any commodities for preventing contracting the disease ( sanitizers ) and drug or medical device that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic .
" The Agency had reduced the 120 working days for approval to 10 days due to the crisis .
The products should have been previously reported for clinical trial treatments in reputable scientific journals or technical literature as safe and effective .
" Other researchers in France , the US have used the drug for clinical trial treatment of COVID-19 and they reported effectiveness of the drug .
Lagos State will be starting a clinical trial on chloroquine to evaluate the effectiveness .
" Chloroquine works by increasing endosomal pH from the acidic environment required for virus/cell fusion , resulting in the inhibition of infection of SARS-CoV .
" It also interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor , angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 .
This may inhibit the virus-receptor binding and terminate the infection .
The antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine contribute to the efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients " .
NAFDAC , therefore , advises the public to desist from the use of chloroquine without the guidance of a medical doctor or clinician for cases of clinical trial treatment of COVID-19 .
