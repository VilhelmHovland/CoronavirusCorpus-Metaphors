Jeff Lowe , a central figure in the Netflix documentary phenomenon " Tiger King , " wanted to do business with the last Las Vegas Strip entertainer to use wild tigers in his act .
Dirk Arthur said no .
Lowe wanted to open this business at Pawn Plaza , owned by Rick Harrison of " Pawn Stars .
"  Harrison said no , too .
That was in June 2017 , as Lowe was scratching around the Pawn Plaza property , seeking to cash in on his adorable baby liger and pet tiger cub .
Lowe sought a partnership with Arthur for what was billed as an **25;2788;TOOLONG attraction , where tourists could have photos taken with these exotic creatures .
For the uninitiated , Lowe has become nationally famous/infamous in the seven-part " Tiger King " odyssey , which at this writing remains the No .
1 series on Netflix .
The documentary centers on the long-running feud between the stridently flamboyant Joseph Maldonado-Passage ( known in the series as Joe Exotic ) , owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma ; and Big Cat Rescue owner Carole Baskin .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among them Exotic 's polygamist same-sex marriage and farcical run for governor of Oklahoma .
Finally , Exotic is arrested and indicted by the FBI for attempting to hire a hit man to murder Baskin .
The Lowes -- Jeff and Lauren -- arrive midway through the project , with Jeff presented as an " angel " with resources to save Exotic 's faltering zoo .
In the series , Lowe is depicted as an entrepreneur out of South Carolina with suspect financial standing and questionable ethics .
One illuminating disclosure : Lowe tools around the zoo in a Ferrari , even while falling behind on payments on the car .
Las Vegas is shown as his playground , with obligatory footage of the Strip , and shots of him partying on the Fremont Street Experience and at Hakkasan Nightclub .
Lowe is shown convincing Exotic to hand over zoo operations , while also helping federal authorities assemble a case against Exotic .
The space in Las Vegas that Lowe envisioned was to be called Tiger Encounter , located on the second level of Pawn Plaza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snaking into the Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop .
The idea advanced to the point that Lowe 's wife , Lauren , posed with a tiger cub on Tiger Encounter promotional material .
The Lowes and Arthur also took a tour of The Strat for possible sites .
But their primary focus was to the north , at Pawn Plaza .
Arthur was a natural tie-in for such a concept , having headlined Las Vegas showrooms for more than three decades since debuting as a specialty act in " City Lights " at the Flamingo in 1985 .
Arthur most recently headlined with his half dozen exotic cats at the Westgate 's International Theater in 2016 .
He returned to the stage at the Westgate Cabaret from 2017-2018 , but without the animals .
Arthur still cares for his big cats on his property in the southwest .
Most recently he 's worked as a manager at Houdini 's magic shop at Circus Circus while restarting his stage career .
" I was open to ideas , sure , and Jeff saw you could make a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourists could have their pictures taken with the babies , " Arthur says .
" We looked at the units there , I did a bunch of research into the sanitation requirements and what permits we would need .
"  Permits are vital in Arthur 's world .
His career depends on legal compliance .
" What it came down to was , I would be able to house a few of the cats on my property as long as we were in strict accordance with Clark County use permits , " Arthur says .
" There 's no way in a million years I would do it any other way .
"  Arthur made that provision clear to Lowe .
" Then this guy started getting kind of crazy , he said , ' I do n't need to get a permit to have a tiger ; I can just bring one in , ' " Arthur says .
" I said , ' You definitely need to have a permit to do this in Clark County .
Trust me on this .
' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in revisiting his time in Vegas : " We have talked to so many media outlets that we 're talked out at this time .
" Earlier in the day , he and Lauren appeared on the Instagram version of " Lights Out With David Spade .
"  Harrison , who is always seeking ways to expand the " Pawn Stars " empire , enlisted Pawn Plaza and Gold &amp; Silver General Manager Andy Zimmerman to review Lowe 's concept .
It took one meeting between Arthur , Zimmerman and the Lowes at Pawn Plaza to know the idea was stalled .
" I remember talking about it and thinking it sounded interesting , but once we were told it was n't going to work out by our contact ( Arthur ) , we moved on to other interested tenants to fill the spaces , " says Harrison , who is more than happy with the tenant who eventually moved in to the space -- the Rev .

Lowe 's exotic animal experience , where he hauled tourists along the Strip so they could play with the cubs , is shown briefly in " Tiger King .
"  Lowe also rented a home on Natalia Court near Tropical Parkway and Rainbow Boulevard in North Las Vegas , another business where guests could mingle with the cubs .
The entire operation was halted in November 2017 , when Lowe was arrested at his home by Clark County Animal Control officers for keeping and staging the animals without proper permits .
In a plea deal to avoid jail time , Lowe agreed to pay a $10,000 fine and surrender his tiger , liger and lemur ( his court appearance , too , is featured in the documentary ) .
Those animals , now adults , are being kept at a private exotic-animal habitat in Pahrump owned by Zuzana Kukol and Scott Shoemaker .
" They came to us very sick , with many problems , bloody diarrhea , urinary-tract infections , pancreatic problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kukol says .
" We have all the proper licensing through the county .
That 's why Animal Control asked us to keep them .
"  Meantime , the Lowes have taken over G .
Zoo operations , renaming the attraction the Greater Wynnewood Animal Park -- and the place is still open even during the coronavirus outbreak -- and are planning a new zoo , the Oklahoma Zoo , in Thackerville .
But do n't expect any further business forays , or even pleasure trips , to Vegas .
According to city of Las Vegas ' marshal 's office documents , Lowe is a wanted man in Las Vegas with multiple warrants out for his arrest , having not paid his four $2,500 court-ordered fines .
The marshal 's office notice warns , " DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DETAIN THIS INDIVIDUAL , CONTACT YOUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY .
