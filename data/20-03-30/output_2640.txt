The Refuge of Nature  Finding solace in the natural and sensory worlds during a pandemic .
Synesthete artist Carrie Barcomb has always been a naturalist .
The Brandywine Valley , PA resident is taking solace during the coronavirus pandemic by spending even sweeter , sensory moments out of doors .
Her reflections on the Earth in this historic time struck me as something which might inspire others finding themselves in the netherworld depicted in her underpainting , " Shelter , " to take a walk ( while safely social distancing ) , and perhaps see , hear , taste , smell and feel things as never before .
How has nature has come to mean even more to you lately ?  CB : As a child , I always relished time spent outdoors , where I wandered wild forests and fields for hours .
There was always something new to discover -- a bird or plant to observe .
I enjoyed every tree and plant , the changing seasons , and feeling the excitement after a storm to see where the stream may have rerouted due to debris or an overturned tree .

As an adult , leading a routine hectic life , my time in nature was spent on scheduled trips to explore this country and others , to places of gorgeous and exotic landscapes .
This global pandemic has halted everything .
Everyone has come to a grinding halt .
Amidst this devastating crisis , we are challenged to cope with and reassess our lives .
My isolation has forced me outdoors , yes , but also back into the woods .
My son now has time to explore the woods freely without external pressures , even declaring that here in the forest , " the trees are boss .
" My teenage daughter is also finding joy from simply walking across giant felled trees .
It has made me mindful of my ancestors who farmed up until the 20th century .
I appreciate stories where my grandmother used folk wisdom to predict the weather .
Although she worked in a city , she would travel to her family farm in the summertime to plant enough crops to feed her family for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rethink food supply and materialism , how instead of simply recycling a plastic bottle , I 'll reuse it for frozen orange juice .

Like many of my friends , I 've also started looking into planning a garden .
I bought seeds from a local Amish woman , including a rare heat-tolerant " deer tongue lettuce , " circa 1840 .
My neighbor and I are even considering raising chickens together .
This crisis has led me to appreciate nature as vital and important , as life-sustaining and for mental well-being .
Nature is more beautiful and essential to me today than ever before .
Can you tell me about your sensory impressions of nature ?  CB : With each passing mild winter , I feel the pulse and vibration of the grand old trees around me grow weaker .
Sometimes I wonder if my own senses are weakening from age , or if the energies in this world are fading .
Maybe both .
On a visceral level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enjoy observing the slow steady rhythm of the earth .
There is a deep , low hum , that resonates across the land , ringing up around us , and up into the sky .
The sky above is a giant dome of brilliant sparkles , like the sun 's hot surface but in cool , silvery blues -- something known as the Blue Field Entopic Phenomenon .
In recent years , I 've noticed our skies have become dulled , saturated with an acidic umber haze from pollution that settles across the horizon .

You have keen personal observations about Earth due to your virtuoso senses .
Can you share ?  CB : Despite the miraculous wonders of our world , I see troubling signs , from both a naturalist and a synesthetic perspective .
The difficult aspect of nature , which holds the greatest concern to me is the changes to our air quality .
Scientists collect data showing we are living in a hotter climate , where our air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a toxic stew of microplastics and other debris from unprecedented wildfires in the Arctic , Amazon , and Australia .
Polluted ash has been released across the globe , leaving our air smelling foul , and even acidic-tasting .
My area is especially wrought with harsh synthetic smells from decades of industrialism , where smells of diesel and gas are widely reported across large geographical areas , which has happened so frequently our local government now works to record these mysterious odors .
The day after a refinery explosion in the summer of 2019 , I awoke to air charged with a harsh electrical and caustic odor for days .
I 've now found there is a constant acidic odor ever-present outdoors .
The air sometimes tastes and even feels gritty and abrasive .
It 's sometimes difficult for me to remind myself to overcome and adapt to this invasive intruder , and sometimes I find it difficult to stay outdoors , and wonder how nature , as we know it , can survive .
As a naturalist , it is difficult observing changes .
In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air have increased , along with increased rainfall and with it , flash flooding .
This flooding scours entire communities of microorganisms from stream banks .
Delicate species are washed away , unable to rebuild .
This strain reduces the resiliency and biodiversity of our environment .
Synesthetically , there are days I have now observed my area covered in a haze of dry brown dust .
I have seen times where our wild , wicked storms can also include days of extreme dead silence .
In the forest , everything is absolutely still , devoid of light and color forms .
The trees are exhausted , their bark is brittle and cracked .
This arid air is disrupting the beautiful patterns I once regularly observed .
In April 2019 , I observed a dreadful fungal attack on insects which were being eaten alive from the inside out turning them to crisp ashen corpses .
The fungus felt as if it was part of this greater energetic brown fog .
In October 2019 , we had a cool morning which gave way to an intense 90-degree afternoon heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly preserved , air-dried .
As if they were caught in the sudden heat , their poses frozen in time , like they were trying to move .
On March 21 , my daughter and I were walking through the forest and she discovered a snake emerging from its hole .
As is typical after hibernation , it moved sluggishly -- undulating back and forth in a wave-like motion .
However , it did n't look healthy .
Its head jerked suddenly and it forcefully hit its head on the ground , like it had a stroke .
Half its body was dried and withered .
It was sad witnessing a young snake emerging into spring to die .
Although nature is cruel , seeing animals struggle this way , out of sync with established cycles , are for me also devastating signs of demise .

Is there a way forward ?  CB : With this virus , humans are now forced to pause for our own survival .
Rachel Carson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask yourself , " What if I had never seen this before ? What if I knew I would never see it again ? " We must remember that nature is essential to our living .
For me , the air we breathe appears not flowing and harmonious but like a chaotic disruptive dusty heat mirage .
With this subtle decay and shift of established energy patterns along with a recent deadly flu season and the current aggressive virus , I am not surprised to hear that coronavirus patients reporting having reduced or completely lost their basic sense of taste and smell .
We must learn to clear this " fog " and reconnect patterns .
It will take coordination and strength to adapt to and endure these global changes .
