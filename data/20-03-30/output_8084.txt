The NCAA 's decision to give a season of eligibility back to spring sport student-athletes whose seasons were cut short by the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic was met Monday with relief and appreciation from the Ragin ' Cajuns .
The ruling applies to all athletes , not just seniors .
It also extends an athlete 's eligibility clock beyond the usual five years to play four seasons , and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you @NCAA " UL junior pitcher Brock Batty tweeted .
Canceling the season was especially tough for UL 's softball team , which was ranked No .
1 in national RPI ratings when the play was halted earlier this month .
UL athletic director Bryant Maggard was happy with the NCAA 's eligibility ruling Monday .

" This is a great day , in my opinion , for collegiate athletics , in the sense that the student-athletes will have a choice to make , " Cajuns athletic director Bryan Maggard told The Daily Advertiser in a telephone interview .
Although no one is obligated to come back , the vote by the NCAA 's Division I Council allows schools to provide the additional season of competition and extend the athletes ' period of eligibility .
Baseball roster limits also will be waived next season , but -- according to Maggard -- they 'll be put back into place after then .
The council also adjusted financial aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to account for incoming recruits and seniors who decide to stay .
Baseball , for instance , currently is limited to the equivalent of just 11 .
full scholarships .
It 's up to individual schools , however , to decide how much each athletic aid each senior will be provided ; the amount can be the same as this school year , a lesser amount or nothing at all .
" The Council 's decision gives individual schools the flexibility to make decisions at a campus level , " Council chair M .
Grace Calhoun , Penn 's athletics director , said in a statement released by the NCAA .
Maggard suggested it will up to individual coaches to decide if aid will be fully matched , whether that 's baseball , softball , golf , tennis or track and field .
" We would be committed to doing that , should that be the desire , " he said .
" But .
the head coaches of those sports will certainly visit with their student-athletes between now and the end of the semester .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie .
"  That 's typical after any season .
" But I will anticipate that should a student-athlete want to return , they 're gon na have the opportunity to do so , Maggard said .
" But we 'll just have to see where the aid falls in those discussions .
"  " The interest and well-being of our Sun Belt student-athletes are at the core of our mission , " Gill said .
" We believe this is the correct course of action because it 's another opportunity for our student-athletes to have a complete competitive season .
