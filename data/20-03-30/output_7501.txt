Steam game updates changing to help with bandwidth during coronavirus  Steam 's under strain and this should help .
Steam game updates will change to help preserve bandwidth during the COVID-19 coronavirus crisis .
" For games that have n't been played recently , Steam has already been scheduling updates for the next off-peak local time period , " a new blog post reads .
" Beginning this week , we are now spreading these updates out over several more days .
Only games played within the last 3 days will be updated immediately .
" As always , the game will begin updating immediately if you request to play it , and you can always initiate an update ( or pause it indefinitely ) through the Download Manager .
We 're also looking into additional solutions to help on our side .
"  Valve also advises that players manage their own bandwidth by scheduling auto-update windows and to choose to disable auto-updates on specific games .
