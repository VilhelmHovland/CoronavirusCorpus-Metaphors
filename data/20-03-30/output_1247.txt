The UK 's coronavirus death toll will continue to rise as the outbreak moves towards an expected peak in two to three weeks , scientists have warned .
More than 1,000 people have died after contracting the virus , the Department of Health in England revealed on Saturday .
Covid-19 related deaths in the UK jumped from 759 to 1,019 - an increase of 260 and by far the biggest day-on-day rise since the outbreak began .
Brendan Wren , Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine , said the report of the further UK deaths " approximates to a person dying every five minutes in our hospitals from Covid-19 " .
He added : " With the doubling rate of infection every four/five days and the epidemic expected to peak in two/three weeks it is possible that we may get to much higher levels in the coming weeks before we see if the social distancing interventions have an impact .
