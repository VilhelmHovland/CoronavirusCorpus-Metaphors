Our world has changed immensely in the last few weeks but amid the upheaval and distress , there are reasons to believe we can emerge from the crisis with some human qualities enhanced , writes Matthew Syed .
A few years ago , Michael Michalko , a former US army officer , came up with a fascinating idea to sharpen creativity .
He called it " assumption reversal " .
You take the core notions in any context , subject , discipline and then , well , turn them on their head .
So , suppose you are thinking of starting a restaurant ( obviously not possible right now ! ) .
The first assumption might be : " restaurants have menus " .
The reversal would be : " restaurants have no menus " .
This provokes the idea of a chef informing each customer what he bought that day at market , allowing them to select a customised dish .
The point is not that this will turn out to be a workable scheme , but that by disrupting conventional thought patterns , it might lead to new associations and ideas .
Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering a new taxi company .
The first assumption might be : " taxi companies own cars " .
The reversal would be : " taxi companies own no cars " .
Twenty years ago , that might have sounded crazy .
Today , the largest taxi company that has ever existed does n't own cars : Uber .
Now we are living through a disruption ( you might even call it a reversal ) of unprecedented scale .
The coronavirus has turned our lives upside down and , although we hope to return to some version of normality in the coming months , it is probable that nothing will quite be the same again .
Many have lost their livelihoods and businesses , and there is no diminishing the difficulties - emotional and financial - this has brought in its wake .
But amid the darkness , there are also opportunities .
Opportunities to reimagine the world and one 's place within it .
Reversal techniques are typically used by people working in the creative industries to come up with new products or innovations .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silver lining or two amid the grey clouds .
Take education .
This has traditionally been conceived as a place where children absorb knowledge .
In Hard Times by Charles Dickens , Mr Gradgrind says " give me facts , sir ! " .
Education has , of course , moved on since then , but there is still a tendency to see classrooms as forums for imparting formal knowledge .
So how about this for a reversal : " Education is not about imparting knowledge .
"  This provokes the idea of helping children develop skills that are not drawn from traditional disciplines .
Softer skills .
Skills that are important in the real world but which teachers struggle to find time to teach because of the demands of the curriculum .
Improvising , for example .
Debating .
Thinking on one 's feet .
Working in teams .
Most parents ( if they are anything like me ) will have realised how difficult it is to teach kids at home .
But here are some " rebel " ideas that emerge from assumption reversal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , pick up a card lying face down , and then turn it over to reveal a topic .
Their task is then to turn around to the rest of the room and speak on this topic for 60 seconds .
I tried it with my daughter ( seven ) and the first time , she froze .
She had the topic " Paddington Bear " and she managed five seconds before trailing off .
But by the second time ( the topic was " tennis " ) she got to the end , albeit in a stumbling way , and by the fourth attempt ( on " wildlife " ) , she was fluent throughout .
She is learning the art of improvisation .
I also asked her and her brother to write down their biggest failure and what they learned from it .
The idea was to shift the concept of failure from something stigmatising to part and parcel of how we grow .
We shared stories of famous people who had failed .
A JK Rowling quote was very helpful : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live without failing at something , unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case , you fail by default .
"  These are just reversal ideas related to education , but I am sure you can think of dozens of other contexts in which this technique could work .
The point of the education example is n't to stop kids imbuing formal knowledge , but to find ways to supplement this with other skills ( and have fun at the same time ) .
Innovative schools are already trialling some of these ideas .
Another positive that might emerge from this crisis is a surge in kindness .
In the UK , more than 700,000 volunteers stepped forward to help the NHS , and the nation showed its appreciation to carers by applauding in unison .
Kindness is often considered ( particularly by economists ) to be a short-lived anomaly .
But I wonder if kindness can become a more sustainable part of our societies , particularly when people realise that altruism and self-interest are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 600 medical students , which found that the selfish ones - people who focused on their own progress , and cared little for others - performed very well in their first year .
These " takers " were good at extracting information , and by offering little in return they were able to focus on their own progress .
Those who were more generous with their time and were willing to offer insights to their fellow students , the " givers " , got left behind .
But here is the curious thing .
By the second year , the kinder cohort had caught up , and by the third year had overtaken their peers .
Indeed , by the final year , the givers had gained significantly higher grades .
Indeed , a kinder attitude was a more powerful predictor of school grades than the effect of smoking on lung cancer rates .
What was going on ? The givers had n't changed , but the structure of the programme had shifted .
As the psychologist Adam Grant has written : " As students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into clinical rotations and patient care .
The further they advance , the more their success depends on teamwork and service .
Whereas takers sometimes win in independent roles where performance is only about individual results , givers thrive in an interdependent roles where collaboration matters .
"  This is a finding that keeps re-emerging in social science : people with a giving approach are flourishing in a world of interdependency .
The evidence also shows that the most successful givers are strategic , seeking out diversity but cutting off selfish people who seek to exploit them .
As one researcher put it : " a giving attitude is a powerful asset when allied to social intelligence .
"  I do n't wish to diminish the scale of our present difficulties , but neither do I believe that the future is inherently gloomy .
A world with more kindness and creativity is one to look forward to .
We would be reaching out for new solutions , rebelling against outmoded ideas , but in a spirit of collaboration , helping us to become successful .
As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly successful people have three things in common : motivation , ability and opportunity .
but there is a fourth ingredient : success depends heavily on how we approach our interactions with other people .
Do we try to claim as much value for ourselves as we can , or do we contribute value ? It turns out that these choices have staggering consequences for success .
