The show must go on : Coronavirus changes Q-102 's ' Jeff &amp; Jenn ' production  You know Jeff Thomas and Jenn Jordan .
If you do n't , then you have probably heard their voices if you listen to Q-102 radio channel .
They have been a part of our morning drive in Cincinnati for more than 15 years as hosts of " Jeff &amp; Jenn : Cincinnati 's Morning Show .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , producer , and Tim Timmerman , fellow DJ .
In case you have n't been in a radio studio lately , they can be small .
Too small to hold four people and comply with the rules of social distancing in a time of the COVID-19 virus .
The global pandemic has changed the way we all work , live and play .
So , while you will still hear their voices , the four will no longer be in the studio together for the foreseeable future .
Their solution : Jeff is the only person who reports for duty at their Reading Road studio .
The others report from home .
We do n't know the difference , but it matters to them when they are accustomed to wordplay and seeing one another move around .
The threat of the novel corona virus has forced the Jeff and Jenn Morning Show on Q102 to go remote .
( Photo : Provided )  " We 're used to vibing off each other 's facial expressions and body language and that 's harder to read via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home can also present distractions that mentally take you out of the conversation .
But we 're in the same boat as a lot of people who are just trying to adapt to a new normal .
"  Video conferencing is the new normal , even in radio .
The use of technology such as Zoom and WebEx are must-haves if you want to communicate with teams at home .
In a way , radio pioneered the remote report because signals can reach hundreds of thousands of listeners .
In this case , essentially a talk-show format where the main two hosts have worked in the same room for more than 20 years , this is very different .
" It 's definitely different to not be in the same space , " she said .
" But I 've done this before when I was on bed rest with a high-risk pregnancy .
I did my part of the broadcast from home for six months .
And that was really hard .
" The show at that time was new , and we were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt terribly disconnected and alone .
This time around we have video chatting and other ways to talk to each other between breaks .
It 's a lot easier .
And , I 'm actually enjoying it this time .
"  Ever the optimist , Jenn is looking on the bright side of things .
She sees this new normal as an opportunity for all of them to become better communicators .
" We have to listen more closely .
We do n't have the body language and eye contact to depend on .
Listening is a skill we can all get better at , especially those of us in the media .
"  Jennifer Fritsch , known by her last name on air , tries to keep from being distracted .
" We are definitely feeling the energy of the other person through the video chat , but there definitely are more distractions .
I find myself staring at the video the entire time we 're talking on the air .
"  Timmerman , whose " Snack Time with Tim " segment is popular , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We definitely have done different types of conversations , topics , social media content .
We 've had some really fun shows filled with lots of laughs from our home studios living in the moment , but also have times where it 's more difficult to connect with each other , " he said .
Many of us , myself included , are juggling children , pets and homeschooling as we seek to protect ourselves and others .
Home has become a classroom , a workplace and even a radio studio that is keeping our mornings as familiar as possible .
We are all fellow travelers .
In a world that is temporarily topsy-turvy , knowing these guys are going all in to keep our mornings normal is a good thing .
A very good thing .
