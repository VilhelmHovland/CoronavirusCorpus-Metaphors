Stranded Wanaka pair ' frustrated ' with lack of Govt support  Conor Hayes ( left ) and Caleb Nicol have been travelling around South America over the past three months .
Photo : Supplied  Desperate Kiwis stranded in Peru watching citizens from all over the world being repatriated by their governments say they are " frustrated " at New Zealand 's lack of support .
Two dozen Kiwis had paid over NZ$5500 each for seats on a charter flight home via Australia , but were told two days before it left they could not board as there were no connecting flights to New Zealand the same day .
But this morning , hours before the charter flight would leave without them , they received an apology email stating there had been a mix up - but they would not be put back on the flight .
NZers in Peru : we are aware of the developments with the Chimu flight and understand how disappointing this is .
We continue to work hand in hand with Australian embassy in Lima on future options for you to leave .
We know you are there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incredibly frustrating , " Caleb , 23 of Wanaka , told the New Zealand Herald from his hostel in Lima .
" Our Government told us to get flights on this plane , and then to have it stuff up like this .
"  To make matters worse , over the past few weeks Nicol and travel mate Conor Hayes , 23 also from Wanaka , have seen citizens from countries the world over fly home with government assistance .
" We are stoked for them , but each time it really hurts and feels like our government has just left us here .
"  There are about 90 New Zealanders registered with SafeTravel as being in Peru currently .
Most of them are trying to get back to New Zealand , but have been stuck since the country went into lockdown due to Covid-19 on March 16 , and shut its borders .
The lockdown was initially meant to end on April 1 , but has been extended to April 12 , leaving stranded Kiwis increasingly concerned about their situations .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months through South America and were due to fly home on March 19 , but on March 16 were given 10 hours warning the country was going into lockdown and borders closing .
They got straight on a five-hour bus to Lima to fight for one of the last flights out of the country , but their efforts were to no avail and they have been stuck in a hostel in the capital city ever since .
" There has been all this talk of Kiwis having a window to get home - we never had a chance .
"  Australian tour company Chimu Adventures has organised charter flights with the Australian government to return its customers , offering up extra spaces to other stranded travellers .
Source : NZ Herald  New Zealanders have also been encouraged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to seek seats on these flights as a means to return home .
Nicol and Hayes both bought seats for the flight departing on March 29 , at $5500 each , along with two dozen other Kiwis .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't board the flight , as on March 31 when it arrived in Sydney there were no ongoing flights that day to New Zealand , as required by new Australian border controls .
Nicol spent the next day working with a travel agent and discovered there was in fact a flight on March 31 with airline LATAM .
They passed this detail on to Chimu , but never received a response .
" We accepted that it was not legally possible for us to transit through Australia , " Nicol said .
" We were disappointed but had done all we could .
"  But on Sunday morning ( Peru time ) , just hours before the charter flight was to depart they received an email from Chimu saying they could have boarded the flight after all .
" I feel it is my duty to let you know personally that it has come to our attention that LATAM do now intend to operate a flight between Sydney and Auckland on Tuesday , " the email read .
" When we made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the information we had available to us .
"  Meanwhile , their hostel continued to empty all around them as citizens returned to their home countries .
" Four Australians from our hostel are on that flight , " Nicol said .
" The German government has taken their citizens home , along with 27 Israelis - their governments worked together to help their people leave .
" I said goodbye to our Irish and English friends from the hostel this morning .
" The UK government has paid to take their citizens home .
" The Dutch people here are packing their bags awaiting a flight that departs in the next two days , and the Americans are leaving as more flights take them home each day .
" Meanwhile , we sit waiting .
"  Caleb Nicol ( left ) and Conor Hayes are both stuck in a hostel in Lima , Peru , due to a Covid-19 lockdown .
Photo : Supplied  The last email from Mfat told them " Government-assisted flights can not be relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money " , said Nicol .
" While I ' hunker down ' , hostels throughout Lima are being raided by military and police .
" Hostels are being shut down and the remaining tourists are scrambling to try and find new accommodation where they can feel safe and stay healthy .
" Three hostels have confirmed cases of Covid-19 .
" The people in these hostels have been told they can not leave their dorm room for up to three months .
" Their hostels are being guarded by the police and they have been told they will be put in prison if they are caught attempting to leave the hostel .
Nicol said he did n't blame Chimu Adventures for the mix-up , which was going out of its way to assist them , but the New Zealand and Australian governments needed to work together to bring their citizens home .
" Our Government turns a blind eye to its citizens who are literally begging for their help .
Other countries are getting their people back to where they belong .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mfat has been approached for comment .
Chimu Adventures co-founder Chad Carey told the Herald it was a " very difficult situation " with information changing constantly and they made the call based on safety .
" Our travellers ' safety is our first priority , including being concerned about the possibility of people being left stranded at the airport in Lima .
" In this case , what seemed to be fact on one day , changed the next , after the deadline had passed , as we are seeing this in many events and situations around the world .
"  A message on Mfat 's SafeTravel website reads : " We recognise that not all New Zealanders who want to return home are able to do so .
New Zealanders who can not return home for the time being should take steps to stay safely where they are .
" The Government is committed to helping New Zealanders overseas where we can .
But the international situation is complex and changing quickly , and some things are out of our control .
