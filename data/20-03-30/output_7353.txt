OPINION  From the editor : At The Detroit News , we 're committed to reliable information  In these unprecedented times , you want and need reliable information .
We 're committed to giving it to you .
That 's why the controversy surrounding a Detroit News opinion piece last week deserves analysis and explanation .
In the end , it illustrates the essential role that newspapers play in providing checks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , editor and publisher of The Detroit News ( Photo : John T .
Greilick )  Her well-documented commentary reflected on a letter issued by the state 's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs ( LARA ) to pharmacists and doctors , warning about allegations of doctors prescribing and hoarding two controversial medications -- hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine -- for the treatment of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
These two drugs were top of mind last week , as President Donald Trump hailed their potential and his chief infectious diseases adviser warned that they were not yet medically proven .
LARA 's letter , however , went well beyond a prohibition of hoarding .
" Prescribing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine without further proof of efficacy for treating COVID-19 or with the intent to stockpile the drug may create a shortage " for patients with ailments for which the drug is approved , the letter said ( emphasis added ) .
" Reports of this conduct will be evaluated and may be further investigated for administrative action .
" Again , " the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been proven scientifically or medically to treat COVID-19 .
"  There was no question of the facts .
Hoekstra 's opinion was equally clear : Threatening doctors and pharmacists against using the drugs was a quizzical , heavy-handed approach that could cost lives .
Hospitals , she pointed out , already were using these drugs to treat COVID-19 .
Unsurprisingly , the column was picked up by other outlets and on social media channels , with many assigning their own political spin .
Four full days after LARA 's initial letter ( but less than a day after the column was published ) , the department ostensibly clarified itself .
In a second letter , it repeated the warning against hoarding and included statements from medical associations .
But it never backtracked on the threat to physicians and pharmacists about prescribing these drugs for COVID-19 , sowing continued confusion .
On Monday , LARA alerted its licensees that the FDA late last week authorized the emergency use of these drugs to fight the virus .
It took an explanation from Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor to issue the original letter to make clear that people should n't hoard these drugs .
" We needed something to prevent cloroquine from becoming the next toilet paper , " Shirkey told me .
" I quickly requested of her staff that they put something out , and somehow in the translation it was prohibiting use of these drugs -- and that was n't the intent .
"  " I was grateful for your article .
because it was the first thing that alerted me that it was screwed up .
"  In the meantime , the governor 's office took umbrage with the piece and The News .
" You know , one wacky idea would be to just .
not run crazy s--- on your opinion page during the worst global pandemic in 100 years , " Whitmer 's communications director Zack Pohl wrote me Saturday .
" What qualifications does Kathy Hoekstra have ? Is she a lawyer ? Is she a physician ? Who pays her salary ? What exactly is her expertise here ? If you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect your readers to ? And that seems like a problem .
"  The problem was neither the credentials of the writer nor the opinion she expressed .
Nor was it The News ' standards for allowing her to express them .
This was not fake news , as critics of the piece alleged .
It was public service journalism .
LARA 's original letter created fear among physicians desperate to treat patients dying of the virus .
That confusion was caused by miscommunication between branches of state government .
It had the real potential to cost the lives of real Michiganians in real time .
And it has been clarified because of that opinion piece in The News .
We 'll take the heat , gladly , because that 's exactly the kind of thing we 're here to do .
