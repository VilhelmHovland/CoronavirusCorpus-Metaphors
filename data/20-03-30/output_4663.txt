Coronavirus : Urgent ICU investment needed ahead of peak  Academic modelling suggests efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus in NSW could delay the peak period of infection until October but there would still be a massive shortage of ICU beds without " urgent investment " .
If restrictions on movement reduce the reproduction rate to 1 .
- meaning each individual with the COVID-19 infects 1 .
others - the state 's ICU capacity could still be overwhelmed later this year , an article published in the Medical Journal of Australia says .
" Under the scenario of increased social isolation , the peak infection will shift to early October and peak ICU utilisation will shift to mid-November and would be around one-third the size of the business-as-usual peak , " the authors wrote in an article published yesterday evening .
At that point , about 5 per cent of the population could be symptomatic , with more than 14,000 people in hospital across NSW and 5100 patients in intensive care .
An urgent expansion in ICU beds in NSW is needed to meet an expected October peak of the virus , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 585 per cent of the state 's baseline ICU capacity prior to the epidemic , " write the article 's authors , who are from the University of Sydney , Monash University and James Cook University .
The infectious diseases modellers note that prior to the current coronavirus epidemic , there were 874 intensive care beds in NSW .
They argue that even with a doubling of existing services " the available supply is estimated to be substantially less than the peak requirement " .
Hospitals and ICU facilities " are likely to be overwhelmed unless transmission can be reduced significantly " , the authors suggest , arguing there 's a need for " urgent investment in the resources required to support surge capacity for critical care services " .
Without social distancing measures , peak transmission would be much earlier , in late-June , with peak hospitalisation in early July , the modelling suggests .
NSW Health have cautioned the public not to get too excited over the recent drop in COVID-19 cases in the state .
( 9News )  Sixteen per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people hospitalised and close to 11,800 UCI beds needed .
That 's 1349 per cent of baseline capacity .
The authors admit , however , that their " compartmental model " approach has several limitations .
It depends upon assumptions including the current reproduction rate of the infection , which remains uncertain .
The authors acknowledge the trajectory of the epidemic will be highly dependent upon the effectiveness of mitigation strategies .
" The present report does not estimate the effect of more intensive suppression strategies which would be likely to reduce the peak ICU requirement , " they write .

The NSW government is imploring the public to practice self-isolation measures as the state 's tally of COVID-19 cases continue to be the worst in the country .
