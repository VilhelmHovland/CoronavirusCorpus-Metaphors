" I think it 's amazing , " Andrew Ambas of Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce says about $2,500 tab opened up at the restaurant by Canadiens defenceman Jeff Petry and his wife , Julie , for health-care workers .
" It 's really nice what they did for ( the hospital ) staff , but it 's also really nice what they did for us .
" Allen McInnis / Montreal Gazette  Business was booming at the N .
location of Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce on Sunday .
That was unusual since the restaurant -- like just about every other eatery in the city -- has had its business devastated by the COVID-19 crisis .
Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce remains open , but only for take-out and delivery .
The burgers were flying out the door Sunday because Canadiens defenceman Jeff Petry and his wife , Julie , announced on Instagram Saturday that they were opening a $2,500 tab at both Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce in N .
and Mandy 's restaurant in Westmount to provide free meals for health-care workers .
Late Monday afternoon , Nastassia Subban -- the sister of former Canadiens defenceman P .
Subban -- confirmed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donating money to provide meals from Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce free of charge to workers at the Montreal Children 's Hospital at lunch time on each of the four Fridays in April .
Subban now plays for the New Jersey Devils .
Both restaurant tabs opened up by the Petrys were used up in one day .
Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce owner Jonathan Dresner said there were between 200 and 250 health-care professionals who came in to take advantage of the generous offer from the hockey player and his wife .
" It was a $2,500 tab and for all I knew that could 've lasted the week , " Dresner said .
" But it went so fast .
It was crazy .
We ended up having to bring in three extra staffers .
I think it 's amazing .
It 's really nice what they did for ( the hospital ) staff , but it 's also really nice what they did for us .
It 's extremely hard ( for us ) .
"  It was a similar scene at Mandy 's on Sunday .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mandy 's co-owner Mandy Wolfe said .
" It just goes to show how many people are out there working ( in Montreal hospitals ) doing this heroic front-line work and looking for any gestures of kindness and generosity .
We think it 's fantastic ( that the Petrys did this ) .
We think it 's such a representation of Montreal love and support and unity and community .
"  Petry wrote on Instagram : " Julie and I are constantly thinking of all those on the front lines helping take care of others during this unthinkable time all over the world , but especially back in Montreal .
They have taken such good care of us &amp; our kids over the years we ca n't help but have those doctors , nurses and staff members on our hearts during this unfathomable time .
"  Wolfe and her sister Rebecca , who own Mandys together , have been going themselves to Montreal-area hospitals every Monday , Wednesday and Friday over the past couple of weeks to deliver free salads to staff .
( This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're giving them away , " Wolfe said .
" We 'd go every day if we could afford to .
But I think everyone is operating at a loss right now .
I think the opportunity to be able to feed people who are working overtime , who are exhausted and stressed and worried , to be able to offer them some kind of kindness and nutrition ( is great ) .
We 're saying : ' We love you , we thank you for everything you 're doing .
' It 's a small small token , but it makes us feel like we 're part of the solution .
"  Last week , two Montreal women separately called up Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce and made $500 orders of burgers and side orders , which were delivered to staff at Montreal hospitals .
On Thursday , Rina Fisher had $500 worth of burgers delivered to the people working in the intensive-care unit of the Jewish General Hospital , one of the busiest ICUs in the province for COVID-19 patients .
Fisher 's daughter , Jackie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to her death from cancer five years ago .
" I 'm sure that ( the hospital staff ) do n't have too much time on their hands to look after themselves , " Fisher said .
" It 's also in honour of Jackie .
"  On Friday , Kimmy Chedel followed suit and had $500 worth of Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce hamburgers and side orders delivered to emergency-room staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital at the McGill University Health Centre Glen site .
" I do n't know what else to do , " Chedel said .
" I 'm here in Montreal and all I can think of is my friends who work in the medical field and I feel helpless .
So I felt at least we can come together as a community and send them food , maybe on a regular basis .
"  Andrew Ambas , manager of the N .
location of Notre-Boeuf-de-Gr ? ce , was the one who delivered the two orders to the Jewish General and Royal Victoria hospitals .
" I got to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were with this generosity , " Ambas said .
