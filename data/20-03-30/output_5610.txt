The 21-day lockdown was n't a great start for e-commerce service companies .
Despite central government asking states to allow e-commerce operations to run during the lockdown , there were several disruptions in operations and delivery on ground .
Disruptions led to a lot of wastage of perishable items , with startups like MilkBasket being forced to dump 15,000 litres of milk and 10,000 kg of fruits and vegetables .
" Due to the harassment faced by our employees , we were in complete lockdown .
While the intent for the lockdown is right but the message that went out to the frontline , the constable on the street is that no one should come out .
As a result , blue collar employees and our delivery staff were beaten up on the street before they could even show their ID , " said Anant Goel , co-founder &amp; CEO , Milkbasket  It is not just MilkBasket but Ninjacart , a startup that connects farmers with kirana stores , also said that they faced similar issues on ground .
" We had to dump 20,000 kgs of vegetables in Chennai today .
We have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities as we are still waiting for clear directives , " said Thirukumaran Nagarajan , CEO &amp; Co-founder , Ninjacart  While startups iron out issues with local authorities , they will soon be faced by another road block .
When in crisis , people often revert down to Maslow ' hierarchy of needs to basic desires such as health , safety and security .
These reports are sending out waves of panic among essential services staff .
" Employees themselves are scared to come out to work as local panchayat are not letting people move out before the coronavirus scare .
The bigger challenge now will be to get people back into work because of the social pressure , " added Goel .
It 's not just panchayats , even housing societies , landlords and PG owners are raising concerns and are against people stepping out of their home to do their job .
There is some relief for these players as central government has taken note of these concerns and is working with states to address challenges , Goyal narrated .

Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant told CNBC-TV18 that he personally intervened to make sure Grofers ' operations were up and running and ensured that their services resumed .
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also announced they will issue curfew e-pass to ensure seamless workflow of essential services .
Gurgaon and Noida Police took to twitter to assure smooth movement on streets for those who fall under essential services category .
In Bengaluru , police commissioner is set to meet all related stakeholders .
Despite several requests and measures being taken , people are still panic-buying .
Grocery store shelves were wiped out minutes after the announcements of the lockdown .
And , if stocking up of perishable food items continue at this rate , we may already be leading towards the brink of a wastage crisis .
While food wastage is an inexcusable act at any given point in time , dumping fresh produce at this scale during a nationwide lockdown because of a communication gap between the Centre and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
