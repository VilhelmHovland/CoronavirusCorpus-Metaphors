What criteria will be used to determine when in-house service can resume in restaurants and bars ? If it is not very soon , we will impoverish a large number of fine service staff and lose a number of taxpaying businesses .
I understand the reason for the shutdown is to prevent the exponential growth in caseload and deaths that is typical of a pandemic .
As of March , Alaska has 12 confirmed COVID-19 cases and no deaths .
Unless we see a drastic increase in the caseload over the next couple of days and some deaths , it appears that we may well have dodged this pandemic .
If so , we need to promptly resume local business .
Testing of out-of-state travelers might still be warranted , as caseloads are still growing rapidly in other states .
Tracking the death toll across the United States is more important than the number of positive tests because we are still in catch-up mode for testing .
However , we must execute a prompt end to each class of emergency measures in order to minimize damage to our economy .
