The person who died was a woman in her 70s who had other underlying illness , and was being treated for influenza before she was tested for Covid-19 .
Dr Bloomfield said the modelling reports painted a sobering picture of what the impact of Covid-19 in Aotearoa would be if a strict approach was not taken .
" Without the actions currently being taken , the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 would exact a high price on New Zealand in terms of its impact on our healthcare system , on our healthcare workers , and of course , in a large number of deaths .
"  New Zealand needed to take this virus seriously , he said , and part of taking it seriously was getting the best possible outcome from the level four measures put in place .
He also noted that there had been a lot of ongoing interest in personal protective equipment .
" It 's very important that we keep our frontline health workers safe and there has been very clear advice about where healthcare workers need to wear PPE in different contexts .
However , I 'm also conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , they need to feel safe .
" I know that many of our frontline healthcare workers are concerned about not having access to masks when they feel they need them to feel safe .
"  She said a Covid-19 Local Government Response Unit had been formed , and regional Civil Defence groups would be operating local hotlines around the country .
" I 'd like to thank everyone for all you 're doing to help stop the spread of Covid-19 .
The small things we do as individuals make a real difference .
" Please keep being kind , we 're all in this together .
People who have or suspect they have Covid-19 need to be treated with compassion and support .
No one catches this virus on purpose .
"  She also pointed out that wet wipes were a major problem for councils ' sewers and wastewater treatment plants .
" As people , rightly , become more vigilant about hygiene , the use of wet wipes has increased markedly .
Unfortunately , disposing of wet wipes down the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this includes flushable wet wipes .
" The bottom line is , if you 'll beg my forgiveness , please always put wet wipes in the rubbish and not in the toilet .
