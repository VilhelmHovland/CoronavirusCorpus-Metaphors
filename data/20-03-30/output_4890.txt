Several terms have taken on newfound meaning in the grip of coronavirus .
" Doom surfing " is one , to describe those who seem unable to remove themselves from scrolling the internet , and " infodemic " another , a term adopted by World Health Organization for the misinformation that appears to spread online faster than the virus itself .
With no country and no people immune -- and with the rapid spread of Covid-19 and online misinformation about this disease -- it is clear that journalism 's role in combatting disinformation has never been more important .
This is particularly keenly felt in the region , where there is a sense of dread and helplessness made worse because people around the world once again appear to have discarded lessons learned years earlier in Asia , particularly from the SARS epidemic .
It has provoked a torrent of resentment toward foreigners , especially those who refuse to a wear mask .
Signs have popped up in Hong Kong saying " Hey Gweilo , ca n't afford a mask ? " .
In Australia , health professionals of Asian appearance were shunned and abused by parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that high quality health information -- plus journalism from trusted , professional and responsible sources that verify details before publication ? -- needs to be more easily accessed than poorly researched posts cobbled together in haste .
Covid-19 has also exacerbated a range of social and anti-social behaviours online while producing an info-torrent of material .
There are the " doom surfers " looking for anything about the virus to share ; the self-appointed online moral enforcers who shame others for sometimes innocuous and other times problematic actions ; the internet trolls who appear to find joy in spreading fear or provoking racism ; and the comedians who can bring a laugh with a clever meme , song , or video , but , in some cases , may inadvertently cause further harm .
Groaning under the weight of the torrent , the WHO label of " infodemic " is intended to convey that an excessive amount of information makes the solution more difficult to communicate clearly .
To be clear , the Covid-19 " infodemic " does have real-world health impacts because it creates confusion and reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read and understand Indonesian may find interest in work at the Kawal Covid-19 site by data scientists and other volunteers , who have been working on data-driven solutions to the problem of misinformation in recent Indonesian elections .
Health professionals want information shared online to be from a trusted source , such as a credible media outlets , recognised health and research institutions , government agencies , the WHO , or similar .
But the reality is the doomsayers ca n't help but share anything that comes across their feeds , quality or not .
People are glued to their smart phones getting a strong dopamine fix , but also seeking practical news about how the crisis affects them , what to do , and how to help others .
Take , for example , a friend and scholar sitting in an isolated , well provisioned apartment in New York , bemused and alarmed by an urgent message from another friend in Singapore offering to arrange a car to her to flee the city immediately .
Watching the craziness of the world unfold online , and panicked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the streets or riots of people armed with guns , the friend in Southeast Asia has been unable to determine the truth from fiction .
It 's clear that high quality health information -- plus journalism from trusted , professional and responsible sources that verify details before publication ? -- needs to be more easily accessed than poorly researched posts cobbled together in haste , and , in some cases , fear or malfeasance .
But in an era where trust in public institutions , politicians , and news media is so low , many people appear to to have few qualms about listening to and sharing rumours and disinformation -- often these are underpinned by conspiracy theories or racist sentiment -- unaware that the very purpose of manipulative content is to exploit pre-existing divisions in society .
To be fair , the social media giants have been attempting to do their bit , although not always succeeding .
In the early days , Facebook initially bungled its takedown notice of all Covid-19 posts and cross-posts , removing posts linking to stories from trusted news sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had personal experience of this , as shown .
)  TikTok has been providing information at the bottom of every video that mentions corona , coronavirus or Covid-19 .
Snapchat has introduced lots of coronavirus-related stickers , such as " wash your hands " and has introduced a clever myth-slaying game .
WHO even used WhatsApp to encourage users to explore its credible info line .
Unfortunately , these steps do n't always work in closed-message groups among friends , such as within WhatsApp , Facebook Messenger or Instagram .
These platforms appear still to be awash with well-meaning individuals privately sharing information that is n't quite right or even seriously wrong , making online and social media a breeding ground for fear and disquiet .
Professional journalists have long known that media content can heighten anxiety , and have worked hard on systems and warnings to ensure that their work does not make problems worse .
Publishers and program producers understand the need for balance and relief , usually confining crisis-related content to defined areas and deliberately focusing other areas on alternate content , often things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things going on in the world .
Largely thanks to social media , unverified Covid-19 stories and videos -- particularly from China -- have promulgated unfiltered graphic and disturbing descriptions and visual content , such as people dying on streets , survivors being welded into their apartments in Hubei , or later vision of the people who had died inside .
These are the kinds of stories and images which traditional news media outlets seek to verify , mediate and contextualise , in order to educate and minimise needless panic .
Traditional news media outlets have long been aware of their role in not just in providing credible , tested information from appropriate authorities , but also in providing context and solutions , some of which work well online .
Right now , the paramount need is to provide the members of the public in every community around the globe with strategies for enhancing wellbeing and remaining resilient .
However , in an age of shrinking newsrooms , disappearing mastheads and a rising number of spurious alt-media popping up online , the public 's trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly , lest Covid-19 sparks a media extinction event .
It is time for those citizens who have , over recent years , turned away from -- or who never developed an interest in -- traditional news sources to return to the fold , so they can put their trust in a reliable source of verified information that can form an important cornerstone as society moves through this global crisis .
Information-sharing needs to take on a more pro-social , responsible approach during these testing times -- yet still provide invaluable outlets for humour , laughter and jokes ; encourage physical exercise , yoga or meditation ; remind the devout of the power of prayer and religious rituals ; and ensure isolated individuals can communicate with their distanced family , friends , neighbours , peers and colleagues without fear and apprehension .
The doom-saying will then fade into the past .
