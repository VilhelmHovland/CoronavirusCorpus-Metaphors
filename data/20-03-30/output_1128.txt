" The public health emergency and economic uncertainty created by Covid-19 means that Prudential 's customers , staff and distribution partners are depending on us now more than ever for their personal wellbeing and financial security .
My message to all of you is simple : we are here for you , and we continue to support you in whatever way we can .
" During this period of uncertainty , Prudential , as a business committed to openness and transparency , will issue regular updates on our response to the varied effects of Covid-19 .
In parts of Asia , our colleagues have been living with this outbreak for several months and they have been performing heroically , providing outstanding service to customers in a challenging environment .
Covid-19 has now developed rapidly from a largely regional issue into a global pandemic .
This means we are having to adapt further .
Our teams in the US , the UK and Africa are learning from the experience of their colleagues in Asia , and I am pleased to report that our business continuity plans have been executed smoothly .
" Our business continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio ( RBC ) of Jackson , our US business , as at 31 December 2019 was 366 per cent and , despite extreme market volatility since then , Jackson 's RBC ratio is currently estimated to be at a broadly similar level .
" In the same way that Covid-19 is requiring us to think flexibly about how we deliver for customers , it also requires us to be flexible in how we execute our corporate strategy .
The Board is unambiguously clear on the strategic priorities for the Group : firstly , to enable Prudential 's investors to benefit to the fullest extent possible from the opportunity presented by Prudential 's business in Asia ; and secondly , to pursue a path for an independent Jackson , while ensuring that , through a combination of diversifying its business mix and the necessary strengthening of its standalone capital position , it retains the strong credit rating that its current and future customers require .
" At our Half Year 2019 results back in August , we announced an intention to introduce third-party capital into Jackson .
At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stated a preference for public equity markets as the source of that third-party capital , through a minority initial public offering ( IPO ) , subject to market conditions .
In light of continued turmoil in public equity markets , the Board is ensuring that , alongside preparations for a minority IPO , it continues to actively evaluate other options in relation to Jackson , driven by the focus and objectives that underline our strategic priorities .
" While the full consequences of Covid-19 are still emerging , Prudential has a highly resilient business model and remains well placed to continue to create value for shareholders , and support distribution partners and customers .
This crisis is impacting families and individuals in every community we serve across the world , and all of us at Prudential want those people to know that we will be there for them now and in the future .
