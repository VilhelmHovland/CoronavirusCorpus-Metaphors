As concerns grew over the spread of COVID-19 , Y Combinator shifted the event format away from the two-day gathering in San Francisco we 've gotten used to , instead opting to have its entire class debut to invited investors and media via YC 's Demo Day website simultaneously .
In a bit of a surprise twist , YC also moved Demo Day forward one week citing accelerated pacing from investors .
Alas , this meant switching up its plan for each company to have a recorded pitch on the Demo Day website ; instead , each company pitched via slides , a few paragraphs outlining what they 're doing and the traction they 're seeing , and team bios .
It 's unclear so far how this new format -- in combination with the rapidly evolving investment climate -- will impact this class .
As we do with each class , we 've collected our notes on each company based on information gathered from their pitches , websites , and , in some cases , our earlier coverage of them .
