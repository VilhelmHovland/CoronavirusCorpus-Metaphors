A Co Down principal has spoken of his frustration over being forced to close his school for two days after being overwhelmed with applications to accommodate key workers ' children .
?  Killinchy Primary head teacher Chris Currie said he had " no choice " but to go against guidelines indicating that schools should offer spaces to children if they have one parent who is a key worker .
?  The Department of Education announced last week that schools should only remain open for pupils whose parents have been deemed as " essential workers " .
?  Mr Currie said it was initially understood that schools would only be staying open for pupils with two key worker parents , but Education Minister Peter Weir later clarified it was just one .
Afterwards , Killinchy Primary received around 70 requests from parents .
This forced Mr Currie to keep the school 's doors closed yesterday and Monday so he could re-do the application process and reduce the numbers .
Parents were informed of the development last weekend , he added ,  Mr Currie said it was frustrating that he had to take such action because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" I had to reinstate the policy of only accepting children whose parents are both key workers , " he said .
?  " In Killinchy there are a large number of parents in key worker jobs , so there 's a lot of people there that need childcare .
It was a perfect storm for me .
"  He stressed that in addition to the high number of requests , he was also dealing with reducing staffing levels following government advice that those who are at a high risk of contracting Covid-19 should stay at home .
" The result of that was my available staff base was decimated , " he said .
" I had the double-edged sword of an increased flux of parents with the one key worker criteria and the complete decimation of my staff .
I then issued a plea to parents saying , ' Please if you really , really do n't need us , do n't use us .
On that plea I got eight withdrawals , but it was still far , far too high .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school .
I could n't keep staff safe .
" On that basis I had no choice but to re-run the whole application process .
I then issued exceptional closure notices for Monday and Tuesday to look at the two key worker criteria again .
" Those coming to school ( today ) are the children of blue-light workers and frontline medical workers .
"  In all , Killinchy Primary is accommodating fewer than 30 pupils .
Mr Currie said Mr Weir understood why he had been forced to break with Department of Education policy .
" He understood that I had no option , " the primary school teacher added .
A spokesperson for the Department of Education said it " is urgently looking at how we can help schools and would urge schools to work together at this time to provide a local solution for the supervision of children of key workers .
We are encouraged that some schools are already doing this " .
They said the Department was carrying out a daily survey to identify issues and had Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time " .
