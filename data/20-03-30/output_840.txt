ET  The Tony Award-winning American playwright Terrence McNally has died of complications related to COVID-19 .
He died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota , Fla .
at age 81 .
McNally was a lung cancer survivor who lived with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
His work on Kiss of the Spider Woman , Love ! Valor ! Compassion ! , Master Class and Ragtime won him a string of Tonys in the 1990s .
He also won a lifetime achievement Tony last year .
In all , McNally 's body of work encompassed some four dozen plays and musicals , many of which went to Broadway .
McNally was born Nov .
3 , 1938 in St .
Petersburg , Fla .
, and grew up in Corpus Christi , Texas , before attending Columbia University in New York .
( In a 2002 interview with the school , he professed not to know how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much .
" )  McNally was a crucial voice in illuminating the lives of LGBT people in the United States ; in 1995 , the New York Times marveled that his " proudly gay play " Love ! Valor ! Compassion ! became a mainstream Broadway hit .
In a 2019 interview , he told Playbill he was " tone-deaf , " but that he also considered himself to be a musical person .
Certainly , much of his stage work -- whether writing books for musicals or , in the case of Master Class , creating a theatrical portrait of opera legend Maria Callas -- was an expression of his deep love of music .
He also wrote the librettos for two operas by composer Jake Heggie : Great Scott and Dead Man Walking .
In a 2003 interview with WHYY 's Fresh Air , composer John Kander -- who , alongside lyricist Fred Ebb , collaborated with McNally on several shows , including Kiss of the Spider Woman -- called him a gracious co-creator .
" McNally is very good at writing a scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well we 're going to steal and musicalize , " Kander said , " but where he will let a character go on in dialogue in a way which is probably unnatural for him emotionally to do .
And he does that in order to turn Fred and me on to musicalizing it .
"  Among his other awards were an Emmy , two Guggenheim Fellowships , four Drama Desk Awards , two Obies and an induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters .
Correction : March 24 , 2020 12:00 am -- A previous version of this story said Terrence McNally collaborated with John Kander and Fred Ebb on Ragtime .
In fact , he collaborated with Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens on the play .
