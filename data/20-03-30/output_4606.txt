Coronavirus : Mild symptoms are more serious than you think  He deals with terrorists for a living but for Shiraz Maher , contracting the deadly COVID-19 pneumonia was more terrifying than anything he has ever encountered .
The 38-year-old British academic , who is one of the country 's most prominent government advisers on Islamic radicalisation , described his horrifying experience of the disease in a mammoth twitter thread that has gone viral .
Mr Maher said he had been vigilant about protecting himself from the coronavirus but , because he was relatively young with no underlying health conditions and a non-smoker , believed he could " shake it " if he caught it .
" Here 's how things have played out .
Firstly , it 's not the flu .
Whoever originally said that , did everyone a great disservice .
This thing is not the flu .
It 's a nasty , horrible , illness , " he said .
" I started having symptoms about two weeks ago .
The fever was mild and went very quickly .
Is it COVID-19 ? Who knows , but I 've shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and my chest got very tight .
This happened around 15-16 March .
" The cough was dry and unlike anything I 've ever had before .
It was much more extreme and pronounced than a dry cough you might have during a bout of the flu .
It feels like there 's something deeply lodged within your lungs , that they 're ( violently ) trying to eject .
" Of course , there 's nothing to actually eject .
The resulting cough is dusty , dry and painful .
Much more scary is that you 're unsure of when you 'll stop coughing .
You have no control over it .
There were times I was worried I 'd start vomiting because the coughing was so severe .
" When you finally stop , it 's a relief -- but now you 're in a new phase altogether .
You 're fighting to draw air into your lungs but your chest is tight and , frankly , your lungs are in distress .
They 're not functioning the way they should .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I suffered terrible headaches after these coughing fits .
The evening of Wednesday 18th was the worst day for me .
I fought for breath for about 3-4 hours .
It was horrific .
"  Mr Maher said he recorded his symptoms and ran them past his doctor friends , who told him he had : " Classic COVID " .
Not wanting to further burden the British health system , which is already struggling to cope with the daily surge of coronavirus patients , he did what he could to manage his worsening symptoms at home .
Struggling to breathe and stay awake , he went to bed for two days .
" By Friday , I thought I 'd got through the worst of it and things were looking good , " Mr Maher said .
He was blindsided when his condition suddenly took a turn for the worse and his blood pressure shot up to the point where he feared he would have a heart attack .
" On Saturday night I started to feel distinctly unwell again .
I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor .
" Anything over 180/120 is classified as ' hypertensive crisis ' ( basically , heart attack/stroke territory ) .
Without revealing what mine was , lets just say I was well , well in excess of this ( again , I do n't have an underlying issue ) .
This was easily the most terrifying moment .
" I called my doctor friends and told them .
' Time to call 999 ' ( the British equivalent of triple-0 ) they said -- so I did .
It took more than 15 minutes to speak with a representative ; that 's how overwhelmed the emergency services are .
I told them my BP and that I have coronavirus .
" Ultimately they decided they could n't respond to my call .
I am not criticising the London ambulance service .
They are doing superb work under incredible , unprecedented circumstances .
"  Over the next 48 hours , Mr Maher remained in bed in a bid to bring his blood pressure down naturally .
His hacking cough began to subside and his chest started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he thought he was finally on the mend , Mr Maher was hit by a raft of new symptoms , including " crazy abdominal pains and headaches " and extreme lethargy .
On March 28 , two and a half weeks after the first signs of coronavirus appeared , Mr Maher said he finally felt like he was " starting to beat it " and took to social media to share his horrific experience with others .
" Coronavirus appears to have a completely different trajectory in different people , " he said .
" Some are shaking it off relatively easily .
Others are suffering very badly .
The most difficult part of this is the extent to which it takes hold within your lungs .
It 's a completely mad , crazy illness .
It had made me feel more intensely ill than I 've ever been in my life .
"  Disturbingly , because Mr Maher was never hospitalised or put on a ventilator , his case has been classified as " mild " by British health authorities .
You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debating about whether to ' go public ' on having coronavirus - which I kind of did inadvertently this morning .
So , now I may as well share my experience(s) with you in order to help those who are worried about it or who are thinking they might have it .
Here goes .
