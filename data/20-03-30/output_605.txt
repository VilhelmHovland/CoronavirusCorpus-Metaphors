Mike Parson said Monday .
On a day that saw confirmed cases of the virus top 1,000 in the state , Parson said an order that prohibits the meeting of groups larger than 10 must be extended beyond its April 6 expiration .

One has died in St .
Charles County .
Across the state , 500 men and 523 women have tested positive .
The state Department of Health and Senior Services said 14,107 people have been tested .
Parson said he is looking for signs of progress in mid-April , but did n't sound optimistic the disease would be under control by then .
" I do n't want to give false hope to anyone .
April will be a tell-tale month , " Parson said .

" We 're trying to leave facilities like that open , " Parson said .
" Unfortunately people did n't abide by the rules .
"  He also defended his decision to prohibit the press from attending the briefings , which are held in the Capitol .
In a letter to the governor , the Missouri Press Association urged him to reopen the events to the press , despite the closure of the Capitol over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus .
