In Pennsylvania , in the United States , and in many parts of the world , the global coronavirus pandemic is still accelerating .
The U .
had about 125,000 infections and 2,200 deaths on Sunday -- up from about 32,000 a week earlier .
And this is in spite of the inexcusably slow rate of testing .
Pennsylvania has more than 33,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , the illness caused by the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,700 have died nationally in addition to 27,000 fatalities around the world , with the number of overall cases nearing 600,000 .
So , it is no surprise that medical experts like Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr .
Anthony Fauci , a member of the White House 's coronavirus response team , are urging a continuation of social-distancing and shelter-in-place practices that are in effect in large swaths of the country , including York County .

( AP Photo/Alex Brandon ) ( Photo : Alex Brandon , AP )  What is surprising is the view of noted medical non-expert President Donald Trump , who would like to see a return to business as usual by Easter .
And as he has throughout , the president continues to worry more about the health of financial markets than American citizens .
In making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trump maintains the nation " was n't built to be closed , " and that its economy must return to some semblance of normalcy .
" We can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself , " is fast becoming the mantra of Trump , rattled business leaders and like-minded office-holders like Texas Lt .
Dan Patrick , who went so far as to suggest older Americans , who are at elevated risk of death from the virus , be willing to sacrifice their lives for the supposed greater good of a stable economy .
" No one reached out to me and said , as a senior citizen , are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren ? " he told Fox News .
" And if that 's the exchange , I 'm all in .
"  There 's probably a bad joke to be made about Patrick leading by example , but instead we 'll ask , is this what politics has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and CEOs ? Or worse , to own the libs ?  Health experts warn a return to anything like normal in the nation 's businesses , schools , stores , sports stadiums and , given the Easter deadline , churches , would be catastrophic .
Even some in Trump 's own party acknowledge this reality .
" There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages , including our doctors and nurses , lay dying because we have failed to do what 's necessary to stop the virus , " Wyoming Rep .
Liz Cheney , the No .
3 House Republican , declared on Twitter Tuesday .
That 's the point .
Aside from spiking the rate of new infections and related mortality , a foolhardy rush toward illusory pre-virus normalcy would do little to shore up financial markets , reverse skyrocketing unemployment figures or bolster retailers ' coffers .
The public can not -- and should not -- operate as normal until things actually are back to normal ( or at least a whole lot closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump 's wishes , mayors are not going to urge city residents to hit the streets ; governors are not going to reopen schools ; businesses are not going to swing open their doors ; professional sports leagues are not going to resume their schedules .
None of this is going to happen until the spread of coronavirus has subsided and the public health is no longer at risk .
