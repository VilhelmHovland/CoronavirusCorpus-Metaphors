Chiu , AP  LOS ANGELES ( AP ) -- Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva , who was sued by gun-rights groups after trying to shut down firearms dealers in the wake of coronavirus concerns , said Monday that he is abandoning the effort .
The sheriff said he 's heeding a federal Department of Homeland Security advisory issued on Saturday that listed gun and ammunition dealers as " essential critical infrastructure workers .
"  Villanueva called the non-binding memo " persuasive " and announced that his department wo n't order or recommend closing businesses that sell or repair firearms or sell ammunition in the nation 's most populous county .
California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state 's 58 counties can decide for themselves whether to list firearms dealers as nonessential businesses that should be subject to closure while the state seeks to limit the spread of COVID-19 .
The disease causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people , but for some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .
Villanueva ordered a shutdown of gun shops last week , saying panic-buying that produced long lines at the shops was worrisome from a public safety standpoint .
Days later , he issued a second order closing them to the public , despite a county legal counsel 's finding that the stores are essential businesses that should remain open .
However , Villanueva 's second order said the stores may still supply security guard companies , and anyone who already has purchased a gun and possesses a valid safety certificate can pick up their firearms .
On Friday , four groups , including the National Rifle Association of America , filed a federal lawsuit , contending that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear arms .
