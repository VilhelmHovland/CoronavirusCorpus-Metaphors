In Trinity , controversy erupted earlier this month when the College ordered all students living in its accommodation to vacate .
Irish students were given just 24 hours to vacate their apartments , while international students were told they should " aim to have left their Trinity accommodation " within 48 hours of the announcement .
The following day , this newspaper reported that many international students were scrambling to find a way home -- with several reporting huge " stress and anxiety " and many hitting out at the College .

Binary Hub and Kavanagh Court -- both of which are privately operated -- have not issued a vacation order as of yet , despite Trinity naming those residences in their initial email concerning vacating accommodation .
College later backtracked , admitting that it was not in a position to order students to vacate the luxury complexes .
