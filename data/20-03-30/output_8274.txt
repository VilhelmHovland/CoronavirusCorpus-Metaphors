by Michael Wade/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images  Suddenly , the rules have changed .
As we all deal with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic , there are many completely unanticipated consequences .
While the impact on the NFL is pretty far down the list of priorities , it is nonetheless real .
While we focus on the Dallas Cowboys here , these things are universal for the league .
We preface this look at how free agency and the draft will look by noting the NFL could , at any moment , change their schedule and delay the start of the new league year .
The optics of moving forward while things are so uncertain in this world might be enough for them to pause it .
This article is basically a look at things if they proceed as currently scheduled .
No one can accurately predict how this will all play out and in what timeframe .
In the meantime , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual .
Unlike the other major sports , they are in the offseason so the crowds situation is mostly not in the picture .
And thanks to the digital world we now inhabit , there are mechanisms in place to make different things more feasible .
For now , the two big things to sort out are free agency and the draft .
Here is what is happening and how things may change .
Free agency  Currently , free agency is set to start on Wednesday , March 18 .
There is still a possibility that the league could decide to delay this .
There are reports that some owners are questioning the start of the league year .
Multiple team officials are skeptical that the NFL will be able to start its league year next week , expressing doubt to ESPN 's Adam Schefter given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak in the United States and the typical in-person visits , including physicals , that would have to happen as part of free agency .
There is at least a suspicion that they are delaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the new CBA , which was approved and announced Sunday morning .
Things have changed rapidly so far , so be braced for just about anything .
On the surface , it would seem that free agency could be conducted almost exclusively at a distance .
There is no absolute need for face-to-face meeting for negotiations , except for medical evaluations/physicals .
Everything else can be done by internet , telephone , or even by fax , assuming both parties can access the equipment .
It does , of course , make things a bit more difficult .
A lot of owners , GMs , coaches , and the players themselves want that face-to-face time during the courting stages .
There are unquestionably differing levels of comfort with having to substitute video conferencing around the league .
But it could be done .
The real question at this point is , will the teams accept this , or make a collective decision to push things back to go a more familiar route ? The situation with the pandemic has been very fast-moving over the past week and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a decision .
It should also be noted that more restrictions on travel may be coming for California and the state of Washington .
If that happens , and it is total to include private aviation , then it would be expected that free agents throughout the league would not be allowed to do any visits .
The draft  Just like free agency , drafting players does not really require any large gathering or audiences .
Those raucous events have become the norm because they are so popular - and one more revenue source .
The transformation of the process to a major spectator and media event was the real start of the NFL becoming a true year-round sport , despite having by far the shortest season of any major professional league .
But it can be done .
Just have the war rooms call directly to the league rather than to a superfluous person to actually fill out and hand in the card .
TV audiences would likely be even larger , since other sports could will be idle , leaving the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be noted that war rooms themselves may be much more sparse as staffs try to protect their own members .
The impact in this case is significant for the teams and the prospects .
And on you , the reader .
One of the key indicators for many teams is the 30 pre-draft visits they are allowed .
We have been tracking those for years here at Blogging The Boys , actually pioneering the idea of collecting and consolidating the various reports from social media .
It all was started because BTB icon One Cool Customer noticed how often actual picks were players who had paid a visit to the team .
Now , that is all gone .
The NFL has banned visits and teams are no longer able to go visit players or attend pro days , either .
Here , there is no real option .
The teams can do video or phone interviews , but that is all they have available to take the measure of the individual .
For many teams , this has long been crucial .
That includes the Cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future Cowboys draft pick Maliek Collins in the Nebraska cold .
" What jumped out to me was his work ethic .
" This year will be different .
Such evaluations are banned " until further notice .
" https : //t .
In essence , the teams are mostly down to grinding tape and studying measurables - when they have reliable numbers for the latter .
Unless players were among the elite invited to the NFL Combine , that may be a bit sketchy , as many ( if not most ) colleges are not above fudging things a bit to help their own products .
After all , pointing to how many of your players made it to the NFL can be useful in recruiting .
If you think social media Draftniks were irritating and too numerous in the past , imagine how it will be when they realize that they are now operating with almost the same information ( namely , video ) that the teams have .
At first glance , it would seem to severely hamper the teams to not have the visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews and direct observations .
There have been times when teams probably overdrafted someone with less than stellar tape because the prospect just blew them away in an interview .
Conversely , an awkward or somewhat withdrawn individual may have slid undeservedly because that was mistakenly assumed to reflect a lack of motivation or desire .
The ones who will suffer the most from this are the players who did not get to make a splash because they were outstanding talents stuck on losing teams or in small schools , and did not get an invite to the Combine .
There is only so much time to review college games , and no matter how skilled and dedicated scouts are , they will inevitably miss some good performances .
Those pro days were great chances for these overlooked prospects to catch someone 's eye and at least get on a radar or two .
It is a strange time , with no way to know when or truly if things will return to the way they were .
We 'll keep you posted as soon as hard information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health experts , take care of yourself , and help protect those who may be more vulnerable than you .
