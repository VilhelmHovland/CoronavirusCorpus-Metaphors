' Do n't make me cry ' : Coronavirus pandemic robs high school seniors of precious memories  Aylon Gipson did n't have any big plans for spring break -- he just wanted to spend some time with his friends .
With the end of his senior year at Booker T .
Washington Magnet approaching and his departure for college , he wanted to make as many memories as the time left would allow .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors who left their schools two weeks ago to start spring break , unaware that by most accounts , their high school careers would be over .
Those last couple of months as things slow down in the classroom , where students have more freedom to hang out and chat at lunch , are gone .
Plus , as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to rise , Americans are being urged to stay inside and away from others , including Gipson and his friends .
While there 's been assurance that a graduation ceremony will happen , the timing is unknown .
The other rites of passage that so many look forward to -- prom , the senior trip , the senior picnic -- are all canceled or postponed indefinitely .
The trip for Gipson 's class was supposed to be to Six Flags Over Georgia in Atlanta , where he 's never been .
The picnic would have been at the school , with parents showing up to grill hamburgers and hot dogs , with a water balloon fight .
Everybody would have worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T .

Like so many others , Gipson had already picked out his suit for prom -- a custom , tailor-made black suit he spent hundreds on , to match his date 's black dress she spent hundreds on .
He 'll likely have another opportunity to wear it , the girls in his class , though , " They 're just wondering if they 'll ever get the chance to wear that dress .
"  His classmate , Jazmyn Isaac , was planning to find her prom dress in Atlanta over spring break .
She and her mom started the drive , and even made it past Auburn before they decided to turn around .
" We did n't want to make that huge commitment with that much money and not have a prom , " Isaac said .
" I guess the gift of procrastination has worked out in my favor .

" ( Photo : Jake Crandall/ Advertiser )  " I was fully ready .
We were headed there and then the conversation started up and I got to calling the boutiques while we were in the car and then I was already out of the mood .
I did n't even want to try on a dress .
Even if we had went , my moral had already went down .
I did n't want to buy a dress and stare at it in my room not knowing if I 'd get to wear it , " she said .
This year would have been her first -- and last -- prom .
Aside from that , Isaac was looking forward to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen .
Heading to University of Alabama in the fall , Isaac knows there are talks of holding orientations virtually .

Jake Crandall/ Advertiser  Interested in this topic ? You may also want to view these photo galleries :  Some of her classmates are headed to the military , making this their first and last graduation , she said .
Some are the first people in their family to finish high school .
All of them have spent the last 13 to 14 years working toward that moment -- a moment that not just everybody makes it to .
" That 's the rite of passage , like passing off the torch .
" Isaac said .
" It 's your first step into adulthood .
After graduation it 's time to go to college and start a life for yourself .
"  Everyone , she said , needs that validation .

, on Friday March 27 , 2020 .
( Photo : Mickey Welsh / Advertiser )  " It 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no one to blame , students ca n't help but feel robbed .
Tejary Poole , a senior at Jefferson Davis High , is trying to be rational about this predicament , but it has been hard to process .
" Everything happens for a reason , " he said .
" I ca n't really be too distraught about it .
I just feel like we 've worked so hard and all the pay offs .
I wanted to have the experience as a senior , like prom and everything , " Poole said .
His mom is strongly enforcing the stay at home rule and his job , at Rock ' N Jump , has closed .
The lack of social interaction has weighed the heaviest on him .
" I 'm a real busy person -- I do n't like to be on my own , " he said .
" So the social distancing has taken a toll on me a little bit .
I feel like being away from people has changed me a little bit .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Poole 's just tried to keep busy -- washing his car , doing yard work , getting to the chores normal day-to-day life would n't allow .
His plan is to join the military , with basic training set for August .
Bailee Golab , a senior at Brewtech Magnet , at basic training for the National Guard in the summer of 2019 .
( Photo : Contributed )  By then , maybe things will be back to normal .
But for Bailee Golab , the timing of this pandemic could delay her future plans entirely .
A senior at Brewtech Magnet High , Golab has had her plans for after high school set in stone long before her upcoming graduation date .
Her grandfather and father served their country , and she went through basic training last summer so she could do the same .
The plan is to head to Advanced Individual Training mid-June to finalize her enlistment in the National Guard .
After , she 'll enroll at Auburn University , hopefully for the Spring 2021 semester .
Initially she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors would still graduate , regardless if the schools are closed , " by the end of summer .
"  But , for seniors like Golab , the end of summer would have been too late .
Now , Mackey has said seniors can anticipate graduating on time or within the first week of June , but Golad is hearing the current class at AIT is being slowed down .
The ripple effect may be that she 'll have to start her college career later .
" It 's going to slow a lot of stuff down , " she said of the virus .
Shaderricka Taylor , a senior at Carver High School .
( Photo : Contributed )  A senior at Carver High , Shaddericka Taylor is also upset about what she 's going to miss .
She 'd missed all of the end of middle school celebrations and was looking forward to her chance this time around .
Graduation , even if it eventually happens , she does n't think will be the same .
It wo n't be the way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Taylor joined her school 's dance team this year , making a new set of friends she wanted to spend time with .
But , she 's confined to her house .
Set to go to Alabama State University , her hope is to join the school 's cheer or dance team .
Tryouts for cheer were set for April 18 though , and the university has cancelled all activities indefinitely .
The fear of not being academically prepared is her biggest concern , though .
" The only thing I 'm thinking on is my grades .
Its hard to stay in contact with my teachers , " she said .
MPS is developing a plan to provide instruction to students through the shutdown , but its not set to start until April 6 .
Some high schools were already in a position to communicate with students electronically , but not all .
While the district is working to address the many barriers students will face , there is no doubt that the benefit of being in a classroom is priceless .
As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are transitioning to a new point in their lives .
For Gipson , he had a lot he wanted to accomplish before setting out on his new path .
He won first place in the state 's Future Business Leaders of America journalism competition last year , and wanted to go back and do it again this spring .
He wanted to go on and compete in nationals again , too .
