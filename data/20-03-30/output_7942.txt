COVID-19 found in sputum and feces samples after pharyngeal specimens no longer positive  Clinicians from the Institute of Infectious Diseases at Beijing Ditan Hospital , Capital Medical University found that some patients had positive real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) test results for SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum or feces after the pharyngeal swabs became negative .
Pharyngeal swabs are widely used to determine the appropriateness for a patient 's discharge from the hospital and/or whether isolation continues to be required .
These findings raise concerns over whether patients with negative pharyngeal swabs are truly virus-free or if sampling of additional body sites might be needed .
The clinicians retrospectively identified a convenience sample of patients admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital , Capital Medical University with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and paired RT-PCR testing of pharyngeal swabs with either sputum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 20 to February 27 , 2020 , the authors identified 22 with an initial or follow-up positive sputum or fecal samples paired with a follow-up negative pharyngeal sample .
RT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV2 of sputum and feces was seen up to 39 and 13 days , respectively , after the obtained pharyngeal samples were negative .
The researchers caution that the study was not carried out in a systematic fashion with sampling of all patients in a protocolized manner , and it is not known whether these positive sputum or fecal results indicate that the patient could still be infectious to others .
However , their findings are potentially important because they suggest that more study is needed in this area .
