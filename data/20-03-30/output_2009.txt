Four senators are coming under fire for selling massive stock holdings as the coronavirus spread across the US .
Republican Sens .
Richard Burr , James Inhofe , and Kelly Loeffler all dumped stock in late January and early February , around the time when the first diagnosed cases of coronavirus emerged in the US .
Democratic Sen .
Dianne Feinstein also sold a significant amount of stock .
Here 's how much each senator sold and the time period each transaction was completed :  Burr sold 33 different stocks , some in hotel chains , collectively worth between $628,000 and $1 .
million on February 13 , according to Senate records .
Loeffler reported 27 different stock sales on her Senate disclosure form beginning January 24 and worth at least $1 .
million .
The revelations raised questions as to whether senators had unloaded stocks before an outbreak that threw financial markets into a tailspin and erased trillions in wealth .
The details around Burr triggered widespread outrage .
Given his position as the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee , the North Carolina senator was part of a panel that received numerous briefings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Burr also came under criticism after a secret recording first published by NPR on Thursday showed the senator striking a far more dire tone on the virus threat in a gathering with business leaders in late January compared to his public statements .
In a statement directly addressing the financial disclosures , Burr said he " relied solely on public news reports " and cited CNBC 's coverage .
He also called on the Senate Ethics Committee to review his actions .
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , a prominent House Democrat , called on Burr to resign and accused him of misleading the public about the severity of the outbreak .
Some watchdog experts say his moves raise the possibility that he made money off information he had privileged access to .
" We have huge concerns with this ethically .
As a senator , he has a responsibility to his constituents first .
The idea that he might be profiting off insider information is problematic , " Lisa Gilbert , vice president of legislative affairs at the government watchdog group Public Citizen , told The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Loeffler tweeted about attending a Senate briefing on coronavirus on January 24 , and began dumping stocks shortly after .
The first stock was in a company named Resideo Technologies , which has shed half its value in the ensuing market plunge over coronavirus .
Loeffer went on the defense in a tweet , calling the scrutiny " a ridiculous and baseless attack " and saying " third-party advisors " oversee the portfolio she shares with her husband Jeffrey Sprecher , the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange .
Inhofe also echoed his Senate colleague in a statement released Friday , saying the allegations were " completely baseless and 100% false .
" He added he did n't have " any involvement " in investment decisions made by his financial adviser .
" In December 2018 , shortly after becoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , I instructed my financial advisor to move me out of all stocks and into mutual funds to avoid any appearance of controversy , " Inhofe said .
Feinstein is one of the longest sitting Democrats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee , which received several classified briefings on coronavirus last month .
Three days before the first sale , Feinstein joined other Senate Democrats on January 28 to send a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services to express " deep concern " about the coronavirus spreading in the US .
In a statement to Business Insider , the California senator said she was n't at the January 24 Senate briefing on coronavirus and that she had put all her assets into a blind trust .
She also said she did n't personally make the decision to sell any stock .
" During my Senate career I 've held all assets in a blind trust of which I have no control , " Feinstein said .
" Reports that I sold any assets are incorrect , as are reports that I was at a January 24 briefing on coronavirus , which I was unable to attend .
"  She went on : " Under Senate rules I report my husband 's financial transactions .
I have no input into his decisions .
My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company .
This company is unrelated to any work on the coronavirus and the sale was unrelated to the situation .
"  Congress began mandating that members disclose all stock transactions in 2012 under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act , or STOCK Act .
The law was designed to bar lawmakers from profiting on sensitive information they have access to .
Transactions are reported in ranges on disclosure forms .
