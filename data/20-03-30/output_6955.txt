Kalie Shorr has opened up about her coronavirus diagnosis and the misery that came with the virus .
The " Fight Like a Girl " singer 's experience highlights how contagious the virus is .
" The first few days were absolutely miserable , " the 25-year-old writes on Twitter .
" I 've never felt like that before .
My entire body was in pain , and my fever was like riding a wave .
I completely lost my sense of taste and smell .
"  Shorr is from Maine but has lived in Nashville for seven years .
The singer-songwriter helped found Song Suffragettes and the #LettheGirlsPlay movement in Nashville .
Prior to all things being shut down for coronavirus , she was slated to play select headlining shows and a few dates with Martina McBride in 2020 .
" Despite being quarantined ( except for a handful of trips for groceries ) for three weeks , I managed to contract COVID-19 .
I 'm feeling significantly better , but it 's proof how dangerous and contagious this is , " Shorr writes .
" It 's endlessly frustrating to see people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of country singers who 've tested positive for the coronavirus is slowly getting longer .
