Letter of the Day - Festival should be cancelled  I love the Edinburgh Festival , I 've been attending it most years for more than 50 years -- every year I go to ? every ? morning concert in the Queens Hall and every evening for concerts or ? operas in the Usher Hall or the ? Festival ? Theatre .
In recent years I 've been reviewing festival events for The Wee Review and was looking forward to reviewing for my new online magazine , The Edinburgh Music Review .
So why am I calling for it to be cancelled now ?  After Monday 's lockdown from Boris Johnson I would really think this is an ? academic question -- I 'm certain that the Festival and the Fringe will be cancelled .
I have attempted to talk to the Festival director and press officer about this but with no response .
I suspect they may be a little busy , but when you send an email as editor of an online music magazine to the director of the Festival and you get a response that says , not only are they too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , you have to make your own judgement .

It 's my judgement that the virus crisis wo n't be over by August , and that even if the Festival was held , no one would come , or at least many fewer , making the event an economic disaster .
Performers need to know as soon as possible to plan their alternatives , people who come from overseas need to know to cancel their travel , we all need to know to plan our ? summers even if we are n't locked ? down .
Some in Edinburgh will ? welcome a Festival-free August and maybe it will give us time to rethink its role and the scale for the future .
Edinburgh is greater than the Festival but we do need it ; let 's cancel it now to save it for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Wharton Square , Edinburgh  Shock tactics  As well as the repeated ? messages about hand washing , symptoms etc , the ? Government should have been putting the frighteners on a recalcitrant public weeks ago by instigating a ? ? hard-hitting advertising ? campaign like the apparently very effective AIDS : Do n't Die of ? Ignorance campaign in the 1980s .
David J Mackay  Gladhouse Place , Edinburgh  Good science  John Cameron 's letter about Covid-19 ( 23 March ) is as ill-informed as it is dangerous .
I heard Sir David King , then scientific advisor to the UK Government , with whom I worked for seven years and whose integrity as a scientist I unequivocally respect , lecture on how the foot and mouth epidemic of 2001 was eradicated .
He showed several graphs of animal deaths that were ? predicted to occur if various scenarios were adopted .
? Killing all the cattle within ten miles of an infected animal was predicted to give by far the least number of overall deaths .
He then showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the model and the two were ? superimposable .
If the modellers predict that so accurately , we MUST listen to them now .
Please everyone , obey the Government and stay at home if you are not needed on the front line .
David Cole-Hamilton  Emeritus Professor of Chemistry ? Buchanan Gardens , St Andrews  Silver slots  Surely I am not the only ? ' elderly ' 70-plus person who was constantly being told by government not to go out of my home .
However , as I am still reasonably active at 81 , and have been able to push my trolley around my supermarkets until the coronavirus emergency occurred , I have never needed online home delivery .
However , there are no slots available until ? mid-April and no way of contacting these stores to find out if ever , when and how !  This is a real problem as I feel shoppers like me will have missed the boat to secure a slot .
Neighbours are very obliging , but with their own families to consider , can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? It seems that the supermarkets have forgotten that it is not possible for us all to benefit from the erroneously called ' silver shopping hours ' .
However , the Scottish ? Grocers Federation and smaller convenience stores have been more than helpful .
Margaret Campbell  Dovecot Loan , Edinburgh  Bring us home  In view of Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's statement about actions being taken to limit the spread of Covid-19 , and requesting one million travellers abroad to return home , I do feel there is a need to arrange repatriation flights , as many of us are stuck due to local restrictions .
After a General Medical Council appeal for doctors , we arranged our flight on 23 March from Lahore to Edinburgh , then all flights were banned until 4 April , with a possibility of extension .
For British nationals , and British doctors needed to help NHS , it is imperative to organise ? repatriation .
Hasan Beg  Harcourt Road , Kirkcaldy , ? currently in Lahore , Pakistan  I believe in Boris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fore again , ? perhaps this time because the circumstances are more demanding .
The current crisis is , as we all know , extremely serious ; our politicians are doing a marvellous job at all levels in all parts of the UK .
Boris Johnson may come under fire from various quarters , but personally I believe he is the sort of leader we need in such times .
As far as I am ? concerned the emergency measures will be handled best by a Government which , through our electoral ? system has the responsibility for the whole of the UK , with the resources to tackle the enormous problems relating to the economy , unemployment , and the health and the wellbeing of the population .
This crisis could put an end to any attempt to cause political division in future years .
In Scotland the SNP has passed its sell-by date .
Hopefully the flag-bearing , tartan-clad , woad-painted marches will be a thing of the past .
Scotland needs to remain part of the strong UK economy , with optimum employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the present crisis as a stronger and more united UK .
Robert IG Scott  Northfield , ? Ceres , Fife  Rich pickings  Not so long ago , ' millions ' and ' millionaires ' were common words in our vocabulary .
Now ' billions ' and ' trillions ' trip just as easily off our tongues .
But do we really appreciate just how many zeroes there are in each ?  A billion is 1,000 times a ? million , i .
1,000,000,000 .
A trillion is 1,000 times a billion , i .
1,000,000,000,000 .
Can it be just that there are trillionaires in this world , when so many millions ca n't even put a crust of bread on the table ? How long till there are many quadrillionaires ( 15 zeros ) ? The world has gone crazy .
We are all going to have many months to think in ? isolation about real issues .
Let 's hope it is a wake-up call that teaches us some important lessons .
Three of the most important are that Covid-19 ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all depend on one another for health ( mental as well as physical ) and well-being ; and we achieve more by working together than by ? simply thinking of ourselves .
Hopefully , some good will come out of this crisis and we will begin to work together to make this world a fairer place for billions of people -- soon to be trillions , even if millions more die from Covid-19 than from the many causes that already exist .
Henry L Philip  Grange Loan , Edinburgh  Let 's be better  I am glad our governments are at last taking more drastic measures to counter the ? Covid-19 pandemic .
Sadly , they missed the best opportunity to slow its spread by ? failing early on to institute and continue a strict testing policy and tracing of all contacts of positive cases with subsequent ? isolation .
Now we have people being told to self-isolate needlessly because their child has a cough , yet no tests are done to verify the need for this .
Presumably we do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NHS , which has been starved of resources for years and is in danger of being overloaded with seriously ill patients .
China , which appears to have done a great job of ? controlling this virus , produced many more testing kits quickly and used them and isolation ? effectively .
Make no mistake , this is a serious pandemic , caused by a virus which spreads very ? rapidly .
Sadly the death rate globally will climb relentlessly .
Also , we do not yet know what the long term pulmonary complications may be for those who survive severe , or even moderate , attacks .
I appeal to people to obey official instructions about hygiene , social distancing and self-isolation .
I hope that ? Government , along with ? charities and volunteers , will continue to help out those who are financially affected by ? various closures .
The economy and the markets will ? eventually recover .
May this emergency cause us to be less selfish , less ? materialistic and more ? caring for others .
At an international level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to negotiate ? rather than threaten , to aim for peace rather than conflict .
Donald M MacDonald  Blackford Avenue , Edinburgh  Halfwits house  Having experienced hundreds of cars , campervans and caravans arriving in our small village with a ? population of mainly older people , I can see how the draconian move of a lockdown is the only result these halfwits will recognise .
Asking them why they were ignoring the stay at home request resulted in responses of " .
but the weans are on their holidays " ; " It is a lovely day and I was fed up " and " we needed a break with the kids " .
The selfish minority always blows it for the reasonable majority , whatever it may be .
Margaret Thatcher once said " there is no such thing as ? society " and for once I am almost persuaded that she was right .
