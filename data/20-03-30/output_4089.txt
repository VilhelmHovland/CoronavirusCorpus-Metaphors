According to the Sky Sports pundit , Pogba would be a " doddle " to play against .
Souness has long been critical of the Frenchman 's commitment and desire to play for Man United , frequently hitting out at the midfielder in his role as a pundit .
Earlier this month he questioned the legitimacy of Pogba 's ankle injury , which had seen him miss a large chunk of the Premier League season and on Sunday he was quizzed on what advice he would give the World Cup winner if Souness had been his teammate .
" Pogba has absolutely everything to be a top player -- great athleticism , super technique -- but his attitude to the game is the polar opposite of mine , " he said in his Sunday Times column .
" He goes out with one thought in his mind : " I 'm going to show everyone how clever I am today and be the star of the show .
" My attitude , the way I was taught , was : " Go out and work harder than the guy you 're in against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute doddle to play against .
"  Pogba has only featured eight times in all competitions for United this season , with his last appearance coming in their St Stephens ' Day win over Newcastle .
He had successful surgery on his ankle at the beginning of January and had been close to a return to fitness before the suspension of the Premier League season as a result of the coronavirus outbreak .
" I see Paul Pogba dancing at a wedding , I see him shooting hoops and there was something else and the cynic in me thinks he does n't want to be at United , " Souness said earlier this month .
" How can you not want to play for Manchester United ? How can you not want to play for Manchester United , if that is the case ? Will you give me odds for him playing at the Euros ? " .
