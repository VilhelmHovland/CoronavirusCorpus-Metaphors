DIGITAL TRENDS : Digital diet status quo in the age of Covid-19  Thursday March 26 2020  Advertisement  By Innocent Swai  Food production technologies are changing .
Today , humanity has revolutionised a number of things including their digital and physical diets .
The latter used to be stuff like vegetables and fruits , whole grains , fish , chicken , and meat .
Technology advancements in agriculture and the fast food chain evolved into a new flexible mobile society .
That resulted in far less wholesome foods which penetrated into the whole society .
Manufacturers capitalised on emerging technologies by figuring out different ways to get rid of certain parts of the physical traditional diets .
Other ingredients like preservatives were added , so that foods could last longer with less spoilage .
That skyrocketed the value of food chain .
And the processed food culture was born .
Science and technology was sort of the ' new god ' - till coronavirus changed everything around .
What is happening ? Lets play the wait and see game .
The world is grounded .
Science and technology had shifted the known healthier food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food taste preferences as the society switched into refined sugar and refined grains .
Big malls and supermarkets were born ; killing the known corner shops and traditional markets in big cities .
Can coronavirus reverse the trend again ? Today with emerging technologies , I dare say , we have everything store like Amazon .
Change is the only constant as digital diet is taking over .
Industrial farms have been designed to feed animals with more cost-efficient grains instead of traditional grass .
They are making use of growth hormones in their diet to boost the production cycle , hence more profits .
On the other hand , the fast food chain industry has reinvented itself by becoming a cultural staple , as did the processed foods devoid of nutrients but crammed with salt , sugar , and synthetic chemicals .
Most of the calories consumed today , come from refined grains , added sugars , vegetable oils , and solid fats .
Today , humanity consumes highly varieties of processed food stuff than ever before .
Imagine , the harmful side effects coming from the usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starch .
Besides side effects , the place of essential nutrients for the proper functioning of our bodies has taken over resulting to people having lifestyle diseases .
Nanotechnology is a field of applied science and technology whose unifying theme controls matter on the molecular level in very smaller scale ( less than 1 micrometre ) .
The good news is that , you are a walking nanotech miracle .
Today , with the help of emerging technologies , we are building tiny robots that would circulate through the human body and eliminate cancer cells , repair arteries , etc .
hence accomplishing all sorts of other miraculous things .
That is what is trending .
Interestingly , our human body already has nanotechnology that does all of this and much more .
Why not ? If humanity can stop fighting nature ! Look at the way nature is designed to function just by itself ; then brilliance can be borrowed .
Design thinking is the way to go .
Our own immune system can put most of these man-made technologies to shame .
Our bodies without external intervention already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mechanism of appropriate technologies on how to use optimum nutrition and put it to good use to support not just a healthy organ but the whole body system of yours .
If do n't get what I am saying , take it easy .
Just look at the human body to see a nanotech miracle .
You 're already a walking miracle of molecular technology that works even when you do n't understand how it works .
Go figure ! .
