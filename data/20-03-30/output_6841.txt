For people living in abusive homes , Burgess-Johnson offered some advice :  Create as much space within your home as you can to try to maintain distance from the batterer .
Have a plan to flee .
Know where you 'd go and what you 'd need to take with you before tensions get high .
Have a " go bag " stashed somewhere with medications and anything important for your children .
Back your car into your driveway in case you need to leave in a hurry .
Hide a spare set of car keys , house keys and , if possible , an old cellphone .
