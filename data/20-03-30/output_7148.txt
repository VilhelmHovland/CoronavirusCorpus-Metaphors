COVID-19 : Guide to Handling Materials  Many of us have received questions about how , in this time of extreme uncertainty as the pandemic continues , are we going to work through the important topic of lending materials in school and public libraries .
While we have e-materials that can be safely circulated by our users , the bulk of most collections in school and public libraries remains physical , tangible items .
The Maryland State Library Resource Center and Enoch Pratt Free Library ( Baltimore ) have put together a Guide to Handling Materials during COVID-19 .
This document , as stated , outlines the safest practices known as of March 27 , 2020 .
It includes references and links to associated information .
This quote from Jacob Nadal , Director for Preservation at the Library of Congress is included in the first document , and indicates that there are still many unknowns about the viability of the virus on various library materials :  " There are no studies that specifically answer the question of how transmissible COVID19 might be from the most common library materials -- for example coated and uncoated paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials for 72 or more hours seems to be the safest course .
There is very little research on the effects of medically effective sterilization and sanitization measures on the condition of library materials , another reason to favor quarantine .
"  It should be noted that due to the national shortage of PPE ( personal protective equipment ) , items such as gloves should be reserved for medical , health care , and first responders and not purchased or stockpiled by libraries at this time .
Use your judgment about how many gloves currently on hand at your school or library would be needed for the safe handling of library materials , and if large amounts of unopened boxes of gloves could be donated to more pressing needs in your community .
Thank you for your continuing work for and with both teens and everyone within your service populations , .
