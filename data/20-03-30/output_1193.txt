In an open letter posted online , Playboy Enterprises chief executive Ben Kohn said the company had been discussing overhauling its print output for some time , but the decision had been accelerated by the pandemic .
" Last week , as the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic to content production and the supply chain became clearer and clearer , we were forced to accelerate a conversation we 've been having internally : the question of how to transform our US print product to better suit what consumers want today , and how to utilise our industry-leading content production capabilities to engage in a cultural conversation each and every day , rather than just every three months , " he wrote .
The iconic bunny mag will instead move to a digital-first publishing schedule for all of its content , including the Playboy Interview .
The publisher said it will launch a range of new print products -- including special editions , partnerships and collections -- alongside its digital offering from next year .
" Print is how we began and print will always be a part of who we are , " Kohn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh Hefner and the brand has since expanded into an empire that includes TV shows , nightclubs and merchandise .
The lifestyle magazine has printed stories by some of the world 's most famous writers , including Ian Fleming , PG Wodehouse and Margaret Atwood .
But it has attracted controversy for its portrayal of women -- particularly through its portrayal of full-front nudity .
