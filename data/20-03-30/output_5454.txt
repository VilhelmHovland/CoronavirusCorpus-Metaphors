Consumers are concerned about potential food shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic , despite assurances that there are no issues with food supply chains other than temporary disruption caused by the sudden increase in demand .
AUSTRALIA 'S FOOD SUPPLY  Australia 's food supply chains are well placed to meet demand during the COVID-19 pandemic , because the nation produces so much food .
More than 90 per cent of the fruit and vegetables , meat , dairy and eggs sold in supermarkets are produced domestically .
We also export large surpluses of beef , dairy , wheat and some fruits that provide a useful buffer during supply shocks .
But disruptions can still impact Australian supply chains and lead to temporary food shortages .
This happened during the 2010-11 Queensland floods when farms were inundated , Brisbane 's main wholesale market flooded , and major highways were closed .
In New Zealand , after the 2010-11 earthquakes , community groups in Christchurch formed a Food Resilience Network , with a vision to create " a patchwork of food producing initiatives based around local hotspots and linked together like a ribbon woven into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christchurch and Baltimore initiatives aim to help communities adapt to food system shocks by increasing local access to fresh , healthy food .
ENCOURAGING URBAN FOOD  One of the ways that they do this is by encouraging more urban food production - in community gardens , orchards , schools and backyards .
Interest in community food initiatives is also growing in Australian cities .
The Foodprint Melbourne research team at the University of Melbourne is collaborating with stakeholders to assess the vulnerabilities of Melbourne 's food system to shocks and stresses .
This assessment is a first for an Australian city and aims to inform policy to strengthen the resilience of Melbourne 's food system .
Shocks to our food supply teach us how we can prepare to withstand and bounce back from them in future .
But they are also an opportunity to transform food systems , so that they can continue to supply people with food through shocks and stresses , but in a way that is healthier , more sustainable and more equitable .
Importantly , these shocks have the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POVERTY  The major risk to food security from the COVID-19 crisis is not empty supermarket shelves .
It 's the emerging social and economic crisis that will push greater numbers of people into poverty , so that they 're unable to afford enough nutritious food .
Many people are worried about how they 'll afford to eat if they lose their jobs or who will fetch their groceries if they have to self-isolate .
Over 90 per cent of the fruit and vegetables , meat , dairy and eggs sold in supermarkets are produced domestically .
Picture : Supplied  Victoria has announced that people self-isolating will be provided with emergency food packages .
But the response by governments in Australia to ensuring the food security of vulnerable people during this crisis is patchy and further measures are needed .
Most important is increasing welfare benefits to make sure that people on low incomes can afford to buy healthy food .
We do n't need to panic buy to get through the COVID-19 crisis , but let 's ensure that all Australians have access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Privacy Statement  The University of Melbourne ( University ) collects , uses , handles and discloses personal information in accordance with the Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014 ( Vic ) ( Act ) and other applicable legislation .
