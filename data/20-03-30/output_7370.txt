Cans of soup are all very well -- they worked for Warhol -- but they 're hardly the height of culinary inspiration .
Quarantine cooking is our new daily column , where chefs from across London give their ideas for what to make while we 're all cooped up .
We start with a classic from the London Shell Co 's Stuart Kilpatrick .
Kilpatrick -- who also looks after sister restaurant The Grand Duchess -- is best known for his simple , delicate approach to fish , and both floating restaurants specialise in cleanly done seafood .
While getting your hands on a fresh bit of bass is probably a stretch at the minute , here Kilpatrick offers a back-of-the-cupboard classic , mixing tinned tuna with pasta .
It 's easy as anything to pull off , but be careful with the tuna ; it 's too easy to accidentally turn it into a paste , which will rather ruin things .
Be sure to sweat the garlic enough too , so it cuts right through the dish .
Lovely for lunch and easy for a quick supper , here 's the London Shell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 4  Ingredients  400g spaghetti ?  200g tinned tuna  4 cloves of garlic , thinly sliced  Capers  Tomato paste  Red wine vinegar  Chilli flakes  A large bunch of flat parsley  Stale Bread  A lemon  Salt , pepper  Method  This is a quick , easy one , and the idea is to get the pasta going at the same time as preparing the sauce , before finishing it all off together .
Sweat the garlic on a low heat in copious amounts of olive oil .
Meanwhile , add the pasta to boiling water .
When the garlic starts to colour , add a tablespoon of tomato paste and three tablespoons of the pasta water , and reduce the heat to the lowest setting .
Season with a teaspoon of red wine vinegar and a dash of sugar , a pinch of dry chill flakes and plenty of salt and pepper .
Drain the tuna and add to the sauce in nice big flakes , and allow it to warm through gently .
Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn to mush given half a chance .
After about six minutes or so , drain the pasta -- it should be al dente at this point -- and return to the pan with a knob of butter and the tuna sauce .
The pasta will finish cooking in the sauce .
Roughly chop a bunch of flat parsley and add to the pan with a fist full of capers .
Stir gently , being careful not to break up the tuna too much .
Once it 's all mixed , serve into a pasta bowl .
If you 're feeling especially snazzy , pulse a couple of slices of stale bread in a food processor and then fry in a little oil until crisp .
Drain these crumbs on a little kitchen paper and add the zest of half a lemon for something crunchy to sprinkle on over your pasta .
