The tax relief measures announced by the government have been widely welcomed as means to mitigate the economic hardship for small and medium-sized businesses , caused by the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 .
The government announced relief for tax-compliant businesses with a turnover of less than R50m for employees ' tax , provisional tax payments and the employment tax incentive .
Joon Chong , tax partner at Webber Wentzel , says there has been no relief outlined in terms of late payments of VAT .
She notes that VAT vendors who have monthly payment obligations have a payment due on April 7 .
" There is no indication that there will be any relief ( for late payments ) .
This means that VAT vendors should only delay their VAT payments as a last resort to avoid the automatic 10% late payment penalty when payments are made after their due dates , " she warns .
Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr 's law and tax experts Aubrey Mazibuko and Louis Botha note that tax compliant businesses with a turnover of less than R50m will be allowed to delay 20% of their PAYE liabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is also relief in the form of a deferral of provisional tax payments for smaller businesses .
However , provisional tax payment relief for sole-proprietor businesses has not been finalised .
Chong says the deferred payment of 20% of PAYE over the next four months is only applicable to smaller companies .
No relief was offered to companies with turnover of more than R50m .
" There is a 10% late payment penalty on PAYE paid after the seventh of every month , and 10% late payment penalty for late payments of provisional taxes .
"  Chong explains that there is a 20% underestimation penalty where the estimated taxable income used for the second provisional tax calculation is not at least 90% accurate .
However , she says the Tax Administration Act provides for the remittance of penalties in exceptional circumstances .
The SA Revenue Service ( Sars ) must remit the penalty , or a portion thereof , if the tax authority is satisfied that the taxpayer was " incapable " of complying with the obligations under the relevant tax acts .
One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their tax obligations is a natural or human-made disaster .
A civil disturbance , or disruption in services may also render a person " incapable " of complying with his tax obligations as set out in the relevant act .
Chong also notes that the Tax Administration Act provides for the remittance of penalties in a case of serious financial hardship where there is an " immediate danger " that the continuity of business operations and the continued employment of its employees are jeopardised .
Sars has indicated that any remission of penalty and interest requests will be done on a case-by-case basis .
A Sars committee considering the request is likely to be guided by the principle of whether the taxpayer was incapable of complying with their tax payment obligations , and the documents provided to support this allegation are accurate and reliable .
Chong suggests companies should maintain records over the coming months of business interruptions .
" This could be in the form of the number of cancellations of existing clients , bad debts , the number of debit orders bouncing and amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts given .
" She advises companies to keep records of their payroll calculations , and importantly , PAYE statements of accounts at various dates .
" It will be vital for employers to undertake their own calculations and payments made of the 80% payroll amounts .
" Chong says it is imperative that taxpayers continue to try to meet their tax obligations " in full and timeously " where possible .
" This is to ensure that Sars and National Treasury are able to collect the revenue necessary to support Covid-19 disaster relief efforts and medical costs .
"  Keith Engel , CEO of the South African Institute of Tax Professionals , says tax practitioners need to inform their clients of the available Covid-19 relief mechanisms .
" These relief mechanisms not only include assistance on the tax side , but also subsidies from other departments , such as the departments of labour and small business .
"  Engel adds that thorough paperwork will be essential for prompt access .
