An Australian astrophysicist was admitted to hospital care after getting four magnets stuck in his nose while he tried to invent a new device designed to prevent people from touching their faces amid the coronavirus pandemic , reports The Guardian .
Magnets in the nose from coronavirus isolation  A research fellow at a Melbourne university , Daniel Reardon was assembling a necklace with an audible alarm that sounds upon facial contact -- but then he hit a snag .
The 27-year-old astrophysicist studies pulsars and gravitational waves , and claims he was simply trying to escape the boredom of self-isolation with four powerful neodymium magnets .
" I have some electronic equipment but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things , " he said to Guardian Australia .
" I had a part that detects magnetic fields .
I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field , and we wore magnets on our wrists , then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face .
A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronic device he had subverted his expectations -- it completed a circuit only when no magnetic field was present .
" I accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face , " said Reardon .
" After scrapping that idea , I was still a bit bored , playing with magnets .
It 's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears -- I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril .
"  Risky operations with magnets  Reardon explains that he put two magnets inside his nostrils , with two on the outside .
When he took the magnets off the outside of his nose , the other two stuck together on the inside .
Then he tried to use the other magnets to remove them , which did not work out for him .
" At this point , my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me , " he said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a ridge at the bottom of my nose you ca n't get past , " he said .
" After struggling for 20 minutes , I decided to Google the problem and found an article about an 11-year-old boy who had the same problem .
The solution in that was more magnets .
To put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside .
"  " As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets , they clipped on each other and I lost my grip .
And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right .
At this point I ran out of magnets , " he said to The Guardian .
Instead of going straight to the hospital , Reardon then decided to pull them out with pliers , but then the pliers themselves became magnetized by the magnets inside his nose .
" Every time I brought the pliers close to my nose , my entire nose would shift towards the pliers and then the pliers would stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a little bit painful at this point .
"  Then his partner took him to the hospital where she works -- more for schadenfreude laughs than medical assistance , according to Reardon .
The doctors found it amusing too , and said things like " This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom , " said Reardon .
The doctors used an anesthetic spray to manually removed the magnets from the man 's nose .
After coughing the last one out , the astrophysicist said he had ruled out further experiments with face-touching magnets , and that he 'd find new ways to pass the time at home .
