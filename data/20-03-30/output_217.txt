WASHINGTON -- President Trump retreated Sunday from his desire to relax coronavirus guidelines by Easter , announcing instead that all Americans must continue to avoid nonessential travel , going to work , eating at bars and restaurants , or gathering in groups of more than 10 for at least another month and perhaps until June .
The grim recommendation , which the president made in the White House Rose Garden , came just a day before the end of a two-week period in which the world 's largest economy has largely shut down with staggering consequences : businesses shuttered , schools and colleges emptied , and social life all but suspended .
Trump said repeatedly last week that he wanted to reverse such drastic measures soon , perhaps by Easter , on April 12 , in the hopes of restarting the economy .
But public health experts -- including the president 's own advisers -- had warned that trying to return to normal life too quickly risked allowing the virus to rage , increasing the likelihood of more infections and raising the number of deaths .
The president finally appeared on Sunday to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from weeks of insisting that the threat from the virus might be overblown .
In the past month , Mr .
Trump has vacillated between accepting the need for aggressive action to limit the pandemic and complaining that such moves will harm the economy .
But on Sunday , his mood seemed somber as he conceded the need for another month of collective pain .
Citing figures from his advisers that showed that as many as 200,000 people could die from the virus even if the country took aggressive action to slow its spread , Mr .
Trump said the restrictions must continue , even if it meant more sacrifice in the days ahead .
" During this period , it 's very important that everyone strongly follow the guidelines .
Have to follow the guidelines , " Mr .
Trump told reporters , with members of the government 's coronavirus task force nearby .
" Therefore , we will be extending our guidelines to April 30 to slow the spread .
"  " We can expect that by June 1 , we will be well on our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think by June 1 .
A lot of great things will be happening .
"  Dr .
Anthony S .
Fauci , the nation 's leading infectious disease expert , said he and other public health officials had urged Mr .
Trump not to relax the guidelines too soon .
Fauci -- who in television appearances earlier in the day had offered the estimate of 200,000 dead -- said Mr .
Trump was affected by those predictions .
" The idea that we may have these many cases played a role in our decision in trying to make sure that we do n't do something prematurely and pull back when we should be pushing , " Dr .
Fauci said .
He said extending the guidelines until April 30 was a " wise and prudent decision " that Mr .
Trump reached after discussions over several days with Dr .
Deborah L .
Birx , the coordinator of the effort to fight the virus , and other health officials .
" Dr .
Birx and I spent a considerable amount of time going over all the data , why we felt this was a best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr .
Fauci said .
Aides said that Mr .
Trump was muted during the task force meeting before Sunday 's news conference , his mind almost entirely made up to extend the guidelines .
One adviser said the president recognized that the data about the potential impact of the virus in the United States was bad , and could not be bent to his will .
For weeks , Mr .
Trump had compared the coronavirus to the flu , repeatedly suggesting that many more people die of the flu each year than would succumb to the virus .
But on Sunday , he repeatedly cited predictions that up to 2 .
million Americans could die from the virus if nothing were done to stop its spread .
He talked about " the viciousness " of the virus and revealed that it had sent a friend to the hospital .
" He 's a little older and he 's heavy .
But he 's a tough person , and we went to the hospital and a day later he 's in a coma , " Mr .
Trump said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in a coma .
He 's unconscious .
He 's not doing well .
' The speed and the viciousness , especially if it gets the right person , it is horrible .
"  The president also expressed horror at the grim scenes playing out at the hospitals in New York City , where he spent much of his adult life .
He cited the situation at Elmhurst Hospital Center -- " I know it very well , " he said -- which has been inundated in recent days with people ill from the virus .
" I 've been watching that for the last week on television , body bags all over in hallways , " Mr .
Trump said .
" I have been watching them bringing in trailer trucks , freezer trucks because they ca n't handle the bodies .
There are so many of them .
This is in essentially my community in Queens , New York .
I have seen things that I have never seen before .
"  The president 's turnabout came as state and local officials across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hospitals amid shortages of protective equipment and fears that there would not be enough doctors and nurses to tend to those who get sick .
Several of the nation 's governors said on Sunday that they anticipated surges of cases during the next several weeks , and they urged their residents to continue to follow social distancing guidelines that would slow the spread of the pandemic .
" If we do n't flatten the curve , we 're on a trajectory currently to exceed our capacity in the New Orleans area for ventilators by about April the 4th , and all beds available in hospitals by about April the 10th , " Gov .
John Bel Edwards , Democrat of Louisiana , said on NBC 's " Meet the Press " program Sunday morning .
" So we 're doing everything we can to surge capacity .
It 's very difficult .
"  Gov .
Jay Inslee , Democrat of Washington , who has frequently clashed with Mr .
Trump , said before the president 's announcement that his state would not be ready to lift social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not want to be responsible for opening the door to this virus to ravage our places that seem OK today , but , within 10 weeks , within 10 days , can be at full-scale burning through our hospital system , " Mr .
Inslee said on CNN 's " State of the Union " program .
" And we have seen this happen .
We have got to be ahead of this curve .
"  Over the last several days , Mr .
Trump has lashed out at the governors , suggesting that some of them do not appreciate the help that they are getting from him and from others in the federal government .
Edwards and several other governors largely steered clear of responding to those criticisms by Mr .
Trump .
Instead , several of them stressed that they were working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies even as they pleaded for more help getting ventilators , surgical masks and other medical equipment they need .
" You know , I do n't have energy to respond to every slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said on " State of the Union .
" " What I 'm trying to do is work well with the federal government .
And I will tell you this .
There are people from the White House on down who are working 24/7 , just like we are at the states .
We 're all stressed , because we have people that are dying right now .
"  Still , on Sunday , Mr .
Trump repeated a complaint that Democratic governors had insulted him and said he would delegate calls with those officials to other people in the White House .
" I do n't have to call because I 'm probably better off not , " Mr .
Trump said , describing Mr .
Inslee as " a nasty person " and raising his failed candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination .
" I do n't like the governor of Washington , so you know who calls ? I get Mike Pence to call .
I get the head of FEMA to call .
I get the admiral to call .
"  And Mr .
Trump once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest that New York hospitals are hoarding -- or doing something else improper -- with protective gear like their surgical masks .
He said that he did not believe they really need the increases in protective equipment they claim are necessary to protect doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients .
Trump said he was told that demand for masks at a New York hospital jumped from 10,000 to 20,000 per week before the virus arrived to nearly 300,000 a week now .
" Something 's going on .
And you ought to look into it as reporters .
Where are the masks going -- are they going out the back door ? " Mr .
Trump said .
" Somebody should probably look into that because I just do n't see from a practical standpoint how that 's possible to go from that to that , and we have that happening in numerous places .
"  The president seemed to be suggesting that New York hospitals were lying about how many masks they needed .
Trump said he was given the information about the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company that makes them who was sitting in the audience .
In fact , hospitals throughout the country have said the surge in coronavirus patients requires that doctors and nurses change masks repeatedly throughout the day to protect themselves from getting infected .
That has created a huge shortage of masks .
Trump again clashed with reporters , chiding Yamiche Alcindor , a PBS reporter , and later Jeremy Diamond , a CNN reporter , who made a point of giving his question to Ms .
Alcindor , whom the president cut off earlier in the news conference .
He instructed Ms .
Alcindor to be nice and not " threatening , " while Mr .
Diamond 's question prompted him to declare : " CNN is not trusted anymore .
They are fake news .
"  Before facing reporters , he attacked the " the Lamestream Media " on Twitter , even as he repeatedly trumpeted the high ratings for his coronavirus briefings , which have rivaled " Monday Night Football " and the season finale of " The Bachelor .
"  Mr .
Trump also denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New Jersey and Connecticut on Saturday , despite suggesting 24 hours earlier that he was seriously considering doing just that .
" I did n't do that at all .
Read the statement .
Read the statement .
Read what I said , " Mr .
Trump told a reporter .
" I said we 're going to look into possibly quarantine .
I did n't say we 're going to quarantine .
I looked at it as a possibility , because a lot of our professionals suggested quarantine .
I said we 're going to look at it .
"  The president 's musings about a ban on travel in and out of New York and the other states prompted hours of confusion and some fear as residents of the three states considered rushing to leave before the quarantine was put in place .
On Saturday evening , Mr .
Trump announced a travel advisory urging people against nonessential travel but stopping short of a quarantine .
Listen to ' The Daily ' : Back From the Brink  What one medical professional learned after being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  bars  0:00/0:00  -0:00  transcript  Listen to ' The Daily ' : Back From the Brink  Hosted by Michael Barbaro ; produced by , Clare Toeniskoetter and Michael Simon Johnson ; with help from Daniel Guillemette and Luke Vander Ploeg ; and edited by Wendy Dorr and M .
Davis Lin  What one medical professional learned after being the first confirmed coronavirus patient in New Jersey .
michael barbaro  From The New York Times , I 'm Michael Barbaro .
This is " The Daily .
"  Today : As the pandemic quickly spreads across the U .
, hundreds of hospitals are now confronting their first serious cases of the coronavirus .
Susan Dominus on the lessons from the first confirmed case in New Jersey .
It 's Monday , March 30 .
Sue , tell me how you first heard about James Cai .
susan dominus  Well , a few weeks ago I heard about this young guy , a 32-year-old physician assistant , who was the very first patient in all of New Jersey to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him while he was still at the hospital .
And I was sort of wondering , would it possibly be OK , could you maybe find some time to talk ? And he said , sure , call me now .
I 'm in isolation , in other words , and I have time .
james cai  Hello ? COUGHING  susan dominus  Are you there ?  james cai  Yes .
COUGHING  susan dominus  OK .
michael barbaro  And what was the story that he told you ?  susan dominus  So James lives and works in New York City .
james cai  So my name is James Cai , and I 'm a physician assistant .
susan dominus  And his mother and grandfather live in New Jersey , and so he spends quite a bit of time there as well .
james cai  And I work as a primary care , urgent care and nursing home P .
susan dominus  He came to this country when he was about 16 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , whom he adores .
susan dominus  Why did you go into medicine in the first place ? Why were you drawn to medicine ?  james cai  Oh , because of my grandparents .
They are doctors .
My grandfather is an anesthesiologist in Shanghai .
And when I was young , I always sick , so I always went to his hospital .
So I had a good impression .
michael barbaro  And as someone working in the medical field , was James expecting to interact with this epidemic , the coronavirus ? Was he maybe even thinking he would end up treating coronavirus patients ?  susan dominus  Well , he does n't work in a hospital .
And because he works in private practice , I think he probably imagined he might be working remotely -- with telemedicine .
james cai  I actually heard about coronavirus many months ago when China had outbreak .
But I always followed the disease .
susan dominus  But because of the family background and because he does work in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Wuhan , he definitely understood how quickly the virus could spread .
And he definitely understood that the only way to guarantee that you could survive this was by not getting it in the first place .
james cai  Around end of February , I started to pile up all the food , like canned foods , frozen vegetables , dumplings .
susan dominus  So soon after the coronavirus landed on the west coast , he and his family went to Costco and stocked up --  james cai  Our family plan is to stay home for two months .
susan dominus  -- for like , two months ' worth of supplies .
michael barbaro  Right .
So they were going to avoid any meaningful exposure to the virus ?  susan dominus  Yeah , if there was communal spread and it had become widespread , their plan was to shelter in place .
michael barbaro  And well ahead of the rest of us .
susan dominus  Yeah , I think that 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what point you would start doing that , but you felt you 'd know when it was time ?  james cai  Yes .
susan dominus  But , you know , he 's stocking up at the end of February .
You know , people in the U .
were still flying all over the country .
Kids were going to school .
Bloomberg was in the race for president .
People were planning vacations and weddings and all sorts of conferences and events .
And the same was true of James .
So like everybody else , he 's going about his life .
And around this time , without really too much concern about his health , he went to a medical conference in Times Square .
james cai  So I changed diaper for my daughter and gave her morning milk .
And I kissed my wife and to go to conference .
susan dominus  On the fourth day of the conference , Monday , March 2 , he comes down with a cough .
And he starts to realize he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to cough and a fever and tired .
susan dominus  So he leaves and texts his wife that he 's going to go to New Jersey , where his mom has a house .
His mom 's away .
And he does n't want to come home and get his wife and the baby sick .
james cai  Because of my daughter , when I went home , she always hugged me and kissed me .
And she will catch it .
michael barbaro  And what 's running through his head at this moment ? Is he thinking , I have a bad cough ? I might have the flu ? Is coronavirus even on his mind ?  susan dominus  Not really .
I mean , there had not been a single case in all of New Jersey .
He thought he probably had the flu .
By then , he was mostly feeling this bad cough .
He had an elevated heart rate .
His eyes were really runny .
He had diarrhea .
He was not feeling well at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , he decided to go to one of those drop-in centers to get a flu test , because he wanted to be told he did n't have the flu so he could go home .
So the doctor gives him a strep test and a flu test .
They discuss whether he should get a coronavirus test , in fact , but the doctor did n't have one .
So they moved on .
And the results came back that although the strep and the flu tests were negative , his symptoms were consistent with something called a pulmonary embolism , which is a clot in your lung that can be fatal .
michael barbaro  So this could potentially be even more serious than just a seasonal flu or --  susan dominus  Yes .
Certainly more serious than the flu .
james cai  So after , I went direct to the Hackensack emergency room .
susan dominus  So the doctor sends him to the E .
at the Hackensack University Medical Center , which is not far from that doctor 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they asked me questions .
Asked me if I cough .
I said , I do , I do have cough .
I do have shortness of breath .
susan dominus  So as called for , the doctors do a CT scan .
And after they do , they realize that , no , he does not have a pulmonary embolism .
But that in fact , because of the symptoms he 's having and the way his lungs look in the scan --  james cai  They see a ground glass nodules .
So this can be coronavirus .
susan dominus  -- he might actually have coronavirus .
michael barbaro  And how do the doctors at this hospital react to that ?  susan dominus  Well , at this point , they have n't seen any coronavirus patients .
So they do n't seem to him terribly alarmed .
That said , they do put him in a tiny isolation room , a windowless room on the floor of the emergency room .
That 's where he spends the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnerved and feeling quite ill .
james cai  I was nervous .
And at the same time , since I 'm in the hospital , I 'm going to check everything .
Make sure I 'm OK and then I go home .
susan dominus  So then on Tuesday , March 3 , which is the second day in the hospital --  james cai  They decide to do a test on me .
So the test takes about 24 hours or 48 hours .
susan dominus  -- they do a Covid-19 test .
And they tell him he 's going to have to wait a few days for the result , but he should n't worry , he 's young and healthy .
At the same time , he 's wildly Googling symptoms for Covid-19 and realizing that he has almost every one of them .
james cai  I had maybe lied to myself , was like , trying to calm myself down .
I do n't have the Covid-19 , I should n't have it .
susan dominus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hospital .
It 's Wednesday , March 4 .
He 's still waiting for the results in his tiny little room with a TV .
And --  archived recording  SOUND OF LOCAL NEWS THEME  susan dominus  -- a local news report comes on .
archived recording ( newscaster 1 )  We we begin tonight with breaking news regarding the coronavirus .
archived recording ( newscaster 2 )  Yeah , that virus arriving in the Garden State tonight .
Governor Phil Murphy announcing the first presumptive positive case of the virus right here in New Jersey .
susan dominus  And the news report says --  archived recording ( newscaster 2 )  A man in his thirties is hospitalized in Bergen County .
susan dominus  There 's a guy in his thirties in Bergen County , which is where he is , who 's tested positive for coronavirus .
It 's the first case in New Jersey .
archived recording ( newscaster 2 )  Governor Murphy saying --  susan dominus  There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .
archived recording ( newscaster 2 )  -- " We take this situation very seriously and have been preparing for this for weeks .
I urge residents to remain calm " --  susan dominus  And it occurs to James , they really might be talking about him .
james cai  And then I asked the doctor , saying , is this me ? And the doctor 's saying , no , your test is not back yet .
michael barbaro  And of course , he has n't heard anything about the results of his test yet ?  susan dominus  No , he has not heard anything .
susan dominus  Wow .
So you found out from the news from the governor of New Jersey ?  james cai  Yes .
On TV .
And I asked the doctor .
The doctor say , the result is not back yet .
susan dominus  And then the next day , his doctors come to him and say , yes , you have tested positive .
And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested positive for Covid-19 .
michael barbaro  Right .
And perhaps the first person in the history of the universe to find out he has a disease , not from his doctor , but from TV news .
susan dominus  Let 's hope so .
michael barbaro  And how does the hospital react in this moment ?  susan dominus  So he 's really scared .
But the hospital is telling him that he really has nothing to worry about .
He 's a 32-year-old guy .
He 's got no preexisting conditions .
If it 's not because everybody is talking about corona , you can go home already .
susan dominus  You know , if it were n't for all this attention about the coronavirus , you 'd be home right now , just getting better in the comfort of your own bedroom .
michael barbaro  In other words , it would probably just self-resolve in somebody of his health ?  susan dominus  That was definitely the expectation .
james cai  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  susan dominus  I think he felt that as a medical professional , he actually -- he knew that he was quite vulnerable , that nobody was invulnerable .
And there was this disconnect between his own concerns and their own insistence that he was overly anxious .
james cai  America is not ready .
susan dominus  It also dawns on him that he is the first person in this hospital to be treated for coronavirus .
james cai  I feel like , I 'm in real trouble .
Why I come to this hospital ? Because I feel they do n't know how to treat this disease , and they do n't have deep understanding about this disease .
susan dominus  Nobody there has any experience .
Nobody there can make good predictions .
Nobody there has institutional knowledge about what happens when this goes wrong or something unexpected happens .
He 's the first person , and that 's a very frightening position to be in .
michael barbaro  We 'll be right back .
So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation at this hospital in Hackensack , New Jersey .
He 's been there for about four days .
Physically , how is he doing at this point ?  susan dominus  When you first got the results of the positive test , on a scale of 1 to 10 , how bad did you feel physically ? 10 being the worst ?  james cai  I would say 10 .
susan dominus  Wow .
susan dominus  He is feeling worse by the day .
james cai  Getting worse .
So my heart is compensating , beating very fast .
susan dominus  He definitely has that cough .
And he also is having real trouble breathing .
james cai  It 's like I 'm in the water .
susan dominus  Tell me more about that .
james cai  It 's like , normally , we can just take very deep breaths in and out .
susan dominus  He describes it as that feeling when you 're under water and you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite get that oxygen that you want .
And it 's very panicking feeling .
It 's a very scary feeling .
james cai  So my lung is not allowing me to take deep breaths .
michael barbaro  And how is the hospital treating him now that he 's officially tested positive ?  susan dominus  They move him to a room with certain protections in place .
And they 're keeping an eye on his numbers .
And they 're giving him oxygen when he needs it .
And he 's also keeping an eye on his numbers .
And he 's worried , because he is not breathing well .
And on Friday , March 6 , his fifth day in the hospital , he worries that he is desaturating to a dangerous level .
james cai  And I desats .
susan dominus  He desats .
susan dominus  You desaturated .
michael barbaro  And what does that mean , to desaturate ?  susan dominus  It means that when you desaturate below a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your lungs for you to function in a normal , healthy way .
And this is really concerning to him .
james cai  You have pneumonia , it 's normal .
Just use oxygen .
susan dominus  But he still has the sense that the hospital is telling him he 's overreacting , that he 's being too anxious .
He 's going to recover just fine .
james cai  I was confused .
And also , I was worried , because I think I 'm not getting enough care .
And my oxygen level dropped , and they -- they can not even see it .
michael barbaro  And why do you think people in hospital are saying that ? And maybe more importantly , why are they thinking that ? Why are they insisting on being so calm about what it would mean to have an infection like this ?  susan dominus  I would have to guess that it 's because the widespread impression that people had was that young people were not going to be terribly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel like a very , very bad flu .
And that he was going to recover just fine , just like the statistics supposedly said he was going to .
susan dominus  And did you actually feel yourself having difficulty breathing at that point ?  james cai  I just feel tightness .
susan dominus  Tightness in your chest ?  james cai  I feel like , a very scary -- very scared .
And I do n't know what to do next .
susan dominus  And James is all too aware that no one in that hospital has ever treated anyone with coronavirus .
And he 's really worried about his symptoms , because he knows he 's feeling worse and worse every day .
james cai  So I told my cousin , I told everybody , and they just start searching .
susan dominus  So he starts reaching out to friends of his who are plugged into the Chinese medical community , including his best friend , who 's a physician -- and whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they start making phone calls and trying to get information from experienced people who can maybe share what they 've learned .
michael barbaro  Which is what ?  susan dominus  You know , there 's advice that he should get high doses of vitamin C , there 's some discussion of whether he should get a steroid treatment if things get worse .
james cai  He translate the seventh edition .
susan dominus  They say that maybe he wants to look into antiviral medication .
They tell him he should n't wait too long before getting a second CT scan .
But his doctors were really reluctant to do that .
michael barbaro  Why was that ?  susan dominus  They felt like they were giving him good care and that probably the results of the CT scan would not change that .
michael barbaro  So James is more or less beginning to advise his own doctors on how to treat him , based on his research , based on his relationship with other medical professionals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Very unusual .
And then the evening of the 7th , he starts desaturating to a level that really scares him .
He 's concerned that if he desaturates to a certain degree , there could be no turning back .
He 'd have to be intubated , which definitely increases , you know , all of the risks of the illness .
It would mean that a machine was going be doing all the breathing for him .
It could lead to organ failure and in some cases , of course , death .
james cai  And I mean , if I intubated at night , I probably would just die by myself alone , without seeing the loved ones .
susan dominus  And his friends -- also , some of them see this real urgency to save his life .
And you know , one of his friends said to me that he personally felt responsible for making sure that the doctors took James 's case as seriously as possible .
Here he is .
He 's the first health care worker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't make it , it was going to feel like the battle was over before it had even begun .
james cai  You always live in fear that you 're never going to wake up .
And also , in isolation .
And nobody can see you .
So it 's very miserable .
If people die , think about it , people die and they can not see their loved ones .
What -- I mean , like , I feel like it 's very tough , right ? For somebody to die alone .
susan dominus  You were scared .
I mean , you were probably too weak to really speak forcefully , but you were letting them know that you felt that your life was on the line at this point .
james cai  Yeah .
susan dominus  And we do n't exactly know why , but on the 8th , he did get that second CT scan .
james cai  And it come back very bad .
susan dominus  It 's bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 percent of his lungs seem to be affected .
That 's astonishing , that it would go from a small spot just a few days earlier to where it is now .
And if he had gotten that bad in three days or four days since the last CT scan , how much worse was he going to be in another four days ? And now , James starts to worry that he really might not survive this .
james cai  I was praying to everybody , to God , to Buddha , to everybody , saying , do n't let me die .
When I know my oxygen levels keep desaturating , one of my requests is can I see my mother and my wife or my daughter for the last time ? It was that time , when my chest X-rays show so bad , and my oxygen level every day is dropping , and I would tell them that I have to be strong , but I do n't know how many days I can live .
And the good thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw second CT , she was like , OK , we have to treat you .
susan dominus  I spoke to a doctor at the hospital who was part of the team overseeing his care .
And he said they 'd been looking at the whole clinical picture , had recognized that he was declining even before the CT scan .
But from James 's point of view , everything changed after the scan .
He feels like , now they 're taking this very seriously and they 're listening to him .
They 're coming around to seeing just how serious it is .
And also recognizing that , yes , even a young person can get very , very sick with coronavirus .
And they 're willing to try something .
michael barbaro  And at this stage , what is he asking them to do ?  james cai  So then a doctor in China recommend a high-flow machine .
susan dominus  James wants a few different types of treatment .
He 's been advised that the doctors should try providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to go on three experimental antiviral medications -- Kaletra , chloroquine and remdesivir .
And at this point , he and the doctors at Hackensack and all the other doctors he 's working with are pretty much all on the same page .
He finally gets the main things he 's been asking for .
james cai  And I think the next day , Dr .
INAUDIBLE came in .
He said , the medication 's here .
We 're going to give it to you .
susan dominus  And finally , after more than a week in the hospital , James starts to turn around .
He does start to feel better .
And does he have a sense , do you have a sense , do his doctors have a sense of which of these treatments was responsible for that ?  susan dominus  Not really .
I mean , it might have been any one of the drugs , or all of the drugs , or the oxygen , or some combination of that .
Or he might have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know .
susan dominus  And so I asked you how you felt on a scale of 1 to 10 , 10 being the worst , when you first got the results of the test , and you said that you were a 10 .
On a scale of 1 to 10 , how do you feel now ?  james cai  I would say now , maybe 3 .
susan dominus  That 's pretty good .
james cai  Yeah , because I feel like all the symptoms have gone .
I mean , I will be maybe no worry if tests come back negative .
Then I know the virus is dead .
Now , I do n't know if it is dead or not .
susan dominus  It 's now 10:37 , and I need you to get a good night 's sleep .
So I 'm going to call you in the morning and see how your oxygen level were .
Is that OK ?  james cai  Yes .
Thank you .
susan dominus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bye .
james cai  Good night .
Bye-bye .
michael barbaro  Sue , it feels -- correct me if I 'm wrong -- like a big reason why James survived was because he was such an aggressive advocate for himself .
And he had this network of expertise that he could tap into .
He himself was a medical professional .
And that that put him in a very strong position .
But I wonder why the people around him in this hospital were not better prepared , given the stage of this pandemic when he arrived in Hackensack .
susan dominus  We do n't really know what saved his life , because these drugs are still in clinical trials .
What we do know is that the entire story of coronavirus in this country is a story of lack of preparation .
People did not believe that it simply was never going to be as bad here as it was in Wuhan or Milan .
That is a universal story .
It was hardly just these doctors at this hospital .
I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
They are moving things really quickly .
They are saving lives every day .
In fact , we all know that they 're saving lives and putting their own lives on the line right now .
But also , it is just hard to put yourself back in that moment -- March 1 , March 2 or the end of February -- and remember how unlikely we all still hoped and believed , against all evidence , that this was n't going to be devastating here the way it was elsewhere .
michael barbaro  Right .
susan dominus  That said , to their credit , the doctors at this hospital were open-minded and they were flexible and they were nimble .
And they were willing to try whatever they could that was safe when they realized that whatever they had been doing definitely was not working .
And I know James feels really appreciative , ultimately .
He sent out a tweet that expressed his gratitude for the hospital saving , as he sees it , his life .
michael barbaro  Sue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of James , his very unique situation in these early days of the pandemic in the United States , and of what happened to him at this hospital ?  susan dominus  One of the things that I 'm hearing from doctors is that until you are in this moment and experiencing the onslaught of patients , it is very hard to imagine it .
You ca n't really know until you 're actually living it .
And you know , every hospital in this country is likely to have its James .
It 's going to have that first patient who comes in , who is really ill .
They 're not exactly sure how to treat it .
We still really do n't know how best to treat this virus .
That is the hard , cold truth of it .
There are some protocols that we hope will help , that are thought might help .
But it 's unclear .
It 's so new .
And it 's going to be really hard for all those hospitals .
And they 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make complicated ethical choices .
They 're going to have to make decisions on the fly and build up their clinical experience .
And it 's not going to be easy for any of them .
michael barbaro  Sue , how is James doing at this point ? I do n't know when the last time it was that you spoke with him , but what did he tell you ?  susan dominus  He 's home .
He is still in quarantine .
So he still has not been able to see his wife or daughter .
And his lungs are still recovering .
It 's unclear just how fully they will recover .
You know , it 's definitely a long road ahead of him .
And at the same time , you know , he 's reading the news and he is feeling so lucky .
michael barbaro  Lucky to be alive ?  susan dominus  To be alive .
michael barbaro  Thank you , Sue .
susan dominus  Thank you , Michael .
james @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James , it 's Sue .
How are you doing ?  james cai  I 'm good .
susan dominus  Are you actually in your own home ?  james cai  Yes .
susan dominus  How does it feel ?  james cai  It feels great .
I 'm going to sleep on my own bed .
susan dominus  Fantastic .
james cai  Once I 'm out of the hospital , I feel like I 'm alive .
I feel like everything is so new to me .
The grass , trees , cars , new people face , the sky .
And then when I drive on the road , I appreciate every building , every people I see .
I feel like it 's a second chance to live again , to be alive .
susan dominus  What is the first thing you 're going to say to your daughter and wife when you finally get to see them in person ? I know you 're quarantining for almost two more weeks now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my daughter and my wife , I definitely will give them big hugs .
Try to do n't let them go .
I maybe will , like , have my daughter in my arms all the time .
I will come home and spend every minute with my family .
Appreciate every day , living .
susan dominus  All right .
Good night .
Have a great night 's sleep .
Thanks , James .
james cai  Thank you .
Thank you for checking in on me .
susan dominus  My pleasure .
Goodbye .
james cai  Bye-bye .

Here 's what else you need to know today .
In interviews on Sunday , members of the president 's coronavirus task force delivered dire warnings about the pandemic 's projected path in the United States .
archived recording ( dr .
deborah birx )  No state , no metro area will be spared .
And the sooner we react , and the sooner the states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full mitigation , at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need , then we 'll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans .
michael barbaro  Speaking to NBC News , Dr .
Deborah Birx said that the White House was asking every state to prepare for the kind of outbreak now occurring in New York , where there are about 60,000 infections .
archived recording ( jake tapper )  Well , Dr .
Birx said yesterday , as you know , that she does n't think any city will be spared from this virus .
How many cases do you think the U .
will reach ?  archived recording ( dr .
anthony fauci )  I mean , looking at what we 're seeing now , you know , I would say between 100 and 200,000 cases -- excuse me , deaths .
But I just do n't think that we really need to make a projection when it 's such a moving target .
michael barbaro  On CNN , Dr .
Anthony Fauci said that millions of Americans could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could die .
archived recording ( dr .
anthony fauci )  What we do know , Jake , is that we 've got a serious problem in New York .
We have a serious problem in New Orleans .
And we 're going to be developing serious problems in other areas .
michael barbaro  On Sunday night , the president extended federal guidelines for social distancing to the end of April and backed away from his previous plan to open up much of the country by Easter .
That 's it for " The Daily .

What if somebody in my family gets sick ?  If the family member does n't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home , you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms , while also keeping as much distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's space , the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom .
If masks are available , both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room .
Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters , doorknobs , toilets and tables .
Do n't forget to wash your hands frequently .
Should I wear a mask ?  Experts are divided on how much protection a regular surgical mask , or even a scarf , can provide for people who are n't yet sick .
The W .
and C .
say that unless you 're already sick , or caring for someone who is , wearing a face mask is n't necessary .
And stockpiling high-grade N95 masks will make it harder for nurses and other workers to access the resources they need .
But researchers are also finding that there are more cases of asymptomatic transmission than were known early on in the pandemic .
And a few experts say that masks could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to stay 6 feet away from other people .
Masks do n't replace hand-washing and social distancing .
Should I stock up on groceries ?  Plan two weeks of meals if possible .
But people should not hoard food or supplies .
