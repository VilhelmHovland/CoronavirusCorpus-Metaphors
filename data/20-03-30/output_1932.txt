Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett said courts had already put in place arrangements to use telephone and video to allow some hearings to continue .
But he said jury trials could not be conducted remotely amid the coronavirus pandemic .
" My unequivocal position is that no jury trials or other physical hearings can take place unless it is safe for them to do so , " he said .
" A particular concern is to ensure social distancing in court and in the court building .
"  No new trials will start , as of this morning , and efforts to bring existing jury trials to a conclusion should continue , the chief justice said .
If necessary , existing cases will be adjourned to allow safety measures to be brought in .
