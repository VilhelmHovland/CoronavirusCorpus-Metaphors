Dr David Wilson 30/03/20  I 'm reminded of a John Ralston Saul quote : " If economists were doctors , they 'd be mired in malpractice suits .
" Are you getting a little tired of commentators guessing , sorry " forecasting " , about how bad this is all going to turn out ? I am .
Solutions lie with our businesses and our innovators .
A combined public , civic and private sector effort now will get us through .
Dealing with complexity requires the best minds at the right time for the right task , working together .
We need responsive institutions , a systems approach and adaptability .
We need solutions .
So far Government has done all the right things in a Covid-19 health response .
As Assoc Professor James Ussher has said here RNZ ' NZ has a chance to eliminate Covid-19 ' and Government may have set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Right now , though , its survival mode .
Survival of viable businesses and employment relationships are critical .
We need to throw our SMEs and innovators some lifelines .
Government has said that it is talking to our large businesses , OK , hope that is more than Air NZ .
That 's not fair , I know MPI and NZTE , for example , are working very hard to keep key exports moving in China and looking for other markets .
Some of our larger businesses are retail groups , and I 'm pleased MBIE has moved to widen the criteria for essential goods and services , this can lay the ground for further online commerce as we seek to recover .
So , here 's my starter for $300Bn ( our GDP ) .
I 'm seeing the next year in terms of three phases for the economy ; survival -- recovery -- rebound .
Survival : well you can guess what that means in economic terms .
Recovery , ideas flying around all over the place about that , it 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's about how we take this opportunity to diversify and strengthen our economy .
These three phases do not have to be linear they will overlap and for some run in parallel .
Small business is big business .
What I am hearing from businesses , and agencies on the ground is the outlook is dire and confidence low .
Meanwhile the many ideas and policies being floated by the public sector are really recovery ideas ; infrastructure spend , PGF re-allocation , fast-forwarding projects and government guaranteed business loans .
Lockdown essentially nullifies many of these efforts and businesses must be ready to take up the opportunities when they can .
Recovery planning can happen right now for those that know they can survive and can maybe take on more debt .
But unless you have a strong balance sheet , and or market opportunities , taking on more debt is not going to be your first move .
Survival is .
We , therefore , need to ensure that viable businesses can survive and let the private sector know NZ Inc is behind them .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to be supported through that , but many profitable businesses will also become collateral damage if we deliberate too long .
That has extreme ramifications for society and the economy .
No cashflow with overdrafts and loans to service , suppliers , rent , tax and wages to pay is a recipe for disaster .
International evidence suggests that most SMEs can not last past three weeks with no income ( high cashflow-dependent businesses like tourism , retail and restaurants even less ) , let alone a month .
We need to act now .
Putting an economy on life support and expecting businesses to hibernate is expecting too much .
And , it 's not a good strategy .
You try it , spend normally and go without income for a month and see where that leads , that 's right you do n't just lose income you go backwards twice as fast .
With a business that path is amplified because the stakes are higher ; the domino effects to mental health , marriages , families , suppliers and employees can be catastrophic .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redundancy in the psychological literature is regarded as a ' major life event ' right up there with marriage breakdown and deaths in the family , we should not take this lightly .
I have heard some people , mainly those on public sector salaries , express a kind of Darwinian sentiment in that only the best will survive .
Well , just like addressing Covid-19 through ' herd immunity ' , I do n't like the picture that paints in terms of collateral damage .
From an economy-wide perspective , it is way harder for new businesses to start up than for those with established relationships , clients and supply chains to recover .
It just hurts less all round .
So , how can we ensure that viable businesses survive on little or no revenue ? Well , reducing their outgoings is a start .
Incremental recovery tactics are others .
Usually the first to go are employees .
This is a bad idea , as Sam Stubbs said here ' now is the time for employers to keep faith with employees ' .
Businesses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their knowledge , their networks and relationships .
Replacing them after the fact slows down and weakens recovery .
After the Sars pandemic airlines took nine months to get back to pre-pandemic numbers and that reverberated throughout the tourism and hospitality industries .
Covid-19 looks worse .
The wage subsidy scheme is softening the blow for employers and employees in this respect , but it needs to form part of a wider business survival plan .
Painful business closures , mass redundancies , high unemployment and a drawn-out recovery awaits inaction .
Many businesses , regardless of maturity , have debt to service , sometimes at quite high interest rates .
Landlords will not be wanting to forgive rent as that 's their income , especially if they themselves have significant debt to service , and yet rent is one of the most significant costs for a business or those renting in the housing market .
Banks have a key role to play .
Last week Government announced that they had negotiated mortgage holidays with Banks , to which my response was ' great ' , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier , ' but the devil is in the detail ' , and it was .
What the banks have offered is not much more than what they would normally offer distressed clients ; a mortgage holiday where interest accrues .
This is a disgrace .
A slogan with no substance .
People are already distressed this just prolongs the pain and adds to it as interest will become principle at the end of the " holiday " .
No , a mortgage holiday for distressed clients in these circumstances should be just that -- a holiday , with no penalty .
The recent lowering of the OCR by 75 basis points to 0 .
had a similar response from retail banks , a small movement in floating rates .
This is simply not good enough from our banking system in a global economic crisis .
I seem to remember in 2009 the taxpayer underwrote banks in the fallout from the GFC ; time to return the favour .
Demand is tanking as a result of Covid-19 .
This is far from normal ; it is an unexpected exogenous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-emerging China for our food exporters , and hopefully logs , but that will not stem the tide for much of the rest of the economy .
Extraordinary times require extraordinary responses .
That is why alongside the quick fiscal response that Government has put in place , the quantitative easing measures the Reserve Bank have announced , we need a business survival plan and our whole banking system to step up .
On several occasions , I have suggested that the Reserve Bank lower the OCR into negative territory .
Economist Michael Reddell is suggesting negative 5% .
This would not only allow banks to offer mortgages and business interest rates at , say , 0% it would give viable SMEs a debt holiday while they attend to a myriad of other commitments , and homeowners the chance to hunker down .
If landlords get temporary reprieve in the cost of their debt , then rent holidays become viable .
Government needs to find ways to support business survival .
The OCR , set by the Reserve Bank , is the main tool that addresses inflationary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is something we can do that will have an economy-wide effect quickly .
Retail Banks will need to think about their social license to operate during this crisis and pass on any OCR drops to their customers , immediately .
Businesses need to find ways to maintain employment and lockdown other costs .
We all know that in crisis there is opportunity , but this is not a normal recession or business cycle downturn .
A debt breather for our businesses , landlords and homeowners may actually allow us to survive the storm .
Let 's get survival sorted first , then we will have the breathing room to plan for recovery and beyond .
