We Spoke To The Aussie Legend Who Went Viral For Dancing To The PM 's Coronavirus Presser  SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY  Thanks for signing up !  When Scott Morrison chastised ABC journalist Andrew Probyn during a televised press conference , TikTok turned it into a meme overnight .
It was only a matter of days before a dance remix dropped , and now Melbourne art director Jeff van de Zandt has found himself as the unintended face of it .
Van de Zandt had been lip-syncing online for years , back since the days of Dubsmash .
Currently on self-isolation at home , the 30-year-old was perfectly poised to become the face of the meme .
" Work completely dried up and I was like , I have nothing to do and I 'm stuck at home .
So I just decided to start doing one TikTok a day and then people started sharing that particular dance and now it 's gone mental , " he told PEDESTRIAN .
" I feel like such a fraud because all I 'm doing is lip-syncing to the track ; I 'm actually doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The original remix of Scott Morrison 's lecture over the beats of Duke Dumont 's Red Light Green Light was uploaded to TikTok by Triple J a day earlier .
It 's been liked over 44,000 times .
Van de Zandt 's TikTok , by comparison , has around three thousand likes , making it the sound 's third-most-popular upload .
But off TikTok , Van de Zandt has become the face of the tune .
Within just two days it had gone viral on Facebook , Twitter and even Instagram .
While his video did not take over TikTok , it did spread all over the rest of the internet .
" The message that I get the most is that it 's .
a moment to laugh about something rather than their feed that 's constantly full of drama all the crap in the media , " he said .
Sometimes watching a cute boy bop with a fan -- even if the tune is the Prime Minister berating a journo at a coronavirus press conference -- is enough to take your mind off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been watching some of the PM 's press conferences while cooped up at home , but even he admits it all gets a bit too much sometimes .
He 's been off work in self-isolation for two weeks and said he 's " not into the politics but literally just doing it for the fun .
"  Since the video went viral , Van de Zandt 's mates have been pinging him every time someone famous shares it on social media .
He lists Zo ? Foster Blake , Matty J and the ABC 's own Leigh Sales as some of his favourites .
" It 's mental .
I 'm getting sent the Leigh Sales one the most , because she 's such a legit , hardcore journalist on the ABC , I was like ' wow that 's that 's a big deal for someone to be sharing something as silly as this ' , " he said .

" People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ' OMG we had so much to do with each other .

It 's not the first time Van de Zandt has poked fun at Scott Morrison 's prolific coronavirus press conferences .
When Kate McLennan and Kate McCartney from Get Krack ! nparodied the PM 's vague lockdown rules on Twitter , he uploaded the audio to TikTok .
It 's now been lip-synced by countless other Aussies on the app .
He 's also the first person to lip-sync Sammy J'stake on the press conferences .
Van de Zandt 's theory as to why this particular TikTok of him dancing has blown up is simple : " It 's so out of character for a prime minister to have a go to someone like that publicly .
It 's like he 's a teacher in a classroom of children .
"  As for whether he 's Team Andrew or Team Katherine , Van de Zandt has cast his lot with Guardian Australia 's Katherine Murphy , even whipping out a fan when the PM mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " .
