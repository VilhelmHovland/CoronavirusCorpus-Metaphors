The potential introduction of harsher penalties for those not complying with new restrictions implemented in Tasmania to slow the spread of COVID-19 has been met with concern by the Australian Lawyers Alliance .
After announcing further restrictions on non-essential activities on Monday , Premier Peter Gutwein said he was considering introducing on-the-spot fines for people disobeying the rules with penalties up to $16,800 already in place .
Coronavirus : All the latest updates on COVID-19 for Tasmania ALA spokesman and barrister Greg Barns said , while it was understandable and desirable for the government to move quickly to protect the community in any way it could , the state needed to ensure the public and the police had a full understanding of the new restrictions .
" There is a risk that we will see inappropriate uses of police power , such as arrests and the issuing of on-the-spot fines in circumstances where it 's unfair to do so , " Mr Barns said .
" To arrest a person or issue a large on-the-spot fine should be a last resort .
These are draconian penalties .
" Mr Barns said he was particularly concerned about the homeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public areas .
He said more detail was needed on the directives given by the Premier .
" Although it 's academic now , on the issue of congregating with 10 or more people there was no definition of congregating .
Or , for example , defining what is unnecessary travel , " Mr Barns said .
" The Alliance is n't saying these measures are n't necessary but the law must be certain , it must be known by everyone and we must guard carefully against abuse of police power .
" He said people should know their rights to challenge a fine or arrest .
" People should seek legal advice if they are issued a fine and are unhappy about it , " Mr Barns said .
Tasmania Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Higgins said reports of non-compliance referred to police would be dealt with on a case by case basis .
" There have been very high levels of compliance and understanding of the requirements , but we continue to get reports of people flouting the requirements in some public places and it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner Higgins said .
" Those required to isolate must fully adhere to the requirement and be aware that if they blatantly disregard these directions then police will initiate formal proceedings .
" More than 1300 police compliance checks have been done on people in quarantine across the state since March 25 .
Mr Gutwein said around 40 cases of minor non-compliance had been identified .
" There have been 10 people who have received fines for camping in areas that they should n't camp , " Mr Gutwein said .
" In terms of the breaches , if they are blatant then people will be charged .
" Mr Gutwein encouraged members of the community to contact Tasmania Police on 131 444 if they knew of someone not following the rules .
