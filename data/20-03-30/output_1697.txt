A Derbyshire union has criticised Sky for keeping call centre staff in Derby working during the coronavirus pandemic .
Dave Gorton , area organiser for the Derbyshire branch of Unison , says there is " nothing essential " about work taking place at Firstsource in Pride Park .
" The work being carried out is to alter Sky television packages , " he said .
" How on earth can this be considered essential ? To do this , hundreds of employees are being crammed in a call centre with no attempt to maintain social distancing " .
Mr Gorton went on to say : " When thousands of Derbyshire people stood on their doorsteps last week applauding the work done by NHS staff and other key workers during this emergency , I do n't believe they were including Sky in their thoughts .
" This is an abuse by a multinational company to maintain its profits , putting ordinary Derbyshire workers and their families at risk .
It must be stopped now .

" It is vital that a core team continue to work to support our customers , particularly vulnerable ones who we are prioritizing .
"  They went on to point out that Sky is not dealing with new sales , installs or upgrades and that they have reduced the numbers of staff in call centres to around 30% of the usual workforce .
They added that remaining workers are subject to " rigorous " social distancing plans and temperature checks in the office , which will be kept " under continuous review for the safety of our colleagues over the coming weeks " .
