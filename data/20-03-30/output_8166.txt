Congress has passed a $2 trillion emergency relief bill that will expand unemployment insurance , provide $1,200 stimulus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide life preservers to distressed businesses impacted by the COVID-19 epidemic .
The bill , touted as the largest economic stimulus package in U .
history , was passed by the U .
Senate and U .
House this week and is expected to be signed by the president .
William Lastrapes , the Bernard B .
and Eugenia A .
Ramsey Chair of Private Enterprise in the department of economics at the University of Georgia , argues Congress had to take action .
What has this pandemic done to the U .
economy ? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has inflicted two negative shocks on the U .
economy .
One is a " supply " shock -- much of what the economy produces depends on face-to-face human interaction ; the social distancing so necessary to slow the spread of the virus reduces our capacity to produce goods and services .
The other is a " demand " shock -- laid-off workers and falling output cause incomes to fall , which in turn constrains the ability of households and businesses to spend .
These distinct shocks clearly reinforce each other in a downward spiral of economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan ? Because the current situation is a global epidemic and economic crisis , the U .
federal government must act to stabilize the economy and provide a sense of security to the nation 's citizens .
The $2 trillion stimulus package just passed by Congress aims to do this .
The package is an unprecedented amount -- the Recovery Act of 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis came in at just under $900 billion -- and we should think of it as an insurance payment made by the government to U .
households and businesses in light of a massive , harmful and unpredictable event , one so big and systematic that private insurance can not cover it .
But the federal government can , through its ability to tax and spread the costs over people and over time .
The government 's stimulus check puts money in people 's pockets for them to spend now , when spending is needed , even though incomes are falling .
It also aims to protect private credit markets to keep money flowing between borrowers and lenders .
The federal injection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinating a rise in overall spending .
It is unlikely that even with this fiscal stimulus a recession will be avoided , but perhaps a long-lasting and deep depression can be .
Can the federal government afford a $2 trillion stimulus plan ? Most of the stimulus package comes in the form of " transfer payments " from one group of individuals to another .
For example , the plan allocates $250 billion to boost unemployment insurance for those losing jobs , $301 billion in direct cash transfers to individuals , and $349 billion in loans to small businesses to help make payroll , rent and utility payments .
Another $150 billion flows as direct aid to states , while almost half a trillion dollars will be set aside to support the Federal Reserve System 's new lending facilities , aimed at providing needed liquidity to the banking and business sectors .
None of these programs entail direct spending by the government ( like , say , building a road or a dam ) .
There is no question of affordability here .
The federal government must of course " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow cheaply now , by issuing debt at current low interest rates , lowers any real resource constraints .
( And the Federal Reserve can help by printing money , although this power held by our central bank should be used cautiously .
) Additional debt allows the government to give to those in need and take from future taxpayers when the economy returns to normal .
As long as the country remains productive in the long run -- which it surely will -- and maintains healthy fiscal institutions , those taxes will not be a burden to future generations , and the federal government will not default on the national debt .
What should we do once we recover from this crisis ? It is painfully clear that the federal government was caught off guard by the coronavirus despite having ample warning that an epidemic of its kind was likely to happen , sooner rather than later .
We should also not have been surprised at how quickly the virus has spread across the world given the pace of globalization .
Macroeconomic policy mechanisms are in place -- like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stabilize credit markets -- to respond to a crisis by softening the economic blows .
Yet the country needs to be better prepared for the next epidemic , which will surely come , to help prevent a crisis in the first place .
We are now observing firsthand how shortcomings in our public health system can have drastic , and possibly , dire consequences for our economy and our well-being .
Journalists face some unique challenges when they try to report accurately on a major infectious disease outbreak like the one associated with COVID-19 , according to professor Glen Nowak , director of the Center for Health and Risk Communication in the Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia and a former director of media relations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , including during the 2009 H1N1A influenza pandemic .
Below , Nowak provides his thoughts about the communication challenges facing journalists and the public when it comes to COVID-19 tests and testing .
Why has COVID-19 testing been in the news ? Diagnostic tests and testing are an essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cases of new infectious disease have been identified , health care providers need to be able to quickly determine who else is infected , particularly other people who have similar symptoms , while public health officials need to quickly learn how many others have been infected , where infections and virus transmission are happening , and which people may be most likely to be infected and to have severe illness from their infections .
News media are interested in providing their audiences that information as quickly as possible .
In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U .
, testing also made the news because there were problems with the initial test that CDC provided to state labs .
This caused delays in being able to identify patients with COVID-19 .
Much attention has been given to the importance of testing , including because some countries , such as South Korea , have been able to quickly and extensively test people to determine if they are infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and as a result , slow its spread .
Why will COVID-19 testing continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests and testing will continue to be in the news for at least three reasons .
One , President Trump has said that a goal going forward is for anyone who wants to be tested to be able to do so .
This means many news media will continue to be doing stories about the availability of COVID-19 tests at the local and state level .
The supply of COVID-19 diagnostic tests is currently well short of the number needed to achieve this goal and supplies vary considerably across the country .
Two , there is disagreement about who needs to be tested and who should be tested .
Hospitals and health care facilities that are dealing with large numbers of infected and potentially infected patients do not have the ability to test people with mild or no symptoms .
As a result , we can expect news media stories about who can and can not get tested .
Third , the information gained from diagnostic tests increases medical , science and public health knowledge regarding where this new coronavirus is , how many infections it is causing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected experience , and the percentage of people who experienced severe illness or died from their infection .
That knowledge , in turn , is used to make decisions about how to slow and prevent the spread of the virus .
What are some of the communication challenges that COVID-19 tests and testing bring ? COVID-19 tests and testing bring many communication challenges .
One challenge involves competing messages regarding who should be tested and how the tests should be used .
While the CDC has issued and posted specific recommendations regarding who should be tested , decisions about testing are at the discretion of state and local health departments and individual clinicians .
Some are testing people who do not have known exposures to the virus or who have mild symptoms , while others are limiting testing to people in risk groups or who have significant symptoms .
A second challenge is that there are different types of tests and different testing methods .
There is not a single COVID-19 test .
Most of the COVID-19 test and testing stories have focused on diagnostic tests -- that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
There are many companies providing these types of tests , with the time it takes to get results ranging from as short as 45 minutes to as long as a few days .
Less attention has been given to efforts involving the development and use of tests that can tell whether a person has been infected in the past with this new coronavirus .
These are typically blood tests that look for antibodies that indicate if a person was infected .
These tests are important because they help provide estimates of how many COVID-19 cases have gone undetected .
This type of testing increases understanding of how many people had no symptoms or symptoms so mild that they were not noticed .
As this information becomes available , there is a good chance it will increase significantly increase the number of confirmed cases and lower fatality estimates .
It is essential to accurately convey this information without creating the impression that the increase in confirmed cases involves new infections .
When it comes to COVID-19 tests and testing , what advice do you have for the news media ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is important that journalists , news media outlets , the public and policymakers understand that different types and uses of testing will be done going forward .
They also need to understand the reasons for using and not using diagnostic tests , especially as tests become more widely available .
Finally , it will be helpful for journalists and policymakers to understand the difference between using tests to make medical diagnoses versus the use of testing to learn more about the extent and spread of the virus , the characteristics of the virus , and the effectiveness of measures intended to slow or prevent the spread of the virus .
Doctors and medical facilities need tests that accurately and rapidly provide a diagnosis .
Those tests may not be designed or able to provide the more detailed information that comes from laboratory tests and analyses .
It is also likely the case that as the CDC builds a surveillance system designed to obtain and provide much greater information about this new coronavirus that effort will involve much testing of people who do not have symptoms or known exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be essential for getting a better picture of how widespread this virus is and the percentage of infections with no or very mild symptoms .
Due to the coronavirus crisis , the University of Georgia canceled its graduation ceremonies , which were scheduled for May 8 .
To try to give some of their fellow Dawgs a little pomp and circumstance , a group of enterprising UGA students have taken it upon themselves to build a virtual world , inside the Minecraft online environment , where graduating seniors can gather to celebrate commencement .
As reported in The Red &amp; Black , junior psychology major Ivan Campbell and senior biology major Nick Miller followed the lead of an elementary school in Japan , where a group of youngsters also created a virtual gathering place in the popular Minecraft online world .

" Campbell and Miller have drawn together a group of about 30 people to help work on the construction .
Campbell told The Red &amp; Black that once the stadium is completed students can login into their own Minecraft channels and attend the ceremony .

His lifts are what somebody who works out with Nick Chubb better be able to do .
Washington bench presses 340 pounds , does some rep maxes with 295 for power cleans and is already squatting 515-plus pounds .
His power clean max is at 330 pounds .
( NEWS FLASH : This is a high school sophomore .
) When recruiting analysts size him up , it is a fitting comparison to liken him to former No .

' Coach speak : An honest assessment about Washington Chris Hirschfield is the offensive coordinator at Walton High School .
He 's been able to coach elite talents like Dominick Blaylock , Kerryon Johnson and Jordan Matthews along his varsity career up to this point .
Those are just the names most of DawgNation will know .
Hirschfield has coached at programs in Alabama and Georgia that have continually sent players to the SEC .
He served as the coach on Washington 's team at the ' Georgia Elite Classic ' All-Star event last December .
He had the chance to work with Washington for a few days .
A fella who has seen two current NFL starters every day as a high school coach surely wo n't impress easily .
Washington played at H-Back , defensive end and outside linebacker for the winning team in that showcase .
' When we had him out wide at d-end , we stood him up and put him an extra yard out wide basically as an outside backer , ' Hirschfield said .
' Basically nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His roster did n't have any H-Back or fullback types on the other side of the ball .

DawgNation has four staffers who cover Georgia football from every angle : Beat , live streams , photos , podcasts , recruiting , etc .
The ' Cover 4 ' concept is : 1 ) Present a topic ; 2 ) Offer a reasoned response ; 3 ) Share a brisk statement on that opinion .
4 ) Pepper the page with photos for the big picture .
For this edition , we discuss what we still think the Georgia startingoffensive line will look like for the first game of 2020 against Virginia .
DawgNation continues with the ' Cover 4 ' concept .

Here 's a quick look at the turnover at that position for the Georgia program .
OUT : Line coach Sam Pittman ( HC : Arkansas ) ; LT Andrew Thomas ( NFL ) ; LG Solomon Kindley ( NFL ) ; RT Isaiah Wilson ( NFL ) ; G/T Cade Mays ( Transfer to Tennessee ) ; G/T D'Marcus Hayes ( graduation ) IN : Line coach Matt Luke : 5-star OT Broderick Jones ; 4-star OT Tate Ratledge ; 4-star C Sedrick Van Pran-Granger ; 4-star OL Chad Lindberg ; 3-star OT Devin Willock ; 3-star OT Austin Blaske ; 3-star OT Devin Willock ; 3-star OG/C Cameron Kinnie That 's pretty considerable , huh ? We just though we 'd make it a wild and crazy Sunday .
The aim here was to try to predict what the starting line might look like for the eventual 2020 opener against Virginia .
No degree of difficulty there , right ? Especially with the cloud of no spring practice looming over that competition .
The quick in-and-out game remains .

What will theeventual Georgia starting O-line look like against Virgina ? Brandon Adams : LT : Broderick Jones ; LG : Justin Shaffer ; C : Trey Hill RG ; Ben Cleveland ; RT : Jamaree Salyer The ' why ' from ' DawgNation Daily ' here : ' A healthy Shaffer gets the nod at left guard because he was in line for playing time prior to his neck injury .
Hill at center is the only true given , but Salyer is definitely starting somewhere .
However , the critical spot is left tackle .
Jones faces an uphill climb in becoming a freshman starter , but his competition is also inexperienced .
' Mike Griffith : LT : Xavier Truss ; LG : Justin Shaffer ; C : Trey Hill RG ; Ben Cleveland ; RT : Jamaree Salyer The ' why ' from ' On the Beat ' here : ' This is the area Kirby Smart is most concerned about , and he 'll say it .
There will be discussion about different players lining up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riley : LT : Xavier Truss ; LG : Justin Shaffer ; C : Trey Hill RG ; Ben Cleveland ; RT : Jamaree Salyer The ' why ' from ' Good Day UGA ' here : ' It would n't surprise me to see Warren Ericson slide into one of the guard spots or possibly center if Hill wanted to move to guard .
I do think Salyer played well at the right tackle spot and think he 's got the athletic gifts to play and do well there in college .
' Jeff Sentell : LT : Jamaree Salyer ; LG : Justin Shaffer ; C : Trey Hill ; RG : Ben Cleveland ; RT : Broderick Jones The Intel here : ' There was nothing off with Sayler .
Georgia just had NFL talent with a year of progression in the program lined up ahead of him .
Look for Salyer to stabilize the UGA line at one of the two tackle spots .
He blocked the 5-star edge guys at elite prospect camps in high school .
He could do it then and can definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uncommon freshman like Jones or Sedrick Van Pran-Granger the chance to earn early time .
The veterans will now pivot to Luke and Todd Monken 's system at the same time with all of the new guys .
That is hard to do in the SEC but guys like Jones , Van Pran-Granger and Tate Ratledge can be special .
If Van Pran-Granger is ready , there could be a position flex for Hill in order to put the best five guys up front .
