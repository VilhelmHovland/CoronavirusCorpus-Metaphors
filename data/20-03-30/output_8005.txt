In light of the social distancing recommendations , the many people living in social isolation and working from home , the outing proved to be a loud and visible symbol of hope and togetherness .
One of the organizers , Deb Brown , said she heard the suggestion from a friend .
" A friend called me and said we needed to do something .
' How about Scoop the Loop ? ' " she said .
Her friend then asked Brown to organize the event .
" We just put out the word on Facebook and I bet there were 50 cars there , " she said .
