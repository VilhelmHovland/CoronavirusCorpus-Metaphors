Tips To Enhance The Nutrition Of Your Meals Amid COVID-19 Lockdown  It can not be denied that the coronavirus pandemic has forced you to limit your grocery shopping trips ( and possibly miss out on fresh produce and other healthy food items ) .
However , that does not mean you can start paying little attention to your nutrition ( and by extension , your overall health ) while at home , especially in the middle of a global health crisis that forces millions to stay at their homes .
Amid the COVID-19 lockdown , here are some dietitian-recommended tips that will help enhance the nutritional value of your meals , courtesy of mindbodygreen :  Add Greens Powder To Any Meal  Greens powder can be added to any meal at any time of the day , whether added to a morning smoothie , sprinkled on popcorn during an afternoon snack , mixed into beans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
When searching for a greens powder , look for a mildly-flavored option , and find one that is boosted by organic sea vegetables that will add essential nutrients , including vitamin C , magnesium , iron and calcium .
Try Other Dried Options  Beans and grains are not the only dried goods that can be added to your lunch or dinner .
Although canned and frozen vegetables add more nutrition and flavor to your favorite meals , dried veggies such as sun-dried tomatoes also do the job .
After all , dried veggies -- and dried fruits such as dried raisins -- are not just for snacking .
Roasting  Being at home all day can be a good time to undertake more time-consuming cooking methods -- in this case , roasting veggies .
It is also an opportunity to take out your frozen veggies and make them tasty , but it is different from roasting them fresh .
With this in mind , registered dietitian Molly Knudsen shared her strategy for getting crisp flavorful vegetables from the oven even if they are frozen .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead of throwing the frozen veggies directly on the pan and putting it right in the oven , heat up the pan with the cooking oil in the oven first , " Knudsen said .
" Once that 's nice and toasty , take it out , toss the veggies on it , and then put the pan back in the oven to cook .
This should help the texture of the vegetables be more crispy than soggy .
"  Cook To Eat  Meal prepping veggies and food can cause their nutritional value to diminish over time .
" For all veggies and food , for maximum nutrient retention , it 's best to eat soon after cooking , " Abby Cannon , registered dietitian , said .
If you are batch cooking , she recommended stopping short of cooking vegetables to retain more of their nutritional value , even when reheated .
That does not mean that you can skip meal prepping , though , since you need food that are ready-to-eat everyday .

Soak Grains  Grains are a great base for pantry-sourced dishes , but now is the time to experience most of their full nutritional value by soaking them with water overnight before cooking .
There are stores that are cleared out of canned and frozen goods , and there are those that lack fresh produce .
If you can get some fresh produce , it is best to freeze them yourself , rather than buying them frozen .
This will free up space in your already crowded refrigerator .
Check Canned Goods  If your local shop lacks fresh produce , you can opt for healthier frozen and canned ones instead .
" Always look for unseasoned and unsalted options and add your own flavoring at home , " Knudsen said .
If you have canned beans in hand , Cannon recommended soaking these overnight before storing them in BPA-free containers of your own to pair with whole grains , seeds and/or nuts .
