Trump signs $2 .
stimulus after swift congressional votes  WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an unprecedented $2 .
trillion economic rescue package into law Friday , after swift and near-unanimous action by Congress to support businesses , rush resources to overburdened health care providers and help struggling families during the deepening coronavirus epidemic .
Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9-11 attacks , Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus that have shuttered schools , closed businesses and brought American life in many places to a virtual standstill .
" This will deliver urgently needed relief , " Trump said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office , flanked only by Republican lawmakers .
He thanked members of both parties for putting Americans " first .
"  Earlier Friday , the House gave near-unanimous approval by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis .
Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate -- their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signalled he 'd try to force a roll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home districts .
" Today we 've all acknowledged our nation faces an economic and health emergency of historic proportions , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif .
She said Americans deserve a full-on government response " to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now .
"  The $2 .
trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1,200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work .
Businesses big and small will get loans , grants and tax breaks .
It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments , and the nation 's all but overwhelmed health care system .
" This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing , " said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming .
" This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth , that we have overcome every challenge we have faced , and we will overcome this one .
"  Despite reservations , arch-conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a Congress that 's been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused .
Reps .
Joe Cunningham , D-S .
, and Mike Kelly , R-Pa .
, announced Friday that they 'd tested positive , bringing the number of infected lawmakers to five .
Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with their small-government ideology .
Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits , deferrals of student loans , and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis .
" I 'm going to have to vote for something that has things in it that break my heart , " said conservative Rep .
David Schweikert , R-Ariz .
The bipartisan amity went only so far .
Top congressional Democrats were not invited to the White House signing ceremony , said Democratic aides speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the situation .
And in a statement released after the signing , Trump objected to efforts to establish congressional oversight of spending in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of treating provisions like these as advisory and non-binding .
"  Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9-11 and efforts to fight terrorism .
Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers .
Some , like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer , who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district , came close to tears .
Others could n't restrain their partisan impulses .
Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous , such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts ; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it .
Still , in a chamber increasingly populated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks , Friday 's debate was a noteworthy break .
" We have no time to dither , " said Rep .
Gerald Connolly , D-Va .
" We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights .
Our country needs us as one .
"  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libertarian conservative Thomas Massie , R-Ky .
, announced plans to seek a roll call vote .
Leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home .
Instead , they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday 's session to block Massie 's move under the rules , and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum .
The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation .
" This bill is not only a rescue package , it 's a commitment -- a commitment that your government , and the people whom you elected to serve you , will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face , both now and in the foreseeable future , " said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif .
The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses .
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky .
, welcomed Democratic participation a week ago , and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance , but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals , as well as an assortment of smaller items .
McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days , along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials .
Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning , and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote .
Key elements are untested , such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses .
Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs .
Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed , and conservatives fear that a new , generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget .
The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed , subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4 .
trillion in lending to distressed businesses , states , and municipalities .
There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system , including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads .
It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless .
Schools and students would get relief , small business loans payments would be deferred .
Evictions from public housing would be put on pause .
Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll .
Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6 .

Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
