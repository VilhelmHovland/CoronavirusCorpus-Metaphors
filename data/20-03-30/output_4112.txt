Mayor of Limerick : ' I ca n't believe people would be so irresponsible and uncaring '  Reporter :  Nick Rabbitts  24 Mar 2020  Email :  nick@limerickleader .
0  Appeal : Mayor Michael Sheahan  MAYOR Michael Sheahan has said he ca n't believe how people could be so " irresponsible and uncaring " as to venture outside despite the spread of Covid-19 .
He added he is " saddened " that people continue to ignore calls to self-isolate to prevent the spread of the coronavirus - but stopped short of calling for a full lockdown in the country .
However , he did ask people to remain indoors .
Despite an 18th case of the flu-like condition being confirmed in the county yesterday - and 1,125 around the country - many people ventured out into the sunny weather across the weekend , ignoring calls from medical experts and the government .
" When I saw the pictures , I could n't believe how people could be so irresponsible and so uncaring about the lives of others who are most susceptible to the coronavirus , who are more open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limerick Leader , " the vast majority of people are co-operating with the health advice .
It 's very sad and disappointing to see other people not doing so .
"  Mayor Sheahan added : " the longer people do this , the longer it will take to get our country back again .
"  Yesterday , the mayors of Cork , Galway and Dublin united to issue a call for a total lockdown here .
But Limerick 's first citizen said he would not be calling for this .
" I 'd be totally guided by the health advice .
Up to now , it 's been good , and I am quite happy to be guided by what we get seom the health authorities .
I would like to congratulate everybody including Dr Tony Holohan , who is an ex-pupil of mine in Monaleen National School right down to all our staff locally and in particular our staff at University Hospital Limerick , " the mayor added .
And he also encouraged people to display their club , county or Irish flags outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are becoming a colourless society .
We need to give areas a bit of a boost .
Display your colours , show you are fighting fir and standing tall for Ireland .
Show we are standing up for Ireland in this moment of crisis , " he concluded .
