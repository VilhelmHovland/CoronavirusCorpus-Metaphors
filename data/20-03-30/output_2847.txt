This Is the New Normal  A COVID-19 survival guide for parents of tweens and teens .
Most teenagers would be horrified at the idea of being quarantined with their parents for an unspecified amount of time .
And most parents feel the same .
And yet , here we are .
Everything is being shut down , the hospitals are overcrowded , and we 're being told the best way to stay safe is to hunker down together at home .
Nobody is happy about this , but teenagers are having a particularly hard time of it .
Their friends are essential to their health and well-being .
They do n't yet have the neurological maturity to maintain a healthy perspective and cope well with the uncertainty and isolation .
Your tween or teenager is angry they ca n't see their friends .
They 're bored and frustrated .
They have a hard time channeling their energy .
They 're banging about the house looking for someone to blame , and they 're filled with righteous indignation that you 're policing the COVID-19 quarantine .
Or they 're regressing , reverting to habits they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a funk , imagining the worst , unable to manage their dark thoughts .
We will get through this .
These suggestions might help your family survive COVID-19 without damaging your relationships , maybe even getting stronger together :  1 .
Take good care of yourself .
Do what you need to do to keep yourself as healthy as possible .
Practice deep breathing .
Do n't consume too much media .
Take walks .
Pay attention to your body 's need for sleep , nutrition , and exercise .
Strengthen your resilience as much as possible , both for the sake of good parenting and also for better managing the illness if you get it .
Stay connected to friends and extended family .
We all need social connections now , more than ever .
Include your teenager in staying connected virtually with grandparents , extended family , and adult friends , as well as their own friends .
That will help them keep a healthy perspective on what 's happening , and how others are responding to it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
You do n't know how long this period will last , how bad it will get , whether your family and friends will be hit by COVID-19 , or when jobs and school will come back to normal .
Reassure your child that anxiety is a healthy , normal response to a situation like this , and help them see that the challenge now is learning how to cope with that .
Discuss coping mechanisms .
Start by doing everything possible to minimize the risks .
Right now , that means physical distancing , social cohesion ( by phone , Skype , or online ) , personal hygiene ( meticulous hand-washing and the rest of it ) , and taking care of one 's health ( good sleep , nutrition , and exercise habits ) .
Let your child know how you deal with stress and anxiety , and where you know you fall short in your coping .
Share sources that might help with creative projects , stretching exercises , breathing regulation , meditation , or anything else that works for you .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their resourcefulness .
Hanging out with friends , playing baseball , participating in the spring recital , or attending parties may not seem important to you , but this is the most important stuff of your teen 's life .
Be sensitive and understanding with your child 's misery .
It is real .
Be positive .
Do n't judge .
Do n't micro-manage .
Your teenager may be eating too much , not sleeping enough , annoying a sibling , or behaving in other ways that are n't ideal .
One of the reasons it 's hard to be a teenager is the pervasive sense of being judged .
Children are blissfully unaware of the perceptions of others , but teens are painfully , brutally aware , and believe that everyone is looking at them with critical , mocking eyes .
So intervene only when truly necessary .
Avoid nagging and criticism .
Trust your teen to figure out the small stuff , even if it means they 're suffering consequences you could have warned them about .
No matter the provocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  7 .
Listen .
Let your teenager know you 're available to listen or to do some problem-solving if they want that .
When they want to talk , be fully present ( no distractions , no devices ) , and be fully positive ( no criticism , no judgment ) .
Offer no solutions , just patient attention and acceptance .
Try to avoid giving advice , but instead to ask the questions that lead them to identify the best possible solutions .
Any solution they feel they 've invented will be worth a hundred solutions you 've given them .
Look for humor .
Smile whenever possible .
It helps .
Connect as frequently as you can to your sense of humor and to your good humor .
Restrict COVID-19 news .
You or your teen may become fixated on following what 's being said , written , and posted .
That makes sense -- you are trying to understand the nature of this terrible situation and get a sense of when and how it will end .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption , including which sources might be trustworthy , and which should be avoided or kept to a minimum , as well as how often during the day it 's healthy to check for news .
Expect drama .
During the teen years , everything is changing rapidly -- your child 's body , brain , hormones , and emotions are all on overdrive , even without this virus and the need for physical distancing , and the cancellation of everything they care about .
Even the wisest and most thoughtful teenager will have moments when this feels like too much to handle .
Let that be okay .
Your teen may try to aggravate you , but you need to be the grown-up here .
Do your best to stay calm and give them the reassurance they really need , that you will do everything in your power to keep them safe .
Expect power issues and conflict .
The adolescent development research shows it 's good if you argue frequently with your teenager , as long as there 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best long-term outcomes for kids occur in families where there 's lots of warmth , as well as plenty of inter-generational discussion .
A hot debate is a great way for your teenager to discover what you care about , and why it 's worth caring about .
As much as possible , respond thoughtfully to the substance of your child 's issues with you , without reacting to their tone .
Expect resentment .
This is a hard time for everyone , and teens do n't have the neurological maturity to keep it in perspective .
There will be times when your teenager is angry and frustrated and looking for a target for that .
You are it .
Even worse , if you are enforcing the guidelines and insisting your child stay home , they are probably furious , even at the same time they 're relieved you 're keeping them safe .
Let your teenager be grateful for nasty things .
Your teen may be relieved not to have exams this year , or to be rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid an annoying friend .
That 's okay .
You may have some untoward reasons for gratitude too .
Rethink the household rules .
This is a good time to have a family discussion about what everyone needs in order for home to be a safe and happy place .
Give up as much power and control as you can , including loosening the media rules , without undermining your child 's physical and mental health .
Do insist , though , for your own well-being and that of others in your household , that your teenager take some responsibility for managing their moods , not imposing their grouchiness unduly on the rest of the family .
( And obviously , the grouchiness rule applies to parents too .
)  15 .
Respect everyone 's need for together-time , and for alone-time .
Some kids will need more closeness and conversation with their parents now than usual , both to reassure them in this stressful time , and also to compensate for not seeing their friends .
Others will want to spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing their own things .
Still others will need privacy , time and space where they can do what they want to do .
Your child 's needs may be different than yours ; do your best to provide what they need , while also taking care of yourself .
Help your child broaden their horizons .
This is a great time to talk with your teenager about their hopes and dreams , and to look for ways to help them explore possibilities they have n't yet considered .
Look for ways to become helpers .
We all feel better when we 're contributing to solutions , rather than focusing on problems .
By following the recommended rules for personal hygiene and physical distancing , and sacrificing normal pleasurable activities , you 're already doing something important to stop the spread of the virus .
Talk together about what else your family can do , either now or for the future , to help with survival and recovery .
Maybe you can give to local food banks .
Maybe you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home after this is all over .
Maybe you can contribute encouraging and trustworthy posts to social media .
Maybe you can reach out via phone , Skype , or social media to friends and family who are feeling isolated .
Once they get into this , your teenager will have more creative ideas than you or I could ever generate .
Put it in perspective .
Remind yourself that your child once was a wonderful human being , and is doing their imperfect unconscious best to become that again .
When my now-wonderful adult daughter was a teenage nightmare , I found a photo of her as a sweet four-year-old .
I taped that photo to the fridge .
Remembering who she used to be reminded me of who she really was , and helped me stay strong and loving , which is what she needed most of all .
Talk together about the Daily Quarantine Questions :  What am I grateful for today ?  Who am I checking in on , or connecting with today ?  What expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How am I getting outside today ?  How am I moving my body today ?  What beauty am I creating , cultivating , or inviting in today ?  How am I nourishing my spirit today ?  20 .
Get help .
If you 're dealing with a seriously troubled teenager ( drugs , violence , etc .
) , the extra stressors of this time may push things over the edge .
Follow these suggestions , but also get the help you need to provide your teenager with a more solid foundation for moving into adulthood .
There are psychological helplines being set up to help troubled kids get through the extra challenges imposed by COVID-19 .
Your teenager needs you now more than ever .
Do what you can to be kind , patient , and loving , and to model good coping skills .
That means taking good care of yourself , being patient with yourself as you think together about the best way through this stressful time for your family .
