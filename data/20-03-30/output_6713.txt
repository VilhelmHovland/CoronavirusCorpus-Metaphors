SAN BERNARDINO -- The county released the number of people who have tested positive for the new coronavirus by city Tuesday afternoon .
The new information shows one person in Yucca Valley has tested positive ; Yucca Valley is the only Morongo Basin community shown on the list .
Unincorporated communities like Joshua Tree , Morongo Valley and Landers are not listed .
The Hi-Desert Star has reached out to the county to learn if they will be if cases are confirmed there .
The Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center is also not on the list , but the commanding general , Brig .
Roger Turner , said by Friday , March 27 , more than 75 people had been tested at the Naval hospital and none tested positive .
The Department of Public Health cautioned that residents of places with low or no numbers should not assume there are no cases in their communities .
Just 996 people have been tested out of the roughly 2 million who live in San Bernardino County .
" The number of cases by city provides a picture of community spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erin Gustafson .
" However , residents of cities not listed or with low case numbers should assume and behave as if there are cases within their communities and comply with the statewide stay-at-home order .
Residents of cities that are listed should not panic and feel the need to go somewhere else .
I can not stress strongly enough the importance of staying at home and practicing good hygiene to reduce further community spread .
"  The city of Yucaipa has been hit hardest , with 18 positive cases .
That includes 12 people in a single nursing home , along with another elderly woman living at the nursing home who died last week .
Rancho Cucamonga has 14 confirmed cases .
The city data shows where each person with COVID-19 lives , regardless of where they were tested or where they might be hospitalized .
Cities and communities not listed have zero confirmed cases , according to the county .

( 2 ) comments  I followed my own advice and believed BG Turner over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that BG Turner needs to be replaced or whatever .
Dawn Rowe was wrong , so with that as a known factor now .
I will assume that there is no way to tell how many other people have COVID-19 in our little town .
I think it is time to pay closer attention , and protect yourself from the Nay Sayers writing about how horrible someone is that actually knows .
Kudos to BG Turner for letting me know what is real vs fantasy .
My wife and I are continuing to sew masks from our home to give out .
It would be nice to keep an eye on our neighbors in need .
Next I will probably read here is there is no proof that the confirmed case was the one Rowe said did not exist .
I like Curtis Yakimow , but he was not informed apparently .
Thank you to the HDS for getting the truth out to us .
