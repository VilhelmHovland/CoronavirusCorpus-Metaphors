Merchant of fake hand sanitizers busted  A businessman has filed a complaint against a medical store in Bellandur that was producing fake hand sanitisers using his company 's name and logo .
The sanitisers were being sold at the same MRP of Rs .
610 as his company 's product .
The enterprising owner , who came to know of such a thing happening , visited the store , bought the fake sanitiser , recorded a video and produced it to the police as proof .
Siddesh S Gowda , 32 , a resident of RR Nagar , owns NAP ( New Associated Pharma ) , a company that makes hand sanitisers , gloves and other pharma items .
After Siddesh filed a complaint with the Bellandur police on Saturday , the accused , Mubarakh , 36 , a resident of Bellandur , was arrested on Sunday .
Siddesh said that as their company is based in Kerala , the accused must have thought they would n't come to know of it .
Siddesh said , " I was surprised to know that our product was being sold in Bellandur as I could n't recall them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store and bought our sanitiser from them for Rs .
I was secretly recording the whole time .
There were two people named Harish Reddy , the owner of Balaji medicals , and his wife , there .
They did not have computerised bills and gave me a written one .
I asked them if they take bulk orders and they said yes .
I asked for about 5,000 hand sanitiser to which they immediately agreed and said that if I give them money , they will arrange it in no time .
I was shocked because even our company can not manufacture that many products at such a short notice .
I knew that there was something wrong .
"  Not only was the medical store selling fake hand sanitisers ( above ) , it was also overcharging , said the owner of the manufacturing unit who stumbled upon the scam in Bellandur  Siddesh dug a little deeper and noticed that the address of the company was different from his .
So he took the sanitiser bottle to his company 's lab and discovered that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were preparing these sub-standard sanitisers which were being sold at our MRP .
Except the address , everything was the same , " he said .
A senior officer said that they have nabbed the main accused .
" We found that the accused had rented out a house in Begur where he along with others were preparing these sub-standard sanitisers .
We have seized 200 bottles of half-litre and 300 empty bottles ; drums and other materials from the manufacturing place , " he said .
