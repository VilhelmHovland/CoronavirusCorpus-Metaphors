A few years from now , when the renovation of Omaha 's three downtown riverfront parks is complete , the social restrictions of 2020 should seem like a distant memory .
Children will run and scream on a custom playground .
Rollerbladers and ice skaters will zip around a ribbon-shaped rink .
There will be picnics and concerts and gatherings of all sizes .
The effects of the novel coronavirus have n't slowed progress on the $300 million overhaul of the Gene Leahy Mall , Heartland of America Park and Lewis &amp; Clark Landing , project leaders say .
Now more than a year into construction , the entity managing the projects has released new conceptual images and updates to help you daydream about brighter days .

A kid 's splash park would sit along an 11th Street walking promenade .
That pass through , which does n't exist today , would allow people to walk from the Old Market to the Capitol District and north downtown .
The promenade would n't be open to traffic , other than for food trucks to park and serve food .
At 11th Street , a smaller water feature about one-third of the size of today 's lagoon would ripple down stairs and run to the east side of the Greenhouse Apartments .
The area around the Burlington Place building would not rise to street level ; it would slope downward .

A smooth transition into Heartland of America Park would make that area less intimidating and more accessible .
" We want to make this flow , " said Ken Stinson , an Omaha businessman and philanthropist co-chairman said of the committee 's work .
The size of Conagra Lake at Heartland of America Park would be reduced to allow for an Eighth Street plaza gathering place , another event lawn and a multiuse , ribbon-shaped rink for wintertime ice skating and summertime rollerblading .
The smaller lake would also allow for Farnam Street to continue east past Eighth Street ; today , it dead ends .

OJB LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE  Downtown workers and residents in April can expect to see large pipes coming into Gene Leahy Mall as crews work to install storm and sanitary sewers , according to the Metropolitan Entertainment and Convention Authority , which is managing the renovations for the city .
That basic infrastructure work is the next step in creating a large green lawn that will include a sculpture garden , children 's play area , dog park and performance pavilion .
" It 's like a cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bassett , vice president of parks for MECA .
" We 'll get to the frosting .
"  Weather permitting , 13th Street between Douglas and Farnam Streets is expected to reopen to traffic by June .
Workers last spring removed the 13th Street bridge before filling in the Gene Leahy Mall with dirt to bring it to street level .
Demolition work continues on the east side of the mall .
Demolition and grading work will begin this month at Heartland of America Park , which closed to the public at the end of 2019 .
As soon as April 1 , the Conagra campus lake will be slightly lowered to allow crews to install an earthen causeway .
The lake wo n't be completely drained , though its final redesign calls for a smaller lake than the one that exists now .
About 26,000 truckloads of dirt will be required to raise Heartland of America Park , creating another lawn space " capable of hosting large-scale events with the Missouri River serving as a scenic backdrop , " MECA said in a statement .

People downtown may notice construction noise , increased truck traffic on Douglas and Dodge Streets and some vibrations as crews work on Heartland of America Park , MECA said .
Lewis &amp; Clark Landing should close to the public next fall .
The city and MECA have been recycling or reusing many materials from the parks , which will retain their individual names but be branded under the umbrella of The RiverFront .
Bricks that will be removed from Heartland of America Park will be kept and used when the city needs to repair streets in the Old Market , Bassett offered as an example .
" Those bricks are very old -- they do n't make them quite like that anymore , " she said .
New conceptual images released by MECA show in more detail how some of the parks ' amenities will look .
A custom-built playground in the Leahy Mall will offer children of all ages and abilities the chance to have fun , Bassett said .
An image shows a large , multilevel wooden structure that features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange " play arch " covered in climbing nets .
The ground will be covered in a cushy turf .
Omaha 's iconic downtown slides are n't going anywhere , but the configuration will look different .
They 'll be joined by two slides geared for smaller children .
An image of the skating ribbon in Heartland of America Park shows a large decorative circular light hanging above the space .
Design work on all three parks is being planned using mainly video conferencing technology because of the coronavirus , MECA has said .
Construction leaders across Omaha say the pandemic so far has not affected building projects .
Major construction at the Gene Leahy Mall is expected to wrap up in 2022 .
Heartland of America Park and Lewis &amp; Clark Landing are expected to open in 2023 .
The final touches to the new parks will be made in 2024 .
