Outback airlines warn of imminent collapse  At least eight regional airlines could collapse within days because of the crippling coronavirus pandemic , putting life-saving flights at risk .
Regional Express Airlines ( Rex ) has also warned it could shut down without immediate support from local , state and federal governments .
Opposition transport spokeswoman Catherine King said the federal government 's aviation relief package , worth up to $715 million , was not nearly enough and failed to support airlines whose fleets were grounded .
Rex deputy chairman John Sharp said the smaller airlines were effectively offering the government a 24-hour ultimatum .
His airline transported blood and even COVID-19 test samples between the regions and capital cities .
" This may no longer be possible in the foreseeable future , " he said .
" It would be most ironic if ( Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack ) should be presiding over the collapse of all these regional carriers under his watch .
"  He said moves by the consumer watchdog allowing airlines to coordinate flights and the aviation watchdog 's easing of regulatory burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not allow the airlines to survive the next three months , " Mr Sharp said .
Mr McCormack did n't rule out further financial help , saying he had been in regular contact with the airlines industry .
" I acknowledge calls for further support and am working closely with industry in responding to this crisis , " he told AAP .
" Our first priority as a government is the public health and safety of Australians .
This core focus underpins every decision we are taking in response to this crisis .
"  A joint letter from eight regional airlines urged the government to provide support , saying that unlike Australia 's major carriers they were family or privately owned .
The airlines said any financial relief needed to go straight into airlines ' pockets to keep them going .
" The government , while repeatedly proclaiming the importance of protecting regional aviation as a vital resource for growing the economy appears , instead , to have wiped its hand of the industry at what is its most critical time , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided services to regions unattractive to the bigger airlines .
" The financial survival of our companies can be counted in days rather than weeks , " the letter said .
Ms King warned aviation workers had no guarantee they would still have a job once the coronavirus pandemic was over .
