Foundation collecting money to help Sudbury 's hospital through pandemic crisis  Anthony Keating , president and chief development officer of foundations and volunteer groups at Health Sciences North , makes a point in this file photo .
He said HSN has launched a COVID-19 support fund , which will help the hospital with its most urgent care needs .
John Lappa/Sudbury Star  Health Sciences North has been swamped .
First , it was flu season .
Then came COVID-19 .
And finally , the hospital has been besieged by offers of support and kindness from the community .
In response to the city 's outpouring of support and goodwill for frontline health care workers , HSN has launched a COVID-19 support fund , which will help the hospital with its most urgent care needs .
" This fund will help support HSN 's highest priority needs as a result of COVID-19 , " Anthony Keating , president and chief development officer of the HSN Foundation and volunteer association , told The Star .
" This fund was created in response to a significant number of donors who have reached out to our foundations wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time .
"  While Canada has yet to see the number of COVID-19 cases swell as they have in many other countries , as of Thursday evening , there were more than 4,000 cases in this country , including 39 deaths .
The curve is currently moving in an exponential direction , which could overwhelm our hospitals , tax our health care system and imperil the lives of frontline health care workers .
As of Thursday evening , there were 858 confirmed cases in Ontario and 15 deaths .
Ontario is second only to Quebec , which has more than 1,600 cases of coronavirus .
In Sudbury , six cases have been confirmed in people ranging in age from 20-something to more than 70 years old .
Of the 449 tests that have been administered locally , results are pending for 133 individuals but the good news is that at least 310 people have received negative results .
" This fund will support patients who may require treatment , " Keating said .
The hospital currently has several high-priority needs , including N95 masks and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membrane oxygenation machine .
" The Cardiohelp ECMO machine is a compact heart-lung support system used to provide respiratory support for patients in the ICU , " Keating explained .
" In patients with severe pneumonia and the flu , this vital piece of technology pumps blood around a patient 's body until their own heart and lungs are strong enough .
ECMO plays an important role in caring for some of the most acute patients in the ICU at HSN .
It has been used for respiratory support with successful patient outcomes .
"  HSN has been identified by Critical Care Ontario as a designated ECMO centre , Keating said .
" As such , the need for a second Cardiohelp ECMO machine at HSN is needed to better equip the hospital for emerging medical situations , such as COVID-19 , " he noted .
The hospital also needs ventilators to support patients with severe respiratory conditions .
" A ventilator is a vital piece of equipment that is used to support patients with severe respiratory conditions that impact the lungs , including pneumonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to breathe for somebody who is unable to breathe effectively on their own .
It helps get more oxygen into the lungs and take carbon dioxide out .
This exchange is more difficult in the most severe cases because a patient 's lungs are inflamed and filled with fluid .
Ventilators play a crucial role in the care of patients diagnosed with pneumonia and COVID-19 .
Additional equipment capacity will aid in the preparedness of HSN for potential emergent situations .
"  Finally , Keating said the hospital needs vital signs monitors .
These portable devices are used to collect accurate data for evaluating patient health .
They are used to access and monitor vital signs , including blood pressure , temperature , heart rate and respiration .
This is especially useful in identifying situations requiring immediate attention and treatment .
The monitors can detect several different vital signs and are useful for quickly identifying changes and complications in a patient 's condition .
Keating also said the hospital could use some quality-of-life amenities , such as TV programming , since visitors are not currently allowed .
