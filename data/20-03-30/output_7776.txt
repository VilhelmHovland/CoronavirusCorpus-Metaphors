All financial information is prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ( " IFRS " ) , except as noted in the Non-GAAP Measures section of the Company 's Management 's Discussion and Analysis ( " MD&amp;A " ) .
All dollar amounts are expressed in US dollars ( " USD " ) , unless otherwise noted .
" In 2019 , Great Panther transformed into a growing , intermediate precious metals producer through the acquisition of Tucano , which increased production ( on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectively over 2018 , " said Jeffrey Mason , Interim President and CEO , and Board Chair .
" We ended the year exceeding our revised fourth quarter production guidance at Tucano and , in the past three months , we have raised $24 million of new non-dilutive capital ( net of cash collateral requirements ) to strengthen our balance sheet .
"  Mr .
Mason continued , " the Company 's focus for 2020 is to continue the current program of implementing operational improvements , ramp up exploration programs to replace and expand mineral resources , and improve our financial position , all with the objective of creating shareholder value and regaining the confidence of our various stakeholders .
Importantly , we are investing a minimum of $11 million to realize the significant exploration potential at our assets , focusing on mine life extension at Tucano and a possible re-start of the Guanajuato Mine later this year .
"  On March 9 , 2020 , the Company announced its inaugural Mineral Reserve &amp; Mineral Resource Estimate ( the " MRMR " ) for Tucano dated effective September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized mining consultants Roscoe Postle &amp; Associates ( " RPA " ) and used a rigorous approach to Reserve and Resource estimation that is expected to improve mine forecasting reliability and exploration planning .
The inaugural MRMR has resulted in an impairment of approximately $39 million in the carrying value of Tucano , representing approximately 25% of the value recorded at the time of the acquisition of Beadell Resources Limited on March 5 , 2019 , based on the non-cash share exchange value of the transaction plus assumed debt .
2018 comparative data for Tucano has not been provided as this relates to the period of ownership by Beadell Resources Limited ( " Beadell " ) .
The data presented for the year ended December 31 , 2019 is the period from March 5 , 2019 to December 31 , 2019 during which the Company owned Tucano following the acquisition of Beadell .

Revenue was $198 .
million for 2019 , an increase of $139 .
million over 2018 , reflecting the acquisition of Tucano .
Tucano accounted for $153 .
million of revenue in 2019 .
Higher realized gold and silver prices also contributed to the increase in revenue .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-cash charges ) decreased to $6 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) compared to $8 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) in 2018 , primarily due to Tucano 's amortization and depletion .
Mine operating earnings before non-cash items increased to $29 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) from $12 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) in 2018 , which was also primarily attributed to the contribution of Tucano , which accounted for $32 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) of mine operating earnings before non-cash items .
Net loss for 2019 was $91 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) as mine operating earnings were offset by an impairment of Tucano goodwill of $38 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) , exploration , evaluation and development ( " EE&amp;D " ) expenditures of $24 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) , finance and other expense of $13 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) , and general and administrative ( " G&amp;A " ) expenditures of $17 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) .
For accounting purposes , the Company re-evaluated its initial assessment of the purchase price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated assessment of the carrying value of Tucano assigned a value of $85 .
million to the Tucano depreciable mineral properties , plant and equipment on acquisition and $43 .
million to non-depreciable mineral properties reflecting the underground reserves and resources , open pit resources , and near mine and regional exploration potential .
The assessment resulted in a reduction of the carrying value of Tucano 's mineral properties , plant and equipment from $167 .
million to $128 .
million .
Goodwill of $38 .
million , being the difference between the fair value of net assets acquired and the original share exchange value plus assumed debt , was deemed as impaired at March 31 , 2019 .
1  The Company has included the non-GAAP performance measures cost per tonne milled , cash cost per gold ounce sold , cash cost per payable silver ounce , AISC per gold ounce sold excluding corporate G&amp;A expenditures , AISC per gold ounce sold , AISC per payable silver ounce , mine operating earnings before non-cash items , cost of sales before non-cash items and adjusted EBITDA throughout this document .

2  Average realized gold and silver prices are prior to smelting and refining charges .
Adjusted EBITDA for 2019 was $7 .
million ( $0 .
per share ) after adjusting for interest , amortization , impairment of goodwill , and a significant amount of non-cash and non-recurring charges ( refer to the MD&amp;A for further information on the computation of Adjusted EBITDA ) .
This compares to a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $5 .
million ( -$0 .
per share ) for 2018 .
Operating cash flow before changes in non-cash net working capital was negative $1 .
million ( -$0 .
per share ) in 2019 , compared to negative $6 .
million ( -$0 .
per share ) in 2018 .
The change largely reflects an increase in mine operating earnings before non-cash items of $29 .
million .
EE&amp;D expenditures increased by $12 .
million , mainly due to increases in reclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations , technical requirements and contractor rates .
G&amp;A increased by $11 .
million due primarily to the acquisition of Tucano which added $9 .
million of G&amp;A expenditures , including accruals totaling $5 .
million for Tucano related legal claims , $1 .
million of costs of its Australian head office .
At the time of the Acquisition and throughout the balance of 2019 , the Brazil legal claims were not assessed as probable by the Company 's legal counsel .
Based on a more recent assessment of these claims by the Company with its legal counsel , it was determined that there was a higher likelihood of loss for which a provision of $5 .
million was deemed appropriate .
The former Australian head office was closed in the second quarter of 2019 and related ongoing severance and other contractual costs will be substantially eliminated following the first quarter of 2020 .
G&amp;A expenses also included non-recurring severance charges for management changes of $0 .
million , and $0 .
million of non-recurring legal , consulting and auditor fees incurred to evaluate financing options , prepare and file shelf prospectus and related matters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance and other expense consists of interest expenses related to Tucano borrowings and past due payables of $5 .
million , a $3 .
million write-off of Tucano 's Imposto de Circula ? ? o de Mercadorias e Servi ? os ( " ICMS " ) , a Brazilian sales tax that was determined to be unrecoverable , $1 .
million of accretion expense on reclamation and remediation provision , and $1 .
million of accretion expense on lease liabilities .
Additionally , the Company recorded foreign exchange losses of $1 .
million , of which $4 .
million were due to the impact of the translation of Tucano BRL denominated borrowings into the Company 's USD presentation currency , partly offset by unrealized foreign exchange gains recorded on the BRL/USD forward foreign exchange contracts ( notional USD value of $100 million ) which were marked to market at the prevailing exchange rate at December 31 , 2019 ( 4 .
BRL/USD ) .
To hedge exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts from time to time .
These have been primarily forward contracts for the purchase of BRL and MXN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

CHANGE IN COST REPORTING MEASURES  As a result of the Acquisition , the Company 's primary metal production by value is now gold .
In addition , Great Panther 's Mexican silver mining operations produce a significant component of gold by-product .
As a result , the Company has changed to primary reporting of cash cost and AISC metrics on a per ounce of gold sold basis , net of by-product credits ( refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section in the MD&amp;A for definitions and reconciliations of these measures to the Company 's reported financial results ) .
Cash cost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of by-product credits ) continue to be provided for the Company 's Mexican operating mines as these remain primary silver producing mines by value .
CASH COST AND ALL-IN SUSTAINING COSTS  The consolidated operating results , cash cost and AISC for the year ended December 31 , 2019 reflect Tucano operations from the March 5 , 2019 date of the completion of the Acquisition , and a comparison to those of prior periods on an overall basis is not meaningful .
Refer to the discussion of operating and cost metrics for the individual mines in the MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31 , 2019 .
Consolidated AISC per gold ounce sold ( excluding corporate general and administrative ( " G&amp;A " ) expenses ) of $1,383 for the year ended December 31 , 2019 is higher than the Company 's most recent consolidated annual guidance for AISC ( excluding corporate G&amp;A expenses ) for the following reasons :  The Company made an accrual of $5 .
million for Brazil legal claims in the fourth quarter of 2019 , as discussed in the G&amp;A expenses above ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-site contractor equipment that was unutilized , in accordance with its mining services contract ;  Higher cash cost per silver payable ounce at Topia due to a less favourable market for Topia 's concentrates and general cost increases over the prior year comparative period .
Further discussion of the Company 's cash cost and AISC can be found in the MD&amp;A for the year ended December 31 , 2019 .
For the purposes of consolidated cash cost and AISC per gold ounce sold , the GMC and Topia are incorporated on the basis of Au eq oz production and sales , and other metals produced are treated as by-products .
See the Non-GAAP Measures section of the MD&amp;A for detailed reconciliations and computation of these measures .
CASH , SHORT-TERM DEPOSITS AND WORKING CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31 , 2019  At December 31 , 2019 , the Company had cash and short-term deposits of $37 .
million , compared to $50 .
million at December 31 , 2018 .
Cash and short-term deposits decreased by $13 .
million during 2019 primarily due to $26 .
million of net cash repayment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions to plant and equipment and lease liability repayments consumed $6 .
million .
Contributions to cash included $15 .
million of net proceeds from a bought deal equity financing , $13 .
million of cash provided by operating activities , $10 .
million concentrate prepayment financing from IXM Group ( " IXM " ) and approximately $5 .
million from other financing sources including cash assumed on the Acquisition , and partial repayment of a loan advanced to Tucano 's former parent company .
Net working capital was $12 .
million as at December 31 , 2019 .
In January 2020 , the Company completed an $11 .
million gold dor ? prepayment agreement with Samsung C&amp;T U .
which improved the Company 's working capital position .
In March 2020 , the Company completed an increase in its credit facilities with Banco Bradesco in Brazil .
The additional facility consists of a $10 .
million term loan at a 3 .
interest rate and a requirement to retain $7 .
million cash collateral .
The term of the facility is to February 24 , 2023 with quarterly repayments commencing on March 5 , 2021 .
2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to provide collective Company-wide guidance for 2020 but it is providing individual operating guidance for both Tucano and the GMC .
These two operations combined represented approximately 85% of 2019 production on a gold equivalent ounce basis .
Further as discussed below , the remainder of the Company 's 2019 production was from Topia , for which the 2020 operations outlook is still being assessed .
Great Panther expects to provide Topia operating guidance , in order to complete Company-wide guidance by the end of the second quarter of 2020 .
Great Panther 's 2020 Operating Guidance for Tucano and the GMC compared with actual 2019 results is as follows :  Operating Guidance  Tucano  ( costs per Au payable oz ) ( 1 )  GMC  ( costs per Ag payable oz ) ( 1 )  Topia  ( costs per Agpayable oz ) ( 1 ) ( 3 )  2020Guidance  2019Results(2)  2020Guidance  2019Results  2019Results  Gold production  koz  120 - 130  106  n/a  n/a  n/a  Gold Eq production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  19  22  Silver Eq production  Moz  n/a  n/a  1 .

( 2 )  2019 results for Tucano are reflective of the period under Great Panther ownership beginning March 5 , 2019  ( 3 )  Topia 2020 operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second quarter of 2020 , as further detailed under the Topia section below .
Tucano  At Tucano , 2020 planned production is between 120,000 to 130,000 gold ounces , representing an increase of approximately 13% - 23% compared to the 106,000 gold ounces of production under Great Panther 's ownership in 2019 , and marginally higher than Tucano 's full year 2019 production at the mid-point of 2020 guidance .
Production is expected to be primarily sourced from the Urucum Central North , TAP AB3 , and Urucum North pits , with lower than average production expected in the first quarter , impacted by seasonal wet weather effects and a focus on waste movement which is expected to benefit ore production in the remainder of 2020 .
Ore production from the Urucum Central South pit ( " UCS " ) is not included in the 2020 guidance but is planned for 2021 , subject to successful remedial work .
UCS was removed from the near-term mine plan in the third quarter of 2019 due to a geotechnical incident ( refer to news releases dated October 7 , 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated remedial unloading work at UCS in the first quarter of 2020 to remove free diggable material at the top of the west wall slope .
Continued remedial unloading work and benching involving drilling and blasting is expected to start in the third quarter .
This work is planned based on established protocols from the Company 's consultants , Knight Piesold , and is contingent on favorable results from five geotechnical core holes to be drilled , commencing in May 2020 .
The majority of planned capitalized stripping expenditures of $23-$27 million in 2020 are related to the Urucum pits , including approximately 2 million tonnes related to remedial work at UCS , with the remainder relating to Tap AB pits .
Capitalized stripping guidance is sensitive to any changes in pit sequencing during 2020 , which will impact the accounting treatment of waste movement on a pit-by-pit basis during the course of the year .
This accounting treatment will have a corresponding impact on cash costs ; however , it is not expected to have a material impact on AISC .
The 2020 AISC guidance mid-point of $1,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% relative to 2019 's AISC of $1,406 per payable ounce of gold .
The reduction results from an expectation of a more favorable currency exchange rate , lower diesel prices and other supply costs , along with various business improvement initiatives .
Capital expenditures of approximately $7 million primarily relate to normal course , staged expansion of Tucano 's tailings storage capacity , and the installation of a new primary crusher at the plant scheduled for mid-year .
Exploration expenditures of approximately $7 million , as outlined in the Company 's news release dated February 6 , 2020 , are primarily focused on near mine drilling activities intended to replace gold ounces mined in 2020 .
These activities are ongoing , and the Company expects that a significant amount of the drilling to be completed by the end of the third quarter .
The Company plans to assess any increases to the exploration expenditure guidance in the third quarter of 2020 , concurrent with the evaluation of the drilling results from the first half of 2020 .
The Company 's guidance for Tucano is sensitive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US dollar to the Brazilian real , fluctuations in key input costs including diesel , pre-stripping requirements related to remedial work at UCS , and weather .
GMC  At the GMC , 2020 planned production is between 1 .
to 1 .
million silver equivalent ounces , a decline of approximately 7% to 20% from actual 2019 production of 1 .
million silver equivalent ounces .
The 2020 guidance is based on a silver to gold ratio of 90:1 ( which compares to 80:1 reported in 2019 , and approximately 110:1 at current market prices ) and based on over 80% of the ore production is sourced from the San Ignacio Mine .
The Company has increased the silver to gold ratio for reporting purposes as a result of the relative outperformance of gold versus silver over the last year .
The mid-point of the 2020 AISC guidance is in line with 2019 actual results .
The Company 's expanded exploration program at the Guanajuato Mine and at the San Ignacio Mine ( refer to news release dated January 28 , 2020 ) is continuing as planned , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2020 , as well as rebuilding mineral resources at both mines .
The Company 's guidance for the GMC is sensitive to a number of factors , including the exchange rate of the US dollar to the Mexican peso , and fluctuations in key input costs including diesel .
In addition , exploration results from the ongoing drilling campaign at the Guanajuato Mines , if positive , could result in an upward revision to guidance in the second half of 2020 .
Topia  On March 9th , 2020 , the Company announced that it had temporarily ceased dry tailings deposition at its Topia Phase II tailings storage facility ( " TSF " ) following receipt of a report from the independent tailings management and geotechnical consultants engaged by the Company to evaluate the TSF .
The March 9 , 2020 disclosure anticipated that mining and processing activities at Topia might cease by the end of March 2020 .
However , operations are now expected to continue uninterrupted at current levels until at least the end of April 2020 by way of storing dry tailings at and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacking at Topia commenced in 2017 .
The Company is continuing discussions with geotechnical and tailings management consultants regarding ongoing observations and assessments , while continuing to monitor conditions at the TSF .
Alternatives to minimize any potential cessation of processing activities in 2020 are being evaluated , including re-commencement of tailings deposition at the Phase II TSF ( if satisfactory mitigation measures can be achieved ) , and normal course permitting for the Phase III TSF , which is already at an advanced stage .
While the Company can not be certain of the timeline to permit the Phase III TSF , it expects it can obtain the necessary permit within the next three to six months .
If one of the aforementioned alternatives is not in place by the end of April , mill processing activities will temporarily cease until either Phase III is permitted or suitable mitigation of Phase II can be achieved .
The Company is also evaluating the continuation of mining and stockpiling of ore if a temporary cessation of mill processing activities were to occur .
As 2020 production and costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue mining and processing after April 2020 , the Company plans to complete its assessment of alternatives before providing 2020 operational guidance .
Concurrent with the availability of a more reliable outlook for the Topia operation , Great Panther expects to provide annual operational guidance for Topia , in order to complete Company-wide guidance by the end of the second quarter of 2020 .
Topia accounted for approximately 15% of the Company 's 2019 consolidated production on a gold equivalent ounce basis .
Great Panther has operated Topia continuously since 2006 , with the exception of only brief stoppages for upgrades and permitting .
A new Mineral Resource Estimate for Topia is being developed to which the Company expects to announce by the end of 2020 .
This estimate will supersede a prior estimate which was effective July 31 , 2018 .
As announced in the news release dated March 9 , 2020 , the Company previously expected to announce an updated Mineral Resource for Topia by June 30 , 2020 ; while this later expected target date reflects the Company 's prioritization of exploration programs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coricancha  The Company continues to evaluate the timeline and conditions for a potential re-start of the Coricancha Mine .
In the first quarter of 2020 , the Company undertook a limited mining and mill processing campaign of approximately 25,000 tonnes .
These activities have been temporarily suspended in accordance with the Peruvian government-mandated restrictions associated with a 15-day National State of Emergency announced on March 16 , 2020 in response to COVID-19 , and the effective period was extended on March 26th to April 13 , 2020 .
Coricancha is not material to the Company 's operations .
General Uncertainty due to COVID 19 Measures  The Company has been closely monitoring the effects of the spread of the coronavirus respiratory disease ( COVID-19 ) with a focus on the jurisdictions in which the Company operates and its head office location in Canada .
The rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 is prompting governments to incrementally implement restrictive measures in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19 .
During this period of uncertainty , Great Panther 's priority is to safeguard the health and safety of personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow the spread of COVID-19 , and to continually assess and mitigate the risks to the business operations .
The Company has implemented a COVID-19 response plan that includes a number of measures to safeguard against the spread of the virus at its offices and sites and is also maintaining regular communications with legal and government representatives , suppliers , customers and business partners to monitor any potential risks to its ongoing operations .
Broader government measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 have not impacted the Company 's operating mines in Mexico and Brazil to date and there are no confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 across the Company 's corporate offices and operations , including those on care and maintenance .
Although there have not been any impacts to the Company 's operations to date , the Company can not provide assurance that there will not be disruptions to its operations in the future .
If the Company 's operations are impacted or expected to be impacted , the Company will seek measures to preserve cash including suspension of discretionary spending and other collaborative and legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company has scheduled the release of its fiscal year 2019 financial results for Monday , March 30 , 2020 after market close .
