Blissful ignorance ? Submariners likely unaware of pandemic  by John Leicester , The Associated Press  Posted Mar 30 , 2020 4:31 am EDT  Last Updated Mar 30 , 2020 at 4:46 am EDT  FILE - In this July 13 , 2007 file photo , French Marine officers wait atop " Le Vigilant " nuclear submarine at L'Ile Longue military base , near Brest , Brittany .
Stealthily cruising the ocean deeps , deliberately hiding from the world now in turmoil , the crews of nuclear-armed submarines may be among the last pockets of people anywhere who are still blissfully unaware of how the coronavirus pandemic is turning life upside down .

( AP Photo/Francois Mori , Pool , File )  LE PECQ , France -- Of a world in coronavirus turmoil , they may know little or nothing .
Submariners stealthily cruising the ocean deeps , purposefully shielded from worldly worries to encourage undivided focus on their top-secret missions of nuclear deterrence , may be among the last pockets of people anywhere who are still blissfully unaware of how the pandemic is turning life upside down .
Mariners aboard ballistic submarines are habitually spared bad news while underwater to avoid undermining their morale , say current and former officers who served aboard France 's nuclear-armed subs .
So any crews that left port before the virus spread around the globe are likely being kept in the dark about the extent of the rapidly unfurling crisis by their commanders until their return , they say .
" They wo n't know , " said retired Adm .
Dominique Salles , who commanded the French ballistic submarine squadron from 2003-2006 .
" The boys need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively to The Associated Press , Salles said he believes submariners will likely only be told of the pandemic as they head back to port , in the final two days of their mission .
" Those who are at sea do n't need this information , " said Salles , who also commanded the nuclear-armed French submarine " L'Inflexible .
"  " The commander , I think , is doubtless informed about what is happening .
I do n't think he 'll have all the details , " he said .
The French navy wo n't divulge what has or has n't been said to submarine crews .
Nor will it say whether any of the four French ballistic submarines , laden with 16 missiles that each can carry six nuclear warheads , left harbour before France instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 17 .
" Because the deterrent is wrapped in a bubble of protection and confidentiality , it is impossible to know whether the crews are informed or not of this situation , " French navy spokesman Lt .
Cmdr .
Olivier Ribard said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with about 110 crew members aboard .
So a crew that left at the end of February would n't be expected back before the end of April .
In that case , they will return to a world changed by the pandemic .
On March 1 , France had just 130 confirmed COVID-19 cases and two deaths .
In under a month , those numbers have surged past 2,600 dead and over 40,000 sickened .
For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
But for some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , and death .
For submariners , the return to land could be a shock .
" They wo n't have experienced the crisis as we did , with a bit of fear , the lockdown .
So for them it will be quite a surprise .
They will learn the history , but it will be a history that is related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor on the ballistic submarine " Le Triomphant " for four years .
He spoke to the AP on condition that he be identified only by his first name and rank , in accordance with the rules of his branch of the French military .
" All events that could affect or change the morale of the crew members are kept from them , " said the officer , Chief Doctor Gabriel .
" Since there is no internet , no radio and no television on board , the only news you get comes from messages received by the commander , and the commander filters the messages to not give all of the information to everyone .
"  The doctor was underwater in 2012 when an Islamic extremist killed three French paratroopers and later killed a rabbi , his two young sons and grabbed an 8-year-old girl and shot her in the head .
Only later did the officer learn of the attacks , " so when people talk to me about it , I find it impossible to imagine , " he said .
" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is underwater , because even on a vessel in space there is still the radio , television , the internet , " he said .
When bombings hit Madrid in 2004 , Salles did n't inform submariners who were at sea for the ballistic flotilla that was then under his command .
Salles said the situation now will be toughest for any crews that leave harbour in the weeks ahead , because they 'll know they are leaving loved ones in the midst of the pandemic and , possibly , still living in lockdown .
The French government has already extended its stay-home orders once , to April 15 , and said it could do so again .
Salles said he believes those crews will get regular coronavirus updates , but wo n't be told of any family deaths until they are returning to the l'Ile Longue submarine base near Brest in Brittany .
Salles was at sea in a sub when his father died .
The news was kept from him until he had finished his 60-day mission .
" No matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do about it .
And since he can not do anything , better that he know nothing , " Salles said .
" They know that they wo n't know and accept it .
It 's part of our deal .

A stern-looking President Vladimir Putin warned his envoys in Russia 's far-flung regions that they will be personally responsible for the availability of beds , ventilators and other key equipment .
" We have managed to win time and slow down an explosive spread of the disease in the previous weeks , and we need to use that time reserve to the full , " Putin said .
Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 1,836 confirmed cases and nine deaths , but the number of people testing positive has risen quickly in recent days and authorities are bracing for the worst .
Putin has declared that only people employed by essential sectors should work this week , leaving it to regional authorities to spell out the details .
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin followed up by ordering Muscovites to stay home starting Monday except for medical emergencies and runs to nearby shops .
He said the city will issue special passes for those who need to keep working and track all others with electronic surveillance .
" We will steadily tighten controls , " Sobyanin told a Cabinet meeting .
" I hope that by the week 's end we will have information systems allowing us to fully control citizens ' movements and prevent possible violations .
"  On Tuesday , the Russian parliament is scheduled to approve a bill that imposes prison terms of up to seven years and fines of up to 2 million rubles ( about $25,000 ) -- a huge sum in a country where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockdown .
Moscow has a sprawling system of surveillance cameras complete with facial recognition technology , which were tested during anti-Kremlin rallies last year to track down protesters .
City authorities have also used cellphone location data from mobile providers to monitor those who were ordered to self-quarantine for two weeks after arriving from abroad .
Russia took early steps to counter the outbreak , closing the borders with China and then barring access to Chinese citizens last month when China was still the world 's hottest coronavirus spot .
Authorities followed up by screening arrivals from Italy , France , Spain and other countries worst-affected by the outbreak , and obliging them to self-quarantine .
Last week Russia cut all international commercial flights and finally fully closed its borders effective Monday , with the exception of diplomats , truck drivers and a few other categories .
Russian officials said those measures helped slow down the spread of COVID-19 , but acknowledged that the disease is accelerating rapidly and relatively low numbers of confirmed cases could be explained by insufficient screening .
For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as fever and cough .
But for others , especially older adults and people with prior health problems , it can cause severe symptoms like pneumonia and can be fatal .
Authorities have converted several hospitals in Moscow to treat coronavirus patients and thousands of construction workers laboured around the clock at a construction site on Moscow 's outskirts to build a new specialized hospital to be ready in a few weeks .
The Defence Ministry also launched a massive effort to build 16 hospitals across the country in a matter of weeks .
Last week , the military also conducted massive drills across Russia to disinfect and quarantine broad areas .
Despite those efforts , many in Russia worry that the nation 's underfunded health care system that just recently underwent massive cuts could be easily overwhelmed by the crisis .
Putin told his envoys in the regions Monday that they must quickly report the real situation with ventilators and other essential equipment , prepare for moving seriously ill patients between regions and mobilize medical personnel , including medical students .
He also ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one laboratory in Siberia was analyzing the coronavirus tests .
In a move reflecting the gravity of the crisis , Putin last week postponed a vote on constitutional amendments that would allow him to stay in office until 2036 if he chooses .
Russian authorities have n't restricted travel to and from the capital city .
Many residents of the Moscow region commute to work in the capital .
In a sign of lack of sync between various state agencies amid quick-paced developments , police in the Moscow region on Sunday night announced a curfew on top of the lockdown , but the authorities quickly denied the announcement .
Putin has hailed Moscow 's lockdown as " necessary and justified .
" St .
Petersburg , Russia 's second largest city , and over a dozen other regions from the westernmost exclave of Kaliningrad to Tatarstan on the Volga River to the Yekaterinburg region in the Urals quickly followed Moscow 's example and imposed similar lockdowns .
Russia 's leading opposition figure , Alexei Navalny , on Monday blasted the Kremlin for longtime neglect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them .
He posted a letter from a doctor at one of Moscow 's hospitals treating coronavirus patients who said staff have run out of protective suits and have to reuse those they have worn .
Kremlin critics also voiced concern that the government would use the lockdown to further tighten political controls and crack down on dissent .
The authorities already have declared a campaign against " fake news " about the coronavirus , tracking down social media users making claims that contradict official figures on coronavirus figures .
Some already have been given heavy fines .
