This all-white 2,000-piece Japanese jigsaw puzzle will keep you busy in quarantine  Jigsaw puzzles can do one of two things : provide hours of soothing entertainment when you 're fatigued from too much screen-time , or slowly but surely drive you mad as you spend hours searching for that one vital piece .
Since we 've all been advised to stay indoors to slow the spread of Covid-19 coronavirus , it 's unsurprising that people have dug their old jigsaw puzzles out of the cupboard -- and immediately been reminded of how time-consuming they can be .
As if it was n't hard enough to put hundreds of fragmented pieces of a picture together , Japanese toy maker Beverly is churning out puzzles perfect for masochists in search of a maddeningly difficult challenge .
With a fitting name that translates as ' Pure White Hell ' , this jigsaw puzzle is entirely white and has 2,000 pieces .
That 's right -- no sorting the pieces by shade to gauge which ones belong where , the best you can do is identify the outer edges first before descending into a diabolical labyrinth of so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly challenged by a puzzle , this monochrome atrocity , priced at ? 3,300 ( including tax ) , could be just the thing to keep you busy while you 're self-isolating .
Not ready to take the 2,000-piece plunge ? Beverly also makes the same puzzle with 1,000 and 300 pieces .
The latter actually makes for a fun customisable gift as the pieces are big enough to draw or write messages on .
Alternatively , you could spare yourself the stress altogether and opt for something more conventional , like this sushi puzzle -- it looks lovely , and it ( probably ) wo n't drive you round the twist .
