Cabaero : Christmas in March  A LIGHT at the end of the tunnel is what it means to bring out your Christmas lantern and display it in March , in this time of the coronavirus disease ( Covid-19 ) .
A family in Dipolog City decided to do just that last week .
Armand Bengua Frasco , in a message to SunStar Cebu , said his family took out the Christmas lantern from storage and hang it by a window .
" It is a symbol of light at the end of the tunnel and a reminder that , with massive effort , modern medicine and prayers , the coming holidays will turn out to be bright , " Frasco said .
It is a message of hope during this public health emergency .
Frasco said his family saw an article on the House Beautiful website that called on those on quarantine in their homes to hang their blinking colored lights again , three months after Christmas .
The www .
sunstar .
report quoted the article author , Nathalie Kirby , as saying : " So if you 're home with nothing to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ( or just switch them on if , like me , you still have n't taken them down yet ) and hopefully , you 'll inspire your neighbors to do the same .
"  Frasco said the Christmas lantern in March signifies " hope in a world enveloped by fright and darkness .
"  What 's next ? Maybe radio stations will start playing Christmas songs of Jose Mari Chan and others .
