United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres fears " millions and millions " of coronavirus cases in Africa , where the youth will not be spared .
He wants wealthy countries to help the developing world , for their own sake .
Guterres told Radio France International ( RFI ) that Africa should be the priority of the international community as the continent does have the resources to fight the Covid-19 pandemic .
" Ninety percent of the cases are in the G20 countries which hold 80 percent of the global economy .
They should n't be working alone , each in their corner , but in a coordinated manner to find treatments and vaccines to put at the world 's disposal , " he said .
According to him , at least three trillion US dollars , around 10 percent of the world 's GDP , is needed to slow the spread of the coronavirus for vulnerable countries in the Global South .
" This is not a financial crisis like in 2008 , " he said .
According to figures published by the African Union , there are 3,924 cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Africa is in urgent need of test kits , masks , ventilators , protective suits for health workers , " said Guterres .
" We can still prevent the worst in Africa but without a massive mobilisation we will have millions and millions of people contaminated , which means millions of deaths , " adding that Africa 's booming youth population will not be spared .
Guterres said the risk of the coronavirus mutating is higher given the fast rate at which it is spreading globally .
" As the virus mutates , all the investment we are putting into vaccines will be for nothing because the virus will then travel from the South back to the North .
So it is in the interest of countries in the North to help the South , " he said .
