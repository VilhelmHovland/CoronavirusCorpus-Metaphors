When Vern Brown and his partner Santana Edgar welcome a new baby girl into these novel times in the next few weeks , one worry is when they 'll be able to get home to share their joy with family and friends .
Announcements , Events &amp; more from Tyee and select partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are comfortably battened down in the Black Rooster Inn in Prince Rupert , on British Columbia 's north coast , after doing what so many expectant young First Nations families are forced to do : they left their isolated home fully a month before Santana 's due date , for the security of a larger centre with a fully equipped hospital in plenty of time for when their baby arrives .
With a due date of April 22 , the couple boarded the Northern Expedition ferry from Klemtu , a small village ( pop .
319 ) on British Columbia 's central coast , on March 22 , for a 12-hour overnight journey north .
" We 're just praying for a healthy baby and to be able to get her home as soon as possible .
"  Brown works in the stewardship department of the Kitasoo/Xai'Xais First Nation in Klemtu as a field technician , creek walker , and all-round natural resources expert .
Kitasoo/Xai'Xais territory is in the heart of the Great Bear Rainforest , and Klemtu is a popular jumping off point for tours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Klemtu , as with many other First Nations communities in British Columbia , and indeed across Canada , is now closed to outside visitors due to the risk of contagion from the novel coronavirus , or COVID-19 .
Brown said he is delighted with how fast his band leadership acted .
" They 've made some really good moves .
I 'm glad of their urgency .
that the central coast is in lockdown .
"  By comparison , he said , Prince Rupert seemed " laid back " when he and Santana arrived , people moving around freely , " and that 's really scary to me .
" Brown admitted that with the advent of a baby , " everything 's really heightened for me .
"  Prince Rupert is itself a transit point for tourists headed to Haida Gwaii , an eight-hour ferry sailing to the west .
Some travellers with bookings to Skidegate chose not to travel the weekend of March 21-22 in light of a directive from the Haida Nation that the archipelago was off-limits to tourists .
Others insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reception they got on arrival on the islands was hostile .
They were " immediately turned around and sent home , " said Gudee Gud Dlaay .
Vince Collison who , days later , was still angry that people even made the journey .
" Tourists for some odd reason thought they could hang out here .
"  " These people are like infested blankets to me , " he said in an interview , hearkening back to the darkest time in the Haida 's , and indeed all coastal First Nations ' , long history : a smallpox epidemic in the 1860s that killed tens of thousands of Indigenous people in what some historians , and many First Nations people , believe was a conscious attempt to depopulate the young colony .
Collison , who in summer works as a Guardian Watchman in the Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve , and otherwise works on repatriating Haida ancestral remains from museum collections around the world , admits his strong views sparked accusations that he was being racist .
He is unrepentant .
" My father , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to fight tooth and nail for him .
I 'm not going to allow a stupid visitor to endanger my family , my grandkids , my nieces and nephews .
"  The danger in all communities is , obviously , one of exposure .
The more physical distance the better , but that can be difficult to maintain in small communities that are often overcrowded due to chronic housing shortages .
That problem is compounded by the fact that community health infrastructure -- small hospitals , even smaller clinics -- can be quickly overwhelmed .
Evan Adams , chief medical officer of the First Nations Health Authority ( FNHA ) , said it is fair to assume , if not presume , that Indigenous communities ' " susceptibility to COVID-19 will be higher than in the general population " because Indigenous peoples already suffer poor outcomes in a range of health factors , including communicable diseases .
Santana Edgar and Vern Brown do n't know when they 'll get back to Klemtu after their daughter is born in Prince Rupert .
Photo from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Collison said , there are just two ventilators for a population of around 5,000 full-time residents -- one in Masset and one in Queen Charlotte City .
Collison was as vocal as he was in part out of frustration that the political leadership on Haida Gwaii did n't act more quickly to turn people away .
By midweek , he was reassured when a state of emergency was declared by all levels of government on the islands .
( That , and other local declarations were suspended by the province on March 26 .
The government said it was seeking to avoid " patchwork " approaches to emergency measures .
Some local leaders vowed to continue with their own plans regardless .
)  Council of the Haida Nation president Gaagwiis Jason Alsop said the decision to declare a state of emergency is " critical to the public health of all island citizens .
"  " It is based on advice from local health professionals and will limit the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to our island communities , " Alsop said .
" There are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing all that we can to ensure the ongoing safety of our communities .
"  According to the North Coast Regional District ( NCRD ) , a state of emergency means " travel to and from communities within the NCRD will be controlled and limited to essential services only .
"  Back on the central coast , in Bella Bella , where the year-round population numbers around 1,300 people , a directive to cease travel in and out of the community came on the cusp of a seasonal swell in band members due to it coinciding with the annual herring spawn -- a key event on the Ha ? lzaqv ( Heiltsuk ) First Nation calendar .
( The Central Coast Regional District also issued a COVID-19 emergency travel restriction order .
)  In view of the pandemic , " it was unanimous to cancel the commercial fishery " eight days ago -- just as the herring spawn began -- said D ? qva ? ? sla William Housty , a natural resources manager with the nation .
" Looks like it could be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few families were conducting FSC herring roe fisheries -- FSC meaning for food , social , and ceremonial uses .
The roe that was harvested , a fraction of what would be hauled ashore in a commercial fishery , " goes pretty far beyond our families " to other families in Bella Bella , with maybe a trickle of product going to Kitamaat in barter for eulachon grease from up that way .
Otherwise , Housty said , government buildings were shuttered and folks in Bella Bella were " staying home , working in their yards .
it 's a blessing right now to be here and have less exposure to people coming in .
"  On the morning of Tuesday , March 17 , a half-dozen or so members of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation ( TFN ) on the west coast of Vancouver Island assembled at Sutton Pass , the high point of Highway 4 as it wends its way to Ucluelet and Tofino from the east side of the island .
" Traffic stopped .
A lot of people were getting out and screaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yours .
We belong here more than you and a lot of young people started to jump out of their cars telling us this is not right , and we do n't have a right to this .
" " As much as we do n't want to do this , we need to cap the pandemic .
We are doing this to protect all Tofino community and our residents .
Not just our tribe , but the whole community .
It 's safety precautions .
" Some drivers reportedly turned around , although none were blocked from finishing their journeys .
If the Tla-o-qui-aht wanted to make a point , they sure succeeded .
And it was n't just First Nations making that point .
At a popular surf beach near Tofino , someone had posted a notice saying : " Visiting From Out of Town ? ! It 's time to head home .
You are in a small town with one hospital , one clinic + one grocery for everyone to share .
You are overburdening a struggling system .
Thanks ! "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is accessible only by water or air .
All three Nuu-chah-nulth Nations in Clayoquot Sound -- the Tla-o-qui-aht , the Ahousaht , and the Hesquiaht -- have declared their communities off-limits to outsiders .
Canada 's iconic and popular west coast surf towns , gearing up for another madhouse summer , took a page from the First Nations ' playbook with Tofino , and then Ucluelet , asking visitors to stay away .
" For now , please enjoy Tofino vicariously through images and your memories of past visits , " said Tofino mayor Josie Osborne .
" Make plans to visit us again when our community is ready to host you and give you an incredible experience .
This recommendation is temporary only -- just as the COVID-19 pandemic is -- and we look forward to welcoming everyone back again soon .
"  All three Nuu-chah-nulth Nations in Clayoquot Sound -- the Tla-o-qui-aht , the Ahousaht , and the Hesquiaht -- have declared their communities off-limits to outsiders .
Lynn Edwin " Eddy " Frank and his wife Grace sat in their family van a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance to the Ty-Histanis reserve behind a barrier that said , " Residents Only No Visitors .
" The only road to Tofino runs past Long Beach in the Pacific Rim National Park Reserve , which is also home to the Tla-o-qui-aht 's Esowista/Ty-Histanis reserve .
The Franks had been hired to keep visitors out and to discourage band members from leaving .
" We did our best .
People were starting to listen , " Eddy Frank said .
But a week ago , the couple were confined to their two-bedroom apartment in an elders ' building on the reserve .
They 'd been ordered to self-isolate after learning that a visitor to their home had been in a meeting with someone who later reported falling ill .
" I was fit to be tied , so angry , but what can we do but ride it out ? " Frank said .
He quickly came to realize it was a " blessing .
for the safety of my family it 's best to just do that .
" Frank , 68 , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing the communities to outsiders , but was unimpressed that so many community members themselves were going to Tofino or otherwise not self-isolating in the village .
" First Nations demand the best for everybody but are hypocrites for not applying the rules to themselves , " he said .
Test , Lockdown , Test : Prescription for Small and Island Communities  Dr .
Evan Adams , of the FNHA , said that isolation has its own hazards .
" I think this lockdown idea can be triggering for people .
It 's completely understandable , it 's probably within their rights and title " to exclude outsiders from First Nation communities .
Adams , who is himself First Nations ( from Tla'amin Sliammon First Nation near Powell River ) sympathizes with peoples ' need to be socially active .
While there 's an understandable focus on physical safety , Adams said , " people are upset , so there 's a mental health issue .
We do n't want people to stay home , " if they can find ways to get out and about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them pleasure .
In Ahousaht , home to about 1,000 people , one thing some people are doing to stay active is fishing .
" Bottom fish , salmon , clams , oysters , " said Curtis Dick , one of five emergency coordinators working to keep the community safe .
Other band members were preparing to hunt ducks .
In Klemtu , before he and Santana sailed to Prince Rupert , Vern Brown had been out on the land , gathering traditional medicines from the territory .
" It 's very uplifting to our communities to have our medicines close to hand , " Brown said .
And , he said , to anticipate what 's coming next : " herring , seaweed , sockeye , and everything else that rolls through after that .
" As the isolation fades , " it 's going to be a whole family thing , families living together , a real food , social , and ceremonial thing .
"  Brown , like Vince Collison on Haida Gwaii and William Housty in Bella Bella , talks openly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We see it coming across the way , and that 's why we 're taking action , " Brown said .
That 's why they are asserting their rights to close their communities , and to gather their own medicines and their own food after a long , cold winter .
" We 're lucky to have that cycle of life that starts now , " Brown said .
A cycle of life that will continue , someday soon , with the birth of their new baby girl .
Then they just need to get her home .
