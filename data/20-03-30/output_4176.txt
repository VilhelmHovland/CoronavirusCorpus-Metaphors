"  I interviewed Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic on the industry and why he thought to initiate this series .
" The event industry has been especially hard hit with almost all companies servicing the sector having seen a significant impact on their immediate business pipelines as well as future order books .
It has affected all aspects of the industry from venues , d ? cor suppliers , caterers , content production companies , technical suppliers , event management agencies and even transport companies .
In the UK many of the large tech firms have started using their large trucks to pull groceries for Tesco 's instead of sound systems for Madonna , just to generate some income .
"  What , in your opinion , is the biggest challenge facing the industry at the moment ?  The biggest factor is undeniably the short-term decimation of order books as well as the medium-term uncertainty around when things will get going again .

Issued by Loeries 3 days ago  How did this online event/panel discussion come about ?  We acknowledge the challenges the marketing industry , in general , are facing and saw no attempts to curate a common conversation around the challenges brands are facing in this unprecedented situation .
Those of us in marketing have to be concerned with questions concerning the impact of Covid-19 on our work , our clients and the impact on the industry .
Here are some thought starters that focus closer to the marketing world .
The objective is to offer a platform for marketers to share thoughts on the challenges and possible solutions brands will face now and in the coming months .
I doubt three weeks ago any South African brand had an opinion on " brand voice in a pandemic " yet now every single brand in the country is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform for both industry-leading opinion and a meaningful Q&amp;A section , surely every brand manager and agency strategist in the country can benefit from this .
What would you say to encourage corporates and industry folk to listen in and support the initiative ?  We have to date seen an almost entire lack of support from corporates for this initiative .
Whilst we acknowledge the significant challenges facing us all , we believe corporate South Africa can and should be supporting this , and other initiatives by SMEs to ensure there is indeed a valid pool of professionals around to support their efforts when the doors open up , and things return to as normal as can be expected .
We urge all SMEs to mail us as access is free for all qualifying parties .
If corporate SA does not want to support this initiative , we still serve a valuable service as , in this situation , knowledge is power and we hope we are able to provide that to brand teams , agencies , corporates and SMEs alike .
Businesses will bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the outbreak of Covid-19 .
20 Mar 2020  What 's next ?  We are already working on the second edition of ' Going Viral ' which will be an in-depth discussion on the challenges and solutionist thinking required for SMEs to survive , given their unique ability to react and reinvent in the fraction of the time of large corporates .
There is a positive side to this situation and we hope to profile this through relevant discussions in episode two .
