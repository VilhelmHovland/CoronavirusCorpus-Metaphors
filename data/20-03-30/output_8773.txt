Larry McCormack / The Tennessean  " The question in all our suffering is , how long ? And the answer from our God , from Abraham , from Moses and Job is , ' I am with you , ' " Stevens said .
" ' I am with you , ' says our God when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the night .
' I am with you , ' when you share what you have with your neighbors in the bright light of day under the red buds blooming .
' I am with you , ' as you weep and as you laugh .
' I am with you , ' as you mourn and when it is time once again to dance .
' I am with you , ' until you reach the other side of time where we will embrace love forever .
"  On Saturday , Walker , who leads one Nashville 's largest congregations , Mount Zion Baptist Church , called Nashville a " resilient city " when he spoke remotely from an office during the city 's online news conference .
" It is our faith , not just our faith in the God who 's above us , but the faith in the God who is in us as we help each other through this tumultuous time , " Walker said .
" I believe that without a doubt our faith will pull us through .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker , who suspended in-person services at Mount Zion in favor of online-only worship , urged the faith community and everyone else to continue to abide by the social distancing guidelines .
" I believe it is important now for us to lean on the innovation and creativity that technology affords us and to be able to worship God in our homes , " Walker said .
Nashville Mayor John Cooper also echoed this idea during Saturday 's news conference .
Cooper 's " Safer at Home " order strongly discourages all gatherings and specifically prohibits those with 10 or more people .
" These are not normal times and our city is facing a public health emergency , " Cooper said .
" I urge all congregations to follow the ' Safer at Home ' order and find ways to worship from the safety of your own homes .
"  Wherever you are this weekend , I ask that you take a moment to pause and join me for Nashville 's Weekend of Prayer this Saturday and Sunday .
