But it was inevitable that -- at some point -- someone would call for a match-up that does n't make any sense because the parties involved are n't even comparable to each other .
A dream battle that , yes , you would absolutely watch , but solely because of how ridiculous it is that these two people are actually being pitted against each other .
Well , we have Twitter user DJ Green Villain to thank for inciting what has surely been one of the most amusing and baffling music debates in recent history , when he argued that Quincy Jones ' production is n't better than Kanye West 's production .
The initial tweet that started it all came some time on Sunday night ( it has since been deleted ) , but there are still a few tweets around that show Green Villain 's preference for West over Jones .
( Including one where declares that the production of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is better than Thriller .
)  I 'm talking about Kanye having better production than Quincy Jones .
Quincy got heat but not a longer list than Kanye  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Villain 's unanimously disliked hot take served as a brief distraction from that " coronavirus III " topic that is also trending .
( Rest assured , there is no third coronavirus -- it 's just the name of comedian John Oliver 's latest video speaking on Trump 's handling of the virus .
