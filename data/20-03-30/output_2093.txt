A senior doctor has written to England 's chief medical officer Chris Whitty to raise her " grave concern " that electric hand dryers in toilets could increase the risk of transmission of coronavirus .
Charlotte Fowler , a consultant radiologist , raised the risk of an increased spread if a person had not washed their hands thoroughly .
She called on Professor Whitty to havehand dryersturned off until the issue can be examined .

" I have been envisaging the scenario of someone who is carrying the virus but who has n't been 100% successful in their hand washing .
" If they were to use a hand towel they might be lucky and finish the job off .
If however instead they use a hand drier to finish , they would be less effective in their own decontamination but worse could create COVID-19 laden aerosols which could float around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by anyone coming for the three hours afterwards .
"  Dr Fowler , who is not an infection control specialist but has worked on reducing cross infection within her field , said the risk of germs being spread during the use of hand dryers is well documented .
She highlighted that the Department of Health 's guidance on hand washing ends with the use of hand towels rather than dryers .
Speaking to Sky News , she added that part of the problem is " these hand dryers are not only not drying our hands very safely , but they are whipping the virus up into the air and creating like a mist or a fog " .
Dr Fowler said that this information , combined with recent research suggesting that the virus can survive in aerosols for three hours , is a cause for concern .
As well as writing to Prof Whitty , the consultant radiologist has also started a petition to raise awareness and gather support for her argument .
She cited 2018 research which found jet air hand dryers spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in hospitals .
It found that staphylococcus aureus , which causes a range of conditions including MRSA , was found three times more often on the surfaces of air dryers compared to paper towel dispensers .
The dryer creates an " aerosol that contaminates the toilet room " , Mark Wilcox , professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds , said at the time .
Dr Simon Clarke , a microbiologist at Reading University , has acknowledged there could be a risk but as long as people wash their hands thoroughly there would be no virus to spread .
He said : " It is a theoretical risk , but nothing is proven .
" If you wash your hands properly there would be no virus left to be aerosolised while using a dryer .
