Over the objections of students , professors , and state and local officials , Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr .
reopened Liberty University last week .
Since then nearly a dozen students have already begun displaying symptoms similar to those that come from COVID-19 .
Falwell 's decision to reopen the university is just part of a larger pattern of dangerously dismissive and conspiratorial remarks and actions concerning the pandemic .
Over the course of just a few weeks , Falwell has called the disease an " overreaction , " argued it was designed to hurt President Trump politically , and suggested the disease was a North Korean bioweapon .
This puts Congressman Denver Riggleman in a tough spot after Falwell endorsed the embattled congressman last year .
Riggleman has proudly highlighted the endorsement , citing their shared values and even said he was " honored " to stand with Falwell just weeks ago :  " Despite Jerry Falwell Jr .
' s claims , COVID-19 is not a hoax , it 's a global pandemic .
Falwell 's actions are not only reckless , but they put the lives of Liberty University 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Guggenheimer .
" Voters in Virginia 's 5th Congressional District deserve to know , is Congressman Riggleman still ' tremendously excited ' to have Falwell 's support or will he instead stand up for what 's right and condemn Falwell for his actions and dangerous conspiratorial statements ? " .
