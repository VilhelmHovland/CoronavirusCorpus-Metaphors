Iraqis can only ' dream ' of burying the dead during virus lockdown  Medical staff perform a general examination at a hotel in Najaf last month .
Iraq has confirmed 42 deaths so far .
( AP pic )  BAGHDAD : For Saad Malik , losing his father to the novel coronavirus was only the beginning of his nightmare .
For over a week , cemeteries across Iraq refused to allow the elderly man 's burial .
Fearing the respiratory illness could somehow spread from the corpses to nearby population centres , Iraqi religious authorities , tribes and townspeople have sent the bodies of Covid-19 victims back to hospital morgues , where they are piling up .
" We could n't hold a funeral for him and have n't been able to bury his body , even though it 's been more than a week since he died , " Malik told AFP , his voice laced with bitterness .
Armed men claiming to be tribal leaders threatened Malik , his family and his friends , saying they would set fire to his car if they tried to bury the body in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge country Iraq , there are n't a few square meters to bury a small number of bodies ? "  In Islam , a person must be buried as soon as possible after death , usually within 24 hours .
Cremation is strictly prohibited .
Iraq has confirmed more than 500 Covid-19 cases and 42 deaths from the respiratory disease , but the real numbers are likely much higher as few of the country 's 40 million people have been tested .
Authorities have declared a countrywide lockdown until April 11 , urging citizens to stay at home and adopt rigorous hygiene routines to forestall the spread of the virus .
' Where will we put bodies ? '  But in some areas , local powers are getting even stricter .
Northeast of the capital Baghdad this week , tribal figures prevented a team of health ministry officials from burying four bodies in a cemetery the state had specifically designated for Covid-19 victims .
When the delegation tried to take the bodies to another burial ground southeast of Baghdad , dozens of local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies were returned to the morgue .
One Iraqi living near Baghdad told AFP " we decided to block any burials in our area " .
" We panicked over ( the health of ) our children and families .
"  According to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , which is leading the global response to the pandemic , coronavirus is transmitted through droplets and surface contact .
There is no scientific evidence yet that it could spread via corpses , according to Iraqi health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr .
He said the government was taking all possible precautions when burying bodies , including wrapping them in bags , disinfecting them and placing them in special coffins .
Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , the country 's top Shiite cleric , has said those who lost their lives to the disease must be wrapped in three shrouds and insisted authorities facilitate burials .
But rejections of burials have continued , including in the two shrine cities of Karbala and Najaf , where one of the world 's largest cemeteries is located .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry had tried to intervene directly to convince Najaf authorities to allow burials of Covid-19 victims , to no avail .
The medic , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he had witnessed one widower beg authorities to release his wife 's body .
" Just give me the body and I 'll bury her in my own home , " the heartbroken husband had said .
" This is the situation after just 40 deaths .
What happens if it gets worse ? Where will we put the bodies ? " the medic asked .
Many in Iraq have been bracing themselves for a rise in cases in the weeks ahead , but the country 's hospitals are ill-prepared to deal with large numbers .
They have been ravaged by decades of conflict and have received little investment in recent years , leaving them woefully bereft of medicine and equipment .
Doctors , too , have been threatened , kidnapped and even killed in recent years over ransoms or under pressure from relatives of patients .

By way of comparison , France -- currently overwhelmed by the spreading virus -- has 60 beds for every 10,000 people .
To try to fill the gap , Iraqis are stepping up with inventions of their own .
Medical engineer Moqtada al-Zubaidi has created a hospital bed encased in plexiglass , which includes a respirator with oxygen tanks , an air conditioning unit , a bell to ring nurses and a flat-screen television .
" It 's an invention with humanitarian purposes .
We proposed the name ' the bed of life ' because it provides security and reassurance to people who are sick , " he said .
Zubaidi is awaiting approval from the health ministry to produce more beds , which cost US$4,000 each .
But for many fellow Iraqis disheartened by the rising death toll , such measures may be too little , too late .
Salem al-Shummary , Malik 's cousin , had tried to help Malik bury his father and was left scarred by the experience .
