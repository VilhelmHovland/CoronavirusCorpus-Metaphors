Lawrence Shankland opens up on Dundee United stars ' group chat discussions about coronavirus shutdown situation and how his focus is on titles rather than transfers  One Dundee United WhatsApp group chat and a plethora of questions about the fate of the football season .
That 's the reality for Lawrence Shankland and his Tangerines team-mates as their hopes of lifting the Championship title , and promotion to the Premiership , hang in the balance .
A month ago , in simpler times , United manager Robbie Neilson and his men were dealing with a 2-0 away defeat to Dunfermline .
The focus now is simply finding a way to finish the 2019/20 campaign , derailed by the Covid-19 outbreak .
On Friday , representatives of United -- 14 points clear of second-placed Inverness Caley Thistle -- were amongst those involved in a series of conference calls between all 42 SPFL clubs and league chiefs .
No decisions were made regarding the season 's conclusion however it is understood there will not be any action until August at the earliest .
In separate interviews over the weekend , Shankland spoke sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mail : " We obviously want to get the games finished and play the season out .
" But we know there are more important things in the world right now than us getting a trophy .
" That 's sad for me to say but it 's the harsh reality of the situation .
" It 's frustrating to be so close -- but no one could have seen this coming .
No one was prepared for it .
Shankland joined Dundee United after leaving Ayr last summer  " Hopefully we 'll get the games played eventually and we have to make sure we 're ready .
And hopefully we wo n't need a lot of time to get it wrapped up .
" If the season is ruled null and void , I think I 'd be in my bed for a few weeks !  " It 's all hypothetical so it 's a hard situation .
But some of the boys have mentioned that ' What if ? ' question in our group chat .
" What would we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still in the Championship ? How would the club go about that ?  " It 's a hard one , until we know more .
Not knowing is the toughest part -- that 's what 's getting to the players .
" You 'd like to think every player who started the season will finish it .
" We just want the eight remaining games to get played .
In theory , that would only take a month to finish if we played Saturday and midweek .
" We 're only four wins away from the title so we could be champions in a fortnight .
" It 's unthinkable for us not to go up now , whatever happens .
It would be a sickener if the season was declared null and void .
