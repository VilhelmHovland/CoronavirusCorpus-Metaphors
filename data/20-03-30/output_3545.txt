Use of ARBs for patients who develop angioedema following ACE inhibitor treatment  Question  Can angiotensin II receptor blockers be taken if angioedema has occurred with ACE inhibitor treatment ?  Answer  Angioedema is reported to occur in 0 .
-- 0 .
of patients who take angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors .
However , since ACE inhibitors are given long term and patients can develop angioedema any time during therapy , the risk may be as high as 1% for patients after 10 years of treatment .
The exact cause of angioedema associated with ACE inhibitors has not been determined .
Because ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is thought to be related to accumulation of bradykinin , it was assumed that angiotensin II receptor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however it has been found to occur in some patients .
The incidence of angioedema in patients receiving ARBs is uncertain but appears to be lower than in patients receiving ACE inhibitors .
There is limited evidence to suggest that a significant number of patients who develop angioedema while taking ARBs have previously experienced angioedema during ACE inhibitor therapy .
The incidence of angioedema in patients switched to an ARB following ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema has been described mainly in case reports and case series , with an incidence ranging from less than 10% to greater than 50% .
Because angioedema is potentially life-threatening , ARBs should be used with extreme caution in patients who have previously experienced angioedema while receiving ACE inhibitors .
The risk of recurrent angioedema should be discussed with the patient .
