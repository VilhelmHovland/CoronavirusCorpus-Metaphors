Company known for making film industry generators now serving medical sector  CEO Mark Rabin showcases Portable Electric 's generators .
His Vancouver-based company is shifting production away from the now-dormant film industry to providing devices to medical facilities Submitted  For Mark Rabin , the mission of his company , Portable Electric Ltd .
, has always been about " bringing cleantech to Hollywood .
"  The Vancouver-based company is best known for manufacturing , selling and renting a variety of battery-powered generators used on film and TV productions across the globe .
Unlike roaring diesel generators traditionally used on filming locations , Portable Electric 's devices are emissions-free and make not a peep for the boom microphones .
So what happens when a pandemic forces film and TV productions across the globe to simultaneously call it a wrap midway through shooting ?  " We 're into a new market that we 've never even thought about before , " said Rabin , who is Portable Electric 's CEO .
In COVID-19 's aftermath , Portable Electric is now deploying its devices to focus on the needs of medical facilities coping with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary triage centres , mobile clinics , drive-through testing , and anywhere you have a non-traditional area set up for ventilators and auxiliary equipment , " he said .
" The challenges of doing a pivot in a number of weeks , after being the leader in the film and entertainment industry for power , is it 's a very different customer , very different market , very different language .
"  The equipment already meets industrial standards and wo n't have to be modified for use in medical facilities .
However , the Portable Electric team is still determining how the power needs of lighting equipment or a nest of monitors on a film set differs from medical equipment .
" It 's the same system but we had to learn and understand what are the appliances we 're powering , what are the power draws , how long can our equipment power a ventilator , for example , " Rabin said .
Hundreds of Portable Electric 's devices are distributed throughout eight countries , but for now the company is focusing on medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market .
" Just like you would if you were doing a market validation .
for an idea or an early stage startup , we did the same thing and we started from scratch , " Rabin said .
" This is a very important turning point for our company as well as for the world around us , and we see ourselves as part of the solution .
