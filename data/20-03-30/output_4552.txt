Thirteen-year old Elizabeth Ogunsanya is not happy with the temporary closure of schools in Lagos , Nigeria .
The closure is meant to prevent the spread of the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) in Nigeria 's bustling commercial capital .
But Elizabeth is not enjoying the enforced holiday .
From the little she has heard about the virus , she is afraid that in the one-room apartment that she shares with her mother and two other siblings , in a densely-populated suburb of the city , they are likely to get infected sooner , rather than later .
" We all share one small room , and ventilation is poor , " said Elizabeth , worriedly .
Lagos has a population of 21 million , according to figures released by the National Population Commission in 2016 .
But four years later , with an annual population growth rate of approximately 3 per cent , about two million people are estimated to have been added to that number .

To prepare communities to protect themselves from infection , UNICEF has adopted a three-pronged strategy to support community and social mobilisation efforts by the Government .
At the grassroots level , the emphasis is on strong interpersonal community awareness raising .
To reach larger communities , mass media is used , and on the individual level , U-Report , the SMS-based platform , is used for education and public engagement .
These three methods combined are reaching millions at a time with lifesaving messages designed to keep them safe from contracting the COVID-19 virus .
UNICEF Nigeria 's U-Report platform alone has nearly four million subscribers , the highest in the world .
In February , when the first COVID-19 index case was reported in Nigeria , U-Report launched a COVID-19 Bot to respond to urgent questions , supporting the Nigerian Government 's immediate response .

It facilitates reliable information-sharing in local languages , particularly in hard-to-reach communities with access to only SMS technology .
The COVID-19 Bot has also been deployed to reach thousands of internally displaced people in conflict-ravaged north-east Nigeria .
More than 30,000 people have already accessed the COVID-19 Bot in the north-east , receiving vital information about how they can protect themselves in a very challenging environment .
Elizabeth took part in the UNICEF-supported awareness-raising and sensitization training of community members in the Mende suburb of Lagos .
She is among the hundreds of adults and children in the 378 wards of Lagos State being empowered with information and training on how to communicate COVID-19 prevention messages to their communities and peers .
Her new role as a volunteer peer counselor in her community has given Elizabeth new skills and an important role and purpose to fulfill in her community .
It has also served to allay her own fears .
