A century ago , as the 1918 flu pandemic claimed as many as 50 million lives worldwide , experts rallied to ward off an invisible killer without the benefit of present-day pharmaceuticals or technology .
Their best protection ?  Social distancing .
Not every city was as quick to adopt the strategy , which boils down to keeping families apart long enough that the flu declines instead of jumping from host to host in widening circles .
In 1918 , over the strong objection of theater owners , taverns and the general business community , the health commissioner of St .
Louis imposed one of the strictest quarantines in the country , rolling it out in escalating stages from October through Christmas .
Around the same time , city leaders in Philadelphia downplayed the threat posed by the flu , even going so far as to host a " liberty " parade that drew hundreds of thousands to promote World War I-related government bond sales .
Soon enough , the contrast between the two cities was striking .
Bodies began overwhelming Philadelphia morgues .
The death rate for St .
Louis was indeed high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEASURES TAKE TIME TO WORK '  Today , with the coronavirus spreading , public health experts are pointing to the contrast of Philadelphia and St .
Louis a century ago -- and promising results in Asia and Seattle today -- to advocate for social distancing .
" These big social distancing measures take time to work , " said Dr .
Thomas Inglesby , director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , on social media earlier this month .
" The impact of big interventions in Wuhan , China took about three weeks to start to reverse things .
"  Minnesota Gov .
Tim Walz has said " flattening the curve " of the anticipated rapid spike in cases is no longer possible , given how widespread it is within the state , but the curve can still be bent .
Social distancing buys time for government and industry to assemble the tools it needs to treat the critically ill , from intensive care beds to face masks to ventilators .
With effective social distancing , ICU capacity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing homes and other alternative care sites may be prepared if necessary .
The virus could peak in an estimated 14 weeks , said the governor , who acknowledged that models provided by the University of Minnesota and Minnesota Department of Health depend upon fast-changing variables .
' A BRAND NEW VIRUS WITH TOO LITTLE INFORMATION '  With the experience of St .
Louis and Philadelphia in mind , Dr .
Emily Landon -- the chief infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Chicago Medicine -- joined Illinois state officials this month to deliver a seven-minute speech imploring citizens to respect their governor 's statewide stay-at-home order .
" We now find ourselves facing a brand new virus with too little information , not enough personal protective equipment , changing protocols every single day and no second chances , " Landon said .
" All of us in the field of infectious diseases and the public health community are united in our efforts and agree with this course of action .
"  Calling the coronavirus unforgiving -- " it spreads even before you know you 've caught it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who contract the virus are hospitalized , meaning a fast , wide spread would lead to devastating numbers for the Illinois population , the state 's healthcare network and America as a whole .
" The real problem is not the 80 percent who will get over this in a week .
It 's the 20 percent of patients , the older , those that are immuno-compromised , those that have other medical problems , " Landon said .
" We ca n't take care of everyone at once .
Our healthcare system does n't have any slack .
"  AGGRESSIVE MEASURES  Illinois , Michigan , Massachusetts , Indiana , San Francisco , Philadelphia , Atlanta , Dallas County , Texas and other state and local jurisdictions have joined foreign countries in rolling out " stay at home " orders of various intensity .
Residents are generally allowed or even urged to walk the dog and get exercise -- but ordered to hurry home afterward and avoid groups .
Walz on Wednesday issued a two-week " shelter in place " order effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive measures , including banning evictions and ordering bars and restaurants closed for all but take-out food until May 1 .
Experts continue to encourage the public to wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for 20 seconds or more , cancel get-togethers and work from home whenever possible .
If the coronavirus is as aggressive , contagious and difficult to contain as the experience of virus-ravaged communities in Italy , Spain and Iran would suggest , why not let it run its course ?  More than one elected leader around the country has donned a " leave it to fate " attitude , drawing alarm from medical experts and the public health community .
Frederick Melo was once sued by a reader for $2 million but kept on writing .
He came to the Pioneer Press in 2005 and brings a testy East Coast attitude to St .
Paul beat reporting .
He spent nearly six years covering crime in the Dakota County courts before switching focus to the St .
Paul mayor 's office , city council , and all things neighborhood-related , from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resident of Hamline-Midway , he is married to a Frogtown woman .
He Tweets with manic intensity at @FrederickMelo .
