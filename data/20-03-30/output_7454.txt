It will be decided by the height of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly trying times , this quote by Anand Giridharadas elegantly encapsulates the direction our nation needs to move in -- a need to abandon the notions of individualism and realize the deeply interconnected nature that is shared by every citizen of this country .
The United States invests more financial capital than any other nation into its health care , yet consistently finds itself ranked among the worst health metrics .
By and large , this is a reflection of the lack of safety nets , in the form of essential welfare programs , as well as the insufficient attention placed on preventive measures , both in terms of primary care and basic social programs .
These facets allow for the creation of a system that affords those of higher socioeconomic status the fruits of medicine and health care , while disproportionately baring poorer individuals from pursuing their right to life and liberty .
In many ways , the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both the inadequacies of the American health care system and the leadership that is the Trump administration , or lack thereof .
Despite this nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find ourselves in the middle of a shortage of testing kits to properly screen for the prevalence and incidence of this disease .
Nations like South Korea and China , which rapidly developed and dispersed kits , only stand to rub salt in the wounds that are the failure that is Trump and his policies .
As if the blatant lack of preparation were not enough of a defect , essential medical equipment , like masks and ventilators , remain at a severe shortage as our capitalistic society relishes in price-gouging to raise the cost of essential goods by over 14 times their real value .
As everyday Americans run to their local grocery stores to buy inordinate amounts of toilet paper and canned goods , most are not aware that the grocery store clerks who stock our markets work tirelessly without paid sick leave -- a public health risk that affects even the wealthiest in our society .
But is this not the vision of small government that conservatives and enthusiasts of Reaganomics so viciously fought for ? Is the best government truly the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , and stays the hell out of our business ? The rise of COVID-19 and the inevitable economic recession that awaits makes it clearer than ever that the bedrock of U .
economic principles are ones not created for the average man and woman , but instead for the Jeff Bezoses and Michael Bloombergs of our world .
Yet if there is a silver lining to be found in these difficult times , it is that even the most tumultuous of challenges may allow us to take a moment to reflect on our current values and systems .
Perhaps the concept of universal health care , guaranteed paid sick leave and adequate market regulation are ideas that become increasingly attractive to Americans and politicians .
However , the question still remains : can the screams and cries of conservative news media and their special interest be loud enough to once more subdue a nation into believing that the ultimate evil is big government and its " dangerous " web of welfare programs ? As the veil of small government and its supposed virtues are slowly pulled away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation finds itself in the middle of an existential crisis , we are better prepared to face such challenges because of the past lessons learned .
