And , Gujarat has probably never before faced anything as tough as the coronavirus pandemic that has the State in its grip .
Rising to the occasion are young start-ups that have come up with solutions to tackle the myriad problems that commoners and health professionals face while battling this highly contagious virus .
To tap into the creative and entrepreneurial skills of youngsters , Gujarat government 's Student Start-Up Innovation Policy has come with the ' Innovate While You Isolate ' challenge in which innovators have to come up with products or systems that help people in medical and academic fields as well as those in isolation .
The challenge was launched on Thursday , and SSIP has already received as many as 88 innovative ideas ranging from health care to retail services including home delivery of medicines .
Officials working closely with SSIP said they initiated this challenge mainly for those wanting to innovate products -- from research to prototype .
However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have chosen at least 10 start-ups that have already designed interventions and prepared prototypes of products that can help people , hospitals and local administration .
According to officials , these start-ups will soon work with municipal corporations and hospitals to ease things .
During lockdown , youngsters have ample time to come up with business ideas that will benefit everyone  Anju Sharma , Principal Secy  Funds for products  Start-ups that come up with innovative ideas will get Rs 2 lakh to develop the products .
Those who have already developed products will be given financial support to scale it up .
Principal Secretary of Higher and Technical Education Anju Sharma , who is also chairperson of SSIP Implementation Committee , said , " Start-ups in advance stages that have already prepared prototypes will be directed to conduct tests and seek required permission to hit the market .
Without completing process , we can not allow them to start the sale .

He feels such designs are available in the market , but in time of lockdown , hospitals might suffer shortage .
" Good oral care of patients in ICU has direct co-relation to better chances of survival .
It also reduces Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia .
This is an open-source design , which can be modified , too .
It only requires two things : a 3D printer and cotton gauze , " he said .
Currently , it takes 1 .
hours to make one such toothbrush and is expected to be priced around Rs 650 .
Our team has tested the product with three doctors in Ra j ko t and have received good response .
THE TEAM has come up with a mask that changes colour when it comes in contact with coronavirus .
Dr Pandey said , " The mask consists of absorbent membrane layers that have enzymes which copies DNA into RNA as well as chemical reagents .
These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stable pink colour .
The colour indicates the presence of the virus .
If someone inhales droplets containing the virus , the colour will be visible on a strip on the mask .
" He added , " The mask also prevents virus from penetrating through , preventing infection .
" The team has worked on the concept but it has not been validated as the laboratories are closed now .
As soon as funds are released , the team from Babaria Institute of Pharmacy will complete the prototype .
WHEN THEY heard about the Covid-19 outbreak , this team of engineering students from Vadodara decided to design something that would help in keeping people and healthcare professionals safe .
They thought of designing gloves that would not just protect hands but also sanitise everything it touched .
So the team designed a three-layered gloves .
While the first and last layer were made of latex , the middle layer contained chemical or sanitiser .
Jadav said , " This virus spreads through touch .
When we touch something , we sanitize hands .
But we touch keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it surface .
This glove will sanitise everything that it comes in contact with .
"  The proto-type of the glove is ready and the team will test it in a day .
Once removed from the pack , this glove can be used for three days .

Wearing anti-bacterial clothing/mask will be more effective compared to currently available cotton clothing that is worn by hospital staff .
Anti-bacterial clothing will give them secondary protection beneath disposable Personal Protective Equipment , " he said .
He further added that their nano silver-based anti-bacterial clothing helps kill gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including pneumonia and helps reduce the risk and spread of infections among the wearers .
" Our anti-bacterial mask is more breathable compare to commonly used N95 or surgical masks .
