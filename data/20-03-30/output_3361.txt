Varadkar also said that construction sites that can not implement social distancing should be shut down .
TAOISEACH LEO VARADKAR has said the total death toll from coronavirus is " impossible to predict " , but he would be surprised if the number of deaths stayed below 1,000 .
Varadkar also said that the country 's intensive care units ( ICU ) could reach capacity within a few days but that the health service is making an " unprecedented effort " to increase capacity .
" We are only still learning about it .
But if you take the average flu season in Ireland , there would usually be around 500 deaths , if you take a bad flu season in Ireland there would roughly be a thousand deaths , " Varadkar told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a very pleasant surprise , if the number of deaths at the end of this was less than a thousand .
That 's just a rough idea of what we might be in for .
" Just like the flu season , those most at risk are older people , people who have chronic diseases .
Often it 's the virus that is what affects them in the end .
"  Ireland saw its biggest rise in deaths from Covid-19 in a single day after 10 new deaths were confirmed by the Department of Health last night .
The death toll here has now more than doubled to 19 , while the number of cases now stands at 1,819 .
Data released by the Health Protection Services Centre yesterday showed that as of midnight , Tuesday 24 March , 25% of cases ( 340 ) have been hospitalised , and 47 cases have been admitted to ICU .
Varadkar said an unprecedented effort is being made by the health service to tool up , recruit , and provide additional capacity .
" As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but just the way things are heading would indicate that our ICUs will be at capacity within a few days , " he said .
But just as we 're seeing across Europe , just as we 're seeing in America now , just as we saw in China , there is n't a health service in the world that is going to be able to tool up or scale-up as quickly as is necessary .
" We 're going to be managing a very difficult situation , and everyone is going to be doing the best job they can "  Social distancing  Varadkar also said that construction sites that can not implement social distancing should be shut down .
He said that " absolutely essential " construction work needs to continue , including health care facilities and pharmaceutical plants .

" That can never be done perfectly .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not being done perfectly in other places , but it needs to be done to an acceptable extent that people are protected and the risk of the transmission of the virus is minimised .
" I 'm glad the unions and the Construction Industry Federation are working together on this , but if there are sites that can not comply , can not implement social distancing for most people most of the time , then those sites will have to close .
