Banks try to stop wave of evictions with loan delays for landlords  Banks will allow commercial landlords to delay their loan repayment by up to six months to prevent thousands of businesses from being evicted , as the financial sector braces for a lengthy " hibernation " across the economy .
Lenders on Monday said a support package for business borrowers would be expanded to include an extra $100 billion of loans , as they move to help more companies survive the measures introduced by the federal government to contain the coronavirus pandemic .
Australian Banking Association chief executive Anna Bligh said the policy would help thousands of small businesses that would otherwise face being evicted .
It came as the chief executive of National Australia Bank , Ross McEwan , and Commonwealth Bank chief executive , Matt Comyn , both raised doubts about whether business would effectively be put into " hibernation " for six months , a timeframe the federal government has hinted at as it ramps up " social distancing " policies .
NAB 's Mr McEwan told The Australian Financial Review 's banking and wealth summit on Monday : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for six months .
It would be a very , very big strain on everybody 's balance sheet , but we 'll have to wait and see how long the impacts of this virus go for .

Instead , he suggested that if transmission rates could be lowered in the community , there might be more " flexibility " to ease some of the containment measures over time .
With banks playing a critical role in the government 's plan to keep businesses afloat , ANZ Bank chief Shayne Elliott also warned that banks could not rescue all firms and would need to prioritise those with sustainable business models to avoid Australia emerging from the crisis as a " zombie economy " .

Australian Banking Association chief executive Anna Bligh said increasing the threshold to $10 million would mean an extra 30,000 businesses could access the relief .
The landlords of pubs , clubs , shopping centres and restaurants would be able to defer payments if they promised not to terminate leases or evict tenants that had been hit by fallout from the virus .
