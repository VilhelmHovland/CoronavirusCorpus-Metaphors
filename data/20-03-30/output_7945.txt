The movie based on Sony 's flagship action-adventure game has been pushed back to a later date in 2021 .
The Uncharted movie starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg has been delayed yet again .
This time , however , it 's not due to anything related to the creative direction of the film .
Instead , Sony has delayed the movie as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis .
The Uncharted movie has shifted from March 5 , 2021 to October 8 , 2021 , a delay of around seven months .
The delay is surely due to how production was postponed before it could even begin .
Given how the COVID-19 crisis is evolving with new developments every day , it seems the movie 's new date is merely a projection .
Local governments around the world are not allowing people to gather in the same place for non-essential activities , and this impacts filmmaking .
Until those restrictions are loosened or lifted , no movie or TV project is able to begin production again .
The Uncharted movie has been in the works for a decade already , shuffling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now set , however , with Holland attached to play a young Nathan Drake and Wahlberg as his mentor , Victor " Sully " Sullivan .
Oscar nominee Antonio Banderas also has a role in the movie alongside Sophia Ali ( Grey 's Anatomy ) as the female lead .
Chilling Adventures of Sabrina actress Tati Gabrielle has also come aboard in a major role .
The Uncharted film will be directed by Ruben Fleischer , who previously directed the Zombieland movies and Venom for Sony .
It 's written by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway , who wrote the original Iron Man movie .
