Her husband , Damian , was left in a coma for four weeks after contracting the seasonal flu and was left fighting for his life , just like many Aussies now battling coronavirus .
Gemma and Damian Loomans .
( Facebook/Gemma Loomans )  Sharing an emotional post to Facebook , Gemma urged people to realise that if the flu could have such a devastating impact on her family , COVID-19 can do so much worse to other Aussies .
Especially when so many Australians are ignoring advice to self-isolate , which could lead to hospitals becoming overrun and struggling to treat everyone .
" It breaks my heart to still see people all over social media not doing the right thing and social distancing , " Gemma began her emotional Facebook post .
" Damian and I made the decision to post this together , because apparently some people just do n't get it .
Please , from someone who sat by the person they love more than anything in the world for over a month not knowing if he would wake up , please stay home .
"  Gemma at Damian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flu .
( Facebook/Gemma Loomans )  The frustrated young Aussie then slammed the common myths that COVID-19 is " just a bad flu " or " only gets old people " , recounting the horror she felt as she watched her husband battle the virus .
Damian , 33 , had no pre-existing medical conditions when he contracted the flu , but he ended up in a coma on a breathing machine for four weeks .
He was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) for critical lung failure and doctors later had to create an incision in his throat to fit a breathing tube to keep him alive .
Looms received multiple calls from doctors telling her that they were " running out of options " , and even though Damian woke from his coma and is on the mend , he has months of recovery ahead of him , including learning how to walk , eat and talk again .
In the six weeks he spend in ICU and 2 weeks in recovery , Damian lost almost 30 kilos of muscle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with " nightmares and hallucinations " Gemma said .
Gemma has warned Aussies to take COVID-19 seriously after almost losing her husband to the flu .
( Facebook/Gemma Loomans )  What 's worse , all of this was going on at a time when the couple should have been celebrating .
" All of this when we should have been celebrating our miraculous pregnancy , instead was spent in the ICU ward , " Gemma wrote .
" The nurses knew the gender of the baby before Damian , because he was unconscious fighting for his life .
He missed all of the early baby scans .
Because of ' just ' the flu .
"  She went on to say that Damian only survived because resources were available and is now urging people to self-isolate to reduce the spread of COVID-19 , and make sure that those resources stay available for people diagnosed with the virus .
" If there were no hospital beds , Damian would be dead .
If there were no available air ambulances , he would be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support staff he would be dead , " she said .
Damian faces months of recovery after four weeks in a coma .
( Facebook/Gemma Loomans )  " Please , flatten the curve .
It 's not just about you , it 's about all of us .
"  The Australian government is continuing to urge Aussies to stay at home and self-isolate as the nation 's health system scrambles to manage the pandemic and attempts to contain the virus .
At the time of writing , more than 3,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Australia and though there have been reports that the infection rate is slowing , that figure is expected to rise .
