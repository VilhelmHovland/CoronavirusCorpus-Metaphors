The first pumped hydro project in Australia 's main grid in nearly 40 years -- and the first outside public ownership -- looks almost certain to go ahead after the listed Genex landed a revised off-take agreement with utility EnergyAustralia for its 2,000MWh Kidston storage project .
The new deal for the Kidston project -- located in an old gold mine of the same name , and sized at 250MW of capacity with eight hours of storage -- was announced on Monday morning after months of haggling between the two parties after EnergyAustralia -- under pressure from its major shareholder CLP Holdings -- pulled out of its previously agreed off-take arrangement .
The new deal means that rather than locking in for a 30-year contract , EnergyAustralia will sign up for a 10-year agreement , with options to extend for an initial 10-year period and then a further 10-year period .
It will operate the plant , have full dispatch rights and meet its operating costs , in much the same way as it does with the Ballarat and Gannawarra big batteries in Victoria .
EnergyAustralia will also carry all the risk of volume and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity investment in the project .
Genex will receive an escalating annual fixed fee -- which it compares to a " secure bond-like cash flow .
" It has locked in around $610 million in debt from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility , and will see a joint venture partner to meet half of the expected equity costs of around $100 million , which includes its share of the cost of a new transmission line .
" It took a while , but we got there in the end , " Genex director Simon Kidston told RenewEconomy in a phone interview .
" It 's been a frustrating year .
but this deal means the project will go ahead .
"  Financial close and construction is expected to begin in the third quarter of this year , although the timing may be adjusted depending on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic .
Genex is also looking to add 270MW of utility scale solar -- there is already a 50MW solar plant at the mine-site -- and 150MW of wind .
Kidston indicated that because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queensland as a whole , Genex was now likely to place a higher priority on the wind component .
Kidston told RenewEconomy that the design of the deal means that if EnergyAustralia does not extend beyond the initial 10-year period then the debt component should already have been paid down sufficiently for the company to comfortably seek another commercial arrangement , or even enter the merchant market .
( The storage market should be well advanced by then ) .
EnergyAustralia said in a statement quoting markets executive Ross Edwards that the Kidston project is both " big " and " a first for Australia " , and would provide much-needed reliability and security for the electricity market , as more renewables enter the system .
" Pumped hydro is the perfect technology to complement solar energy , with its ability to store excess power in the middle of the day and then generate in the mornings and evenings when our customers need it , " Edwards was quoted as saying .
" We thank the community , our counterparts and anyone who has actively followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the specifics .
" It 's important that we continue to invest in the transition to a cleaner energy future through these challenging times to provide much-needed jobs and economic activity .
"  A start in the third quarter means that the Kidston project will beat the more controversial Snowy 2 .
project to the punch , and become the first new pumped hydro project in the National Electricity Market for nearly four decades .
And the first to be built by private interests .
Another half a dozen or so pumped hydro projects are being proposed -- mostly in South Australia and NSW -- with some in the short-list of projects being considered by the federal government 's heavily delayed Underwriting New Generation Investment scheme .
The Australian Renewable Energy Agency has also said it will put $40 million towards one of three pumped hydro projects in South Australia , and says it has made its choice , but wo n't announce the winner until a contract is finalised .
The deal with EnergyAustralia is subject to a number of conditions precedent , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied prior to the financial close sunset date of 31 December 2020 .
