Chief executive Jackie Brierton said the support for self-employed people announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Thursday evening -- which included some self-employed people being able to claim 80% of earnings -- was welcome .
But she said the delay in payments until June would see many " struggle to survive " .
She said : " The spread of Covid-19 presents enormous challenges for businesses across Scotland and especially for small and micro-businesses in rural Scotland , which contribute ? 37 billion to the Scottish economy every year .
" The support package announced by the chancellor on Thursday for business owners and the self-employed is obviously welcome but it 's not going to prevent serious financial hardship for many individuals and their families in rural areas .
" With a delay until June for any payments to be made , many will struggle to survive and those who have only recently started a business , and have n't yet completed a self-assessment return , will have to use the benefits system .
" Self-employed people contribute billions of pounds into the UK economy through tax , national insurance and VAT payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers and customers .
" They are an essential part of our economy and adequate support needs to be delivered in a timely fashion .
"  GrowBiz is providing phone and online support to anyone who is self-employed or running a small or micro-business in rural areas of Scotland .
In addition , the group is running a programme of online learning sessions and networking events for the rest of March and into April that are open to anyone looking for support .
Ms Brierton said : " GrowBiz is here to help rural businesses think through alternative strategies and different ways to reach their markets -- and provide information on funding .
" We can also signpost to other sources of assistance .
" Our aim is to help anyone who is self-employed or running a small or micro-business in a rural area to get through the next few months .
