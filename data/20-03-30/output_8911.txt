NEW HAVEN , CT ( WFSB ) - Families continue to have fewer and fewer outdoor options available due to the spread of the coronavirus .
Local playgrounds around the state have now been forced to close .
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said he issued the order because people were not practicing social distancing .
" A lot of playgrounds and parks are n't fenced , " Elicker said .
" Those that are we will be locking .
Those that are n't will be posting signs encouraging people not to use them .
"  Elsewhere in the state , parents were urged to make sure the public place they plan to go is actually open .
At East Rock Park on Monday morning , the gates to the playground were chained up and locked , while yellow caution tape was wrapped around the swing sets .
" We were sad , but we 're also trying not to touch things , so we were not going to use the playground things anyway , " said parent Birke Gregg , of New Haven .
The mayor admits , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking people to follow the rules .
" Please , please , please people , remember to keep 6 feet from each other , do not congregate in large groups , " Elicker said .
At this point , Elicker said they are not going to be arresting or fining people , rather if they get a complaint of lots of people on playgrounds , they 'll send a police officer out who will tell them to leave .

( 1 ) comment  I have no idea why the citizens of New Haven choose to have selective listening and just do what they are supposed to do and LISTEN ! Putting others at risk is not an option for you .
Obviously they have little care for the health and well-being of others and loved ones or this action ( shutting down playgrounds ) would n't have occurred - GET A CLUE !  Welcome to the discussion .
