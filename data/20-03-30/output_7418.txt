Letter : State needs to get busy with testing , securing beds , ventilators  Monday  Mar 30 , 2020 at 4:11 AM  Gov .
Mike DeWine and his health director , Dr .
Amy Acton , have deservedly received plaudits from across the country for their quick and decisive action in addressing the coronavirus epidemic .
That initial forward-looking response looks to be squandered , though , because of a lack of coronavirus tests being provided to the citizens of Ohio .
While it is hard to know with certainty why both Germany and South Korea have the lowest mortality rates by far of any major country facing the epidemic , many officials in both countries attribute the reason for their success to their comprehensive testing programs .
If this is true , Ohio is in far worse shape than our officials have let on .
As of Thursday , Ohio ranked absolutely dead last of the 50 states in the percentage of its citizens who have been tested .
One wonders further , if Ohio officials are doing such a poor job in rolling out testing , will they prove to be capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need if the health director 's prediction of 6,000 new cases daily in May becomes a reality ?
