I was planning to write an update from the International Hospitality Investment Forum ( IHIF ) in Berlin , which was due to take place between 2-4 March 2020 .
I expected to be commenting on a buoyant international investment market , warm affection for the Scottish hotel scene and underlying optimism from operators who have capitalised on a booming picture of international travel .
Unfortunately , at the 11th hour , the IHIF was cancelled ( or , rather , postponed until early May ) .
The reason for this is of course the spread of the Coronavirus -- or COVID-19 as it 's officially known -- and the escalating concern across the globe as governments and health authorities scramble to try to contain the spread of the infection .
This is obviously going to have an immediate effect on the local hotels in Berlin and their counterparts in Cannes , which was due to host the international MIPIM property event , now postponed .
But the hotel and hospitality industry is braced for more widespread effects that could cause a serious dent in trading .

In terms of the international market , visitors from China are top-ranked globally for international tourist expenditure .
In the UK , that part of the market spent an estimated  ? 656 million in 2018 .
Here in Scotland , the proportion of our international visitors who came from China was higher than the average for the rest of the UK .
That market has already experienced a significant downturn and we are likely to see a similar drying-up in visitors from heavily affected areas , such as northern Italy and South Korea .
As the virus spreads , and fears about air travel escalate , we could easily see a massive drop in international visitors .
The chains and brands targeting these international visitors are likely to suffer the most .
Here in Scotland , hotels in Glasgow have been anticipating a bumper pay-day when the Cop26 climate change conference comes to the city in November -- but there are now doubts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture is a bit more mixed .
Undoubtedly , business travel will soften and the hotels in the largest UK cities who have priced their offering to fit with median expenses limits could see a substantial drop in bookings .
Hotels in London are already reporting immediate drops of approximately 15 per cent .
However , there are already some good news stories coming through from hotels who  expect a surge in staycations and trips within the UK .
As more stories come to light of  foreign hotels in lockdown or entire cruise ships in quarantine , it will be hugely tempting to  book an Easter or summer holiday somewhere closer to home .
Domestic travel agency Hoseasons said that enquiries last week were up 15 per cent year-on-year , while other operators have boasted of rises of up to 50 per cent compared with the same period last year .
At the moment , we are going into uncharted territory .
It is likely we 'll see new challenges as well as opportunities emerge .
Will there be a boom as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is serious disruption to normal day-to-day food supplies ) ? As yet most domestic businesses have not changed their own internal conference arrangements , but as worries over mass gatherings grow we could easily see widespread cancellations of venue hires for conferences .
However , the hotels market in the UK is a resilient one .
A few years ago the rise of Airbnb led many to claim that the writing was on the wall for huge parts of the hotels industry .
That has turned out not to be the case -- and indeed the sector is generally in a robust state of health .
Whether the wider market shares the optimism of the organisers of the IHIF -- that all will be well for the conference to proceed in two months ' time -- remains to be seen .
