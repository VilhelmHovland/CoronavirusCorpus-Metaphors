Bridge Magazine reports an executive order that would let seniors who were previously on track to graduate do so and give schools their full state funding through the end of the school budget year as long as districts continue to pay teachers and other school employees is forthcoming as soon as this week .
The order will also provide for some form of remote learning for students for the rest of the school year , Bridge reported .
Asked to confirm the report Monday evening , Whitmer spokesperson Tiffany Brown declined , adding there are " no updates at this time " on the status of ongoing school closures .
