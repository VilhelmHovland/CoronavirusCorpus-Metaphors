A Florida sheriff on Monday sought an arrest warrant for the pastor of a megachurch after officials said he held two services with hundreds of people and violated a safer-at-home order put in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus .
Hillsborough Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news conference Monday that he was negotiating with the attorney of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hernando County , where he lives .
Chronister added that the pastor has " an arsenal of weaponry " and " a vast security force .
"  " We 're allowing him to turn himself in .
If he does n't , then we 're going to be forced to be police officers and go get him , and law enforcement is highly trained to handle it appropriately , " the sheriff said .

A week ago , @carpeveritas was worried about the civil liberty implications of shutdowns and potential arrests of people .
I am too , it 's a fine line we have to walk to strongly encourage people to do the right thing in solidarity with our fellow countrymen/women without turning life into some police state .
But this pastor 's actions go so far beyond the pale that the only reasonable response is arrest .
Hopefully this will deter others who contemplate similarly irresponsible and willfull flaunting of the law and putting the public at risk .
I do n't understand why people follow someone so blindly .
Since you/they believe in God then use what God gave you and think for yourself .

It 's strange to me that people do n't expect God to see what 's in their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect their family do they think God is going to be upset they were n't at church ?  I had this discussion with my dad back in the day , who was Jewish , and did what most Jews do , which is go to temple on the two big Jewish holidays of the year .
And I said , " Dad , if you truly believe in God do you think going to temple two days a year is going to slip by him and have him convinced you 're a legit practicing Jew ? "  It 's strange to me that people do n't expect God to see what 's in their hearts .
If they stay home from church on a Sunday to protect their family do they think God is going to be upset they were n't at church ?  I had this discussion with my dad back in the day , who was Jewish , and did what most Jews do , which is go to temple on the two big Jewish holidays of the year .

Church is wherever you want it to be .
There are millions and millions of churches all over the world right now .
our homes and our neighborhoods .
All it takes is picking up the Bible and reading with your family or your neighbors from the deck .
