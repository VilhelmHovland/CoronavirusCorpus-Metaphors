The government will spend $130 billion over the next six months to keep about six million Australians in jobs , in the third and largest stimulus package to cushion the impact of coronavirus on the economy .
Designed to keep employees attached to their workplace even if a business goes into " hibernation , " the JobKeeper payment will be a flat $1500 payment each fortnight , Prime Minister Scott Morrison said .
Businesses and not-for-profit organisations that lose 30 per cent more of their revenue over a month-long period from March 1 would be eligible for the payment , but businesses with turnover of more than $1 billion annually would need to have lost half their revenue , and the banks are not included .
All workers , whether they be casual , full time or part time , will be treated the same , as long as they were employed on March 1 .
For casuals they need to have been employed for the past 12 months , and can only claim the payment from one employer .
