Steam continues breaking records , this time at 22 million users  Spiking 10% over last weekend 's record-breaking high , Steam has reached a new peak concurrent user count of 22 million online .
With 22,678,529 users this record is yet another for Steam in the past weeks as millions of people practice social distancing , isolation , lockdown , and quarantine under the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic .
Like previous spikes , this spike came at around 15:00 GMT : Mid-morning for the United States , afternoon in the UK , and peak night gaming hours in China .
The in-game concurrent players at the time was n't a record , though it 's close at over 7 million .
The top games at the time of the peak were Counter-Strike : Global Offensive and Dota 2 , Steam 's major free games .
These were followed by Football Manager 2020 , a popular series currently enjoying a free period until March 25th .
( We quite liked it in our review .
)  It 's hard to tell if Steam will hit a definitive peak during this period , or if it will begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to enter lockdowns in the coming weeks , there 's not much doubt that records will continue to break .
It 's more that we 're all wondering when the end will come .
