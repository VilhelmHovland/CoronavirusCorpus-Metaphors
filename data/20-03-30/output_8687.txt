The online exams are " free-response , " in which students write in their answers .
Students will have the option to write their responses by hand and submit a photo , or they can take the test on any device -- computer , tablet or smartphone , according to CollegeBoard , the company that administers the tests .
" Based on the number and length of school closures , it 's clear that the usual way AP Exams are given at schools wo n't be possible , " according to CollegeBoard .

For each Advanced Placement subject , there will be two different testing dates , which have yet to be released .
The full exam schedule and additional testing information will be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , and I think they 're making the best of a bad situation , " Gaspard said .
" The good thing is they are not testing any skills ( that would be taught ) beyond March .
"  Schools in Louisiana are closed , but teachers like Gaspard are making sure their students are ready for the test by emailing students with links to free resources and practice tests from AP and CollegeBoard .
He is going over skills three times a week through Google Classroom .
These are n't required , as the Lafayette Parish School System is not giving assignments or tests while schools are closed .
But teachers are making resources available , whether they be for fourth-grade math or the AP English composition exam like Gaspard 's juniors .
His students can take advantage of free , live review sessions via the AP YouTube channel .

" The content is difficult .
The pacing is difficult .
Expectations are pretty high .
"  She said some of her students are doing their own research and investigation to get ready for the test .
Some are watching the livestreams on YouTube and Facebook to practice while also getting a connection to others in a classroom .
Peterson has watched some of the CollegeBoard classes and has recommended them for her students .
The classes are starting with content she had covered already .
" They 're doing a great job giving guided practice , " Peterson said .
" It is part content and part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on free response questions , which will be the totality of the shortened test this year .
Peterson has practiced free response in her classes , but as one part of a mix of questions .
" That ( practice ) is invaluable right now , " Peterson said .
" If you are lacking in FRQ , there 's a lot less wiggle room .
