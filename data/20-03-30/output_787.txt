Boeing has established that he drove workers from the gate into the site during the second and third shifts on the evenings of Tuesday through Friday of last week .

and 1:30 a .

The first confirmed death of COVID-19 in a homeless person was last week in California ; in Washington , the first positive test was reported in Tacoma on March 18 by the Tacoma News Tribune .
Public health and local providers have ramped up testing of homeless populations in Seattle this week , but shelter providers have complained that they 've had trouble getting homeless-shelter clients with symptoms of COVID-19 into the county 's isolation and quarantine units .

The union representing 900 nurses at PeaceHealth St .
Joseph Medical Center in Bellingham is " appalled " at Friday 's firing of Dr .
Ming Lin , a veteran emergency room physician who had publicly criticized the hospital 's practices to prevent coronavirus infections , a spokesperson said Saturday .
The Washington State Nurses Association also has filed a complaint with the state Department of Labor over what it believes is a failure to provide a safe work environment at the hospital , where Lin was fired Friday .
" At a time when our state faces a critical shortage of frontline caregivers -- as we are appealing for volunteers and trying to reactivate retired nurses and doctors and pressing nursing students into service -- it is outrageous that hospital management could retaliate against health care professionals for speaking the truth , " the union said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the voice for many nurses and other health care workers who are afraid to speak up out of the very real fear that they could be disciplined or fired .
We salute his courage , and we demand that he be reinstated so he can continue his life-saving work .
"  The union , which represents 19,000 nurses statewide , said other front-line health care workers attempting to speak out about unsafe conditions are being " muzzled " by hospital administrators during the COVID-19 crisis .
Nurses at the Bellingham hospital report being out of paper gowns , and said they are being directed to reuse and share protective equipment , the statement said .
Lin , a 30-year emergency room veteran and 17-year employee of St .
Joseph , was informed Friday by an administrator from TeamHealth , the Tennessee-based , national medical subcontracting firm that employs him , that he was fired .
Both TeamHealth and PeaceHealth declined to respond to questions about reasons for Lin 's removal from St .
Joseph .
A public-relations firm representing TeamHealth confirmed Saturday that Lin had been removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained under contract with TeamHealth , which hoped to help him " find a path forward .
"  Lin responded that , because he was paid by TeamHealth only for shifts at St .

"  Gun dealers should be ' essential businesses , ' say some legislators and law enforcement officials  Dozens of legislators and law enforcement officials signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking him to declare firearm dealers " essential businesses " that can remain open during the novel coronavirus crisis .
By forcing the dealers to close with a recent stay-at-home order , the governor is violating the Constitution and jeopardizing public safety , the letters said .
" Some things do n't stop because of COVID-19 and , unfortunately , one of those is crime , " said state Sen .
Lynda Wilson , R-Vancouver , in a news release .
The similar letters said law enforcement and security businesses rely on gun dealers for ammunition .
What 's more , the letters said : " Local law enforcement officials have also seen a significant increase in background checks in this time of crisis , when thousands of Washingtonians have decided to purchase firearms for personal protection .
"  Many of these residents are first-time gun buyers in rural areas , where law enforcement might not be able to respond immediately , the letters added .
Others have argued there are risks in sanctioning a rash of first-time , untrained and perhaps panicky gun buyers .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep their distance  With bus ridership dropping significantly amid the coronavirus outbreak , King County Metro this week began to cut bus service .
But Metro now says it will restore some of those cut trips " to help riders distance themselves from one another .
"  Metro will restore some weekday trips on more than a dozen routes , including restoring all trips on the RapidRide A between Tukwila International Boulevard Station and Federal Way , the agency announced Saturday .
Overall , Metro ridership is down 70% , but some routes serving downtown have seen less of a drop than others , Metro said , which could make it harder for riders and drivers to practice social distancing .
When taking transit during service reductions , be wary of apps like Google Maps and One Bus Away , which may not have updated information .
Check Metro 's website , text your stop ID to 62550 or call 206-553-3000 on weekdays for customer service .

The Girl Scouts of Western Washington is canceling all camp programs for the 2020 season and reducing staff as the coronavirus pandemic continues exacting its toll .
Washington 's stay-at-home compounded earlier setbacks in the group 's cookie-sales program , said Megan Ferland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl Scout families .
She described the " excruciatingly difficult decision " to cancel camps , which , with the lost cookie revenue , " brought major financial impacts to our council in the last couple of days .
"  Of the group 's approximately 160 employees , Ferland said , 81 positions will see reductions , shifts to part-time , eliminations and salary reductions -- including her own -- effective April 10 .
Ferland said that even if the outbreak eases by late May , it would be too risky to convene girls , young people and staff for camps in June .
" Given that other places have seen infections spike as soon they 've relaxed mitigation efforts , we 'd have to prepare any camp we held for a possible outbreak , " Ferland wrote .
" Our girls and staff are not worth the risk .
Also , most of our camp properties are n't prepared for it , which means it would be prohibitively costly -- and a procurement nightmare given the scarcity of the necessary supplies and equipment .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Connecticut  President Donald Trump floated the idea of a quarantine as early as Saturday affecting residents of New York , New Jersey and Connecticut for a short time to stop the spread of coronavirus from reaching states with fewer infections .
But Gov .
Andrew Cuomo , D-N .
, who has criticized the federal government 's response as his state became the country 's virus epicenter , said the issue had not come up in a conversation he had with Trump earlier Saturday .
The federal government is empowered under the law to take measures to prevent the spread of communicable diseases between states , but it 's not clear that means Trump can order state residents to stay put .
Coronavirus hits U .
police  An increasing number of police departments around the country are watching their ranks get sick as the number of coronavirus cases explodes across the U .
Nearly 690 officers and civilian employees at police departments and sheriff 's offices around the country have tested positive for COVID-19 , according to an Associated Press survey this week , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is far higher in many places .
The growing tally raises questions about how laws can and should be enforced during the pandemic , and about how departments will hold up as the virus spreads among those whose work puts them at increased risk of infection .

What 's essential ? In France : pastry , wine .
In U .
: guns , ganja  The coronavirus pandemic is defining for the globe what 's " essential " and what things we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them for survival .

Lorena Gonz ? lez and U .
Pramila Jayapal are urging the U .
Department of Justice to close Seattle 's immigration court during the novel coronavirus pandemic and Gov .
Jay Inslee 's stay-at-home order .
Seattle 's immigration court was shut earlier this month after a " reported second-hand exposure " to the virus .
But the court reopened Thursday for filings , and hearings for those held at the Northwest detention center in Tacoma are ongoing .
In a news release Friday , Durkan described the court 's reopening as " a public health violation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reckless and irresponsible for the Trump administration to allow immigration courts to operate despite an active pandemic , " she said .
Durkan also said the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) should " extend immigration court filing deadlines in light of this global health emergency , so immigrants and their legal representatives do not have to choose between protecting their health and meeting a deadline .
"  Gonz ? lez said immigration detention centers also should release detainees " so they can return home and be healthy and safe with their families .
"  In a letter Thursday , Jayapal , D-Seattle , similarly urged the DOJ to " immediately close immigration courts across the country " and to extend deadlines to at least three months after emergencies end in each state .
Her letter was signed by the members Washington 's Democratic congressional delegations , including Sens .
Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell .
Fact check : Trump a rosy outlier on science of the virus  Groundless assurances keep coming from President Donald Trump , a rosy outlier on the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way since before the virus spread widely in the U .
, when he supposed that the warmer weather of April might have it soon gone , a prospect the public health authorities said was not affirmed by the research .
Now he 's been talking about a country revved up again by Easter , while his officials play down that possibility from the same White House platform .

A driver for Snohomish County 's Community Transit died Thursday after testing positive for COVID-19 less than two weeks ago .
Ten Community Transit employees have now tested positive or presumptive positive for COVID-19 , and while it 's not known whether they caught the virus at work or somewhere else , they fear they 're at the center of an outbreak .
After complaints alleging that workers were exposed to unsanitary conditions , even before the novel coronavirus outbreak , the King County ombudsman 's office has started a preliminary investigation into Metro Transit 's bus cleaning procedures .
