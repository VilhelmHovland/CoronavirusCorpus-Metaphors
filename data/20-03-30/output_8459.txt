People are generally aware of the most common causes of hallucinations , like schizophrenia and a really high fever .
But lesser known are the more rare causes ; here are six you probably have n't heard about .
As per a new update , a new ( and experimental ) attempt to save lives will have doctors fusing the blood of British coronavirus patients with blood plasma harvested from " hyperimmune " people who managed to survive the disease since it can supposedly help fight the infection .
New Experimental Treatment  Per the doctors and health experts behind it , this new type of experimental treatment will be directed to patients who ended up on intensive care units just because their bodies were n't able to fight the coronavirus .
Furthermore , in an effort to stem the spread of the illness as well as reduce pressure on the health service and frontliners , the experimental treatment will also be given to those who are in contact with COVID-19 patients , such as NHS staff and any other family member who 's been exposed to some degree .
According to the experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have managed to jump back from coronavirus have antibodies in their blood plasma that can help them maintain a solid defense against the infection .
The aim right now , however , is to identify who is " hyperimmune " to the virus , and then ask them to donate some blood , which would then be used in a number of clinical trials that include it getting infused with the blood of current coronavirus patients .
" Start-up will need to be faster than is normal , with most other trials usually taking months or years to get approvals and to begin .
Trials need to be undertaken , otherwise we will not know if this intervention is effective and worthwhile .
It may not be a silver bullet , or it may work for instance to stem the development of Covid-19 infection in contacts such as healthcare workers and their families , but not perhaps be as effective to treat severely ill patients being ventilated , " Prof .
David Tappin , a senior research fellow at the University of Glasgow , who has applied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the plasma , said .
Moving forward , the blood plasma will also be screened if they are safe to use before the trials begin .
A new study shows that people with type A blood are more likely to get infected by the novel coronavirus , while blood type O could be more resistant .
