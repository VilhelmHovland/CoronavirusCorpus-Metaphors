The Indian government had directed the states to strictly follow the nation-wide lockdown norms and stop the movement of people across the cities , advising them to arrange shelter , food and other facilities for migrant labours at their workplace .
In addition , the Union government has also clarified that transportation of all goods , without the distinction of essential and non-essential , have been allowed .
The direction came amid migration of labourers from cities to their villages in different states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar after prime minister ( PM ) Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced nation-wide lock-down to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission .
Noting that there has been movement of migrant workers in some parts of the country , Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba through video conferencing with officials of the ministry of home affairs ( MHA ) , state chief secretaries and directors general of police decided to ' seal ' the district and state borders .
Later on Sunday , the MHA wrote to states and union territories ( UTs ) to take measures to prevent large-scale migration of workers .
In a five-point guideline , Home Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate arrangements like " temporary shelters and provision for food to poor and needy people , including migrant labourers , stranded due to lockdown measures in their respective areas .
"  As per the direction , the migrant labourers who have moved out to reach their home states must be kept in the nearest shelter by the state and UT government quarantine facilities after proper " screening for a minimum of 14 days " as per standard health protocol .
" All the employers , be it in the industry or in the shops and commercial establishments , shall make payment or wages of their workers , at their work places , on the due date , without any deduction , for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown , " the order said .
The order mentions that the landlords of properties where migrant labourers are living in rented accommodations shall not demand payments or rents for a period or one month .
On sealing the borders , Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba said during video conferencing : " Directions were issued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were directed to ensure there is no movement of people across cities or on highways , " said a government statement .
" Only movement of goods should be allowed .
District magistrates ( DMs ) and superintendents of police ( SPs ) should be made personally responsible for implementation of these directions which have been issued under the disaster management act " .
Saying that " sufficient funds are available with states in the state disaster response fund ( SDRF ) , " the Cabinet secretary advised states to ensure timely payment of wages to labourers at their place of work during the 21-day " period of lockdown without any cut .
"  It was ordered that house rent should not be demanded from the labourers for this period and action should be taken against those who are asking labourers or students to vacate the premises .

" Essential supplies have also been maintained .
Situation is being monitored round the clock and necessary measures are being taken as required .
"  Separately , the MHA had issued an addendum to its guidelines on nation-wide lock-down that includes additional essential goods and services in the exempt list .

User  Alert me when a new comment is posted  COMMENTS  Meenal Mamdani  12 hours ago  Central government can not ensure any of these orders to aid the migrants as these will have to be carried out by the various states .
But what it can enforce is the sealing of borders and the police will be given a free hand to enforce it .
Are we under a central govt elected by us , that cares for our well being or are we ruled by a colonial govt that cares about law and order above all else ?  Whenever the Prime Minister ( PM ) addresses the nation at 8 pm , it is anticipated with great trepidation .
Twice , it triggered enormous panic .
On 8th November 2016 , when he announced the debilitating demonetisation of currency , and again on 24 March 2020 , when he put the country into a drastic 21-day lockdown to beat the coronavirus .
In both instances , the decision had great public support .
People supported demonetisation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; instead it dealt a blow to economic growth that we are still to recover from .
This time too , the nation is willing to stand with the PM in this tough action .
Unfortunately , like in demonetisation , this time too , it is the poorest people -- migrant labour , daily wage workers and small and the self-employed that are bearing the brunt of the decision announced , without adequate preparation or attention to detail .
Relief Package  On 24th March , the PM announced a paltry Rs15,000 crore allocation to strengthen India 's health infrastructure to deal with Covid-19 .
This was a day after Rs20,000 crore was allocated for a wasteful revamp of New Delhi 's majestic central vista ) , It was only on 26th March that finance minister ( FM ) has announced a more comprehensive , Rs 1 .
lakh crore relief package that included medical workers and weaker sections of society .
For all others , the relief so far , is mainly in terms of additional time for filing returns and a reduction in penalties for late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evident that this is not going to be enough .
The initial package does n't cover all those who are affected , especially the massive disruption of small businesses whose revival is crucial to restart economic growth .
The FM 's announcements so far have been mainly for those who have Jan-Dhan accounts , or are existing beneficiaries of some state schemes .
We know for a fact that these do not cover all Indians and there are plenty of glitches in the delivery process .
A lot more needs to be done for small entrepreneurs , self-employed professionals and others who are going to have a harrowing time paying equated monthly instalments ( EMIs ) on home loans and other borrowings .
They need forbearance and time to make payments without affecting their credit scores .
No announcements have been made in this regard .
( This column was written before the RBI announcements on 27th March ) It is extraordinary for the PM to exhort employers to pay salaries , without any concessions to smaller employers whose businesses have been shut down or disrupted for over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemic needs to be tackled with far greater planning , empathy and deeper connect with people , who are fighting to come to terms with an unforeseen calamity .
Instead we have the opposite .
There are heart-rending images from across India of the police resorting to indiscriminate violence and humiliating people .
Employees who are clearly exempted under the lockdown notification , including doctors and bankers have been harassed and beaten on their way to work .
A man out to buy milk in Bengal reportedly died due to the police beating .
They stoppage of notified essential commodities being sold , disrupted supply chains of essential commodities by beating up of employees and brought even large , organised delivery networks to a halt .
While this was happening , twitter handles of several bureaucrats and the police were confidently assuring people of doorstep delivery .
Large e-tailers , such as Amazon , BigBasket , Grofers and others , had not restarted operations on Thursday , mainly because outstation workers have left in large numbers and can not return .
Getting them back during the lockdown will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supplies at their suburban distribution hubs .
The worry is what happens in a couple of weeks when existing stock begins to dry up ?  In Delhi , the police were seen destroying carts carrying fresh vegetables , instead of getting them organised to maintain social distancing .
The worst affected were migrant workers .
Overnight , several lakh people had lost their jobs and their fragile resources .
The sealing of state borders , stoppage of trains and buses has left them homeless and without resources ; most of them are sole bread-earners for families living in the poorest villages of India .
While well-to-do Indians stranded abroad have had special planes sent for their rescue ( and many of them have also transmitted Covid-19 by being irresponsible about quarantine rules ) , there have been no arrangements to take migrant workers back to Orissa , Bihar , Uttar Pradesh and Bengal .
There are troubling stories from across India about police brutality unleashed on hapless persons trying to find their way back to their homes across state borders .
To make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : rein in the police and involve the NGOs in the outreach , by drawing upon funds available for Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) .
Involve the NGOs  The government can not handle a calamity of this magnitude on its own .
It will require support and cooperation from all quarters .
This has to be facilitated through dialogue rather than a top-down orders or obdurate bureaucracy .
In fact , the government will have to work with non government organisations ( NGOs ) who have feet-on-the ground .
At a time when the government is yet set up the economic task force to deal with Covid-19 , announced by the PM , several NGOS have already sprung into action to help the distressed .
Consider just one example .
FM Nirmala Sitharaman announced relief measures on 26th March , which will kick-in only from 1st April , but organisations such as YUVA ( Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action ) and others have been out distributing sustenance packets of uncooked rations to the distressed for three days already .
Hunger is an immediate issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or older parents to look after .
They can not possibly wait for 1st April .
Ironically , NGOs and charitable trusts have been the focus of extraordinarily tough regulation , increased red-tape , re-registration requirements and punitive action in the past few years , and especially under the finance bill cleared by parliament in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic .
The government has to realise that it needs these very NGOs and trusts to reach help and relief to the poorest Indians , if a well-intentioned lockdown to contain a pandemic is not to lead to bigger humanitarian issues including starvation etc .
Change the CSR rules  The government has done well to permit companies to use mandatory CSR ( corporate social responsibility ) funds to fight COVID-19 .
But a lot more needs to be done .
Noshir Dadrawala , head of the Centre for Advancement of Philanthropy says that there is a " bigger need to relax existing rules and guidelines to enable companies to contributing their own products ( particularly medicines , medical equipment , essential supplies , protective gear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
"  Yes , current rules forbid a Hindustan Lever from dispensing free soap or sanitisers under CSR .
Or pharma companies to distribute medicine , gloves or protective gear under CSR , even if they are capable of re-packaging it in bulk for quick supplies without worrying about costs .
While the rules may have been intended to prevent companies passing off a portion of their sales as charity , it has a negative impact on giving .
The need for such draconian conditions is illogical , as is ' mandatory CSR ' forced on corporates , not only without tax benefits but with elaborate reporting requirements .
Instead of optimising charity , forcing companies to do charity in unrelated areas has only increased cost of intermediation and is creating self-important bureaucrats in corporate India to dole out funds without a real connect .
It has sadly reduced the genuine NGOs , who are engaged in actual out reach to the distressed and disadvantaged into becoming ' implementing agencies ' who have to look up to corporate executives for funding and largesse .
Mandatory CSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such small NGOs , because they are unable to comply with the bureaucratic documentation , proposals and reporting requirements that are taking up more and more time and resources away from real work .
It is time to suspend this nonsense , at least until we have beaten the pandemic .
So huge is this crisis that the government needs to facilitate everybody who wishes to contribute to the revival effort NGOs engaged in consumer welfare or education do not have COVID related activities as part of their stated mandate , but they must be encouraged to go beyond their trust deeds or articles of association and engage in relief work for the next six to eight months ( without fear of harassment later ) when their regular activities have come to a halt due to the lockdown .
A responsive government that will focus on action rather than elaborate media briefings , punctuated with self-praise , is what needed today .
Ordinary people are doing a lot without fanfare or expectation ; it is time the government shows the humility to empower them .
Like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ User  Alert me when a new comment is posted  COMMENTS  vaibhavdhoka  17 hours ago  PM 's intentions are and were only in the interest of fellow public , but this time it was abruptly announced without taking note of migrants and daily wage earners .
laid to chaos as eventhough packages are announced it takes weeks to enforce .
care is must or else corona will be superseded by casualty due to starvation and no medical reach .
Yes , I agree with you that Govt needs to do better .
Trust is the key at this time , especially with NGOs .
If this can be bridged , then things are likely to fall into place .
One thing is for certain : this pandemic will be a catalyst for total reforms , change in our approach , change in bureaucracy &amp; governance , and our mindset -- all for the better .

If Didi 's policemen beat up a person in West Bengal , can you blame Modi for it ? Several countries are now suffering for not adopting a hard approach in the beginning , including UK an US .
In a vast country like ours , it is impossible to prepare for everything before announcing drastic measures .

KRISHNAN2 days ago  You are being unfair to Ms Dalal .
We readers trust her articles because she does not toe any political line , criticizing or lauding as the situation demands .
Yes , she could have praised Modi 's dramatic move comparing it to Bolsonaro 's non-action .
But compared to other countries whose leaders put in place mechanisms to help ordinary people adjust to the lock down , Modi falls short .
KRISHNAN  In Reply to Meenal Mamdani2 days ago  Please be specific .
What are the " arrangements " other countries put in place to help people affected by lock down ? In India also , Govt has announced several measures to help such people .
I am not asking anyone to praise Modi .
Moneylife 's brand equity is based on criticizing the establishment , which , in normal times , is quite laudable .
But in a crisis situation , one has to be circumspect , knowing well that you could shape public response .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago  If you do n't like what we right you can always ignore it .
But if you seriously believe that the lack of food or ANY arrangements for migrants in a country with our level of poverty is fine , you are entitled to your views .
Allow me to voice my opinion .
As for ' arrangements ' by other countries - please do take a look at several of them - it is in the public domain .
Yes some have failed to act in time -- Italy , UK even Spain - but is that what you are comparing India with ?  itpalkavora123  3 days ago  i almost agree with your article - its a bad decisions , some relief for 4-5 days should be given - many seniors are stranded in between and do n't have food and staying facilities ! or it should be pure advisory for lock down - those who loves life will not venture out ! make it simple so that economy don ; t suffer ! idhar bhi maut and udhar bhi maut , better is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than this lockdown and economic effect maut !  narayansa  3 days ago  I sometimes wonder whether all these international alerts and panic and press briefings are not simply an extreme over reaction to a sickness with a lower infection spread rate than smallpox , measles and HIV+ .
Besides the fatality rate is 0% for ages 0-9 , 0 .
for ages 10-50 , 8% for ages 51-70 , and 14 .
for ages 85+ I do not ever recall such reactions to smallpox , measles or HIV+ .
Moreover experts say that 85% of the cases would get cured naturally through the body 's immune system .
Probably more people will suffer and perhaps die due to side effects of lockdown than due to the virus .
What is though disconcerting is the speed of spread .
Whether a more targetted strategy focussing on international travel and the isolation of such travellers would have sufficed ? But that 's hindsight .
If after 21 days , the flattening of the curve does not happen then a more well thought through strategy needs to be planned for , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences of all options .

But , how about thinking it through ? What about some planning of possible scenarios and taking care of them ? All options , including the one he has adopted , as doable but ONLY IF all likely contingencies of that option are taken care of .
This guy just gets up in the morning , thinks of what will make him look like a tough man and announces .
No thinking through , no planning , no sympathy for the poor and weak .

Meenal Mamdani  Ms Dalal , every thing you say is on the mark .
We need many organizations like Money Life Foundation , focused on exposing the problems in different areas of the Indian society , the way MLF focuses on financial chicanery .
We should start with making the voluntary non-governmental organizations easier to set up and operate for people who want to tackle the problems in Indian society .
The politicians are afraid of what such organizations uncover and publicize , that is why politicians want to tie the NGOs with so many onerous requirements that all their time is taken up with meeting these convoluted and totally unnecessary rules .

I agree with you .
I think we lack a good system to deal with exigencies like this one ( and to be fair , most countries lack this , even the United States as we 're seeing now ) .
In a way , this pandemic has exposed the vulnerabilities and shortcomings in our systems &amp; regulations ( and to some extent the mindset of our society as a whole ) .
We 're going to have to rethink a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's COVID-19 count is now nearing 400 and Maharashtra 's count is now nearly 100 .
Taking other countries afflicted by the virus as an example , experts believe that we are now in a critical stage and containing the spread of the virus will be crucial in the coming weeks .
Our vast communities of poor , underprivileged people are most vulnerable during this time and one non-profit organisation , Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action ( YUVA ) has stepped up in support .
People who are homeless or daily wage earners who have lost jobs , have been unable to procure basic food and other essential items .
With a city like Mumbai , there are several households who are surviving on little or no food .
Over the past few days , YUVA has been reaching out to low-income and vulnerable communities , to understand the situation and offer support .
They have rapidly assessed over 20 settlements across 4 cities in the Greater Mumbai area -- Vasai Virar , Mumbai , Navi Mumbai and Panvel , covering more than 1,500 families and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Some groups that were already vulnerable , such as the homeless and individuals from disadvantaged communities , are almost on the brink of starvation .
Integrated Child Development Services ( ICDS ) centres or anganwadis , where children between the age of 0-6 years are provided basic nutrition have stopped daily food supplies in many areas .
With schools being closed for the last few days , mid day meals for such children have also stopped .
YUVA 's early assessment of the situation has helped identify the needs of such communities and they have in turn launched a campaign , ' Together We Can ' , to raise funds and support in the form of food grains , offering emergency relief to the urban poor .
They have started this support giving priority to the most marginalised families first , which have been identified through a rigorous process .
YUVA has now been providing families with a basic food kit in quantities meant for a week 's worth of ration per package .
This package costs Rs600 and includes 5kg rice , 2kg wheat flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
They has already distributed basic provisions to 200 homeless families , comprising more than 1,000 individual and are continuing this support each day only through donations made in support of this campaign .
The organisation has also maintained their advocacy efforts with the government to take forward demands of these vulnerable communities .
YUVA has submitted an unequivocal list of demands to the Government of Maharashtra , in light of work and sources of income being impacted , closure of schools and ICDS centres , and forced eviction notices being sent to informal settlements .
Their demands include a relief fund for daily wage workers , ensuring steady supply of take-home rations and much more .
YUVA 's fundraising efforts are ongoing and they are currently accepting support in the form of cash and essential items ( food grains and non-perishable foods only ) .
Moneylife Foundation would be joining this effort to help spread the message and allow its members , who are concerned about the plight of those who have lost their livelihoods to donate to the cause .
Moneylife Foundation is also working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to streamline the process .
Although we expect the government of India to step forward and take care of the lowest end of the pyramid , it will probably take time for direct benefit transfer or the increased supply of food through the public distribution system to be ramped up in a crisis .
The need is to help out until the government machinery starts functioning and to plug any remaining gaps later .
