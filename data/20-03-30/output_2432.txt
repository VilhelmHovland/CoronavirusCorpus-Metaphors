First Mining Provides an Exploration Update for the Pickle Crow Gold Project  ACCESSWIRE  Multiple Walk-Up Drill Targets Identified by Auteco ; Drilling Campaign to Start in Late May  VANCOUVER , BC / ACCESSWIRE / March 30 , 2020 / First Mining Gold Corp .
( " First Mining " or the " Company " ) ( TSX:FF ) ( OTCQX:FFMGF ) ( FRANKFURT:FMG ) is pleased to provide an exploration update on its Pickle Crow Gold Project ( " Pickle Crow " or the " Project " ) located in Ontario , Canada .
Auteco Minerals Ltd ( " Auteco " ) ( ASX : AUT ) , First Mining 's partner on Pickle Crow , is advancing the Project and may earn up to an 80% interest in the Company 's wholly-owned subsidiary PC Gold Inc .
( " PC Gold " ) , which owns the Project .
Auteco has announced that they have commenced field activities , data compilation and resource modelling , and are currently anticipating minimal impact on their 2020 field objectives from the developing COVID-19 situation .
Auteco 's review of the available historical drill core has identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major mineralized shear zones within the Project area .
Cumulatively , there are more than 110 kilometres of underexplored strike on the structures which are prospective for high-grade orogenic gold .
Auteco intends to commence its first diamond drilling campaign at Pickle Crow , totalling 5,000 metres , in late May , and plans to test high potential , walk-up targets regionally and in the surrounding mine area .
Auteco also expects to complete a JORC 2012 compliant resource update for Pickle Crow in early Q2 .
This resource update by Auteco will incorporate their geological review and will focus on the high-grade , underground mineable resource areas at the Project .
Dan Wilton , CEO of First Mining , stated " We are excited that our partner for Pickle Crow , Auteco , is driving forward with exploration at Pickle Crow .
The Project is benefiting from a renewed look by the strong technical team at Auteco , including a new geological review .
The work the Auteco team is doing provides an opportunity for a better understanding of Pickle Crow 's potential , and we look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project this summer .
"  Auteco 's Executive Chairman , Ray Shorrocks , commented " Auteco intends to commence an initial shallow 5,000 metre diamond drill program in late May , targeting shallow , high-grade , walk-up drill targets to bring further resource areas into JORC compliance .
At the same time , Auteco geologists have been working to integrate regional datasets and , in the process , have identified multiple , high-grade and drill ready regional targets , related to four major structures with more than 110 kilometres of prospective strike .
Work is continuing across the 320 km2 ( 32,000 ha ) project area with geological , structural and geophysical reviews ongoing to be followed up with targeting , on-ground testing and drilling in the coming field season .
"  The four major mineralized shear zones identified by Auteco within the Project area are regional scale structures that formed the conduits for gold mineralization in the Pickle Lake Greenstone Belt .
The structures include the Core Mine Shear Zone ( where the past-producing Pickle Crow , Central Patricia and Dona Lake Gold mines are situated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohen-MacArthur and East Pat Shear Zones .
A map showing these regional shear zones can be viewed here .
Tarp Lake : The regional scale shear zone , which trends north-northeast and extends more than 20 kilometres through the western edge of the Project tenements , has limited historical drilling over the 14 kilometres of identified strike length with three main target areas identified .
Historical drill results from the Tarp Lake Target on this shear zone include 1 .
g/t gold over 36 .
metres ( from 158 metres in TL-29 ) , 7 .
g/t gold over 4 .
metres ( from 76 .
metres in GPT-90-12 ) and 4 .
g/t gold over 5 .
metres ( from 246 .
metres in CGR91-15 ) .
At the Metcalf Target , historical drill results included 74 .
g/t gold over 1 .
metres ( from 164 metres in S-18 ) and 28 .
g/t gold over 1 .
metres ( from 114 .
metres in S-11 ) .
Cohen-MacArthur Shear : This zone has been observed on surface and in diamond drill core and has been identified as a 50-metre-wide high strain zone with coincident , intense ankerite-sericite alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till covering most of the strike length , limited exploration of second order structures has been completed .
However , drilling around outcropping mineralization has identified two target areas : MacArthur and Kawinogans .
The MacArthur target includes historical drill results of 1 .
g/t gold over 14 .
metres ( from 30 .
metres in PC-10-067 ) and the Kawinogans target includes historical drill results of 1 .
g/t gold over 23 .
metres ( from 196 metres in PC-10-092 ) .
East Pat Shear : This zone has been underexplored due to subdued topography and glacial till cover .
It was identified and drilled by First Mining 's predecessor , PC Gold , in 2010 in the East Pat Target area .
Drill results from this area included 2 .
g/t gold over 35 .
metres ( from 214 .
metres in PC-10-108 ) and 7 .
g/t gold over 6 .
metres ( from 232 metres in PC-11-145 ) .
Pickle Crow is one of Canada 's highest-grade historical gold mines .
It operated from 1935 until 1966 , during which time it reportedly produced almost 1 .
million ounces of gold at an average grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 19,000 hectares ) of tenure covering a major gold province .
Auteco recently increased its landholding near the Project by staking an additional 130 km2 ( 13,000 ha ) of land contiguous to Pickle Crow , thereby increasing the combined property 's land package to over 320 km2 ( 32,000 ha ) ( see news release dated February 18th , 2020 ) .
First Mining acquired the Project in November 2015 through its acquisition of PC Gold Inc .
There has been limited exploration on the Property subsequent to when mining ceased in 1966 , with the latest exploration focused on development of remnant resources in proximity to the old mine infrastructure .
Auteco 's development focus is on returning to first principles , completing a new geological review and applying modern exploration technologies in their advancement of the Project .
Auteco has a strong focus on discovering and developing new project scale , high-grade , near surface gold resources .

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada , which differ from the requirements of U .
securities laws .
Unless otherwise indicated , all resource and reserve estimates included in this news release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining , Metallurgy , and Petroleum 2014 Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves .
NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects .
Canadian standards , including NI 43-101 , differ significantly from the requirements of the SEC , and mineral resource and reserve information contained herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U .
companies .
In particular , and without limiting the generality of the foregoing , the term " resource " does not equate to the term " reserves " .
Under U .
standards , mineralization may not be classified as a " reserve " unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination is made .
The SEC 's disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning " measured mineral resources " , " indicated mineral resources " or " inferred mineral resources " or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute " reserves " by U .
standards in documents filed with the SEC .
Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves .
investors should also understand that " inferred mineral resources " have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility .
It can not be assumed that all or any part of an " inferred mineral resource " will ever be upgraded to a higher category .
Under Canadian rules , estimated " inferred mineral resources " may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases .
Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an " inferred mineral resource " exists or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ounces " in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations ; however , the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute " reserves " by SEC standards as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures .
The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of " reserves " are also not the same as those of the SEC , and reserves reported by the Company in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as " reserves " under SEC standards .
Accordingly , information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U .
standards .
