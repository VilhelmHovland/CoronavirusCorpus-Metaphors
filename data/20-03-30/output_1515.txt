5 leadership tips on navigating the COVID-19 crisis response  Details  Janice Tan  30 March 2020  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in companies scrambling to take action to ensure they remain afloat in this challenging time .
Leaders are also monitoring the stituation and responding accordingly by implementing business continuity plans .
According to McKinsey , what leaders require during a crisis " is not a predefined response plan , but behaviours and mindsets that will prevent them from overreacting to yesterday 's developments and help them look forward " .
In light of this , it laid out five behaviours that leaders can undertake to help them navigate the uncertain future .
Building a network of teams  In the midst of a crisis , leaders need to forgo the belief that a top-down response will give rise to stability .
Normally , companies can typically rely on its comand-and-control structure during routine emergencies to handle operations and carry out a scripted response .
However when it comes to crises characterised by uncertainty , McKinsey said leaders encounter problems that are " unfamiliar and poorly understood " , and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect information or make decisions quickly enough to respond effectively .
To overcome this , clear priorities should be set by leaders for the crisis response and others in the company should be empowered to discover and implement solutions that serve those priorities .
Leaders can organise a network of teams to promote rapid problem solving and execution under high-stress , chaotic conditions .
According to McKinsey , a network of teams comprises " a highly adaptable assembly of groups " that are united by a common purpose and collaborate in a similar way that the individuals on a single team do .
" Some parts of the network pursue actions that take place outside regular business operations .
Other parts identify the crisis 's implications for routine business activities and make adjustments , such as helping employees adapt to new working norms , " McKinsey explained .
Breaking it down further , McKinsey said the network of teams will consist of an integrated nerve centre covering four areas - customer engagement , workforce protection , supply-chain stabilisation , and financial stress testing .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders to foster collaboration and transparency across the network .
One way to achieve this is by distributing authority and sharing information .
" In crisis situations , a leader 's instinct might be to consolidate decision-making authority and control information , providing it on a strictly need-to-know basis .
Doing the opposite will encourage teams to follow suit , " it said .
Another important part of the leader 's role is promoting psychological safety so employees can openly discuss ideas , questions and concerns without the fear of repercussions .
Doing so allows the network of teams to make sense of the situation and learn how to handle it through healthy debate .
Elevating leaders during a crisis  Leaders must be prepared to empower others to direct several aspects of the company 's response .
This includes giving them the authority to make and implement decisions without requiring approval .
According to McKinsey , important function of senior executives is to quickly establish an architecture for decision making , so that accountability is clear and decisions are made by appropriate people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the right people are empowered to make crisis-response decisions .
While a group of decision makers will be appointed initially to respond to the crisis , McKinsey said that as the situation evolves , new crisis-response leaders will naturally emerge from the network of teams .
Those crisis-response leaders , in particular , will not always be senior executives .
While experience is most valuable during routine emergencies , McKinsey said character is of the utmost importance in " novel , landscape scale " crises .
Crisis-response leaders must be able to unify teams behind a single purpose and frame questions for them to investigate .
The best leaders will display the qualities of " deliberate calm " and " bounded optimism " .
McKinsey explained that deliberate calm is one 's ability to " detach from a fraught situation and think clearly about how one will navigate it " .
It is commonly found in well-grounded individuals who possess humility but not helplesness .
As for bounded optimism , it is more effective for leaders to showcase confidence that the organisation will find a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognise the uncertainty of the crisis and have also come to terms with it by collecting more information .
" When the crisis has passed , then optimism will be more beneficial and can be far less bounded , " McKinsey explained .
Decision making amidst uncertainty  Leaders often make the common mistake of waiting for a full set of facts to emerge before deciding on the next steps .
As a crisis involves many unknowns and surprises , McKinsey said facts may not become clear within the necessary decision-making time frame .
Leaders should not resort to merely using their intuition .
Instead , they can better cope with uncertainty by continuously gathering information as the crisis unfolds and observing how effective their responses are .
This means frequently pausing from crisis management , assessing the situation from multiple vantage points , anticipating what may happen next , and then acting .
" The **27;464;TOOLONG cycle should be ongoing , for it helps leaders maintain a state of deliberate calm and avoid overreacting to new information as it comes in .
While some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no time to assess or anticipate , leaders will eventually find occasions to stop , reflect , and think ahead before making further moves , " McKinsey said .
It explained that updating and doubting are two cognitive behaviours that can help leaders as they assess and anticipate .
Updating involves revising ideas based on new information teams collect and the knowledge they develop .
Meanwhile , doubting aids leaders in considering ongoing and potential actions critically , and deciding whether there is a need for the actions to be modified , adopted or discarded .
Upon deciding on a plan of action , leaders need to act with resolve as visible decisiveness not only builds a company 's confidence in leaders , but also motivates employees to sustain its search for solutions to the challenges faced .
Demonstrating empathy  It is ever more important , during a crisis , for leaders to uphold the need to make a positive difference in people 's lives .
Doing so requires leaders to acknowledged that personal and professional challenges that employees and their loved ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect people in particular ways , leaders should pay careful attention to how people are struggling and take corresponding measures to support them .
Besides demonstrating empathy , leaders should also open themselves to empathy from others and pay attention to their own well-being .
" As stress , fatigue , and uncertainty build up during a crisis , leaders might find that their abilities to process information , to remain levelheaded , and to exercise good judgment diminish .
They will stand a better chance of countering functional declines if they encourage colleagues to express concern - and heed the warnings they are given .
Investing time in their well-being will enable leaders to sustain their effectiveness over the weeks and months that a crisis can entail , " McKinsey added .
Maintaining transparency  By practising thoughtful , frequent communication , leaders show that they are following the situation and adjusting their responses as they learn more .
This helps to reassure stakeholders that they are confronting the crisis .
According to McKinsey , leaders should take special care to see that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Having members of the crisis response team speak first-hand about what they are doing can be particularly effective .
Additionally , communications should not stop once the crisis is over .
Instead , leaders should work towards offering an optimistic , realistic outlook as it will have " a powerful effect " on employees and other stakeholders in inspiring them to support the company 's recovery .
