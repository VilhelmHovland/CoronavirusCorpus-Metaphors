" Right after this call I 'm speaking to a gentleman named Vladimir Putin .
That 's my next call , " Trump told the Fox News hosts when asked about uncertainty in the oil market sparked by a feud between Russia and Saudi Arabia .
Trump said he would discuss oil with Putin , as well as trade , potentially the situation in Venezuela and the coronavirus pandemic .
" We talk about trade and we talk about trade a lot , " Trump said .
" They love to be able to do trade with our country .
It 's been very much hindered by the nonsense that 's been going on .
Russia , Russia , Russia , which has turned out to be a total hoax when you look at what happened with Comey and McCabe and you look at all the things that happened with Mueller and the Mueller report .
" We should get along with all countries if possible , " he continued .
" There 's a lot of things that Russia 's involved with , that China 's involved with , and nobody talks to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering praise for Putin and downplaying the U .
intelligence community 's findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election .
The president on Monday pushed back on critics who argue he has been too soft with Russia , citing sanctions that he has approved against the country .
He did not directly answer a question about what he would say if Putin asked for those sanctions to be lifted .
ADVERTISEMENT  Instead , Trump discussed how Russia was a U .
ally during World War II .
" I 'm not saying they 're babies .
I 'm not saying they 're perfect .
but you know they also fought World War II , " Trump said .
" They lost 50 million people .
They were our partner in World War II .
Germany was the enemy , and Germany is like this wonderful thing .
Well , Germany takes advantage of us on trade for years , they pay far too little in NATO .
and nobody talks about that .
" I 'm not saying anything wrong , I 'm just saying how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to others , " he added .
The president earlier in the wide-ranging interview shrugged off a question about Russia , China and Iran engaging in disinformation campaigns around the coronavirus that specifically targeted the U .
He instead ripped The Washington Post , which Fox host Brian Kilmeade cited in raising the question , and suggested spreading disinformation was commonplace .
" They do it and we do it , and we call them different things , " Trump said , citing his past use of the term " Chinese virus .
