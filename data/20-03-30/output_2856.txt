--  Cape Breton Regional Police and Nova Scotia RCMP are taking an education first approach to enforcing the state of emergency restrictions put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 .
These precaution measures include the recommendations made in the medical officer 's order , in accordance with the Health Protection Act , as well as the closure of all provincial beaches and parks .
People found trespassing on close provincial parks or beaches or found not following recommendations like self-isolation after travel outside of Nova Scotia , can be charged a summary offence and fined .
Individual fines range from $500 to $10,000 per incident and corporations can be fined up to $100,000 per incident , as outlined in the Direction of the Minister under a declared state of emergency ( found at **25;3494;TOOLONG ) .

Jennifer Clarke  " It could be that someone ( who is reported ) might need supports or might not understand what the rules are .
We all need to work together .
"  Clarke said RCMP in Nova Scotia are n't doing increased patrols because of the state of emergency order and have received calls about people not following the restrictions , particularly those who have returned from travel and are shopping in public .
" We 're hearing a lot of calls about people returning home from trips , stopping by the grocery store on their way home from the airport , and telling people or staff , we just came back ( from out of province ) and are getting supplies before we self-isolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complainants are n't leaving their name .
It makes it very hard to follow up .
We then have to catch the person in the act .
"  Desiree Magnus , spokesperson for regional police , said they have also received a few calls regarding people not self-isolating and patrolling provincial beaches and parks like they normally do .
" These are areas our police already patrol , so they will be monitoring as they normally are , " she said during a phone interview .
" We know most citizens are doing what they can do , to follow the instructions ( to help stop the spread of COVID-19 .
We will enforce as necessary , but our goal is to educate first .
"  Both Clarke and Magnus are encouraging people to report people who are n't complying by the state of emergency orders and reminding them to call local dispatch numbers , not 911 .
" We strongly encourage people to not call 911 , to keep that line open for emergencies , " Magnus said .
" I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to clog up 911 with these calls , " said Clarke during her interview .
