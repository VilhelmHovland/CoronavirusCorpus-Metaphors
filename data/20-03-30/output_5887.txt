( Twitter )  Not really because he used to play cricket once , but Joginder Sharma has managed to bowl over the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) .
For the uninitiated , Joginder was the cricketer who bowled that match-winning last over for India in the final of the 2007 World T20 against Pakistan .
Nowadays , however , the 36-year-old is calling the shots on a different pitch .
As the Deputy Superintendent of Police ( DSP ) of Hisar district in Haryana , Joginder has been extremely busy for the last couple of weeks as the nation fights the coronavirus pandemic .
Joginder 's service as a policeman in this time of crisis has drawn praise from the ICC .
Cricket 's apex body tweeted Joginder 's pictures as a cricketer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #T20WorldCup hero .
2020 : Real world hero .
In his post-cricket career as a policeman , India 's Joginder Sharma is among those doing their bit amid a global health crisis .
"  It has been more than two weeks since the former all-rounder met his family .
But he has no complaints and is ready for a much bigger fight .
" My wife and two sons stay in Rohtak , which is about 100km from Hisar .
I have n't been able to meet them in the last few weeks , but I did speak to them via video calls .
My children often ask me to return home , but then my wife helps them understand the situation .
" My family knows that I am in the midst of a much bigger and unknown challenge , " Joginder told The Telegraph on Sunday .
" And it 's not just me , thousands of others who are in emergency services are trying their level best to protect our country from the coronavirus pandemic .
We all have to be very careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India in four ODIs and as many T20Is between 2004 and 2007 , played his last first-class game for Haryana in December 2016 , against Tripura in Calcutta .
Joginder admitted that in his career as a policeman , he has never encountered a tougher challenge before .
" I have been with the Haryana Police since 2007 but have never experienced such situations and challenges .
But I believe everything would be all right .
" People are very , very scared at the moment .
Some do n't even know what they should do at this point in time .
Our first priority is to help them understand the situation .
I just try to convince people in my area to stay home .
We assure them that we will provide all the essential services .
But despite the assurances , some people still come out of their houses without any proper reason .
We all should fight together against the virus .
" I request everyone to follow the directive of maintaining social distance and to stay at home .
That 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriotism now is in fighting together against Covid-19 , " he said .
Elaborating on the hectic routine the likes of him have been following , Joginder revealed how he has hardly slept more than four hours a day in the last fortnight or so .
" Our day starts at 5am .
First , we discuss our plans .
Our priority is to send the essential commodities or medicines to the needy people .
Then we start patrolling .
I can tell you , this is the toughest situation I have faced in my life .
"  " We also carry masks , gloves and sanitizers for our own protection , but for us the best protection is if people do n't come out of their homes unnecessarily .
"  Asked if his current job is even tougher than bowling that last over against Pakistan in 2007 , Joginder said : " Obviously , you can say the pressure is a million times more now .
" In the 2007 World T20 final , I knew what I had to do .
Pakistan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicket .
Had we not won the match , nobody would have lost his or her life .
It was not a question of life and death .
But here it is all about saving lives .
I know it is tough but I also believe that if we can maintain discipline , we will win this battle too .
"  That was the end of the conversation , with a duty-bound Joginder saying : " Now I have to go out , please excuse me .
I wish you all a safe time ahead .
