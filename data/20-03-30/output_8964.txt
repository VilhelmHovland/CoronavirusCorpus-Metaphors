Reno-area delivery wards are taking a number of steps recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to hinder the spread of the COVID-19 virus to families .
Notably , the maternity wards at Renown and St .
Mary 's Regional Medical Centers are limiting labor and delivery rooms to only the mother and one birth partner .
Natalie Nicholson , Director of Nursing for Women 's Services at Renown , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renown .
She spoke to the Reno Gazette Journal about preventing exposure to COVID-19 in the maternity ward .
The interview has been edited for clarity and length .
What happens when any expectant mother is admitted to the hospital for labor and delivery ?  Any patient coming into the hospital is allowed one support person .
We 've seen that it helps with birth outcomes .
Both the patient and the support person have to go through a screening process , which includes a set of questions recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
If for some reason a support person answers yes to one of the questions , they will be asked not to come with the patient .
If they are suspected to have COVID-19 , they will be asked to leave the hospital and self-isolate .
Has any mother had to deliver without her partner ?  We 've had one family that had a partner with respiratory issues .
Of course he was upset to not be with his wife , but he was very understanding .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really hard situation for a lot of mothers , but all of our families have been very appreciative of us keeping them safe .
We understand this is a very scary time , but we are trying to make sure that we are giving the best birth experience possible .

( Photo : Jason bean )  What about staff ? Do the staff in the labor and delivery ward and post-partum ward work in other parts of the hospital ?  All staff are asked to go through a screening process before they begin their shifts .
The staff in labor and delivery stay in labor and delivery and the staff in post-partum stay there .
Staff are wearing masks at all times for safety precautions .
What happens after the baby is born ?  Once they deliver , mom and baby together they move to post-partum .
Those are lockdown units .
We are n't allowing any unnecessary traffic into that area .
No visitors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ) .
Before families could go to the cafeteria , take a walk .
It 's heightened " rooming in " 24/7 until release .
Everything comes to baby in that room , and when a nurse goes in , we do everything in that hour , versus going in at 10 a .
and going back in later at 11 a .
We 're also not bringing babies into the newborn nursery .
What happens if mom or baby show signs of respiratory issues ?  We have a designated area for mother with COVID-19 who 's going into labor .
If the patient ( mom ) is positive , we will have a conversation with the mother .
We 'll explain the risks and benefits about separation of mom and baby .
The CDC recommendation is to separate mom and baby .
If mom agrees , we 'd move the baby into an isolation area after birth .
It 's completely up to the mother though on what she wants to do .
Depending on the circumstances of the birth , and their health , the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the circumstances , and they would self-isolate at home .
( Discharge time would also vary depending on circumstances .
)  How have births been different since the changes in policy ?  Generally , hospitals have a no video recording policy , but if a patient decides , she can use Skype , Facetime or other video .
We 've had some virtual parties in the rooms .
Families are probably upset too that they 're not there for their grandchild 's birth , or their daughter 's first delivery .
Any other changes that expectant mothers and their families should be aware of ?  Obviously , we 're not allowing in-person tours of the labor and delivery rooms , so we 've developed a virtual tour and a power point .
Because of the guidelines , we have canceled all of our support groups but we 're offering virtual groups .
Lactation consultants are still available .
Once home , make sure that people are not coming over with respiratory issues .
