SAULT STE .
MARIE -- What are the odds of finding a lost diamond ring amid 40 tonnes of recyclable paper items within 30 minutes ?  That would be an interesting problem for mathematicians to try and solve , and the question comes after an especially good news story happened in the Sault this week .
A local woman , who wishes to remain anonymous , is rejoicing after the crew at GFL Environmental found her engagement ring lost when she accidentally tossed it into her recycling container along with some paper items last week .
GFL employees found the ring amid a mountain of paper at the company 's Sackville Road plant .
The ring was mistakenly thrown out , the woman 's recyclable bin emptied by GFL Wednesday , the load taken to the plant .
Realizing her mistake , she sent an email to a friend who works for the City of Sault Ste .
Marie .
GFL staff began their workday Thursday with their typically early start at 6:30 a .
John Martella , GFL district manager , discovered the office had received a rare overnight email from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been alerted to the woman 's distress over the lost ring .
" I noticed the email , that a lady had lost her engagement ring .
Then I got a call from the lady herself , saying she had lost her ring and describing the circumstances .
Our guy in the plant was already baling the paper because we start up early .
I called the guy on the radio and told him to stop baling because we have a lady who 's lost something valuable and we have to investigate , " Martella said , speaking to SooToday .
The woman later arrived at GFL .
" She was shaken up .
It was precious to her .
"  Despite the cost to the company to shut down operations in order to look for the ring , Martella said after the woman left GFL , " I went back into my office .
I called in a few guys and said ' we have to fix this .
We 've got to do what we 've got to do .
' She was shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Martella and a group of employees made arrangements to conduct a special search for the ring ( without letting the distraught woman know ) .
Martella called the woman and asked her if there were any other items she remembered putting into the recycling box that could be visually identified easily , hoping the small diamond ring would be nearby those items .
" She said her six-year-old son does a lot of colouring on paper with crayons ( some of which she had thrown into her recycling container , along with a distinctive-looking bag from her veterinarian ) .
so we quarantined the pile , called all the drivers and asked them what truck was picking up recycling in her neighbourhood that day .
It was like forensics .
We sectioned off the pile from that truck and got exactly to where we thought that pile of paper would be , " Martella said .
" I went in there and saw a piece of paper coloured by crayons .
so I said ' it 's got to be in here .
' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in with a bucket .
No sooner did he drop the bucket , the ring fell out .
"  " It was just amazing , " Martella said .
" The excitement , to find that ring in the shop , with my men .
A couple of guys screamed and yelled ' we found it , we found it .
' It happened that easy , that quick , " Martella estimating it took only 30 minutes into the recovery operation to find the ring .
" It was team building .
It was good for my guys .
They made somebody 's day .
We 're going through a crisis with COVID-19 , so to do something like that makes you think ' we can beat this thing , we can beat this , we can win this .
' Good things happen in bad times .
"  Martella called the woman about the exciting retrieval of her ring .
" She was ecstatic .
She had no idea we were looking for it .
"  " You have to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It was n't cheap .
Insurance would have covered it but insurance has nothing to do with it .
It was valuable , " Martella said .
" With everything going on , everybody 's on a downer , they 're depressed , they 're quarantined , there 's COVID , places are shutting down , people are trying to pay their taxes , their mortgage , and this hits her when everybody 's feeling down .
so compiling all the bad that 's come out of this , something good happened for her .
And for my staff and myself , it was phenomenal .
"  Meanwhile , the woman , in an email to SooToday , wrote " I ca n't thank them enough , that in the middle of a pandemic , in a time of social distancing , they were kind enough to stop and help me and not brush me off .
these men are hardworking , enormously considerate , and will go above and beyond .
I would also like to thank all those who work in waste collection too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential service .
