Moody 's axe falls as COVID-19 lockdown grips the globe  By James Paynter - Mar 30 , 2020  Whew .
the rollercoaster just does n't stop , does it ? ! We are living in some of the most unique days that man has faced - at least in recent times , with lockdowns across the world .
perhaps on a greater scale than what was seen during world wars .
With SA now just at the start of uncharted waters with the 21 day lockdown , we are never quite sure what tomorrow holds .
especially after a week that culminated in Moody 's downgrading South Africa 's sovereign credit rating to junk status .
Eish !  But let 's get into the full review - and see what we clues we can find when it comes to the financial world .
( And please read to the end - got something special for you this week )  Key Moments ( Mar 23-27 2020 )  Here were some of the biggest talking points from the 5 days :  Global lockdown- it was now not just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each country was going bit by bit into full shutdown from Covid-19 .
Stimulus packages- governments around the world pulled out ALL the stops to try and stop the global economy going underwater .
Moody 's countdown - the end of week deadline was bearing down on the Rand like never before .
a downgrade to junk would be the last thing the country and the Rand needed .
Quantitative Easing- in what is going to be one of the biggest decisions of this century , the Fed announced UNLIMITED quantitative easing .
( confirming it is not a case of if , but when a complete fiat/economic collapse will follow )  The Rand opened the week very much on the back foot against the Dollar , having closed around R17 .
It was a week of the unknown beginning , once again , and all too quickly the market was up , touching R17 .
in early SA trade .
this was now the weakest EVER level for the Rand , surpassing #Nenegatewhich sent the market to R17 .
briefly !  It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Euro , Yen , Swiss Franc and others .
You could almost smell the panic and fear in the markets .
but this may still be some way off desperation and despair .
It is tough to encapsulate all that has happened in just a few days , but the most critical of all for South Africa was Ramaphosa 's announcement on Monday evening that there would be a 21 day lockdown countrywide .
This would halt travel , most business and stop purchases of items such as alcohol - while even limiting persons walking their dogs about the streets or going for a run .
a drastic measure , but one for which Ramaphosa was widely lauded for his efforts .
It does seem the only way to " flatten the curve " of exponential spread is to take as drastic measures as possible .
But only time will tell , as businesses despaired over the Thursday ( 26 March ) shutdown .
Thankfully , while a little choppy , the Rand took this news well , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next couple of days .
And then we were onto the second major news event of the week .
and we are calling this one as being the biggest financial one of this millennium so far :  The Fed announced UNLIMITED QUANTITATIVE EASING !  ( just one week before , they had announced a limit at $700bn .
now they have realized this is not enough )  This basically gives them the ability to print unlimited cash , to buy in to stocks/bonds/markets to stop them from collapsing .
It is time for us to take a step back in the midst of all this turmoil , and take account of what is actually happening - this is one of the biggest building blocks being put in place for a COMPLETE fiat collapse , taking most of the financial system with it .
The Fed may believe they have unlimited cash - but such is not the case , case in point so many different countries who thought ' printing money ' would solve any crisis .
Treasury Bills are now negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates go below zero in the coming months as the Fed follows the markets .
we are in for one heck of a ride .
And then in other news :  During the course of the week , US Congress fought backwards and forwards over different facets of the $2 trillion stimulus package that they were urgently needing to be passing .
This package would include assistance for small business , cash payments for individuals , funding for different institutions and medical facilities and much more .
It was more a case of stemming the tide though , as expectations were for far more stimulus being necessary to stave off a depression .
Trouble continued for the debt-riddled SAA , as they cancelled all domestic flights following the lockdown which began on Thursday evening .
From March 27 through to 16 April , there would not be a single domestic SAA flights .
Among many others , mining companies were going through much trauma trying to prepare for the lockdown , as well as other companies such as Edcon showing massive losses due to the shutdown period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be increasing every week ) of an up to 10% GDP contraction in 2020 for SA .
While these figures are very up in the air , and will only become clearer as time goes on , the very fact that numbers like these are suggested is quite frightening .
Bloomberg did a small analysis on the firepower that was there when SA was faced with the 2008 Financial Crisis compared to today , and the difference is stark .
The resources to deal with a global meltdown are not like they were back then , and it does not bode well for the coming months .
Ramaphosa has got some ideas for how to stave off business and consumer collapse with a number of quick and targeted economic interventions , and South Africans will be looking to him this next week to see what comes into reality and how quickly it can be mobilized .
And then we come to Moody 's decision on South Africa 's investment grade .
and what a time for it to happen .
No one could have imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the D-day would arrive .
But so be it , that was the way it worked out ! Some had hoped that current events would make Moody 's delay the inevitable .
Over the back end of the week , we saw stocks rebound ( just a classic Elliott Wave case of when everyone says it can only go lower , then it rebounds ) and the Rand traded stronger until Friday .
and in what has become the norm , we saw a jump from R17 .
on Thursday afternoon , to R17 .
by close of trade on Friday .
But we have got something special for you this next week to give you the information you need to get through these tough times .
read on to find out .
