Passenger sues five Canadian carriers  Canadian airlines Air Canada , WestJet , Swoop , Air Transat and Sunwing have been accused of breach of contract in a class-action lawsuit filed in British Columbia for refusing to refund tickets purchased after the coronavirus severely impacted air travel .
Instead , the five airlines relaxed usually rigid change rules by granting passengers non-transferrable credits towards future travel , the plaintiffs claim in a filing on 27 March .
Source : Air Canada  Passengers sue Canadian airlines  After the Canadian government advised against non-essential travel in mid-March , the five carriers radically curtailed their schedules and began laying off staff .
They have allowed passengers to rebook without charge on dates later in the year when , it is expected , airlines will resume normal schedules .
Some travellers , however , are demanding their money back , saying they may not wish to travel even after travel restrictions are lifted .
For others , it is a financial burden to have money sitting with airlines rather than available to cover daily living expenses , says the suit , filed by British Columbia resident Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class members to forego their fundamental right to a refund and to spend their monies with the same defendant in the future to purchase travel that the class members may not wish to undertake any longer , and likely at a substantially different price , " the lawsuit reads .
The suit says airlines are keeping passengers ' money while also not incurring costs of operating cancelled flights .
Further , the lawsuit says the spread of the coronavirus into a global pandemic , and the ensuing travel restrictions were " outside the passengers control " , thus mandating refunds .
The lawsuit could encompass thousands of passengers who hold tickets for travel on the named airlines in the coming months .
Calgary-based WestJet , which announced last week it was cutting almost half of its staff , declined to comment on the legal proceedings .
The airline is currently operating at about the same size it was in 2003 , having cancelled all international operations and reduced its domestic service to just a few routes .
It has grounded 120 aircraft , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transat did not wish to comment on the specific lawsuit , but says it believes it is correct in refusing refunds for missed flights due to global events such as the coronavirus crisis .
" These are extraordinary circumstances , when all airlines and travel companies have been forced to temporarily halt or reduce drastically their operations when government have decided to close their borders .
We do support these decisions in the name of public health and the protection of populations , but these , and the situation itself , has placed an extraordinary burden on the industry , which puts its very existence into question , " the airline says on 30 March .
" In such a force majeure situation , way beyond our span of control , we do not have to issue a full refund for travels that have not been completed , " the airline adds .
" By issuing a 24-month credit voucher , we believe that we are offering an acceptable solution .
We are confident that our clients will be able to travel again in a not-too-remote future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named in the suit could not immediately be reached for comment .
Sunwing and Air Transat have said they will wind down operations completely and lay off large percentages of their employees as the crisis plays out , while Air Canada is currently also running a skeleton domestic schedule and helping repatriate Canadians overseas who have been stuck in the past weeks .
It too has laid off staff to preserve cash .
Two weeks ago , Canadian airlines asked their government for assistance in managing through the crisis which has decimated the travel industry and left thousands of aircraft across North America idle .
