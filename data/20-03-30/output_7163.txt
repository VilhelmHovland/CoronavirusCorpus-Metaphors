Pete Ricketts on Monday extended Nebraska 's statewide restrictions on social gatherings until at least April 30 and urged residents to brace for another " tough month " in April , when the number of new coronavirus cases is expected to peak .
Ricketts said state public health officials are predicting that the number will continue to increase until mid- to late-April before it gradually declines .
He implored residents to continue following the state 's " social distancing " requirements , including a 10-person limit on social gatherings .
State officials have imposed even tougher restrictions on some hard-hit counties that include Omaha , Lincoln and other population centers .
" We can expect that April is going to be a tough month , " Ricketts said at his weekday news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of Monday evening , according to the state Department of Health and Human Services .
More than 2,700 people have tested negative .
For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
Older adults and people with existing health problems are among those particularly susceptible to more severe illness , including pneumonia .
Ricketts said the 30 counties that are now under a " directed health measure " order should adhere to the deadlines that were imposed on them individually , which may be later than April 30 .
For instance , 15 of those counties have been ordered to wait until May 6 .
Another three directed health measures are set to expire April 30 but could be renewed .
On Friday evening , Ricketts announced 12 more counties in the Panhandle were placed under similar orders , with a May 11 expiration .
Counties with " directed health measure " orders face tougher restrictions than other parts of Nebraska because public officials have identified coronavirus cases in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed health measure requires restaurants and bars to close their dining areas and only offer takeout or delivery .
In counties that are n't affected , those businesses can keep their dining areas open but ca n't have more than 10 people inside at once .
The restrictions are designed to slow the virus ' spread and prevent it from overwhelming the state 's hospitals .
On Sunday , Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert admonished residents who continue to crowd big-box stores such as Walmart , Costco and Menards .
City officials have implored residents to only venture out to buy groceries when it is absolutely necessary .
Meanwhile , Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin announced residents will soon be able to collect new unemployment benefits administered by the state .
Some benefits will extend to people who have exhausted other unemployment and those who are self-employed and independent contractors .
