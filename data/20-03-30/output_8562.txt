I only go out right now when I have to .
It may be getting over hyped in many areas but there 's no reason to put myself and my family at risk .
take a look at the traffic cameras .
There are still a good bit of people on the roads .
Way down from normal .
Maybe those are all essential workers or maybe people are finding excuses to still go out .
I find this more of a suggestion rather than a strict order .
