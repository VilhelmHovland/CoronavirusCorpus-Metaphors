Blitzbok forward Werner Kok admits he would still like to take part in the Tokyo Olympic Games despite signing for the Sharks .
Kok recently played in his 50th Sevens Series tournament as the Blitzboks finished winners of the Los Angeles Sevens in February .
However , after the team 's return to South Africa from North America , the remaining tournaments in Paris , London , Singapore and Hong Kong were postponed to September and October due to the global Covid-19 pandemic .
Meanwhile , the Olympic Games , which were scheduled to take place in Tokyo between June and July , have been moved to 2021 .
This means that Kok , who signed for the Sharks last year , has effectively played his last sevens tournament .
He was due to link up with the Durban-based team after the Olympics in August and will fulfil his contractual obligation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series .
Despite it becoming slightly more complicated , Kok admits he would still want to help the Blitzboks claim Olympic gold next year .
' I still hope to play in the Olympics next year , but that is a whole new conversation now , ' he told the official Springboks website .
The 27-year-old was among the South Africans to be put into self-isolation after the Blitzboks got back from Vancouver .
The national government 's protocols at the time required all South Africans to self-isolate if they returned from abroad and the Blitzboks , who landed in Cape Town on Wednesday , 11 March , underwent Covid-19 tests the next day and went into self-isolation after that .
They all tested negative , but the downside was that they had to do without their loved ones until the results were confirmed .
However , Kok turned this into an opportunity and posted a few simple fitness tips on his Instagram account .
' I had some time on my hands , yes , and decided to do something that would benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was an easy thing to do .
What I wanted to show is that you do n't always need gym equipment to exercise and you can use your body weight just as effectively .
'  While , Kok enjoys the outdoors and particularly has a passion for fishing and hunting , he has found other ways to spend his free time .
' I assembled an indoor driving range for myself and I will work on my swing a bit in this time , ' said Kok , who plays golf off a 19 handicap .
' I will also use my backyard to continue with some running , mostly short sprints .
We received a conditioning programme from our strength and conditioning coach , which I follow .
