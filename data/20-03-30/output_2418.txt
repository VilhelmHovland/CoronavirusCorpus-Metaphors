The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting new challenges to the already-frustrated families of 55 Canadians who were killed when their plane was shot down by Iran in January .
THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/Ebrahim Noroozi  OTTAWA -- Despite the daunting hurdles posed by the COVID-19 pandemic , Iran must live up to its pledge to co-operate with the investigation into its downing of a commercial airliner in January , says Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne .
That includes the unfulfilled , two-week-old promise by Tehran to surrender the flight recorders of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 , which the Iranian military shot down on Jan .
All 176 people aboard were killed , including 55 passengers who were Canadian citizens and 30 who were permanent residents .
In separate interviews with The Canadian Press , Champagne and Andriy Shevchenko , the Ukrainian ambassador to Canada , said the black boxes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Iran 's representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization in Montreal promised on March 11 to transfer them within two weeks to assist with Ukraine 's investigation into the crash .
Iran is one of the hardest-hit countries in the pandemic with more than 27,000 cases of the virus and more than 2,200 deaths .
" On one hand , this is a crisis , a health crisis of unprecedented proportion that we 're living , " Champagne said .
" But on the other hand , we need to make sure that we get answers and that the tragedy .
that the families are still living .
We have to push for these answers and push the Iranian regime for that .
"  The COVID-19 outbreak is presenting new challenges to the already-frustrated families of Canadian victims , who are having difficulty getting answers from Ottawa as the government responds to the global health crisis .
Hamed Esmaeilion is a Toronto-area dentist who lost his wife , Parisa , and nine-year-old daughter Reera on the fight .
In an interview Thursday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several planned meetings between the families of those killed and Canadian officials .
Families had been hoping for updates on efforts to hold those responsible accountable and secure compensation from Iran and the airline .
The RCMP is assisting Ukraine 's criminal probe into the crash while the Transportation Safety Board is involved in Iran 's flight-safety investigation .
" It has changed everything for us because we were supposed to have some meetings , especially here in Canada , and they 've all been cancelled , " Esmaeilion said .
" Even family meetings , we have to do it all online .
"  It has also been difficult to self-isolate because of COVID-19 when he is still grieving his wife and daughter and struggling with frustration over Iran 's continued refusal to turn over the jetliner 's flight recorders , Esmaeilion said .
" I refreshed the ( ICAO ) website a hundred times yesterday to see if there 's any new news , and there was n't , " Esmaeilion said .
" It is very , very frustrating for us .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what to do .
We are really confused .
"  Champagne said he spoke this week with his Ukrainian counterpart to see if Iran had fulfilled its commitment .
He was told Kyiv and Tehran are still working on the " terms of reference " for the transfer .
" Both parties are negotiating , I would say , these terms of reference , " said Champagne .
Shevchenko said in an interview this week that his country expects Iran to fulfil its promise to hand over the flight recorders , and that the international community needs to work together to make sure it does .
COVID-19 " makes our work with Iran much more complicated and the best we hear from Iran is that because of the situation with the virus , they can not do this and that , " he added .
" So , this definitely makes things slower .
Nevertheless , we see no reason why we can not advance .
"  Esmaeilion nevertheless worries COVID-19 has distracted Canadian officials as the federal government struggles to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to co-operate with investigators and bring justice for the victims and their families .
" For most of the families , there 's nothing more important than justice , " he said .
" And every morning when we get up , every night when we go to bed , we 're just thinking about justice because it does n't make sense what they did .
"  Champagne said the government is n't forgetting the promises it made to Canadian families after the tragedy .
He said it has fulfilled two of them -- gaining consular access to Iran and repatriating the remains of crash victims .
More work needs to be done on the crash investigation and securing compensation for the victims ' families , he said .
" We stood up for Canadian families , " Champagne said .
" We said to them we 'd stand up for them from Day 1 and we will continue to do so .
We 're seeking answers from Iran .
We want accountability , justice , transparency .
