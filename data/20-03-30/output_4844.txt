COLES is adding 130 staff members in central Victoria to meet customer demand even as other businesses shut in the face of coronavirus .
Forty-five of the new employees have been fast-tracked into supermarkets and liquor stores in Bendigo and the wider region .
Some are from industries like travel , sport , fitness and hospitality , which have been decimated by restrictions .
Some businesses will thrive during the crisis itself because of their essential service status , even if the number of people they can put on pale in comparison to the jobs lost in the wider economy , Bendigo and Adelaide Bank managing director Marnie Baker said .
Her bank has been approached by businesses needing the capital for extra staff .
" We know that essential service businesses are putting a lot of people on to help with logistics to keep up with online demand , and to get groceries into stores , " Ms Baker said .
It is a bright spot amid surging numbers of people off of work and warnings that coronavirus could radically alter Bendigo consumers ' habits if the crisis wears on .
" If this does go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to what they were a few weeks ago , " Ms Baker said .
" Things will have changed because we all will have adapted .
" More : Several of the city 's largest industries have already been hit hard by social distancing restrictions including retail , accommodation and food services .
Those sectors alone cover one fifth of Bendigo 's 48,000 jobs , statistics compiled by economic consultancy REMPLAN suggest .
Up to $90 million could have been wiped from the city 's $14 .
billion economy when tourism collapsed , REMPLAN director Matthew Nichol said last week .
But that was only a very early estimate of a crisis that has enveloped other sectors and at a time when data is only beginning to trickle in across Australia , he cautioned .
Economists are now watching the thousands of Bendigo office workers now working from home , Mr Nichol said .
" We will be teasing out if , in the middle of this crisis , businesses have learnt things that they might keep doing - or at least elements of them , " he said .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you take councils and businesses : we are all working from home now .
" There might be elements that are not working so well but I 'll tell you what , it 's incredible to see how people are innovating to make it work .
" Mr Nichol group will track that as part of a wider national business survey as it scrambles to help clients track economic damage .
More : Bendigo lost $90 million when tourism imploded : early estimate With the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Bendigo rising to seven on Monday and to 821 across Victoria , Ms Baker said it was way too early to tell when the economic crisis would end and recovery could begin .
In the meantime , businesses and workers would have to keep turning to emergency measures like the government 's newly announced $130 billion worth of JobSeeker payments to affected workers .
Ms Baker said her bank was among those supporting a separate federal relief package allowing eligible customers with facilities up to $10 million to defer repayments on business loans for six months , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry has been working with the government all the way through to make sure we are supporting our business and mortgage measures , " Ms Baker said .
" Outside of that , we are asking all our business and mortgage customers to please get in touch with us and talk about the impact of COVID-19 on them , and see if we can be of assistance .
It 's what we are here to do .
" Ms Baker urged Bendigo residents to keep supporting local businesses .
" I think it is more important than ever that people stick together and support each other , " she said .
