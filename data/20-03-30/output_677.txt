&amp; SAN FRANCISCO-- ( BUSINESS WIRE ) --Generation Bio andVir Biotechnology ( Nasdaq : VIR ) today announced a collaborative research agreement to explore the potential for Generation Bio 's non-viral gene therapy platform to extend the impact and reach of Vir 's current or future human monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) against SARS-CoV-2 , the virus responsible for COVID-19 .
Generation Bio 's technology has the potential to deliver genetic information directly to cells without the use of adeno-associated viruses ( AAV ) , in effect instructing the patient 's body to produce the antibody itself .
The companies believe that this technology , coupled with Vir 's potent neutralizing antibodies , has the potential to provide effective , long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 .
Vir 's leading antibody was isolated from a SARS-CoV-1 recovered patient and potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 .
Vir believes that this approach can potentially provide broad and longer-lasting protection .
" Together , we believe we can develop long-lasting therapies suitable for population-wide prevention and treatment , " said Generation Bio President and CEO Geoff McDonough , M .
" We are moving with urgency to explore leveraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term .
"  Generation Bio 's proprietary non-viral gene therapy platform is designed to enable production of target proteins from a patient 's own cells .
This approach may allow the patient to maintain stable levels of antibody expression for years , providing continuous protection against the target virus .
In addition , the companies intend to leverage Generation Bio 's scalable manufacturing process to potentially extend the reach of Vir 's monoclonal antibodies to a greater number of patients .
" We are eager to bring our antibodies to patients as quickly as possible , and should they work , to make them available to as many patients as quickly as possible .
We are excited to explore the potential of ceDNA in an infectious disease setting and our anti-SARS-CoV-2 program offers a way to do that , " said George Scangos , Ph .
, CEO of Vir .
" Both companies are highly motivated to make meaningful contributions to stopping this disease and we look forward to a productive collaboration with Generation Bio .
"  About Generation Bio  Generation Bio is an innovative genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy to provide durable , redosable treatments for patients suffering from both rare and prevalent diseases .
The company 's non-viral platform incorporates a proprietary high-capacity DNA construct called closed-ended DNA , or ceDNA ; a novel cell-targeted lipid nanoparticle delivery system , or ctLNP ; and an established , scalable capsid-free manufacturing process .
The company is designing therapies to provide targeted delivery of genetic payloads that include large and multiple genes across a broad array of tissues , and to be redosable for individualized and extended treatment throughout a patient 's life .
The platform is designed to expand access to treatments for rare diseases and to address prevalent diseases through efficient , scalable manufacturing .
About Vir 's Antibody Platform  Vir has a robust method for capitalizing on unusually successful immune responses naturally occurring in people who are protected from , or have recovered from , infectious diseases .
The platform is used to identify rare antibodies from survivors that have the potential to treat and prevent rapidly evolving and/or previously untreatable pathogens via direct pathogen neutralization and immune system stimulation .
Vir engineers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential .
This platform has been used to identify and develop antibodies for pathogens including Ebola ( mAb114 , currently in use in the Democratic Republic of Congo ) , hepatitis B virus , influenza A , SARS-CoV-2 , malaria , and others .
About Vir Biotechnology  Vir Biotechnology is a clinical-stage immunology company focused on combining immunologic insights with cutting-edge technologies to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases .
Vir has assembled four technology platforms that are designed to stimulate and enhance the immune system by exploiting critical observations of natural immune processes .
Its current development pipeline consists of product candidates targeting hepatitis B virus , influenza A , SARS-CoV-2 , human immunodeficiency virus , and tuberculosis .
