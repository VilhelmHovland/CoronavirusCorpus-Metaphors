The library system has erected several Little Free Libraries in front of their branches in the city recently to help residents get access to books during the coronavirus pandemic .

While the Little Free Libraries out in the county have been there for several years , the ones in the city were all put up sometime in the past week , said Hill .

It 's escape for sure , but also increases empathy , " said Hill .

" I 'm really glad I could do a project that people are gon na see for a while , even after I leave town and head out , " said Mikus .
" Not to discredit other projects , but sometimes a bridge or something that is n't seen by other people -- I feel like a lot of people are gon na be using them so that makes me happy .
