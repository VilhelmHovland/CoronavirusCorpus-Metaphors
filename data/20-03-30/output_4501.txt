SUPPLIES of minerals and metals to world markets may decline after a number of large mining companies temporarily stopped work at mines in the wake of COVID-19 , including operations which had recorded no cases of the virus , said the Financial Times .
Citing BMO Capital Markets analyst , Edward Sterck , a supply shortage had not been properly priced in by markets .
" As the number of operations announcing restrictions to production increases , so does the risk to supply for a number of key commodities , which we think has n't been properly priced in by markets , " said Sterck .
In Peru , which accounts for 12% of global copper production , a 15-day national quarantine has brought its mining industry almost to a standstill , while Codelco , the world 's biggest producer of the metal , has reduced operations in Chile , said the newspaper .
" The rapid decline in the price of copper due to the impact of COVID-19 has now placed significant additional pressure on Mopani 's operations , " the company said in a statement .
The metal , often referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the global economy , has been hit hard by the global slowdown caused by COVID-19 , said Reuters .
Glencore said that its review of Mopani would give it the necessary financial flexibility to navigate the downturn .
Brazilian firm Vale said it had ceased mining at Voisey 's Bay nickel mine in Canada as a precaution to protect the health of local residents .
