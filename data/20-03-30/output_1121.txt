Over the past 30 years , advances in treatment have transformed HIV from a death sentence into a manageable condition .
The challenge now is to sustain that progress , as innovation is key to ending the epidemic  As the EU reshapes its industrial and digital ambitions , the Covid-19 health care crisis is hitting hard .
Here 's how the Commission 's strategies are leading the way to help citizens and global partners  ROME -- A country on lockdown is facing an increasingly urgent question : What to do with the locked up ?  As the first cases of coronavirus start to spread in Italy 's overcrowded prison system , prison staff and welfare monitors are warning of a public health emergency among inmates and a potential repeat of a series of violent protests that broke out in 24 prisons earlier this month , when 13 inmates died and 70 escaped .
At least 15 inmates have tested positive for the virus , creating a buildup of panic and anger among inmates .
Two prison guards have died from the virus and unions say at least 150 others are ill , although there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in opposition , the government can ill afford to look soft on crime .
For the 5Stars , the anti-establishment party governing alongside the left-wing PD , releasing prisoners would seem to contradict its long-standing criticism of Italy 's lenient justice system and its pledge to never pardon prisoners .
Italy 's prisons are the most overcrowded in the EU .
Some 61,000 prisoners are incarcerated in a system intended to house up to 50,000 , according to official figures .
The government has attempted to head off the crisis and cut prisoner numbers by permitting non-violent prisoners with less than 18 months left to serve to be released on house arrest .
The move has been met with criticism on all sides .
Relaxing the rules amounts to " a surrender " by a " very weak government " and will only lead to more riots , said Jacopo Morrone , a member of parliament for the far-right League and a former undersecretary for justice .
" If a child cries and the mum gives it a sweet , it will cry again to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary disorder during a national emergency , " he added .
" They are not going to wake up tomorrow and start going to church .
"  Moral responsibility  Others have argued that the measures do n't go far enough .
Few prisoners are eligible for release under the new scheme , as many have committed crimes in prison or have bad disciplinary records .
In the first week after the measure was introduced , the state released only 50 prisoners .
Vittorio Sgarbi , a liberal MP and former minister in former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's government , has called for a criminal investigation into Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede as " a plague spreader " for keeping so many prisoners in cramped conditions .

In 2013 , Italy was sanctioned by European Court of Human Rights for breaking the European Convention on Human Rights , which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Delays in the court system also mean that prisoners wait for their trial in jail for months or years , said Valentina Calderone , director of civil rights NGO A Buon Diritto , which champions an urgent and wider release of inmates with two or three years left on their sentence .
Thirty percent of people in prisons are in custody pending trial , well above the European average , and some of the most crowded prisons are in the northern regions of Lombardy , Veneto and Emilia Romagna , where outbreaks of the virus have been most severe .
" Can you guarantee the safe distance of one meter in prison when they are three , four , five to a cell ? " Sgarbi asked Bonafede in parliament last week .
" You have judicial and moral responsibility .
"  ' Public health bomb '  There is a high level of anxiety among inmates at the prospect of being trapped in a confined space with so many others while a lethal virus spreads through the country , said Calderone .
Prisoners tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the closed world , social distancing of 1 meter as recommended by the government is impossible .
" Even in normal circumstances prison is a place you get ill , " said Calderone .
" It could be a public health bomb .
We need a courageous approach from politics .
"  National prisoner rights ombudsman Mauro Palma is " extremely worried " about a repeat of the riots , he said .
" I have seen no measures to prevent the spread of the virus , such as a reduction in inmate numbers , cleaning of prisons and testing .
"  " It is as if there are two layers of imprisonment , " he said .
" The usual detention but also , the fear of being shut in a closed space with an enemy you can not see .
"  More than 6,000 inmates took part in the last round of riots , which began as a protest against a ban on prison visits to slow the spread of the coronavirus .
The riots started at Fuorni prison , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildfire through the penal system .
Detainees fashioned makeshift weapons from bedposts , ripped bars off the windows and took to the roofs , clashing with police tear gas and taking guards prisoner .
Another round of riots would be a disaster , said Aldo Di Giacomo , the secretary of the SPP prison police union , who said riots are being organized by criminal syndicates , with the additional involvement of inmates ' families and anarchists .
Prison guards were not in a fit state to respond , he said , with many working extra-long 20-hour shifts .
" We are like doctors , we are destroyed .
