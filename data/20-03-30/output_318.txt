North Tongu MP , Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa , has made a 10-point suggestion to government on how to generate revenue amid the fight against the new coronavirus .
These points , the legislator suggested in a post , if followed , would give the government the financial muscle instead of the administration falling on the heritage fund .
Among others , Mr .
Ablakwa suggested a 50 per cent pay cut for all political officeholders .
He also suggested a 60 per cent cut in size of government , that is , Ministers and presidential staffers .
If these and others are done , the outspoken MP says " the heritage fund will most likely be left intact for our children .
