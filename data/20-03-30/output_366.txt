One evening a few weeks back , although it honestly feels like years , I ended up at Fu Fu Caf ? , my local late-night Chinese diner .
Usually , it 's stuffed from edge to edge till all hours , serving the third-shift folks , the club set , and any number of hungry families .
But tonight was different .
As the novel coronavirus made headway throughout the States , and an increasing number of cases were found in Houston , our city 's Chinatown had n't been exempt from the dips in business in parallel neighborhoods nationwide .
At some spots on Bellaire Boulevard , whole shifts glided by without customers .
You could find ample parking in the normally overcrowded stacks of strip malls .
And now , at Fu Fu , every table was available .
But , after I ordered , a black couple walked in .
And then , eventually , a couple of Asian guys in sweats .
And then a gaggle of business types , comfy in suits .
And then a few more folks stumbled through the door for takeout .
All over the region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looming disruption of their daily lives -- which , we 're now finding , would mean the suspension of dining out altogether .
But this restaurant , at least for tonight , had settled into somewhat of a flow .
I took a seat by the register .
Talked with one of the owners for a bit .
He told me that , yes , business was slow , but sometimes life is slow , and then he passed me a beer .
It was a regular evening on the edge of deeply irregular times .
Dining out is part of Houston 's cosmology .
It 's as integral as the sprawl and the oil and the art and the chopped-and-screwed remixes filtering through car speakers up and down our highways .
A Zagat survey a couple of years back found that Houstonians eat out more than any other major-city dwellers in the country , and I imagine that 's partly a matter of access , since the city is a global-food haven .
We 've got any number of delicacies , often available on the same street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also because of the city 's relatively low cost of living , which gives us the privilege of being able to eat out at all , let alone a couple of times a week .
Life in Houston is lived in the city 's Korean restaurants , hidden in the back of convenience stores and gas stations and taquerias tucked in strip malls and upscale Southern neighborhood spots .
Our restaurant culture is built on empathy and openness and flexibility -- and , in the midst of a global pandemic , we 're suddenly confronted with what we owe the spots that have given us so much .
On Monday , Houston officials mandated that all restaurants eliminate sit-down service for fifteen days , along with a concurrent closure of bars and clubs .
Some locations instantly turned to Instagram , promoting pickup and delivery opportunities , but many more succumbed to a lack of foot traffic or social-media reach , shuttering their doors immediately .
Gradually , establishments that began alternative services with high hopes began to shutter , too .
Last month , a Singaporean photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring a crowd of diners eating outside underneath neon lights -- just a regular evening out .
" I posted this on my Weibo and my Chinese followers are saying that they really wished they could go out to eat , " Nguan wrote in a comment .
Reading this , I felt a bit of the dread that 's since become a mainstay in our current situation .
Of course , there are sadder things that 've happened , and matters more immediately pressing , in this ongoing global crisis .
But I could n't think of anything more detrimental to public life , in my particular city , than a loss of restaurants .
Eating out can be an afterthought , or a celebration , or a chore .
It can be a bore .
Or a routine .
But when it 's gone there 's simply nothing that you can put in its place .
Last week , before the question of a full-on closure even arose , my noodle shop in Spring Branch -- a tiny joint , usually smoky and fragrant with sesame oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign on the window , written in Hangul .
Earlier this week , my regular Mexican spot in the Heights announced that it was closing until further notice .
In the days since the ban , across seemingly every platform , restaurants have made their appeals : for customers to order out , buy gift cards , donate to fund-raisers for undocumented staff .
The song is the same from city to city .
Fu Fu is operating on a takeout-only basis now , along with every other restaurant in the same plaza .
Wednesday morning , on a quick grocery run , I passed through the parking lot and found a handful of folks sitting in their cars , while others sat on the concrete or the curb , because , where those restaurants and diners had served as a third place , now there was a void .
Here were Houstonians doing their best to fill it themselves .
Our Turkish bakeries , Nigerian markets , and pupuserias lining the whole of Westheimer and Bissonnet , our Taiwanese boba shops , our Cuban joints whose patios sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragrant that you can smell them from the feeder road -- these are places that cultivate people as much as profit .
If we do n't fight for them , many will close for good .
The employees who have been , and will continue to be , laid off wo n't have their jobs to return to .
And we will all be the worse for it .
I can absolutely promise you that .
