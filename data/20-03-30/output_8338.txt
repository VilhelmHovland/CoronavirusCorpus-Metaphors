BEIJING -- The coronavirus pandemic is making a hard situation worse for China 's growing number of job-seeking college graduates , intensifying pressure on Communist Party officials who see steady employment as critical to maintaining economic and social order .
The nearly nine million students expected to get their diplomas this year -- China 's biggest graduating class in roughly a decade -- will enter one of the toughest job markets in recent history .
Even before the pandemic , the slowing economy was already throwing up fewer jobs for the swelling ranks of white-collar workers .
Jin Shu , a 22-year-old student in Beijing , accepted a teaching-assistant job at a local tutoring school in January , only to have it put on ice last month after the academy shut down .
The pandemic , Ms .
Jin said , " is like a cloud of smog and we have no idea what the road ahead looks like .

They have expanded military enrollment and are encouraging those graduating to seek master 's degrees to delay their entry into the job market .
The concern has reached the highest levels of government .
Premier Li Keqiang , China 's No .
2 official behind President Xi Jinping , said this month that officials in charge of economic recovery should prioritize employment over the cherished goal of increasing GDP .

" After 1989 , the employment of young people became very important as a metric for stability , " Mr .
Shih said .
That focus intensified after unemployed young people in the Middle East became the driving force behind the Arab Spring uprisings that toppled several governments , and spooked Chinese leaders , in 2011 .
Last year nearly 20% of recent college graduates struggled to find work , according to a biennial survey by Peking University 's Institute of Economics of Education .
This summer 's graduating class , of 8 .
million students , is 5% larger than 2019 's and more than double the number of graduates the U .
expects this year .

Since then , demand for white-collar jobs has consistently outstripped supply , a gap that has widened in recent years as economic growth slowed .
Public-health crises exacerbate the problem .
During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome , or SARS , that began in November 2002 , 35% of college graduates had yet to find a job by the following June , according to the Peking University survey .
The coronavirus pandemic arrived in the middle of the spring recruitment season , when many of China 's biggest companies extend job offers to graduates .
A report by Peking University 's Guanghua School of Management and Chinese job website operator Zhaopin Ltd .
on March 25 showed new job openings in China fell by around a third year-over-year in January and February .

The expanded master 's degree admissions are for the coming fall semester , when authorities hope most universities will have reopened .
Even if they have to take courses online , the new graduate students will be held out of the job market .
The education ministry also encouraged students earlier this month to enroll in the military , which would make them eligible for tuition deductions .
Others could find work at international organizations like the United Nations , it suggested .
Hubei , the province hardest hit by the coronavirus , said late last week that it would increase recruitment for civil-service positions by 20% and hire an additional 50,000 recent graduates for other public jobs .
The unemployment pressures highlight the Communist Party 's push in recent years to expand the state sector at the expense of the private sector , a drive that has only grown with the party 's reliance on state-owned firms to help supply the coronavirus response .

China 's finance ministry has offered subsidies and tax-breaks to smaller companies that hire more graduates or refrain from laying off employees during the coronavirus epidemic .
Economists are skeptical that those enticements can compensate for the shortfalls such firms have suffered .
Encouraging more master 's degrees and other short-term fixes does little to address the structural issues that are undermining the economy as manufacturing jobs move to lower-wage countries , said Liu Xuezhi , a Shanghai-based economist at Bank of Communications .
" These graduates still need to re-enter the labor market within two or three years , so we need to fundamentally solve these problems , " Mr .
Liu said .
