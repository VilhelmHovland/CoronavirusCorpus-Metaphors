Environment Agency continuing its flood defence work in Mytholmroyd  Work is continuing on the Mytholmroyd flood alleviation scheme to better protect 400 properties in the village from the effects of flooding , the Environment Agency has said .
In light of the Coronavirus situation and Government advice , the organisation has postponed the remaining flood drop -- in sessions which were being held with partners to offer support for residents and businesses affected by the devastating Storm Ciara flood event , until it is safe to hold them again .
Paul Swales , senior flood risk adviser for Calderdale , said :  " We are doing all we can to ensure work continues as much as is safe to do so and that delays caused by the knock-on effects of this pandemic are kept to an absolute minimum .
" The effect which the Coronavirus situation will have on the scheme is still unclear and will depend on developments over the next days and weeks .
If our plans change significantly due to the situation we will keep the community informed .
" Our priority in these difficult times is the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , so we have closed our construction site office in Mytholmroyd to the public and we will not be holding any public engagement events until it is safe to do so .
" As an organisation we are doing everything we can to support our community , our government and the NHS by abiding by these measures .
"  Considerable progress has been made constructing a new bridge in the village by the Agency working with contractor VBA , a joint venture comprising VolkerStevin , Boskalis Westminster and SNC-Lavalin 's Atkins business .
This is a vital part of the Mytholmroyd flood alleviation scheme .
A decision was taken to replace the existing Caldene Bridge with one that is more than 12m wider as it is a major constriction to flood flow and contributed towards the Boxing Day 2015 flood event in the village .
The demolition of the existing Caldene Bridge will begin as soon as the new bridge is open .
To rebuild the bridge , many utility service diversions needed to be carried out and a temporary highway and walkway through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pedestrians so the works could continue safely .
The overnight work and closure of a section of Burnley Road planned to take place this week have been cancelled .
Mr Swales said his team is currently going through a period of readjustment to widespread home working , and systems are being put in place to support this .
