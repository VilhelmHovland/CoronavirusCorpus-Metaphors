Early Sunday evening , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scheduled a procedural vote for the roughly $2 trillion stimulus package that Senate Republicans and Democrats had been negotiating over the weekend .
Democrats had n't signed off on the deal , though , and were still pushing for increased benefits for the unemployed , hospitals , and states , as well as stronger guardrails and oversight of the roughly $500 billion fund for large corporations , disbursement of much of which would otherwise be largely left to the treasury secretary 's discretion .
So Senate Democrats successfully filibustered .
An unusually mad McConnell blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who flew back to D .
from San Francisco on Saturday , for blowing up the negotiations by bringing with her a new wish list of demands .
Later in the night , when McConnell tried to schedule a do-over on the same procedural vote for 9:45 Monday morning -- 15 minutes after the stock markets opened , in an effort to terrify Democrats -- Democratic leader Chuck Schumer objected .
The Senate opened at noon on Monday instead .
And when it came into session , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure , unbridled anger from a cohort of cranky geriatrics who are trapped in the Capitol Hill coronavirus nest until they can reach a deal to prop up the country 's collapsing economy and health systems .
After McConnell 's opening remarks , in which he once again accused Pelosi of turning " the Senate 's serious bipartisan process .
into this left-wing episode of Supermarket Sweep , " Schumer spoke about how his negotiations with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the White House 's congressional liaison , Eric Ueland , had been going well .
" Our goal is to reach a deal today , " Schumer said .
" And we are hopeful , even confident that we will meet that goal .
"  Schumer was just trying to set a voting schedule with McConnell .
After they did , Collins spoke .
She was mad .
" I will tell you , Mr .
President , " she said , addressing the chair , " I 've had the honor to serve in this body for many years .
Never , never have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crisis .
We did so after 9/11 , we did so with the financial meltdown in 2008 .
Here we are facing an enemy that is invisible but equally devastating to the health of our people and the health of our economy .
And yet , unbelievably , the Democratic leader objected to my even being able to speak this morning ? "  " We 're in a situation now where if you vote ' yes ' " on the procedural vote , Manchin said , " and then you 're not in agreement with the bill , then it only takes 51 votes .
That seems to be the reason that everyone 's saying , wait a minute , let 's get an agreement so we can move through .
" In other words , Democrats would lose their leverage if they agreed to move forward .
McConnell was still in the chamber , and nothing gets Mitch McConnell more irate than someone being wrong in their application of Senate Rule XXII .
Practically shouting at Manchin , McConnell observed that Democrats would still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  A Senate Democratic aide , when asked why Democrats do n't just start debate and use the next procedural vote as their leverage , said : " The negotiations are still happening , why should there be arbitrary deadlines for votes ? If we get a deal things can be sped up .
" Why try to amend the bill with the 30-hour clock for formal debate running , in other words , when they can still get it changed in the preliminary negotiations ?  There was an hour devoted to floor debate before the next vote , and it was used for that rarest of purposes : debate .
Typically a Senate " debate " involves lone floor speeches , with senators pretending for the cameras that they 're owning the other side into speechlessness when , in reality , few if any members of the other side are even in the chamber .
It made for a weird scene , then , when senators actually got into arguments .
After a mad Ohio Sen .
Sherrod Brown said that McConnell had taken days to call up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkansas Sen .
Tom Cotton took objection to his timeline , noting that the House had n't transmitted the final version until the day before the Senate voted on it .
" I know you always want to do Trump , the president 's bidding , " Brown said .
" I have the floor and will keep the floor .
"  Other mad senators during this time period included Tennessee Sen .
Lamar Alexander , who is not often mad , and Idaho Sen .
Jim Risch , who is frequently mad .
Illinois Sen .
Dick Durbin , who is occasionally mad , was not mad , and urged other senators to not be mad as well .
They did n't listen .
When the Senate next voted , around 1:45 p .
, on the procedural vote to move ahead , it failed 49 to 46 , with Alabama Sen .
Doug Jones joining Republicans .
And so Mitch McConnell was , again , mad .
