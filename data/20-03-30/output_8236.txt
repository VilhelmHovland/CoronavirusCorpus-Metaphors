Italica Grondona was admitted to San Martino Hospital in Genoa in early March for " mild heart failure , " according to her doctor , Vera Sicbaldi .
She also had mild coronavirus symptoms , so she was tested for COVID-19 and found to be positive .
Despite her age , her heart condition and the infection , she required little medical intervention , doctors said .
" We nicknamed her ' Highlander ' -- the immortal , " Sicbaldi told CNN .
Doctors say Grondona , who was born in 1917 , is the first person they know of to contract COVID-19 and also live through the Spanish influenza pandemic that killed 50 million people in 1918-19 .
They took serological samples to identify what antibodies she might carry .
