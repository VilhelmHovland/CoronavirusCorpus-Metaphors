The document , dated Saturday and obtained by the Star , suggests the province is taking steps to prepare for worst-case scenarios already playing out in hard-hit regions such as Italy and New York , where COVID-19 wards are overflowing and doctors are being forced to ration life-saving interventions like ventilators .
It acknowledges that intensive care units ( ICUs ) in Ontario are already operating near -- or even above -- capacity and that " even the lowest estimates of ( COVID-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  " There is a compelling need to prepare a triage system to allocate critical care resources in the event of a severe surge in demand , to be used only as a last resort , " states the document , which was published by Ontario Health , the newly created " super-agency " for overseeing health-care delivery in the province .
" The consequences of failing to prepare for this eventuality are potentially serious , as has been seen in Italy , a country with similar ICU resource levels to Canada .
"  The protocol document was developed by Dr .
James Downar , secretary of the Canadian Critical Care Society and a critical care specialist at the Ottawa Hospital , who was working " under the auspices " of the province 's COVID-19 command structure .
When reached by email , Downar said he was referring all media requests to Ontario Health , which was unable to respond by deadline .
The province did not respond to questions about whether the document represents the finalized protocol or a working version .
But its existence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicians across Ontario , who have been following the harrowing stories streaming out of COVID-19 epicentres such as Italy and New York while also watching the coronavirus outbreak become increasingly urgent at home .
Last week , Ontario saw the number of COVID-19 patients being treated in ICUs jump from 17 on Wednesday to 63 on Saturday .
The Ministry of Health told reporters that the province 's current ICU capacity is at 68 per cent , with efforts underway to clear more ICU beds and procure more ventilators -- including 300 already purchased and newly secured contracts to provide as many as 10,000 more .
But as of Friday , the most specialized ICU beds -- known as Level 3 beds , needed by the sickest COVID-19 patients -- were already at 85 per cent capacity .
" From a critical care physician 's perspective , this ( triage ) document is crucial , " said Dr .
Bram Rochwerg , an associate professor at McMaster University and critical care physician , researcher and site lead with the Juravinski Hospital in Hamilton .
" I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we might have to start triaging based on resources that we had .
It 's scary .
( but ) having a policy provides protection and pathways and protocols to enact if , God forbid , we ever get to that point .
"  Follow the Toronto Star on social media :  The protocol document states that the purpose of a triage system is to minimize death and illness for the population overall and ensure consistent and predictable guidelines .
The system will be triggered only if local resources have been depleted and every attempt has been made to relocate patients to other facilities that still have capacity .
The document acknowledges , however , that " transportation resources will become stretched in a pandemic and this will not always be possible .
"  The document states that the health-care system can adjust to " mild " or " moderate " surges by adapting existing resources , such as using operating room ventilators or enlisting non-ICU staff .
But if the system enters a state of " major surge " -- defined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more -- regional hospitals are informed that triage will be " imminent .
" When the system hits a breaking point ( theoretically defined in the protocol document as 200 per cent of normal capacity ) , triage protocols are activated and begin to escalate in a stepwise fashion , where the more overwhelmed the system becomes , the stricter the criteria for which patients will be prioritized for critical care .
Under the triage protocol , patients will be assessed according to both inclusion and exclusion criteria .
Those who are excluded from treatment will be patients " who are very likely to die from their critical illness , and people who are very likely to die in the near future even if they recovered from their critical illness .
"  At level 1 triage , for example , doctors are advised to exclude patients who have greater than 80 per cent predicted mortality .
At level 3 , patients with greater than 30 per cent predicted mortality will be excluded .
Under the triage protocol , long-term-care patients who meet specific criteria will also no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients are excluded will be based on " good data to show who is unlikely to survive a long critical care stay when they have COVID " or any other critical care issue , said Dr .
Alison Fox-Robichaud , past president and spokesperson for the Critical Care Society of Canada , which consulted on the triage protocols .
The decision to activate the triage system will also be made regionally and treatment decisions for specific patients will be made by a team of people -- thus relieving individual doctors from having to shoulder these burdens alone , she said .
" I think the most important thing from a critical care perspective is this is n't going to be an individual critical care physician 's decision , if we have to invoke this .

They will also receive " the highest priority for palliative care .
"  " ( This protocol is ) coupled with a clear palliative care plan so that if we have to , heaven help us , get into this situation , we are going to be providing good care , kind and compassionate care , to the best we can in the middle of a pandemic , " Fox-Robichaud said .
The protocol outlines three guiding principles for the triage protocol , the first being " utility , " meaning physicians should allocate resources to patients who stand to benefit the most .
The second is " proportionality " -- in other words , the number of patients who will be negatively affected by this last-resort triage system should not exceed the number of people who stand to benefit .
The third principle is fairness , meaning only clinical information should be used to decide which patients are treated over others .
" Priority should not be given to anyone on the basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lemmens , a bioethicist and professor of health law and policy with the University of Toronto , said he feels this last principle has been given short shrift in the protocol and he would like to see more explicit language guaranteeing that all patients -- particularly those from vulnerable populations -- will be considered equally .
He is especially worried about patients who may be more easily assessed as having a poorer chance of survival -- for example , people with disabilities or homeless people .
" It suggests too easily that these clinical assessments are value-neutral , " he said .
Lemmens also finds the notion of removing patients from life support to be ethically problematic .
" If it comes to a situation where somebody 's on a ventilator and we already committed to this person who is receiving the necessary care , I think it may be more problematic to withdraw that from a person with significant chance of survival than to say to somebody who now enters the hospital system , ' Well , we currently do n't have anything available , ' " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the province 's triage protocol is the kind of document " you prepare but hope to never use , " but he is glad that it now exists and is generating an important conversation .
" This is the first time that Ontario has really had to grapple with this in a concrete way , " said Fowler , who works at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre .
He believes it 's too soon to say whether Ontario or Canada will see a COVID-19 crisis of Italy or New York proportions and he believes it 's still possible social distancing measures have made a difference in flattening the curve .
He notes that critical care units across the province have also become very well integrated since the SARS crisis , so that even if one hospital or region reaches capacity , there is still the option of relocating patients to other regions or even provinces before activating the triage system as a last resort .
In the meantime , he says , the general public can do its part in preparing themselves for their own worst-case scenarios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would even want ventilation or other invasive interventions should they ever find themselves in an ICU ward -- if the answer is no , then that would mean freeing up a bed or ventilator for another patient who would want it .
" These are always the sort of conversations that you think , ' Oh gosh , I do n't want to talk about that , ' " Fowler said .
" But it 's a conversation that 's as relevant now as it ever was .
