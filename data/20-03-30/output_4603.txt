London : Having carved a deadly path through some of Europe 's grandest cities , the worst pandemic in a century now threatens to unleash its cruellest work on some of the places and people that can least afford to be hit .
In the packed , squalid migrant camps of Greece , social distancing , self-isolation and hand washing are fantasy concepts .
Here , these life-saving measures are luxuries that will only be made available if the increasingly desperate calls for help are heard by Athens and the European Union .

Images  On the island of Lesbos , 20,000 people who fled war in Syria , Afghanistan and Iraq are jammed into the infamous Moria camp built for no more than 3000 .
There is just one tap for every 1300 people .
Tiny tents are packed with up to half-a-dozen occupants .
Nearly 170 residents have to share a single toilet and 200 line up for the same shower .

A growing chorus of aid workers like Veizsis are warning of an impending humanitarian catastrophe if coronavirus sweeps into unprepared and ill-equipped makeshift refugee cities in Greece and Syria .
' I can tell you that for the last four years these people on the islands have just been numbers to many .
'  Apostolos Veizis , Medecins Sans Frontieres  Doctors , charity chiefs and some European MPs are calling for an urgent evacuation of the camps before the virus finds its way in and takes hold .
The consequences of a full-blown outbreak would be severe given the absence of medical resources , lack of funding and high number of pre-existing health conditions among a vulnerable population .
" In society , some people are just numbers , " Veizis said .
" And I can tell you that for the last four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many .
" But the European Union and Greek government have the capacity and resources to reduce the suffering and reduce the risk .
They have been able to evacuate European citizens from countries around the world , so if you want to do it , you can .

About 40,000 men , women and children live in facilities built for just over 6000 across five camps on the Greek islands off Turkey 's coast .
Of the people in the camps , 35 per cent are children and 16 per cent of those children are unaccompanied minors .
Some 25 per cent of inhabitants are women .
The government ordered an effective lockdown of the facilities in mid-March as COVID-19 spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two weeks .
The non-essential movements of migrants within and outside the camp has also been curbed .
" Restricting thousands of women , men , and children in severely overcrowded camps , where living conditions are unacceptable , makes it impossible to isolate people exposed to COVID-19 or to comply with minimum preventive and protective measures , even hand washing and social-distancing , " said Eva Cosse , the Greece researcher for Human Rights Watch .
" The Greek government urgently needs to move people to mainland Greece .
"  The European Parliament 's civil liberties , justice and home affairs committee has urged the European Union to arrange the evacuation as an " urgent preventative measure " .
" If the EU fails to take immediate action , the situation on the Greek islands will become unmanageable with the risk of many deaths , " Juan Fernando Lopez Aguilar , who chairs the committee , wrote to the EU .
He warned there were only six intensive care beds available on Lesbos for the general public and those in the Moria camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities in Greece to prepare an emergency response plan to " deal with a potential outbreak " on the islands .
Antigone Lyberaki , the general manager of the SolidarityNow humanitarian organisation , said there was a " window of opportunity to address this issue while the situation is still manageable , but we fear this window may be closing fast " .
Greece has 1212 confirmed cases of COVID-19 , including at least one on Lesbos .
There have been no confirmed cases in the migrant camps .
Infections are also rising fast in Turkey .
Veizis said he was distressed that it had taken the coronavirus emergency to remind the world of the plight of the homeless , the lonely , the elderly , and refugees .
" These people have been living in this extreme situation to the total negligence of the Greek government and the European authorities , " he said .
" They have to act .
This really is one of the worst places to have an outbreak .
We are all worried .
