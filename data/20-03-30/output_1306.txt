Coronavirus : Royal British Legion supporting veterans  AS the country faces its greatest battle since the Second World War , Royal British Legion volunteers are supporting Weymouth veterans self-isolating amid the coronavirus outbreak .
Veterans of any age who need help with anything - from shopping , to cleaning or a chat , can get help from two community-minded Weymouth women representing the local branch of the Royal British Legion .
Welfare officer Jennifer Smith and Naomi Turner , branch chairman , are volunteering their time to visit and care for veterans of all ages in the town .
They want to make sure those who have dedicated their lives to serving in the armed forces are not put at risk due to isolation .
Some veterans who are self-isolating for their own protection already have support from home carers -- but there are many more who do not automatically qualify for help and could be cut off from society .
" We 're happy to help with absolutely anything , " Jennifer said .
" It could be a bit of shopping , a bit of cleaning , or just popping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or being at the end of the ' phone .
" People with mobility issues who relied on others for shopping could now find themselves without help .
If family members are in self-isolation , they might not see anyone for a week or more .
" Even if it 's just dropping in to make the bed or offer a little bit of extra support , we want to let people know we 're here to help - that 's what the Royal British Legion is for .
"  Jennifer said that she and Naomi are available to help veterans living in the Weymouth area , and are meeting their own petrol costs due to limited funds .
They are offering to run errands and visit people between the hours of 9am - 5pm .
" I just want to make sure there 's nobody in the community who 's thinking , ' I ca n't even make a cup of tea because I 've only got one leg and I ca n't get to the shop to buy milk .
'  " Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day is lonely - we 're happy to support in any way we can .
