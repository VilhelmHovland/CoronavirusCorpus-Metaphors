Cuomo threatens to reject $6 .
in federal aid in favor of Medicaid redesign  ALBANY -- Despite a $6 billion budget gap and new revenue losses posed by New York 's coronavirus outbreak , Gov .
Andrew Cuomo is threatening to forgo more than $6 billion in federal aid he says would force him to adjust his Medicaid redesign strategy .
The governor this week reiterated that he will not accept the $6 .
billion in enhanced federal Medicaid matching rate ( FMAP ) funds approved earlier this month because it would prevent him from modifying the state 's Medicaid program as proposed in his executive budget .
Advertisement  " No , New York 's congressional delegation never fixed that bill , " he told reporters while leaving a Thursday news conference .
" They never fixed it .
They said they would , they never did .
"  But state budget officials have suggested New York will use " a portion of those FMAP dollars to otherwise change , or delay , or round out the edges " of proposed modifications to its Medicaid program while also seeking " a fix to legislation regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had planned to close his fiscal year 2021 budget shortfall , which had primarily been attributed to Medicaid spending , by adjusting the local share paid by New York City and counties and adopting recommendations put forth by the Medicaid Redesign Team II .
Without such Medicaid changes , Cuomo has said , New York can not pass the fiscal year 2021 budget due Tuesday .
He doubled down on that position Friday , telling WAMC 's Alan Chartock that New York wo n't be eligible for the funds with his assumed changes , which are not yet in effect and must first be approved by legislators .
" This state , not only did it take a beating in this bill , but the previous bill that had $6 billion for New York state allocated in Medicaid money , we do n't even qualify for because they put in a provision in the bill that you ca n't make any changes to your Medicaid program , " he said .
The federal package , which President Donald Trump signed into law on March 18 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York .
That amount included $5 .
billion for the state , $1 billion for New York City and $436 million for counties , according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer 's office .
The state Division of Budget , however , projects the enhanced FMAP rate would only amount to $3 .
billion annually , spokesperson Freeman Klopott said .
" I ca n't speak to their numbers , " he said when asked about the discrepancy .
Local officials have called on Cuomo to accept the enhanced FMAP dollars , noting that they can not pull down their share of the funding without the governor 's approval .
" The governor needs to weigh , is it in the state 's best interest to receive $6 .
billion versus what he was projecting to reform the Medicaid program about ? " Stephen Acquario , executive director of the New York State Association of Counties , told POLITICO .
" The MRT was slated to address $2 .
billion .
He has to make a policy decision : Is it in the best interest ? Or is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defer the MRT II until after the Covid-19 crisis is over with ? "  Robert Mujica , Cuomo 's budget director , told MRT members on March 19 that the state intended to use a portion of the enhanced federal Medicaid matching rate dollars it is set to receive under the congressional spending package to " soften the edges " and delay some of the panel 's recommendations that should not be implemented immediately because of the coronavirus outbreak .
" We 're going to use the FMAP dollars to soften the edges of these recommendations , delay the recommendations , but when we get to the other side of this , we want a Medicaid program that actually works , " Klopott said this week .
" And these recommendations help to inform how we move forward with the Medicaid program beyond the one-time revenues that we may be getting from the federal government .
"  The MRT II has proposed a redefined Medicaid global cap , a 60-month look-back period for home- and community-based care eligibility and increased across-the-board reductions , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
