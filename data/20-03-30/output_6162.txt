New coronavirus rules : Morrison limits gatherings to two , urges elderly to stay home  New rules will limit outdoor gatherings to just two people to stop the spread of COVID-19 while over 70s will be urged to remain inside " for their own protection " under the National Cabinet 's latest measures to combat the virus .
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the changes on Sunday night , confirming playgrounds , skate parks and outdoor gyms should be regarded as " closed for business " from midnight on Monday .
Mr Morrison stressed that parents can still take their kids outdoors for exercise but should not meet in groups with other families for catch-ups .
" The strong advice is do n't gather together in groups .
That 's the simple way of putting it .
Just do n't do it .
It 's not helpful , " he said .
" It actually creates the risk .
And when you 're going out for shopping , you should be going for just stuff you need and do it and get home .
It 's not a time for browsing .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons : ( A ) , shopping for what you need , food and other essential supplies that enable you to remain at home and to do that shopping as infrequently as possible ; ( B ) , for medical care or compassionate needs ; ( C ) , to exercise in compliance with the public gathering rules that I 've already outlined ; and ( D ) , for work and education if you can not work or learn remotely , " he said .
Retailers including supermarkets , pharmacies , Kmart , Target and Bunnings will remain open for " essentials " .
State and territory governments will , however , consider further restrictions in each jurisdiction to limit shopping to essential services .
Asked why you could visit shopping centres with potentially hundreds of people but only hold a gathering of no more than two people outside , Mr Morrison gave the example of his wife , Jenny , going to buy a jigsaw puzzle .
" What we 've said today is you should be only going out to shop for things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an irregular basis , " he said .
" I 'll give you an example .
Our kids are at home now , as are most kids , and Jenny went out yesterday and bought them a whole bunch of jigsaw puzzles .
I can assure you over the next few months , we 're going to consider those jigsaw puzzles absolutely essential .
" It 's important that parents and families and households can get the things that they need to completely change the way they 're going to live for the next six months at least .
And so what we 've done is sought to be practical about these issues .
" I mean , people are buying sporting equipment at the moment , gym mats and things like that so they can exercise at home .
These are things they 're going to need .
"  The Prime Minister said the limits on how many people could attend weddings ( 5 people ) and funerals ( 10 people ) were unchanged .
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy also revealed there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of Italy or Spain and that the measures put in place were having an impact .
The 3987 confirmed cases are " much less than some people might have predicted some time ago without mitigation " he said .
Scott Morrison and Brendan Murphy updated the public on the latest coronavirus measures from Parliament House in Canberra .

" We have one of the highest rates of testing per head of population in the world and one of the lowest positive test rates so we think , unlike countries unfortunately like Italy , Iran and even the US , that when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much , much larger outbreaks in the community that were undetected .
"  The Prime Minister said the advice for over 70s to stay indoors was a guide and not an edict .
" There is strong advice -- this is not a compulsion , this is strong advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and self isolate for their own protection to the maximum extent practicable , " he said .
" This does not mean that they can not go outside .
They can go outside and be accompanied by a support person for the purposes of getting some fresh air , some recreation .
But they should limit contact with others as much as possible .
These arrangements should also apply to those with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous persons over the age of 50 .
"  National Cabinet also agreed that states and territories will be moving to put a moratorium on evictions of small businesses as a result of financial distress .
" And so there will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements , " he said .
" We 're asking businesses to adapt to what is not a usual set of circumstances .
They must be sustainable because they will run for , we believe , at least six months and we want to be able to get everybody through .
So we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about commercial tenancies in the days ahead .
"  How the new rules will work  Australians will have to adapt to the new rules or they may face fines .

Further measures likely  National Cabinet discussed further restrictions on activities and venues .
