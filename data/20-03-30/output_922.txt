What are you looking at ? ' Virtual ' communication in the age of social distancing  IMAGE : For the study , researchers focused on three areas of interest , which they used for fixation analyses : full face ( purple ) , eyes ( red ) and mouth ( blue ) .

With this expansive use of mobile and video devices , now more than ever , it is important to understand how the use of these technologies may impact communication .
But are all forms of online communication alike ?  In a first-of-its-kind study , neuroscientists from Florida Atlantic University demonstrate that a person 's gaze is altered during tele-communication if they think that the person on the other end of the conversation can see them .
People are very sensitive to the gaze direction of others and even 2-day-old infants prefer faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The phenomenon known as " gaze cueing , " a powerful signal for orienting attention , is a mechanism that likely plays a role in the developmentally and socially important wonder of " shared " or " joint " attention where a number of people attend to the same object or location .
The ability to do this is what makes humans unique among primates .
Throughout almost all of human history , conversations were generally conducted face-to-face , so people knew where their conversational partner was looking and vice versa .
Now , with virtual communication , that assumption no longer holds - sometimes people communicate with both cameras on while other times only the speaker may be visible .
The researchers set out to determine whether being observed affects people 's behavior during online communication .

, a postdoctoral researcher at FAU , compared fixation behavior in 173 participants under two conditions : one in which the participants believed they were engaging in a real-time interaction and one in which they knew they were watching a pre-recorded video .
The researchers wanted to know if face fixation would increase in the real-time condition based on the social expectation of facing one 's speaker in order to get attention or if it would lead to greater face avoidance , based on social norms as well as the cognitive demands of encoding the conversation .
Similarly , they wanted to know where participants would fixate on the face .
Would it be the eyes more in the real-time condition because of social demands to make eye contact with one 's speaker ? Or , in the pre-recorded condition , where the social demands to make eye contact are eliminated , would participants spend more time looking at the mouth in order to encode the conversation , which is consistent with previous studies showing greater mouth fixations during an encoding task .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole face in the real-time condition and significantly less in the pre-recorded condition .
In the pre-recorded condition , time spent fixating on the mouth was significantly greater compared to the real-time condition .
There were no significant differences in time spent fixating on the eyes between the real-time and the pre-recorded conditions .
These findings may suggest that participants are more comfortable looking directly at the mouth of a speaker - which has previously been found to be optimal for encoding speech - when they think that no one is watching them .
To simulate a live interaction , the researchers convinced participants that they were engaging in a real-time , two-way video interaction ( it was actually pre-recorded ) where they could been seen and heard by the speaker , as well as a pre-recorded interaction where they knew the video was previously recorded and therefore the speaker could not see their behavior .
" Because gaze direction conveys so much socially relevant information , one 's own gaze behavior is likely to be affected by whether one 's eyes are visible to a speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may intend to signal that they are paying more attention to a speaker by fixating their face or eyes during a conversation .
Conversely , extended eye contact also can be perceived as aggressive and therefore noticing one 's eyes could lead to reduced direct fixation of another 's face or eyes .
Indeed , people engage in avoidant eye movements by periodically breaking and reforming eye contact during conversations .
"  There was a highly significant tendency for participants engaging in perceived real-time interaction to display greater avoidant fixation behavior , which supports the idea that social contexts draw fixations away from the face compared to when social context is not a factor .
When the face was fixated , attention was directed toward the mouth for the greater percentage of time in the pre-recorded condition versus the real-time condition .
The lack of difference in time spent fixating the eyes suggests that the additional mouth fixations in the pre-recorded condition did not come at the cost of reduced eye fixation and must have derived from reduced fixations elsewhere on the face .
Comparisons between total fixation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the real-time and pre-recorded conditions , with the eyes of both conditions being significantly more fixated than the mouth .
Gender , age , cultural background , and native language did not have an influence on fixation behavior across conditions .
" Regardless of the specific mechanisms underlying the observed differences in fixation patterns , results from our study suggest participants were taking social and attentional considerations into account in the real-time condition , " said Barenholtz .
" Given that encoding and memory have been found to be optimized by fixating the mouth , which was reduced overall in the real-time condition , this suggests that people do not fully optimize for speech encoding in a live interaction .
