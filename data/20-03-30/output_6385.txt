Media reacts to NCAA eligibility ruling due to coronavirus  The NCAA Division-I Council on Monday voted in favor of a blanket waiver for all spring-sport athletes to get an extra year of eligibility in light of seasons being significantly cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
Schools will be able to offer less or zero aid , or match what they provided this year per their own jurisdictions .
The decision comes less than three weeks after the NCAA canceled all winter and spring championships for the 2019-2020 academic year due to the new coronavirus .
Student-athletes who participated in winter sports had also been considered for extra eligibility since championships for those sports were canceled .
The NCAA , however , voted against including athletes in those sports in the provision since regular seasons for winter sports had been mostly if not entirely completed .
The Associated Press reported last week that support for extra eligibility in winter sports had been minimal , per a memo sent to college sports administrators from the NCAA that was obtained by the AP .
The NCAA 's decision earlier this month to cancel all championships generated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student-athletes in winter and spring sports alike that were robbed of competing for a national title .
The NCAA Men 's Basketball Tournament was not held for the first time in his 81-year history as a result of the decision .
While winter sports primarily dealt with championships cancellations , spring sport athletes saw heavy chunks of their respective regular seasons wiped away , with conferences across the country since making decisions to cancel athletic competitions through the end of the academic year as the virus continues to spread .
With that in mind , scroll down to see what the media had to say on Twitter about the NCAA 's decision .
Spring sports only  The decision only applies to spring sports , so winter sports such as men 's and women 's basketball were not included .
The NCAA voted against including athletes in those sports in the provision since regular seasons for winter sports had been mostly if not entirely completed .
The NCAA extends a waiver for an extra year of eligibility for spring sports but declines to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball players .
Bigger test lies ahead ?  While the NCAA received positive reviews for this decision , they could be faced with some more difficult decisions in the future should the coronavirus pandemic affect the upcoming college football season this fall .
Schools not required to honor scholarships  While seniors were given an extra year of eligibility , the NCAA ruling does not require schools to honor their scholarships .
Instead , schools will be able to offer less or zero aid , or match what they provided this year per their own jurisdictions .
This is what I expected .
The key will be what schools offer to seniors - and my guess is a lot of them will be asked to move along .

NCAA gets positive reviews  The NCAA has drawn plenty of criticism over past decisions , but that was n't the case here .
The decision to extend an extra year of eligibility to seniors in spring sports has generated mostly positive reviews .
NCAA handled the eligibility restoration issue surprisingly well .

Without this NCAA decision many of this years juniors would have faced a no-win situation--take a lowball offer to go pro or head back to school knowing they have no leverage as a sr .
next year .
Now they can go back to school and still have leverage in 2021 .
Ivy League dilemma  The NCAA decision may present a bit of a dilemma for one conference .
Under its current rules , the Ivy League does n't allow graduate students to compete , so that would would have to be amended in order for graduating seniors to compete in 2021 .
Worth noting : the Ivy League does not , by rule , allow for grad student-athletes .
If you graduate from an Ivy League institution , you can not compete .
So either a bunch of athletes will be withdrawing from school , transferring , or the league has to change its rule .
