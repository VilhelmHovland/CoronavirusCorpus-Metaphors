Apple Inc .
' s most important manufacturing partner posted net income of NT$47 .
billion ( $1 .
billion ) in the October-December period , based on calculations by Bloomberg News off information Hon Hai has submitted to the local stock exchange .
That 's down from NT$62 .
billion in the same quarter of 2018 .
Hon Hai , which gets half its revenue from making iPhones and other devices for Apple in China , grappled with rising U .
tariffs on its goods even before Covid-19 smothered demand for electronics .
Known also as Foxconn , the company has said it 's resolved labor shortages and is now back at normal seasonal capacity .
But it remains to be seen how it fared during the about-to-end March quarter , when the outbreak was declared a pandemic and government lockdowns dealt unprecedented shocks to the global supply chain .
Signs are that Apple 's Chinese-centric manufacturing -- of which Hon Hai is the linchpin -- is slowly getting back on track .
The next iPhones with 5G wireless capabilities remain on schedule to launch in the fall , partly because mass production is n't slated to begin until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the sort of assembly that Foxconn specializes in is but one part of Apple 's supply chain : the U .
company and its partners spend months or even years sourcing components around the world and any disruptions to that complex network could delay future devices .
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says  Hon Hai 's sales pressure from the global coronavirus spread , U .
trade dispute , smartphone-market weakness and a broader slowdown in tech spending wo n't abate quickly , even as its Chinese manufacturing gets back to full seasonal capacity .
The world 's largest electronics manufacturing-services provider is investing heavily in automation to reduce costs and improve asset efficiency .
Hon Hai has an opportunity to capitalize on the rise of industrial internet-of-things deployment and vehicle electrification , which will develop in the next 3-5 years and provide meaningful sales growth opportunities .

Foxconn has already slashed its 2020 revenue projections in the wake of the epidemic , while Apple withdrew its forecast for the current quarter .
The contagion has disrupted Apple 's carefully calibrated production chain and shaken up many other Chinese-based manufacturers .
Hon Hai was forced to postpone the reopening of its " iPhone City " mega-complex in the central city of Zhengzhou while it imposed strict quarantine measures on thousands of laborers .
But Foxconn has since sharply raised signing bonuses to attract the new workers it needs to assemble its products .
The Taiwanese company is now diversifying away from its main Chinese production base to mitigate the impact of disruptions .
It 's spending more than NT$17 billion building factories in India and Vietnam , responding to customers ' needs , Chief Financial Officer David Huang said at an earnings conference last year .
Those two countries will become regional manufacturing hubs , he added .
