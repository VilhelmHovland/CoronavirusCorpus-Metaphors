Reporting age- and gender-specific data of people who die of COVID-19 is unneeded , potentially prejudicial  The Plain Dealer/cleveland .
editorial board has called for reporting age- and gender-specific data of people who die of COVID-19 ( " County ca n't justify secrecy on age , gender in COVID-19 deaths , " March 27 ) .
This will happen soon enough ? when the numbers are high enough to report while still protecting the personal privacy of individuals and families .
It is irresponsible to call for public health officials to compromise privacy to satisfy curiosity .
We do n't need to know specific characteristics of those who died to know how to act .
We are all at risk , and need to act accordingly .
As a family doctor and public health physician , I deal every day with trade-offs between individual and community needs .
We need information on our collective risk and what we can do together and individually to reduce it .
Public health officials are giving us that vital information .
Age/gender data for the state and country are successfully informing local action .
It does n't help to chase for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they differ from the infected person next door .
And we certainly do n't need to foment prejudicial treatment of individuals based on public perception of their risk status .
We all are at risk for COVID-19 .
Let 's focus on what matters : staying safe and helping each other .
