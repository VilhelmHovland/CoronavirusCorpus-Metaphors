All Australian international travellers to be quarantined in hotels  Travel measures have been tightened to counter the coronavirus spread as Australia fights against both an economic and health crisis .
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said from midnight tomorrow , states and territories will be quarantining all arrivals through Australian airports in hotels and other accommodation facilities for the two weeks of their mandatory self-isolation .
" The ADF will be supporting those states and territories with compliance checks to ensure that people are at their residences , that they have sworn they would be at , to ensure we get compliance with the self-isolation , " he said .
" Again , if there is a situation where people are non-compliant , of course the enforcement authority is the state jurisdiction and the relevant law enforcement agency in that state .
But the ADF will be there to put boots on the ground , to support them in their enforcement efforts .
Mr Morrison said two-thirds of the nation 's 3000 cases are those who have returned home from overseas .
Australia has reported 13 deaths from the coronavirus .
He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs for returning travellers .
He said New South Wales would face the biggest strain as it has the highest number of arrivals .
Businesses impacted by coronavirus restrictions  As well as battling the health crisis Mr Morrison said the federal government planned to " hibernate " Australian businesses to help shoulder the economic blow resulting from COVID-19 measures .
He said a third stimulus package , to be announced in coming days , would contain measures to ensure businesses can re-open down the track , kick starting the economy .
" The thing about an economy is your society does depend on it and so do governments , " Mr Morrison said .
" We want these businesses to effectively go into a hibernation , which means on the other side , the employees come back , the opportunities come back , the economy comes back , " he said .
Many businesses have been forced to closed due to the coronavirus pandemic .

"  He said addressing the issue of Australians facing rental hardship as a result of COVID-19 is a " high priority " , but is an issue that will need to be handled by individual states .
" These things will always remain the province of the states under the Constitution , but there is a lot of work being done together to try to get a consistent approach when it comes to residential tenancies , " he said .
" Residential tenancies are different to commercial tenancies , there are different landlords , different issues in place .
" It is an issue that is a high priority .
"  Mr Morrison encouraged tenants to talk to their landlords , and landlords to talk to their banks .
Warns over lockdown talk  Mr Morrison also cautioned media outlets on their use of the word " lockdown " , saying Australians will be able to access essential supplies .
" When we talk about potential other restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cram supermarkets and do things like that , because of other restrictions that may become necessary , " he said .
" So , I would actually caution the media against using the word ' lockdown ' , because I think it does create unnecessary anxiety because that is not an arrangement that is actually being considered in the way that term might suggest .
"  The PM said the government is looking to keep every service open that they can .
He said there will be no national decision regarding school closures , with state and territory governments to handle local closures based on school calendars .
He said while school attendance is down by 20 per cent in NSW , it is " many times higher " in states like South Australia and Tasmania .
