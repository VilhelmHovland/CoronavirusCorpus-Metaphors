The US is now starting to see the value of immigrant health workers  Since it came to power , the Trump administration has waged a relentless , multi-layered war on immigration .
But it only took a few days of panic over the spread of the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes for the government to start seeing the value of at least some immigrant workers .
In an announcement published on March 26 , and promoted on its social media channels , the State Department called on foreign medical professionals who already have US visas to either move forward with their plans to come work in the country or , if they are already in the country , to extend their stay .
The announcement was aimed specifically at " those working to treat or mitigate the effects of COVID-19 .
" So-called " alien physicians " -- medical residents who are in the US on a J1 visa , which is meant for exchange programs -- were also encouraged to consult with their sponsors to try and extend their stays in the US .
The initial announcement , which was criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon their home countries to help the US , was subsequently clarified to note that it only applied to medical professionals who were already in the process of applying for a US visa .
The State Department plea came not long after it suspended all other routine visa services for the foreseeable future in reaction to the spread of coronavirus .
Under the Trump administration , long before the pandemic erupted , the US government has moved to limit immigration in myriad ways .
Many foreign medical professionals and other hospital workers have been snared in that crackdown , reducing essential staffing at US hospitals at a critical time .
The US had already been anticipating a possible shortage of physicians and medical professionals even before the current coronavirus emergency .
The Association of American Medical Colleges ( AAMC ) estimated that in a decade from now the US would likely face a shortage of about 105,000 physicians .
About a fourth of all US health care workers , and a third of doctors , are foreign born .
As the health care system begins to buckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reduced workforce due to the high percentage of health workers exposed to the virus , encouraging more foreign doctors and nurses to come to the US -- and lowering the legal barriers to practicing medicine as a foreign-trained physician -- might be necessary .
