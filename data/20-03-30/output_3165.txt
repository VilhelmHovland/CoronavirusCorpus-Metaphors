Warren Buffett : Here 's What Separates the Oracle of Omaha From the Average Investor  Warren Buffett is one of the best investors of our time and arguably the best teacher .
To say the man is quote worthy would be a vast understatement .
He 's outlined the principles that he sticks by , they 're timeless and can be applied in any market -- even a crashing one .
Buffett has made his fortune over the long term by investing in what he deems as " wonderful businesses " when they 're at " wonderful prices .
" What he 's not is a short-trader who 's jumping in and out of stocks because he has some sort of crystal ball that foresees what 's to happen with the economy .
He does n't know what the economy has in store next , nor does he know anyone who can .
Always have a " Plan B "  Nobody saw the pandemic coming .
The economy was the strongest it 's been in recent memory before the coronavirus sent it and the stock market crashing down .
What separated Buffett from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any curve balls Mr .
Market threw his way .
You see , Warren Buffett is humble enough to acknowledge that he and his team of market wizards at Berkshire Hathaway have their blind spots .
And unlike most folks on Wall Street , they 're not going to attempt to see what 's in those blind spots because it 's impossible unless you 're an actual Oracle .
As a result , Warren Buffett maintains a hefty emergency fund to be ready for those rainy days .
Your financial adviser probably told you repeatedly not to invest the money you intend on using over the short- to medium-term .
Many investors ignored the old-fashioned rules of Buffett and their advisors and got burned when the pandemic sent the markets into a tailspin .
Black swan events happen -- ask Warren Buffett !  Everything can be going swell , and the next thing you know , a black swan event could hit you from out of nowhere .
Warren Buffett referred to the coronavirus and the collapse in oil prices as a " one-two punch .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that few investors except in their investment careers , Buffett did n't look rattled in the slightest in his recent interview with Yahoo ! Finance .
Warren Buffett had a padded emergency fund -- probably a heck of a lot more than he wanted when the market was doing well .
He could n't find any pitches to swing at and his cash hoard swelled to record levels .
Despite his discontent with hoarding cash as the markets rallied higher , the man continued to exhibit patience .
Because he 's been through his fair share of crash-inducing surprises , and although it took him 89 years to invest through the coronavirus pandemic , he 's likely not treating this market meltdown any differently from any of the crashes he 's been through in his lengthy investment career .
He knows that every time is different .
There 's a different reason for every implosion , and while he 'd never " .
wish anyone ill , " he will be buying stocks when the opportunities arise .
And with the S&amp;P 500Composite Index and TSX Index @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oracle is feeling like a kid in a candy store with a full wallet .
Foolish takeaway  Warren Buffett does n't time the market .
He does n't get excited when stocks are rallying , and he 's not going to put his money to work in any positive paradigm shift .
He keeps ample cash on the sidelines because he knows that black swan events can happen at any time , derailing even the best economy in the world in an instant .
The pandemic hit and all of a sudden , those who were critical of Buffett 's record cash hoard are nowhere to be seen .
If you 're to be a successful investor over the long term , you 've got to recognize that it never makes sense not to have a Plan B when the markets take a tumble .
Sure , economists may give the green light on an economy or the market , but they ca n't foresee black swan events .
And it 's these shocks that one must always be prepared for , making a 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of a long-lived bull market .
Emulate Warren Buffett and have a plan for anything .
Do n't be like the average investor and invest every dime on the ride up .
