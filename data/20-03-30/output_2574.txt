A lot of people are going to learn to cook .
And a lot of people , when this is all done , will vow never to cook again .
The reason for both is the same .
In public school , we do n't teach students how to plan meals , shop , budget , and cook .
And , right now , those are essential skills .
So some of us are cracking open cookbooks and watching tutorials from chefs who have taken to Instagram teaching to pass the time .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time in their lives .
And , after three months of eating the same three dishes on rotation , they 'll swear off it forever .
At the moment , I am getting a lot of pleasure from cooking .
Partly because it marks the end of my workday , most of which is spent speaking to restaurateurs who have just laid off their entire staff .
Partly because I am with my daughter from 5 p .
to 7 p .
, and that means my wife is enjoying some much-deserved quiet time .
Our six-month old Puddin ' , if she 's in a good mood , is content to watch me as I narrate my way through dinner prep .
" Now I 'm chopping the garlic .
And now I 'm zesting the limes .
" It 's also time away from the onslaught of bad news .
But , mostly , I 'm enjoying cooking because the way we cook now is the way I love to cook .
Stay up to date !  Get Current Affairs &amp; Documentaries email updates in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're practising social distancing to mitigate the suffering of this pandemic , we 'll all need to leave the house as little as possible .
That means buying for the week , using what we have , and improvising .
It means resisting the urge to run out for cheese because we want nachos tonight .
We ca n't cancel plans for our famous three-bean chili because we have only two of the beans .
We need to figure out how to produce the most delicious meals from what we have .
When people ask what I most love to cook , I know they want to hear me list a regional cuisine .
But what gives me the most pleasure in the kitchen is to look at what we have and conjure something from it .
The catch is that it has to be good and nutritious and not too similar to what we ate yesterday .
In the Before Times , my wife used to text me from work to ask what was for dinner .
I rarely knew until late in the afternoon .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as the day before .
The view outside the window shifts from grey to yellow , but there 's little to differentiate activities .
So I understand the need to look forward to dinner -- to know that there 's going to be something new , something different , at the end of day .
I try to have an answer for her by 11 a .
That may seem like a random collection of dishes .
But there 's a method to it .
While cooking in restaurants , I had the principle of first in/first out drilled into my skull .
My wife thinks I 'm silly when I rotate stock in our fridge .
But , now more than ever , I need to make sure we are using the oldest or most perishable items first .
If we 're going to limit our trips to the grocery store , we have to make fresh vegetables last all week .
Our fridge is tiny , so we ca n't fit a week 's worth of lettuce and collards in it .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the hope that some part of it will be helpful to you .
Before this pandemic lockdown , we used to shop every few days .
The first lesson from a big grocery haul and not enough fridge space is that I can store root vegetables in my basement .
Most of the carrots , beets , and sweet potatoes we 're eating now were harvested and cellared last year .
They are fine in a cold corner of the basement ( or outside , in a sealed container ) for a week .
That 's the origin of Monday 's dinner .
I 'd cooked off the sweet potato and parsnip to start our baby on solids .
So I wanted to make it part of that night 's meal prep by eating some of it ourselves .
I know I should be stingier with the guanciale ( cured pork cheek ) , but it takes up so much room .
Spinach wilts fast .
Even if you blanch it -- as I did so that it would take up less space in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
So that went into Tuesday 's pasta , along with some pesto from the freezer .
Broccoli was next on the list of freshness .
Last summer , I smoked and froze a lot of meat ( to prep for parenthood ) .
The barbecue brisket was a natural fit with pan-crisped broccoli and lots of Szechuan chilies .
Brussels sprouts were next .
They go in the oven along with chicken wings , which you can get crispy without deep-frying .
Cabbage is about the heartiest vegetable there is .
That 's why I let it sit until the end of the week .
I used half for a Thai salad with lots of fish sauce , garlic , chili , and lime juice ( I removed the zest first and reserved it for later use ) .
I julienned the other half with carrots for a batch of pikliz ( Haitian spicy pickles ) .
Tomato sauce for pizza will come out of the freezer ; so will dough I purchased earlier this week ( my supermarket sells fresh dough for $1 .
For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheese and olives .
( Those 'll get added to the shopping list for the next day , when I 'll head out to get fresh produce .
)  As I 'm taking inventory for our groceries , I spot cauliflower at the back of the fridge .
I 'd washed and cut it into florets last week but failed to use it up .
And it 's not going to last .
So I saut ? some onion and garlic , then toss the cauliflower in with spices , chicken stock , and lentils .
It produces a couple of litres of soup that I label and freeze -- quick lunches ready for the coming week .
I hope that those of us who are cooking , and cooking now more than ever , will be able to savour the thin silver lining to this situation -- more time spent with our loved ones , off our phones , sharing food .
If dinner does n't turn out right tonight , there 's always tomorrow .
There is a lot of pressure on all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day .
So if your spouse does cook something that does n't quite fill the void left by the absence of everything you 're missing right now -- friends , restaurants , a sustainable income , functioning economy , alone time -- you still have to say , " Thanks , honey , for making dinner .
" And you have to at least offer to wash the dishes .
