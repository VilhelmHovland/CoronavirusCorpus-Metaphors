ERNAKULAM : The alcohol ban in Kerala seems to be killing more people than the virus itself in the state , which has one of India 's highest per capita liquor consumption .
The state , like the rest of India , has been forced to go dry in the wake of the ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown .
In the past week , seven people committed suicide out of depression over not being able to buy alcohol in Kerala , while the virus has resulted in one casualty so far .

Despite a popular backlash , Kerala held out for weeks without taking a decision , before finally shutting down bars and state-licensed beverage outlets last week .
When questioned , chief minister Pinarayi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create as a reason for not shutting not down bars .
His fears may have come true .
The state 's hospitals and frontline health and community workers -- already burdened by the coronavirus scare -- are overwhelmed by families approaching for help because of withdrawal symptoms of alcoholics , forcing the state to issue a set of guidelines to control the situation .
The guidelines have asked primary health centres to manage the bulk of the withdrawal symptoms , so that bigger medical colleges are not burdened with such cases .
The government has asked every district hospital to ready 10 to 20 beds for patients seeking de-addiction , according to Kiran PS , the nodal officer for the state 's mental health programme .
After the alcohol ban , the 14405 toll free number of Kerala 's Excise department 's de-addiction programme called ' Vimukthi ' is flooded with distress calls until , at times , as early as 4am .

Also , there is a spike in people trying to get drugs sometimes used to treat alcohol addiction or induce alcohol-like effects , said PV Tomy , Ernakulam district president of All Kerala Chemists and Druggists Association .
