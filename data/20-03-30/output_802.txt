A choir decided to go ahead with rehearsal .
Now dozens of members have COVID-19 and two are dead  Skagit Valley Chorale members Mark Backlund and his wife , Ruth Backlund , sing choir music Friday at their home in Anacortes , Wash .
, while convalescing from COVID-19 .
( Karen Ducey / For The Times )  With the coronavirus quickly spreading in Washington state in early March , leaders of the Skagit Valley Chorale debated whether to go ahead with weekly rehearsal .
The virus was already killing people in the Seattle area , about an hour 's drive to the south .
But Skagit County had n't reported any cases , schools and businesses remained open , and prohibitions on large gatherings had yet to be announced .
On March 6 , Adam Burdick , the choir 's conductor , informed the 121 members in an email that amid the " stress and strain of concerns about the virus , " practice would proceed as scheduled at Mount Vernon Presbyterian Church .
" I 'm planning on being there this Tuesday March 10 , and hoping many of you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Vernon Presbyterian Church in Mount Vernon , Wash .
( Karen Ducey / For The Times )  Sixty singers showed up .
A greeter offered hand sanitizer at the door , and members refrained from the usual hugs and handshakes .
" It seemed like a normal rehearsal , except that choirs are huggy places , " Burdick recalled .
" We were making music and trying to keep a certain distance between each other .
"  After 2 ? hours , the singers parted ways at 9 p .
Nearly three weeks later , 45 have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or ill with the symptoms , at least three have been hospitalized , and two are dead .
The outbreak has stunned county health officials , who have concluded that the virus was almost certainly transmitted through the air from one or more people without symptoms .
" That 's all we can think of right now , " said Polly Dubbel , a county communicable disease and environmental health manager .
In interviews with the Los Angeles Times , eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coughing or sneezing or appeared ill .
Everybody came with their own sheet music and avoided direct physical contact .
Some members helped set up or remove folding chairs .
A few helped themselves to mandarins that had been put out on a table in back .
Experts said the choir outbreak is consistent with a growing body of evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosols -- particles smaller than 5 micrometers that can float in the air for minutes or longer .
But a study published March 17 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that when the virus was suspended in a mist under laboratory conditions it remained " viable and infectious " for three hours -- though researchers have said that time period would probably be no more than a half-hour in real-world conditions .
One of the authors of that study , Jamie Lloyd-Smith , a UCLA infectious disease researcher , said it 's possible that the forceful breathing action of singing dispersed viral particles in the church room that were widely inhaled .
" One could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project more droplets and aerosols , " he said .
With three-quarters of the choir members testing positive for the virus or showing symptoms of infection , the outbreak would be considered a " super-spreading event , " he said .
Linsey Marr , an environmental engineer at Virginia Tech and an expert on airborne transmission of viruses , said some people happen to be especially good at exhaling fine material , producing 1,000 times more than others .
Marr said that the choir outbreak should be seen as a powerful warning to the public .
" This may help people realize that , hey , we really need to be careful , " she said .
***  The Skagit Valley Chorale draws its members from across northwest Washington and often sells out its winter and spring concerts at the 650-seat McIntyre Hall in Mount Vernon .
Amateur singers interested in choral music tend to be older , but the group includes some young adults .
Last year , Burdick worked some hip-hop into one number .
The next big performance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourist season , when the annual Skagit Valley Tulip Festival attracts more than a million people to view brilliant hues in meadows surrounding Mount Vernon .
The festival would soon be canceled , but nothing had been announced yet and the choir was continuing to prepare .
Carolynn Comstock and her husband , Jim Owen , carpooled to the March 10 practice from the nearby city of Anacortes with their friends Ruth and Mark Backlund .
Carolynn and Jim , who ran a home remodeling business together , had been singing with the choir for 15 years and thought of it as a centering force in their lives .
They had introduced the Backlunds to the choir .
Jim Owen and Carolynn Comstock , singers in the Skagit Valley Chorale , sit outside their home in Anacortes , Wash .
( Karen Ducey / For The Times )  The two couples entered the rented church hall -- roughly the size of a volleyball court -- and offered their hands for the disinfectant .
Cushioned metal chairs extended in six rows of 20 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center .
There were twice as many seats as people .
Comstock , a soprano , and Owen , a tenor , took their usual seats beside each other in the third row .
The rows toward the front and center filled up around them .
Burdick , 49 , stood facing his choir , with an accompanist to his right seated at a grand piano .
Given the anxiety over the coronavirus , the conductor decided to lead off with a piece called " Sing On .
"  The choir moved on to other numbers , including a popular spiritual piece written by gospel legend Thomas A .
Dorsey : " If we ever needed the Lord before , we sure do need Him now .
"  At one point the members broke into two groups , each standing around separate pianos to sing .
When it was time to leave , Burdick 's wife , Lorraine , a contralto who also sang professionally , refrained from her custom of embracing friends .
Instead , she curtsied her goodbyes .
***  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't help .
She took her temperature : 99 .
She and Owen canceled their plans for dinner that night at the Backlunds ' house .
At 9 p .
, she got a text from Ruth Backlund .
Ruth , 72 , and Mark , 73 , had fevers .
Burdick woke up the next day , March 14 , with a fever .
As his temperature rose to 103 , he began hearing from other choir singers .
They felt fatigued and achy .
Some had fevers , coughs and shortness of breath they had heard were telltale symptoms of COVID-19 .
Some had nausea and diarrhea .
On March 15 , Comstock , 62 , noticed something odd when she made pasta .
She could n't taste the sauce , a spicy Italian sausage .
She would soon learn that loss of taste and smell was a common symptom too .
When Owen , 66 , first felt sick that day , he found that his temperature was below normal , a symptom that continued .
The same day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their samples for coronavirus tests , which would come back four days later showing they both had COVID-19 .
On March 17 , a choir member alerted Skagit County Public Health about the outbreak .
Working from the choir 's membership roster , a dozen health officers scrambled for three days to contain the outbreak .
They called every member , determining who had attended the rehearsal .
They asked each person with symptoms to list their close contacts during the 24 hours before illness set in .
Then they called those people , telling anyone who felt sick to quarantine themselves .
" We think it was just a really super-unfortunate , high-risk occurrence , " said Dubbel , the county health official .
Mark Backlund felt himself slipping , but not as badly as a friend a decade younger , a runner , who was rushed to the hospital with pneumonia .
Both men would ultimately recover .
On March 18 , Burdick received a message from Nancy " Nicki " Hamilton , an 83-year-old soprano , known for her political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a fellow member .
Three days later , he received another call .
Hamilton had been rushed to the hospital soon after he had talked with her and now she was dead .
Word quickly spread among the choir members , many of them sick and left to grieve alone in their homes .
Health officials said all 28 choir members who were tested for COVID-19 were found to be infected .
The other 17 with symptoms never got tested , either because tests were not available or -- like Comstock and Owen -- the singers were under the impression that only people in dire condition were eligible .
The youngest of those sickened was 31 , but they averaged 67 , according to the health department .
In their split-level home , Burdick and his wife kept distance between themselves for a week .
But Lorraine got sick anyway .
The Burdicks had been heartened to hear that another woman in the hospital -- an alto in her 80s -- seemed to be getting better .
But this past Friday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And another woman , a tenor , had been rushed to the hospital .
Others felt the disease waning .
Fifteen days after the rehearsal , Comstock squirted shampoo into her hand and experienced an odd and pleasing sensation .
It smelled .
Like coconut .
***  Marr , the Virginia Tech researcher , said that the choir outbreak reminded her of a classic case study in the spread of infectious disease .
In 1977 , an Alaska Airlines flight returned to Homer , Alaska , after experiencing engine trouble and sat on the tarmac there for four hours with the ventilation system off .
Of the 49 passengers on board , 35 developed flu symptoms and five were hospitalized .
Researchers ultimately traced the outbreak to a woman who felt fine when she boarded but later became ill .
The case jolted epidemiologists into the realization that influenza could spread through the air .
Research has already shown that the coronavirus is nearly twice as contagious as influenza and far more deadly .
There is still much to learn about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus .
Dubbel , the county official , said she hoped that a study would be conducted someday to determine how the infection spread .
But for now , her team is swamped trying to contain additional outbreaks .
Marr said that researchers will have lots of questions for choir members .
Did the singers sit in customary seats , allowing them to recall their locations that evening and help reconstruct the layout of the room and its occupants ?  Might the 15 people who did not get sick have sat together ?  By Sunday , 99 people had tested positive in Skagit County .
It could be months before the choir meets again .
The Backlunds , though , have started singing again -- an alto and a bass together in their living room .
The couple , and Comstock and Owen , would like to know if they have antibodies against the virus , so it would be safe for them to deliver meals and find other ways to help as the infection spreads .
Comstock marveled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal random people doing things that they love to do , and all of a sudden some people are dead , " she said .
" It 's very sobering .
