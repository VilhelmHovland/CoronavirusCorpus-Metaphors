The man was killed while running home after police officials allegedly dispersed a group of people at a nearby tavern .
However , witnesses said he was chased all the way home and shot several times at close range .
The sister of the man , who can not be identified yet at the request of the family , told Eyewitness News of chaos , confusion , and numbness following the violent events which took place on their doorstep .
She said like many South Africans , she had heeded the call to stay indoors until she heard loud screams and cries from her three children who were all wounded in the shooting .
" One of the grandmothers pulled him into the house and by the time I pulled him into the veranda area , one of the officers had come into the yard as well .
And as I tried to shut the sliding door , he shot at him , " she said .
