The ship is docked just north of a temporary hospital constructed inside the cavernous Jacob K .
Javits Convention Center .
State and city officials are trying to increase hospital capacity by up to 87,000 beds to handle the outbreak .
" We bring a message to all New Yorkers ' " now , your Navy is returned and we are with you committed in this fight , ' ? said Rear Admiral John Mustin .
There are 9,500 people in New York currently hospitalized for COVID-19 , with more than 2,300 in intensive care .

' ? It 's incredibly insensitive to people right now who are giving their all , " he said .
