Beyond the Red Sea of COVID-19  From human perspective , it was a hard job for the Hebrews to cross the Red Sea .
But they had to cross it because there is a hope for them ; they must reach the Promised Land .
The miracle of God carried them to the other side when they believed ( Ex 14:13 , 14 ) .
The wilderness journey became a period of spiritual discipline for them with all spiritual legislations for the rest of their journey till this day .
The story continues beyond crossing the Red Sea .
The Apostle Paul asserted this when he said that ' he could do everything through Jesus Christ ' ( Phil 4:13 ) .
The lockdown days are like a discipline journey .
It is not a boring or tiring period .
A new positive story will begin from here in your life .
Apart from Covid-19 precautionary consciousness , new personal , family and future perspectives will stand out .
