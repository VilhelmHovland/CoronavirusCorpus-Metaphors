UPDATED : The International Olympics Committee will take a month to decide whether the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics can proceed as planned , given the global spread of coronavirus , a move that would potentially wreak havoc on the fortunes of hundreds of athletes , the media industry and the plans of many big-spending advertisers .
The IOC said Sunday that it will mull scenarios that " relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020 , and also for changes to the start date of the Games .
" Still , the group said that " a cancellation of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 would not solve any of the problems or help anybody .

"  The IOC and Abe announcements represent the first sign of recognition that the Games , a global spectacular , may be truly threatened by the contagion .

Then there are the logistics .
The IOC acknowledged Sunday that a postponement would raise any number of issues .
" A number of critical venues needed for the Games could potentially not be available anymore .
The situations with millions of nights already booked in hotels is extremely difficult to handle , and the international sports calendar for at least 33 Olympic sports would have to be adapted , " the group said " These are just a few of many , many more challenges .
"  Canada said Sunday night it would not send its athletes to take part in a Tokyo Olympics this summer .
