The directive on social distancing to stop the spread of coronavirus disease , and the subsequent drop in the consumption of alcohol , has proved that drinking has little to do with access .
On the contrary , the ban on social gatherings means beer consumers are hardly drinking even though their favourite brands are still available through cheaper outlets , including liquor stores and supermarkets .
In such outlets , the retail prices are often those recommended by the manufacturers , meaning that buyers would avoid the hefty margins loaded on the drinks ' prices in bars to cover for their entertainment and hospitality .
Bars were ordered closed in a March 22 directive that took effect immediately and with a near total compliance rate , with serious implications for brewers .
Naivasha-based Keroche Breweries has suspended the manufacturing of bottled beer while East African Breweries Ltd has shifted focus to the production of canned beverages .
" The brewery is open but due to the prevailing situation in the lockdown order on bars , there is no distribution being done , " said Keroche 's corporate affairs director John Nyongesa .
He added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is ugly .
"  The firm has sent home hundreds of workers and opted to retain only essential staff who can be deployed in the manufacturing of other products such as spirits .
Nothing captured the scale of the disruption better than the plunge of EABL 's shares on the Nairobi Securities Exchange , where the company was valued at Sh126 billion .
In just a week after the government announced that bars had to be shut , the brewer 's value had shrunk by a staggering Sh25 billion , as jittery investors took flight .
It might have been worse if EABL was not already a major producer and importer of wines and spirits , which can be easily accessed from liquor stores .
EABL Corporate Affairs Director Eric Kiniti said the brewer 's focus had moved to packaging its products in cans instead of bottles .
" Beer production has been severely affected .
The little that we manufacture is for sale in cans , with more focus on wines and spirits , " said Mr Kiniti .
He added that there were still huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brewer 's large network of distributors .
Senator Keg , EABL 's low-end but best selling beer in terms of volume , has been worst hit by the closure of bars .
The beer is delivered to outlets in barrels and dispensed to consumer in mugs and jugs .
With the lockdown , a few daring retailers are coming up with illegal ways to satisfy their clientele , including dispensing the drink as a takeaway from the safety of their homes .
Negligible sales But even with this underground retail market , Senator Keg sales are still negligible .
Separately , Nairobi Health Executive Hitan Majevdia yesterday warned that the county government would revoke the licenses of restaurants , bars and food eateries found flouting the directive to shut down their operations to curb the spread of Covid-19 .
This followed a public outcry that some establishments were disregarding the presidential directive to stop serving eat-in customers .
Mr Majevdia said he had received reports of eateries and pubs , especially in the estates , that were endangering the lives of residents by allowing them into their premises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public that they were out of business .
" Our health teams have been deployed and are keenly monitoring the establishments that do not comply with the presidential decree .
Those found culpable will be arrested for endangering the lives of others , " he said .
