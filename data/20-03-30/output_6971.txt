United Way 's COVID-19 Relief Fund Helping Central Minnesotans  ST .
CLOUD -- If you 're looking for a way to help our fellow central Minnesotans during the COVID-19 pandemic , the United Way of Central Minnesota has established a relief fund .
CEO Larry Olness says its been up and running for nearly two weeks already .
He says they established the fund to help people who need financial help quickly , oftentimes in 24 hours or less .
Olness says one area that they are offering help is to daycare providers .
If they are providing childcare that is over and above what they are doing , or if they have seen a loss of revenue because of folks staying at home , we want to make sure they continue the service or expand the service .
Olness says they are also helping our local food shelves as they see an increase in activity .
You can make a donation in one of three ways either online at unitedwayhelps .
, text " C19 " to 85511 , or you can mail a check to their offices at 921 1st Street N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
