Just the other day , in one of President Donald Trump 's daily briefings on the coronavirus , ABC News ' chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl tried to get clarity on an important point : Will everyone who needs a ventilator be able to get one ?  " Look , do n't be a cutie pie , " Trump said to Karl , before insisting that the administration 's response to the pandemic has been unprecedented .
Karl called it the " strangest moment I have ever experienced at a presidential news conference " -- as well as a " question that still needs to be answered .
"  The frequent sparring with the media , the attacks on individual reporters , the boasting about ratings should not even be all that surprising coming from Trump .
They are part and parcel of his presidency .
But given the gravity of the pandemic , they are still jarring to watch at the daily briefings .
Stretching sometimes to two hours , they are at once a show and also a national platform for the White House to deliver essential , even life-saving information to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president 's poll numbers have risen during the crisis , with majority approval for how he is handling it .
Related Story  Karl , who just published a book , Front Row at the Trump Show , said that the attacks on the media are troubling at this time in particular .
" It is troubling when information comes out from the top that is not reliable , and it 's also , by the way , I think troubling when the person with the biggest bully pulpit of all wages a sustained campaign to undermine the trust in information that comes through news media , which he has done for the entirety of his political career .
To make people believe that they ca n't trust what they see in a newspaper or in a television news report .
It 's dangerous .
This is a time when people need reliable information and need to believe reliable information .
"  He added : " Donald Trump famously in 2016 told Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes that he attacks the news media so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it .
I mean , the stakes are a lot higher now .
This is this is about whether or not you can make a decision about reopening a business , going back to work , going back to school .
We need to be able to , on one hand , trust the information that is coming from official sources , and to believe credible news reports .
And in a way , we see both of those getting undermined every single day .
"  Karl , who is also president of the White House Correspondents ' Association , spoke to Deadline about how reporters are approaching the briefings , worries about their own safety amid a coronavirus outbreak , and why Trump 's behavior actually is predictable .
DEADLINE : The White House beat during the Trump years has been especially chaotic .
But this crisis seems to have brought things to a new level .
JONATHAN KARL : It 's been an incredibly stressful time .
It 's been strange .
It 's unlike any story I 've ever covered .
It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one where we 're kind of at the heart of it too .
Although it 's much more extreme , it reminds me a little bit of being on Capitol Hill during the anthrax attacks in 2001 .
I was working for CNN at the time , and I was there when then Sen .
Tom Daschle , his office got hit with anthrax and whole place was worried about our own safety while we were also covering the story .
Here we are also simultaneously covering the story , and also , in my capacity as the president of the White House Correspondents Association , working to take steps to protect the health and well-being of the White House press corps and also to protect our ability to continue to cover this story .
DEADLINE : There are only 14 reporters in the briefing room because of social distancing .
But how is it in the media workspace in the West Wing ? Those are tight quarters as well .
KARL : Every news organization is sending radically fewer people to the White House on a day-to-day basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent out a guidance about two weeks ago urging reporters to work remotely if they all can , and to only come to the White House if absolutely necessary .
And working with my colleagues on the WHCA board we took a series of steps to reduce the number of people coming onto the White House grounds and into the briefing room .
Jonathan KarlABC News  And you 'll notice that there were like three distinct moments .
First was the television networks agreed that they would all share video .
And then we took a step to go to every other seat , which reduced the number of people sitting in the briefings from 48 or 49 seats down to about 25 or 26 .
And we also at that point said there would be no more standing in the aisles or standing in the back asking questions , which is tough because I believe that more coverage , better coverage and more reporters , more organizations represented is better , but we had to do something .
And then I had to put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues appears to have coronavirus .
And with that , we had to go to even more radically downsize , and that 's when we went to two people per row , so we would be in compliance with six-feet-apart spacing .
We 're not fully compliant with the recommendations of the CDC .
We should be no more than 10 people in a place .
Obviously .
there are more than 10 people in that room .
But we are much farther apart .
The other thing that we did is we worked with the General Services Administration , which kind of runs that space .
And they have agreed to do much more frequent and more thorough cleanings .
Those people at the GSA are really kind of heroic .
I see them there all the time .
Much of the country is working from home .
They 're not .
They 're there working really hard to keep that space clean .
DEADLINE : The note went out about the member who might have coronavirus .
Do you have any sense of how many people may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  KARL : Some news organizations took it upon themselves to self-isolate anybody who was working at the White House on the days that individual was at the White House .
And the CDC interviewed our colleague and also looked at photographs from those days and , based on that , figured out who this colleague was in direct extended contact with .
And then they reached out to each of those reporters and suggested to them very strongly that they should self-isolate and not come into the White House until April 2 unless than a negative test result comes back .
It has been amazing to see how , for the most part , my colleagues in the White House press corps have been , have had an attitude of , " What can we do for the greater good ? " Almost across the board .
The sharing of information -- that is where only a few people can be in a given place at one time .
And the way in which our colleagues have taken it really seriously when we recommend work remotely .
There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in any crowd .
When the people were told they have been in contact with the colleague who we suspect has coronavirus , most of those individuals immediately left the White House and are self-isolating .
I say most .
There are exceptions to all of this , which is frustrating and a little maddening , when an individual does n't take it as seriously as it should be taken .
But almost across the board , it 's been great to see White House reporters work on this as a team , even though we are intense competitors , as a team trying to protect our ability to cover the story , and also our own health .
DEADLINE : How different is that briefing now with just 14 people there ?  KARL : It is bizarre , it 's a little eerie , because that room , when a president is in it , is usually packed and raucous .
You know , it 's a small space , and that 's a big moment when a president comes into the briefing room .
And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escalated .
Go back and look at some of the briefings when they have a press secretary who did briefings .
Look at how crowded and raucous and loud and unruly those briefings would be .
Now , with just 14 people asking questions , it 's a very different atmosphere , a very different feel .
That said , almost everybody who is sitting in that briefing room is representing not just themselves but colleagues who are n't there .
And we 've come up with a system where our colleagues who are not in the briefing room on a given day can submit questions they would like to be asked .
So I think , actually , in terms of substance , there 's been an ability to get a wide range of questions asked , despite there not being a wide range of reporters .
DEADLINE : Is there a good case to be made for networks not carrying these briefings live , given concerns over misinformation .
KARL : I think there is a legitimate debate to be had over whether the briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision that needs to be made by individual news organizations .
I do think it 's incredibly important to cover the briefings , and that 's a different question whether or not they should be carried live .
There is real information that comes out of those briefings .
There 's also been , unfortunately , all too often misinformation has come out of those briefings .
And I think that is the reporter 's job to cover it and to correct the misinformation and to provide context .
Whether or not they should be carried live -- I do n't think there 's an overall answer to that .
I think each of the television networks has to make a decision .
I know what we 've done an ABC .
We will always carry them live if we feel there is news value , and there often is .
Let 's face it , this is a rapidly evolving story .
We will carry part of the briefing , and immediately go on with the experts to provide context and , if necessary corrections .
DEADLINE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , while reporters have regularly asked for daily briefings , now that they are being held , the networks are n't covering them .
Stefani **34;2456;TOOLONG  KARL : That tweet reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how things work .
Briefings have never been something that were regularly covered gavel to gavel .
They are on occasion .
And I would argue , this might be one of those occasions because it 's a big national crisis and the president himself is there .
But that is not how briefings work .
I mean , if you go back and you look , maybe it 's because this White House has n't done briefings for so long they 've kind of forgotten , but if you go back and you look at the way briefings have been covered .
For much of the existence of that briefing , they were n't they were n't televised at all .
And then , by and large , the only place they were regularly televised was C-SPAN and occasionally the cable networks might dip in .
Actually , in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , because these briefings are being covered live by many of the networks , including by ABC , including the cable networks .
The other broadcast networks are carrying much of these briefings live , which is why you hear people questioning whether or not we should be doing it .
But they are being covered .
Even if they 're not on live , they 're certainly being covered by every major news organization , they 're a big part of the lead story on this on this crisis every day .
DEADLINE : Do you think the White House would have been helped by having daily briefings before this crisis unfolded ?  KARL : I mean , it is not this exact question , but it goes back to what a briefing does and how it organizes government like the whole Mike McCurry argument McCurry was press secretary for President Bill Clinton .
I think they would have been well served , better served , if they had been in the habit of doing regular briefings .
There is something that a White House gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of what the stories are , how they 're perceived in the public , what kind of questions are being asked .
It forces you to rethink not just your answers for the purpose of communications but what underlies those answers .
So I think that the fact that this White House had literally gone a year without a briefing , a regular press secretary briefing , before this crisis hits may have been one reason why the communications , particularly in the beginning of this was less than perfect .
DEADLINE : Your book is called Front Row at the Trump Show .
Do you think that Trump sees these briefings as part of his show ?  KARL : Well , I think that President Trump sees his whole presidency in a way as a show .
He looks very carefully at how he is being portrayed in the news media , on television , in newspapers .
He tracks his ratings .
Virtually every day he asks Dan Scavino , who runs his social media accounts , how many followers he has on Instagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looks at the ratings of the shows he is on .
He counts the number of stories that are about him on the front pages of The New York Times and the Washington Post .
It 's a little bit like a playwright tracking the reviews after opening night .
He cares how he is perceived .
Every politician does .
But with Donald Trump it is to a whole other level .
DEADLINE : You said something -- that even though Trump 's behavior can be erratic , it is also predictable .
What did you mean by that ?  KARL : On one hand , Donald Trump is erratic .
He swings from one extreme to another .
He governs by gut .
He makes decisions on the fly .
All of that would appear to make him very unpredictable on any given day .
I first met him 26 years ago .
I 've covered him for a long time .
And I kind of have a sense of his rhythms , even some of his most unpredictable or seemingly unpredictable behaviors , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often I , you know , I feel like I know what he 's gon na do before he does it .
DEADLINE : For example , last week , when he called for reopening the country by Easter .
KARL : He 's had a few incredibly wide swings on this story , so in the beginning , there was the talk of how this would be over very soon .
Remember he famously said there 's 15 cases , and I think we 'll be down to zero very , very soon .
He said he was comparing this to the flu .
He seemed kind of dismissive about the dangers .
And then he made a very abrupt decision to do the Oval Office address and talked about how serious it was .
I think in a way those swings were somewhat predictable , because again he watched the way he is portrayed in the news media , and he was getting beat up pretty hard before that Oval Office address .
And I think he saw what was going on , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of it all : This is a big problem , and he 's just the guy to take it on .
And then , he 's watching as the country grinds to a halt , sees what 's happening in the markets .
He 's also I think frustrated about the fact that he has to remain cooped up in the White House , instead of going out doing his once or twice a week rallies .
And I did n't know that he would come out and say Easter would be the day .
It makes sense now in hindsight you know he loves something that 's symbolic and brandable .
But I think it was just a matter of time before he was going to rebel against these strict recommendations .
And on Sunday , Trump abandoned the Easter date and said that the White House social distancing guidelines would be extended to April 30 .
DEADLINE : Is he different one-on-one ?  KARL : He 's remarkably similar one-on-one .
There are a few more profanities when he 's in private .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him -- unless he 's angry and upset , and I 've seen him like that .
Often when you 're with him , he wants you to feel good .
And so he 'll praise you , praise you to the people around you .
I mean , I ca n't tell you how many times I 've met with him where he has introduced me to people as " the great Jonathan Karl .
" He wants to make you feel big because you 're there .
He can be very engaging and try to really charm you .
He can also turn on you in private just like he does public .
But one thing that 's also , I think , notable about Donald Trump is that he -- that maybe you do n't see as much in public -- is he does ask people their views .
He wants to know what people think .
Not just the experts , anybody .
He 's asked me stuff .
I have seen him ask others .
He does seem like he 's trying to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
