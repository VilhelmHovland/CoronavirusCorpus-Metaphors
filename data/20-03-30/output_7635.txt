Makeover Monday : Clean and sanitize your makeup and brushes  ( Mass Appeal ) -- Why not use this time at home productively to spring clean your makeup and brushes ! Leandra Rivera of Studio L Makeup , Brow and Lash Lounge joined us for a demonstration .
Rivera advises that you use a tea tree foam or isopropyl alcohol to clean your makeup and brushes .
Using a bowl of warm water , gently massage the brushes with the foam and rinse until the water is clear .
Spritz the brushes with alcohol after washing them and stand them up to dry .
Rivera mentioned not to forget to clean your beauty blender , which can harbor a lot of bacteria .
Again , use foam , rinse until water is clear and spritz with alcohol .
