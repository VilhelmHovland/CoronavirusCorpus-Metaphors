Within days of the COVID-19 outbreak , hundreds of pets in Mumbai became strays .
People started abandoning their loved dogs and cats on the streets when nobody was watching .
Why ? Because the World Health Organisation , WHO , the international agency which is spearheading the fight against the pandemic put out on its India website warnings like : Keep Away From Pets and Keep Away From Wild and Farm Animals .
Promptly , around 17 civic bodies in Mumbai started making announcements and putting up hoarding and pamphlets , with images of dogs , cats , chicken and bats .
There were around 167 hoardings at railway stations , buses , vans , taxis and government offices across Mumbai .
Anand Siva , animal activist , environmentalist and former co-opted member to the Animal Welfare Board of Inida says : " This was ridiculous , wrong and very irresponsible of WHO especially since just a few days prior to this they had categorically put out a message that there was no reason to believe pets could be carriers .
I spent a few hours frantically calling their Delhi numbers , sending emails to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out to vets across the country and unanimously they all confirmed there was absolutely no truth in that .
Sadly , WHO failed to respond or act , and did n't pull down the message .
"  Why did WHO put out the hoardings warning against pets when there has been no case anywhere in the world of domesticated animals contracting or spreading the COVID-19 infection ? Was it the organisation 's India branch which was responsible for spreading such panic among pet owners , as no such notice was there on the WHO international site ? Outlook has sent out a detailed questionnaire to the WHO and is awaiting its response .
Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope came out and allayed fears about pets spreading the disease .
But the damage had already been done .
Says Leena Tandon , writer , director and co-founder of House of Paws : " In Mumbai we already have a count of more than 100 pets abandoned due to the fear of getting infected by them .
Everyone is trying to do whatever one can in the limited capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many paid/free fosters also occupied where does one take them .
"  Vijay Kishore Mohani , founder of Bombay Animal Rights Association ( BAR ) says , " We have data of approximately 130 plus abandoned pet animals though the real figure would be much larger than one can imagine .
Out of which 40 percent are expensive breed dogs .
" Adds Deepa Talib of The Anubis -Tiger Foundation , " We are scrambling to rescue and safeguard as many as they can before they fall prey to accidents , maggot wounds , disease and a grizzly sad death .
All because their owners did n't care about their well-being .
"  Laila , a golden retriever was rescued along with a Rottweiler from a politician 's bungalow , both left to die , tied in the scorching heat outside to the main gate of his house , with no water , no food , cigarette bud marks all over her body .
Both the dogs were adopted by a family .
The silver lining is how so many families came forward to give shelter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
