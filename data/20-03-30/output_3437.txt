Katie Taylor wants this extra time to make the difference in her super-fight with Amanda Serrano .
The eagerly-awaited fight has been moved from May 2 to July 4 at the Manchester Arena after the British Boxing Board of Control ruled that there will be no pro bouts in the UK in May .
The contest between Taylor - the undisputed lightweight world champion - and former seven-weight champ Serrano was officially on the undercard of the Matchroom Boxing card headlined by Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin 's interim WBC World Heavyweight title fight .
However , given their standing as the best fighters in the women 's game , there was massive interest in the Taylor-Serrano showdown .
Undeterred , she 's determined to utilise the extra two months to be as ready as she can be to take on her Puerto Rican rival .
" I 've obviously been over here ( at her Connecticut base ) for the last few months , training for May 2nd , " said Taylor .
" But this is a time for me just to work on a few things now and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the gas .
" I think it 's going to pay off for the fighters who are disciplined right now .
" I 'm just working on a few things now and these are the times that actually make a difference .
" You can turn it into a positive and when the boxing world does come back , I 'm gon na be one of the fired up fighters and am going to be ready for whenever that fight date is .
"  The former Olympic champ gave her reaction in a live Instagram chat with promoter Eddie Hearn .
Taylor said she pays no heed to Serrano 's verbal shots .
" I go into every single fight with the same mindset , nothing has changed there , " she said .
" I want to produce the best performance I possibly can .
" She obviously does an awful lot of talking and it 's the same coming up to this fight , but I do n't get involved in anything like that , I just concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two days before the fight , added : " Literally this is the best fighting the best .
" It 's the one everyone wants to see , so it 's very exciting - not just for women 's boxing , but for boxing as a whole .
" It 's a dangerous fight for both of us - but it 's also a career changing fight for us .
" It 's going to be absolutely huge - whoever wins is going to be cemented as the number one pound for pound in women 's boxing .
"  As for training in isolation , it is something that the Bray woman has done for as long as she can remember .
" I feel like my whole life has been in quarantine , " laughed Taylor , who is unbeaten in 15 pro fights .
" I said to my family , ' You realise you 're in isolation so much that when you have to go into quarantine and nothing has changed in your personal life ! ' .
