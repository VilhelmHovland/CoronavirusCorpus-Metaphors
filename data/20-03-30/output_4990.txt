No social distancing seen in areas of Delhi  New Delhi : The residents of areas close to Jama Masjid were on Sunday were seen shopping for essentials without maintaining social distancing although most of them were wearing masks .
" People are only going out to purchase essentials ; the police are patrolling the area continuously .
No one is going out to just roam around for fun , " said Chand , a resident .
" The Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid also makes announcements regularly requesting people to not venture out of their house , " he added .
Social distancing is one of the measures through which people can avoid contracting the virus .
The country is under a 21-day lockdown which has been imposed to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus .
And the citizens have been asked to only venture out of their houses to get essentials .
Meanwhile , the total confirmed coronavirus cases in India rose to 979 , including 48 foreigners , according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Sunday .
The number of deaths due to the infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Those from the northeast , however , are n't really surprised .
Ask Bune Lemai , the general secretary of the Poumai Naga Tsiidoumais Me Delhi ( a Manipuri students association ) , who is pursuing her Master 's from Miranda House .
Lemai explained that it was extremely disheartening to see one of her " northeast sisters " being treated poorly but the reality is that it is n't the first time that such an incident has taken place .
" The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced people 's hidden prejudices and highlighted their latent racism .
The reality is that this incident could have happened to anyone , " she said .
Ngurang Reena , a human rights activist who also started an informal forum called North-East Unites for Justice and Peace , told ThePrint , " It 's neither new nor shocking .
This is a manifestation of how broken our society is .
Such incidents strip the morale of a person and their dignity .
"  Chun Gonmei , a Master 's student at Delhi University , said she had lost count of the number of times people had called her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her .
Past instances  While the targeted attacks and racial profiling are suddenly in focus again , for many it 's just daily reality , one that does not change even if the news cycle does .
Professor M .
Ramananda Singh , who is a chemistry professor at Kirori Mal College in Delhi University and president of the North East Teachers Association , said , " Terms such as chinky , momo , Chinese , Japanese , have been going around since I was a student and I was also called that .
"  He , however , underscored the impact such name calling had on people .
" It impacts their morale and confidence .
We are in the middle of a pandemic but so many students from the northeast are more worried about their safety and not the pandemic , " he said .
" The same goes for their parents .
"  Saikhom Chingkhei , president of the Manipur Students Association-Delhi , echoed the sentiment .
" The other day , a small boy in my neighbourhood called me ' corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but laugh .
"  While Saikhom managed to laugh , Reena , who first came to Delhi in 2009 , was ready to pack her bags and head back to her hometown in Arunachal Pradesh .
" I was molested by six men at Chandni Chowk in 2009 when I first came to Delhi .
I was all set to go back home when my father explained to me that if I left I would be letting evil triumph , " she said .
Since then , the activist has faced many instances of racial profiling , but the one that sticks in her memory is when she was refused stay at a Jaipur hotel she had booked online because she did n't have her passport and the manager was not convinced she was Indian .
She tried to convince him but it was in vain and she had to leave the hotel and stay somewhere else , despite paying for her stay .
In another incident , during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests , Chun said someone came up to her and asked whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of staying calm and ignoring such comments is on me because if I counter them then the situation can get ugly , " she said .
Crisis of identity  The common thread in all such instances among the affected is a crisis of identity .
Professor Ramananda explained , " I proudly say I 'm an Indian but if people do n't recognise or accept it , then I will question how much I need to assert it .
"  " I find it very disturbing that I need to constantly assert my identity time and again , " Reena said .
" I struggle when I question why I need to constantly prove my Indianness .
I never thought my different identities would constantly conflict with each other .
"  For Bune Lemai , it 's not so much about identity but respect .
She narrated an incident about a junior of hers , also from the northeast , who studies at Ambedkar University .
The junior got into an e-rickshaw on the way to class and found that nobody was willing to sit beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seated itself here ' , " Lemai said .
The exact same incident happened to Chun as well .
On her way to Kamala Nagar after filling her exam form , she said she had to wait for 15-20 minutes for somebody to share a rickshaw with her .
" They would walk towards the rickshaw , see me and then walk away .
One lady came and sat but when she saw me , got up and got into another rickshaw which was almost full , " she said .
Support  Alana Golmei started the North East Support Centre Helpline in 2007 with the help of four to five people .
" We would get calls regarding discrimination in getting accommodation , at the workplace and malls .
And then we would intervene , " he said .
This took several forms : Providing trauma counselling , registering an FIR , following up with police , or even providing legal assistance .
However , after the creation of the Delhi Police Special Police Unit for North East Region in 2014 , Golmei now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continues to follow up on legal assistance for cases .
Professor Ramananda said he helped students by approaching law enforcement agencies such as SPUNER .
He even wrote a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on 25 March to highlight " racial attacks against North-East people in many parts of India " .
" I tell everyone not to be silent and speak out .
Because it is only when we raise our voice will the people in power hear us , " Lemai said .
Reena 's informal support initiative , North-East Unites for Justice and Peace , which also has a WhatsApp group , helps people , and gives them guidance and moral support too .
" It 's funny sometimes , because I feel I am doing all this when I am the one who needs help , " she said .
4 COMMENTS  People who look like Chinese , and the real Chinese people , will face discrimination for many many years to come because of this pandemic .
This is true not only in India , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this virus which may or may not be true .
Indians will be warm towards others as long as they do n't view them as a prejudiced threat .
The moment they think it 's a threat and mind you , all for the wrong reasons , like a Muslim , NE Indian , Dalit , JNU , then all the hate and vile comes out and makes them look petty and very and medieval minded .
Not only racism , North Easterners had to even face violence from Muslims in India , during the Rohingya crisis .
Many North Easterners had to leave cities like Bengaluru because local governments failed to protect them from the terror of Muslims .
Nonsense attitude , this need to be corrected through awareness but people of these states also needs to understand and look at how they themselves treat non-locals in their state .
Recent example of attacks in Meghalaya shows that .
