Photo : Nicole Album  What it 's like to go on a video chat first date in SF during a pandemic  1 / 20  Back to Gallery  Halfway through my first date since the coronavirus shelter-in-place ordinance , my dog started humping a blanket laying on my floor .
I picked up my laptop and turned the webcam towards Peanut , a spayed female shih tzu who looked at me wild-eyed , then stopped out of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we 'll call Amy , laughed over our Google Hangout , her image blurring briefly due to a poor internet connection .
Everyone has to make lifestyle adjustments due to the pandemic , and single people are no different .
The harsh reality is that if you 're single right now , you 're going to be single for a while .
Social distancing makes in-person dates nearly impossible , but dating app usage is actually up .
On Tinder , daily messages increased 10-15% week-to-week in mid-March .
Bumble reports that since March 12 , messaging and videos chats are both up over 20% in San Francisco .
Even Seeking .
, a self-described " sugar dating site , " has seen member sign ups increase 74% over the same time period last year .
Bay Area dating coach Jessica Engle did n't sound surprised to hear about the increased activity .
In a quick telephone interview , she cites research that says when potential partners meet in a dangerous situation it increases the chance they will fall in love .
" It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are feeling more vulnerable and are able to open up more and bond over shared difficulties , " she says .
Online dating is different for everyone , which makes sweeping generalizations difficult .
Personally , I 've used dating apps for a few years with results that ranged from mixed to horrendous .
As the coronavirus became a reality here in early March , I started polling women on Tinder , Hinge and Bumble about how the pandemic affects their dating , from the safety of my couch in the Mission .
Those who responded ( about half ) already had their guards up before the shelter-in-place order .
First dates , in person , seemed out of the question .
One woman said that multiple men made racist comments about her profile description ( " All I ask is that you tell me I 'm pretty and feed me soup dumplings " ) .
Several equated COVID-19 to an STD , in that contracting it may have a lasting stigma .
As the pandemic spread and in-person dates became potential misdemeanors , women started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have wanted to hear in the same sentence .
But most of the women I messaged with seemed bored enough to try it , and after several ghostings , two graciously agreed to be subjects for this story .
To optimize my video dates , I received a few tips from Wayne Elise , contributing author of pick-up artist tome " The Game " and creative director at Charisma Arts .
Smile a lot to overcompensate for lack of human touch ( I can do this ) .
Wear blue or purple because it looks better on camera ( check ) .
Create a backdrop wall with your toilet paper hoard ( negative , unfortunately I can not spare a square ) .
Minutes before my first very meta video date , I was still finishing a dish of quarantine pasta .
I messaged let's-call-her-Jade to push back the date 15 minutes , giving the standard fake excuse of bad traffic ( with a winky emoji ) .
In three minutes flat , I brushed my teeth , threw on a non-wrinkled t-shirt and set my laptop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the background .
" Speaking of books , " Elise tells me via email , " use some under your laptop to get your camera above your eye level .
This will prevent Godzilla video where you look like you 're a hundred feet tall coming to crush their town .
Getting your eye level under someone 's gaze is one of my oft-used tricks I use in real life .
It makes the other person feel relatively more empowered and helps get them talking .
"  We both logged into a Google Hangouts link and I immediately discovered Elise was right about the Godzilla gaze .
I adjusted my laptop and offered Jade some wine , which scored a polite laugh .
Then I tried to pour myself a glass from a half-full bottle .
unsuccessfully .
Just below sight of the camera , I awkwardly wrestled with the cork while carrying on a conversation about , what else , grocery shopping .
One of the unexpected positive consequences of the coronavirus is that for the first time in history , a first date did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every first date seemed irrelevant .
Instead of talking about routines , we explained how they 've been disrupted .
Everyone 's life is fundamentally different than it was two weeks ago , which makes it more interesting to both hear and talk about , especially with a stranger .
Where you suggest to go on a date says a lot about you , but not nearly as much as what type of couch you own ( Jade 's looked like IKEA , Amy 's West Elm ) .
It 's rare to see inside someone 's personal space so early in a relationship , which added another intimacy jump start .
My first date spun her computer around on her coffee table to show a view of the Presidio through her window .
Later she reached off screen to grab a vinyl record she referenced , adding an element of show and tell .
The second date walked her computer into her Pacific Heights kitchen to pour a glass of wine ( more adeptly than I had ) , giving a tour of her whole living space .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an insight into their lives , video chat made it harder to tell if I found them attractive ( and probably did n't do me any favors either ) .
People look different in photos than in real life , and it 's same with video .
When I explained this to dating coach Jessica Engle , she saw it as a return to a shift away from hook-up culture and towards more traditional courtship .
" You ca n't rely on physical connections at all , so you 're going to be challenged to really build an emotional connection without the pheromones and potential chemistry and physical closeness .
In the long run , that might help people build more quality connections , " she says .
The main advantage of video chat dating was immediately clear : efficiency .
I can typically tell within 30 seconds of meeting a Tinder date if I 'd like to talk to them for more than a minute , but by then it 's too late .
Transportation to a bar plus two cocktails equals three lost hours ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates lasted about an hour , and I did n't spend a dime ( apologies to my roommate for finishing his wine ) .
At the end of our conversation , Amy made the interesting observation that she did n't feel like we had really met yet .
I felt the same way , that there was something uncanny about interacting with a two-dimensional version of her , so many things were missing .
It did n't really feel like a date to me .
But Peanut somehow understood what was going on .
My little shih tzu loves me very much and is quite protective of my affection , which is to say , the first time a woman visits my house Peanut will " assert dominance " by thrusting all nine pounds of her body weight against my date 's leg .
My dog almost never humps anything in other contexts .
How she felt the call to be an anti-wingwoman is beyond me .
Overall the experiences were n't nearly as awkward as I 'd expected .
Initially I worried about the self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes I stopped noticing myself .
I enjoyed both dates , but did n't feel that strong spark with either woman , which seemed mutual .
About an hour into my second date of the night , our conversation/internet connection lulled .
Amy remarked that maybe it 's time to end the date , as she noticed me yawning a few times ( Note : I do not remember yawning ) .
We talked for another minute or two , beginning what 's typically the most awkward part of any first date : the goodbye .
We hit all the normal pleasantries , she said she 'd be open to seeing me again ( likely out of boredom or loneliness ) .
But what was most interesting is that in this last minute of conversation , we both moved a little closer to our screens and began the type of meaningless talk that serves solely to build momentum for a kiss .
Then we both leaned in and kissed our laptop screens .
Just kidding ! We did not kiss our dusty laptop screens , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said goodbye and closed the chat , but it did feel like a moment of real intimacy , a chance to feel closer than six feet away from a stranger , even if they were a mile away .
