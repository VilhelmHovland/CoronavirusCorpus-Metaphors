A Letter From The Front Lines of the Coronavirus  The following is a text from Dr .
Alissa Baker .
Baker is a Hematological Pediatric Oncologist in NYC , Her work in the fight against childhood cancer has been recognized by companies like Hyundai  A few days ago she provided a brief description of what they are facing , in a text a received just a couple days ago .
She writes :  Your text made me smile so thank you I 'm ok , I 'm on service this week since I took over for a colleague with severe asthma &amp; it 's been emotional .
At peak I had 5 covid19+ kids .
One is one of our sarcoma kids who had metastatic disease &amp; was slowly dying but now he 's intubated from covid19 &amp; rapidly dying .
NYC is a mess , I finally have my two N95 masks but had to see my first + kid without one .
My hospital is better off than most here but we 're on a trajectory to run out of ventilators on Monday &amp; today we 're having a meeting about being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's hospital is being consolidated to three floors to make room for adult , our ED got converted to additional adult ED space &amp; our ICU is taking up to age 30 now .
I wish I could see the end in sight but not so far ; I know it has to be there so I 'm trying to focus on the positives .
I 've been taking my team for coffee &amp; breakfast every morning to try to keep the residents morale up .
But honestly , I cry every night when I get home .
Hoping to learn a new skill with some meditation soon : P .
One of the hard parts about this for me is that Alissa is family ( picture above was our visit to the Salt Mines ) and I ca n't be there to comfort her with a hug , tell her she 's amazing and that she can do this and it will soon pass .
She comes every year for Thanksgiving and that hug will be waiting for but for now , on Day 1 of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go out , if it 's not truly essential for you to be around people , stay home .
I will save lives , maybe even the life of someone you know .
