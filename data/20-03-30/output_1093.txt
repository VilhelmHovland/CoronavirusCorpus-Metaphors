Follow the author of this article  Follow the topics within this article  I was delighted when the Government performed its dramatic U-turn a few weeks ago and moved away from a herd immunity strategy to outright prevention of the rapid spread of Covid-19 .
To have allowed 500,000 people to die while watching the NHS being overwhelmed would have been immoral .
But is this new plan being enforced too drastically ? We have stringent rules affecting the most basic routines of daily life and a police force with full discretionary powers .
Are the Government and police trying to prevent the spread of coronavirus or put the nation under house arrest ?  Over the past two weeks I have been particularly careful about human contact .
As a smoker of over 40 years ' standing , I know I am at risk of contracting pneumonia .
The concept of social distancing at this time makes perfect sense to me and I will do my utmost to adhere to it for everybody 's sake .
I will not , however , live under home detention and be told -- regardless of whether I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave my property only once per day .
During my LBC show on Sunday I mentioned that I had been out walking eight times in the previous five days .
According to some on social media , it was as though I were a suicide bomber .
I am fortunate to live in a rural area with a low population .
During this crisis , few cars drive through it .
The footpaths through the woods and fields are devoid of people , though I do see many lycra-clad cyclists going along the country lanes .
Yet if I lived in urban Sheffield and chose to drive a few miles to the Peak District to walk my dog -- at a safe distance from others , of course -- what would be wrong with that ? The answer , according to some police forces , is a lot .
It is clear that the emergency regulations which came into force a few days ago have gone to some people 's heads .
The use of drones to target dog walkers and people strolling along beaches in Cornwall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been set up encouraging people to tell on their neighbours if they leave the house more than once a day .
This is madness .
It is un-British and the public will turn against the authorities if this trend continues .
Apart from anything else , there is a huge irony at the heart of this situation .
As officers from Derbyshire Constabulary put black dye into the Blue Lagoon beauty spot to dissuade visitors from flocking there , planes from New York , Italy and China were landing at major UK airports .
Every day thousands of people continue to come here from overseas .
They do not have their temperature taken on arrival , let alone any effort being made to see if they might have Covid-19 .
They get onto public transport .
No quarantine is required .
They are simply advised to stay at home for the ensuing 14 days .
Why are British citizens being treated with contempt by elements of our police force when the Government allows the potential daily importation of this disease ?  I have always felt that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it .
It does feel like this is happening .
Consider the case of Labour MP Stephen Kinnock .
He visited his father on his 78th birthday and sat a safe distance away from him .
This was hardly irresponsible .
Yet he earned a public reprimand from South Wales Police on the basis his actions did not constitute essential travel .
When you have a Government that has failed on its testing regime ; has not managed to supply enough protective equipment to NHS staff ; and at the same time has allowed the airports to remain as busy as ever , I would suggest that it needs to examine its priorities .
Citizens must be able to exercise common sense .
Some in Government seem to be enjoying their new authority , incidentally .
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove gave the impression of a man who positively relished announcing that new daily limits of 30 minutes for a jog and 60 minutes for a walk may be introduced .
Doubtless his neighbours will have their stopwatches ready .
I will continue being careful and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect statements such as Mr Gove 's , which risk losing all perspective and could even be counter-productive .
If the authorities carry on down this road , mass civil disobedience could follow and the virus might even spread more widely as a result .
In a national emergency , everyone wants to do their bit , but it is a two-way street .
The Government must respect the people if the people are to respect the Government .
