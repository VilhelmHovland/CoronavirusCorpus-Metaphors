Selectors need to decide if drafting MS Dhoni into the side will be fair , opines Irfan Pathan  Irfan Pathan feels that MS Dhoni must continue playing for India , but stated that it was up to the selectors to decide whether it will be fair to do so , taking into consideration the other players .
Pathan added that sporting events should n't be prioritised over health , in these dire times .
As the fate of the 13th season of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) gets pushed into darkness by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , speculations around former India skipper MS Dhoni 's future in the national side have risen again .
The postponed season of the cash-rich league was supposed to be Dhoni 's springboard to propel him back into the national side in time for the T20 World Cup .
While many experts have given their opinion , former all-rounder Irfan Pathan seems to differ by some margin as he feels that Dhoni must go on to don the Indian jersey again .
But the left-arm quick , hailing from Baroda , also added that its the board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fair on the incumbents .
" He obviously needs to play .
If he does , he should for India .
He is the most amazing cricketer we have .
He has been fantastic for the country .
He has given so much to the world of cricket .
But if he is just drafted in , will it be fair for those who have been playing regularly is an important question .
KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant have been playing consistently for a year .
So , this question needs to be answered by the board , " ? Pathan told New Indian Express .
The widespread COVID 19 outbreaks around the world has claimed more than 30,000 lives by now and has put a big question mark on the fate of the T20 World Cup scheduled in Australia later this year .
Pathan opined that ICC must be watchful of the situation around the world and should put public health first , while taking a call about the gala event .
" It is very important that all governments take proper measures .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than life .
Like the postponement of IPL , everyone should consider the situation every month .
Be it ICC or any national board , all organisations need to see the situation in Australia ( for the T20 World Cup ) every three , four weeks and then take a decision .
If something has to be deferred or cancelled , so be it .
You can not do anything because you need to save lives , which should be the most important thing on everybody 's mind at the moment .
