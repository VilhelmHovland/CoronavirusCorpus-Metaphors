Anders Fogh Rasmussen was the Prime Minister of Denmark from 2001 to 2009 .
Eight hundred and fifty thousand of Taiwan 's 23 million citizens reside in mainland China .
Four hundred thousand work there .
At its narrowest point , the Taiwan Strait between the island and the mainland is just 130 km .
So , by all accounts , Taiwan should be in the midst a major coronavirus outbreak .
Instead , as of March 18 , it had seen just 100 cases compared to the more than 80,000 in China and the tens of thousands in several countries in Europe .
This has not happened by chance .
Learning from the experiences of SARS in 2003 , Taiwan was ready when the outbreak in Wuhan occurred .
After the first notifications at the end of 2019 , Taipei swiftly deployed a combination of measures to identify and contain the virus , including the use of big data to help contain potential cases .
The global health community could have learned from Taiwan 's experience .
But in recent years its world-class health specialists have been shut out in the cold by Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsai Ing-Wen came to power with a mandate to assert her people 's autonomy .
China did not take kindly to this democratic challenge to its " One China " policy and bullied the world 's multilateral institutions into dealing only with Beijing .
As a result , Taipei was denied access to a number of international fora which it was previously able to attend as an observer .
This includes the UN World Health Organization .
Until 2016 , Taiwan was allowed to participate in its annual assembly as a non-state actor .
This is no longer the case , and for the past three years , its request for an invitation has been denied .
If it wishes to participate in WHO technical working bodies made up of health experts looking at specific challenges , it must apply each time and its participation is regularly blocked .
One example of this was last year when Taiwan was blocked from discussions on influenza vaccines .
Taiwan made clear that its wish to be part of these bodies was due to its practical know-how .
It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to offer the global health community .
Yet China muddied the waters of geopolitics and global health -- and today we see the consequences .

Related Stories  After the SARS outbreak , Taiwan established the National Health Command Center ( NHCC ) , and in the first five weeks of the outbreak it took 124 actions ranging from issuing travel alerts and bans , allocating resources for face masks with 4 million being produced every day by the end of January and guidelines for schools .
Following the amendment of the Communicable Disease Control Act in June 2019 , fines can also be applied for the deliberate spreading of disinformation .
These measures were strict but combined with a high degree of transparency from the government .
Daily press briefings were given and regular public service broadcasts were issued from the President 's office , and simple messaging about hand washing , face masks and the dangers of hoarding were effective .
Perhaps not all of these actions would be culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be little doubt that it has saved lives and is helping to prevent widespread panic .
We should look to Taiwan and try to learn lessons for both the current outbreak , and for the inevitable outbreaks of disease that are now characteristic of our globalized world .
But there is a much wider issue .
In the 21st century , almost all of our major challenges have cross-border elements to them : climate , health , trade and technology .
We can not afford geopolitical " blackholes .
" We need Taiwan in the room , helping to shape the global policy with its highly educated , industrialized and high-tech expertise .
Until now , the world 's multilateral bodies have gone along with China 's pressure that Taiwan be excluded .
But it has come at a cost to all of us , starting in this case , to China .
Now it 's time that we tell China , there is a place for discussing geopolitics .
The World Health Organization is not it .
