More Australian businesses eligible for COVID-19 repayment relief  Another 30,000 Australian businesses will be eligible to defer their loan repayments , under further COVID-19 relief measures announced by banks this morning .
The threshold for relief has been lifted from $3 million to $10 million in total business loan facilities , with the Australian Banking Association saying this will cover 98 per cent of businesses with a loan .
According to the ABA , the ability to defer repayments for six months will now apply to $250 billion worth of loans .
Ms Bligh confirmed businesses with loans over $10 million may also be eligible for relief , although this will decided on a case-by-case basis .
More than 100,000 Australians applied to have their loan repayments deferred last week , a figure Ms Bligh described as " extraordinary " .
She said the measures announced today would help businesses hibernate , and re-emerge once the pandemic had passed .
" Banks understand that for many businesses this will help them keep the lights on , for others it will help them keep going as they get through this crisis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be required to close down as part of government restrictions , and they 're the ones who are really worried .
" Those businesses that can no longer open their doors because of COVID-19 restrictions , can now be relieved of the burden and worry of making their loan repayments .
"  Australian Banking Association boss Anna Bligh .
( AAP )  Ms Bligh reassured customers that their credit rating would not be impacted in the future if the coronavirus pandemic has forced them to suspend their repayments .
" Of course these are highly unusual arrangements , and they are on a highly unprecedented scale , " she said .
" Neither Australia 's banks or Australia 's credit rating agencies have ever had to deal with anything on this scale before .
" Banks are having discussions with the credit ratings agencies , to identify whether it 's possible to somehow put a flag to indicate that this was an initiative only made necessary by COVID-19 .
" People need to know that they can relax , if in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've had this period of time where they had their payments deferred , banks are going to look through this six month period .
