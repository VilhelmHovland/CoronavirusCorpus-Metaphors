The outbreak of COVID-19 creates a myriad of unexpected , outside-of-the budget costs for Estes Park Health .
Additional supplies are needed as staff work to protect both patients and themselves to minimize the impact and spread of COVID-19 in our community .
The uninsured and underserved , who could potentially become infected , will require prompt and compassionate care and there will be costs associated with that care .
And , additional equipment may be needed as the number of cases in our community rises .
To pay for expenses related to COVID-19 response at Estes Park Health , the Estes Park Health Foundation created the Coronavirus and Subsequent Emergency Response Fund .
Estes Park Health is a central hub of care in this community , providing services including prenatal , general medicine , rehab , surgical , home health and hospice .
Responding to COVID-19 in the Estes Valley community creates unanticipated demands on every staff member from the medical staff , IT , HR , Dietary , environmental services , and so on .
