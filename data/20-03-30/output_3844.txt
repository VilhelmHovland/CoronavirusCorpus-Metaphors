' The Whole Thing Is A Mess '  2 Mar 25 , 2020 - 07:32 pm  By Soccer Laduma  The ongoing disruptions in various football leagues and all major sporting codes in South Africa due to the Coronavirus outbreak are hitting hard on the agents and their business as in all many other aspects of life .
Before the decision by the Premier Soccer League to suspend the league in line with country 's efforts to curb the spread of the disease , the Absa Premiership had entered into less than 10 fixtures remaining for the season for all the teams , with things having become more interesting both at the top and bottom of the log .
For some agents , it was a case of looking forward to starting the negotiations for their clients -- players and/or coaches -- who will be looking for contract extensions or to move at the end of the season .
However , the COVID-19 pandemic has put everything to a standstill for the moment , as top local agent Michael Ngobeni explains to the Siya crew .
" There is absolutely no business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has put everything on a standstill .
I am lying on a couch and watching television as I speak to you .
There is nothing I can do .
We hope for the best .
The whole thing is a mess , " said Ngobeni .
Ngobeni has Kaizer Chiefs Zimbabwe international star Khama Biliat , as well as Talent Chawapiwa of AmaZulu , among some of his clients in the PSL .
