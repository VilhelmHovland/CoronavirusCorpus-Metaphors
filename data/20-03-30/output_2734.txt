While Ontario appears to be well back from Quebec in terms of overall number of infections , Quebec has tested far more people and likely has a far more accurate picture of the current spread of the virus .
" This is definitely something that Ontario needs to get a handle on , " said Todd Coleman , epidemiologist and assistant professor in health sciences at Wilfrid Laurier University .
" If we 're seeing ( testing ) at a much higher level in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of people who have lesser symptoms or are asymptomatic are walking around and transmission can keep happening .
"  As of publication time Monday , Ontario has tested 48,461 people for the COVID-19 virus , while Quebec has tested 65,915 and British Columbia 38,697 .
But when measured proportionally , because Ontario has a bigger population , it has tested only 333 people per 100,000 , while Quebec has tested 777 and B .
Alberta has tested more than 1,000 people per 100,000 .
Even as tests are ramping up , it could take a week or longer before Ontario has a realistic idea of where it is on the epidemiological outbreak curve and how much longer the economic shutdown and physical distancing measures will have to last , experts said .
" One of the pillars of managing an epidemic is to have diagnostic testing , " said Dr .
Isaac Bogoch , an infectious disease expert at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute .
" It 's very challenging to manage this if you 're working in the dark .
"  While Ontario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests without results -- with provincial health authorities reporting Monday that it was down to 5,651 from nearly 11,000 last Thursday -- infectious disease experts say there is not nearly enough testing to get an accurate picture of the spread of COVID-19 .
The province has said it is working with labs in hospitals , as well as academic and private settings to clear the backlog .
As of Friday , the province was completing an average of about 2,400 tests per day .
Speaking to reporters Monday , Dr .
Barbara Yaffe , Ontario 's associate medical officer of health , said about 4,000 tests were completed in the last 24 hours .
The province is aiming to reach a capacity of around 19,000 tests per day by mid-April , she said .
" We 've heard about this backlog in diagnostic tests and we 've heard about how they 're resolving this backlog .
But still , at the end of the day , there is a backlog of diagnostic tests and we 're not testing as many people as we should , " said Bogoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 and 2,000 tests a day .
But by last week , they were able to take swabs from more than 15,000 people in a single day , according to the Quebec provincial health institute .
The province accomplished this not only by dramatically increasing its testing capacity , opening 64 testing clinics across the province , but also by allowing major hospital labs to process their own test results , said Marie-Claude Lacasse , spokesperson for the provincial health ministry .
Quebec can now obtain 6,000 test results per day .
" It 's amazing , Quebec has totally turned the corner , " said Bogoch .
While the jump in the number of tests performed in Quebec was accompanied by a jump in confirmed cases as well , this should n't be seen as a sign that the virus is rapidly spreading .
Instead , Bogoch said it 's a reflection of the province finally getting a more accurate picture of the current state of infection -- something Ontario has yet to do .
" If you test , you find it .
So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to happen to Ontario .
We should not be alarmed when Ontario does ramp up testing , because we will see more cases .
" Many key decisions hinge on having accurate data from diagnostic testing .
Once we have a better understanding of the number of new cases per day , we will know how we 're doing on that epidemic curve .
"  Meanwhile , in B .
, where testing for the virus has been done at a rate more than twice that of Ontario , officials are hopeful that the infection curve is flattening -- that is , the number of new cases is n't growing as quickly as projected by provincial health officials without social distancing .
" It 's beginning to work , " said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday .
" We see promising news out of B .
"  The province has 970 confirmed cases , but that number has n't been growing as quickly as it has in Quebec and Ontario .
, which recorded the first case of community transmission in Canada on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and people with suppressed immune systems over the general population .
's health officer Dr .
Bonnie Henry said over the weekend that her province will consider people recovered from COVID-19 if they had a mild form of the disease and are symptom-free for 10 days ; they will not need two further tests showing a negative result , a procedure reserved for more vulnerable patients in hospital or those with compromised immune systems .
( Ontario has a similar policy ) .
British Columbia leads Canada with the largest number of people who have recovered from the virus -- 469 as of Monday .
On Monday , Henry stressed that the province is at a critical juncture where either hospitals will see a " continuing trickle " or " dramatic increases " of cases after saying late last week that the infection curve in B .
is bending in the right direction .
" We are not through the storm yet .
We have not yet reached our peak , " Henry said Monday .
" We have more people everyday who are in hospital and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do all we can across government , across our health system and in our community .
Every person needs to do their bit .
"  While limiting the spread of the virus is largely accomplished through physical distancing and keeping as many people at home as possible , there 's no way to tell if these measures are working without sufficient testing .
" I ca n't say it is working yet .
It may be working , and it is incredibly important , and the modellers have shown us that if we do this right , it is what is going to save us .
It 's going to save our healthcare system , it 's going to save our communities , " Henry said Friday .
While Ontario remains behind B .
and Quebec , Toronto General Hospital 's Bogoch is confident the province is moving quickly to ramp up testing .
" I firmly believe that there will be a quick turnaround and we will see the rapid deployment of diagnostic tests in Ontario .
I know there are goals of 5,000 tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ahead , " Bogoch said .
