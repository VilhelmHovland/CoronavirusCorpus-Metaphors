A keen home bread baker , Sudul says she initially rolled her eyes at the news of people who seemingly ca n't get through the COVID-19 crisis without hoarding toilet paper .
But she soon realized she had her own anxiety -- running out of flour .
Like scores of other cooped-up Calgarians , she 's rising to the challenge of spending time in self-isolation due to the novel coronavirus pandemic by turning out loaf after golden loaf .
Witness the scores of people hunkered down at home who are posting shots of their cookies , sticky buns and other floury creations on social media .
( It must be said this simply is n't possible for everyone ; essential workers and those short of time , money and resources may not be able to stock up , stay home and cook .
)  " Bread is the absolute foundation of food , " says Sudul , a retired piano teacher .
" Baking it makes me feel like I 'm producing something rather than buying .
It 's a self-sufficiency thing .
"  If bread-baking is therapeutic and the end result is delicious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepper .
" Flour , the most basic of foodstuffs , was cleaned out of supermarkets this past week , causing some consternation .
Many of us have a food thing we ca n't live without .
Kraft Dinner must be at the top of many people 's lists ; about 15 million boxes of the pantry staple sold in March in Canada , more than double the amount from the previous month , according to the Financial Post .
My thing is canned tomatoes .
From a 28-ounce can of red gold , I can spin an " instant " tomato soup ( see recipe ) , a batch of pizza or bolognese sauce .
Recently , after fruitlessly hunting high and low for tinned toms at supermarkets , I decided to change my weekly shopping strategy and hit up The Italian Store , a retail outlet , deli and cafe operated by Great West Italian Importers .
It carries Mediterranean staples like canned and jarred goods under its Scarpone 's label .
There , keeping a safe distance from other shoppers , I picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also scored a precious 20-kilogram bag of enriched flour for my husband , another hard-core bread baker .
" We 've had a run on the Italian flour .
People have been going crazy for it , " says Sera Duros , one of the family-run company 's owners .
Likewise , coffee is in hot demand at The Italian Store .
" People are saying , ' I can stay home as long as I have coffee .
' We 're trying to buy as much as we can .
We ca n't go without our morning coffee .
"  Duros , who ca n't live without good olive oil , sees a lot of Calgarians turning to homemade meals for comfort .
" Cooking is therapy .
It makes you feel so good .
Your family loves it .
People are n't going out to the restaurants so it means there 's a lot of demand for our stuff .
"  Pierre Lamielle , a chef , illustrator and cookbook author , also applauds home-cooking and the humble canned tomato .
He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the five tastes : sweet , salty , bitter , sour and umami .
But , butter is his jam .
" Butter is important for my health and well-being , " says Lamielle , a Calgary contender on Top Chef Canada and winner of the Chopped Canada TV series .
" It 's a genetic , French thing .
I do n't want to find out what happens when I run low .
"  He keeps a life-preserving stash of butter in the freezer , some in the fridge for uses like grating over pancakes and more at room temperature for when the " irresistible " urge to bake cookies strikes .
Baking cookies brings us back to flour -- and thoughts of whether we 're facing shortages of it and other food supplies .
Are concerns justified ?  Duros is unsure .
On Monday she ordered more flour , but could only get two pallets , not the six she wanted .
Her supplier of Canada 's legendary Five Roses flour has told her there could be a shortage .
So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags of flour to two per customer .
She 's more worried about her supplies that come mostly from Italy and Spain , two countries ravaged by COVID-19 .
" We 're okay for now , but we 're not sure if there will be delays and problems with shipping .
I think there will be shortages .
"  A supermarket worker in Europe fills up flour supplies after the number of customers was limited to 50 at a time due to coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) threat .
Reuters/Stevo VasiljevicSTEVO VASILJEVIC / REUTERS  I take some comfort in the words of Gary Sands , senior vice-president , public policy &amp; advocacy for the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers .
? In a recent opinion piece for Postmedia , he explains that grocers run " very tight margins " to control inventory and prevent food waste .
So , when shoppers start stockpiling and hoarding , it disrupts those lean , just-in-time supply chains .
Presto : empty shelves .
" But there is simply no reason for panic buying in Canada .
Grocery stores are staying open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure .
Suppliers have assured retailers that enough food is being produced and there are no shortages of essential products such as , yes , toilet paper , " Sands writes .
" Bear in mind , too , that in some categories , Canada is a net food exporter .
? We are , for example , a major producer of grains , beef , chicken and dairy products .
"  It leads me to believe perhaps our home-grown basics like flour will be readily available .
Depending on how long the pandemic lasts , imports such as coffee -- and some of the other food items we think we ca n't live without -- might become luxuries , like in bygone days .
Shop accordingly .
For her part , Sudul is n't taking any chances .
Before things " got really scary , " she stocked up on flour , yeast and salt .
" Even if the stores shut down , we could live on bread and water .
At least we 'll have bread .
That 's enormously comforting to me .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a way to use up leftover diced canned tomatoes .
It 's almost as fast as opening a can of tomato soup , but infinitely more delicious and a perfect mate for grilled cheese sandwiches .
Scale the recipe up or down as required .
It 's nice to add minced fresh rosemary , basil or thyme , or a pinch of dried herbs or stir in some pesto after blending .
Also , you can make it with coconut milk instead of dairy .
