Even as the state government sputters into action to provide food to the hungry amid the COVID-19 pandemic , civil societies in Lucknow has started to make provisions and cooked meals available .
The distribution started on March 25 , and a day later 300 families had been reached .
" We have mapped about 12,000 families in 80 bastis of Lucknow who are most in need .
We have no resources for now and the contribution is entirely voluntary , " said Sandeep Khare , social activist and secretary of the Vigyaan Foundation which is among the organisations that have taken a lead in the initiative .
The reach-out was made possible by a diligent mapping of volunteers and families in need .
Thus , volunteers working with various organisations were asked to first identify community level volunteers in their neighbourhoods .
These in turn helped list the most vulnerable families- such as those of rag pickers , daily wagers , rickshaw pullers , those stranded at bus stops and railway stations , and household workers in their immediate vicinity .
A volunteer need-match was made and a picking up of rations from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals too .
The amount of provisions to be put in a packet has been specified such that it lasts an average family for about a week .
Thus , one packet contains five kilograms each of wheat and rice , one kilogram each of salt , sugar , arhar and chana daal and refined oil , 100 gram each of turmeric and chilli powder and a packet of milk .
As the administration is still in the process of making lockdown passes for vehicles available , much of this distribution is being done on foot and in the morning hours by the 100 volunteers identified thus far .
Coordination is made possible over social media and emergency messages sent out for those in critical situations .
" We have been getting calls from Chhattisgarh and Delhi to help though we are limited to Lucknow .
This is a measure of the size of the calamity " , Khare told THE WEEK .
As food supply chains remain interrupted , getting provisions is a challenge .
There are many citizens who upon coming to know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no bank account to take such contributions into .
" We are looking at some CSR ( Corporate Social Responsibility ) backing to get funds for the work , " Khare said .
For now , monetary contributions are limited to sending them to provision shop owners through e payment gateways so that supplies can be made available to volunteers .
All contributions are made part of social media groups to maintain transparency .
As no help is deemed too insignificant , the organisations are also making an appeal to those who want to help but have limited provisions , to mark a collection point in their neighbourhoods from which the listed volunteers can pick up food .
Thecoming together of organisations with differing specialities has helped consolidate the larger fight against COVID-19 .
Farrukh Rehman Khan , Regional Manager , WaterAid India which is also part of the effort said that the organisation had been digitally and through community volunteers disseminating information about hand hygiene .
" We are also working with Water Works Lucknow to disseminate information about the contact numbers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water supply as this is critical to maintain hygiene .
Where there is no piped water supply , handpumps are the major source of water and Panchayat and Jal Nigam are responsible for ensuring restoration in case of breakdown or provide water through tankers for immediate relief " , he said .
While the government gets its act together , these measures of relief will provide some succor against a pandemic of uncertain proportions .
