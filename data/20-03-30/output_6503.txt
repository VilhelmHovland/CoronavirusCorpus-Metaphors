Mossad Delivers 10 Million Protective Masks  The Mossad has continued its unique contribution to Israel 's response to the coronavirus pandemic with the delivery of some 10 million protective medical masks , The Jerusalem Post reported on Monday .
The masks , which will help relieve a shortage , were purchased by the Mossad , Israel 's espionage agency , and arrived in the country on Monday .
Details of the operation were not available , but they likely came from countries with which Israel has no diplomatic relations .
That was the case with 100,000 test kits the Mossad brought in two weeks ago , The JerusalemPost said .
Four million are reportedly in the pipeline .
The sensitivity of transactions with such countries explains why the Mossad was involved .
In addition to the masks , the Mossad brought a few dozen ventilators , tens of thousands more test kits , and 25,000 of the much-in-demand N95 surgical masks .
