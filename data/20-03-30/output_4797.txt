Renters offered coronavirus relief as government pauses evictions  Australian renters struggling to cover their rent payments have been thrown a lifeline after the federal government introduced a six-month moratorium on evictions .
Under new rules announced on Sunday , commercial and residential landlords will be unable to turf out tenants who ca n't pay the rent because of the coronavirus pandemic .
" There will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements , " Prime Minister Scott Morrison said .
Tasmania was the first to implement these measures on March 25 , giving renters a 120-day grace period if the pandemic leaves them unable to pay for the roof over their heads .
" Any appeals from tenants for a notice to vacate due to rental arrears that are currently waiting to be heard by the Magistrates Court will be put on hold , " said the state 's minister for building and construction , Elise Archer .
Incentives will be included for tenants to keep paying their rent through the pandemic where they 're able to do so , Ms Archer added .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specify how they will apply and implement their moratoriums .
Moratorium welcome , but clarity needed  A Productivity Commission report found two-thirds of renters in the private market experience rental stress ( defined as spending more than 30 per cent of their disposable income on rent ) .
With so many people under pressure at the best of times , Anglicare Australia CEO Kasy Chambers said a moratorium is a welcome measure .
" We 're thrilled that government has heard the call for a moratorium , " she told The New Daily .
However , the lack of detail provided by government leaves many questions unanswered .
" We 're still pushing a little bit around , things like what will happen to arrears when the moratorium finishes , how we relieve tenants but still support small landlords for whom rent is their only income , " she said .
Dr Chris Martin , senior research fellow with University of New South Wales ' City Futures Research Centre , flagged similar concerns .
" An eviction moratorium in the present public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the health and economic aspects of the problem , " he said .
But it has to go further .
' '  Dr Martin cautioned that by linking the eviction moratorium to financial hardship , it still leaves landlords with other ways to evict their tenants .
In most states , landlords could still force out their tenants without grounds to evict after their fixed-term agreement expires .
Without specifically addressing these concerns , Dr Martin said a partial moratorium will be the same as no moratorium at all .
Coronavirus highlights need for reform  One of the biggest problems facing Australia 's renters is the unforgiving legal structures governing disputes with landlords .
Banks and other financial institutions have a legal obligation to offer some flexibility to customers ( through hardship provisions , for example ) , but landlords face no such requirements .
