South African production of key foods largely reassuring in face of crisis  An independent research centre , the Bureau for Food and Agricultural Policy ( BFAP ) , has published an overview of five key foods produced in South Africa , as part of its analysis of food and agricultural aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis .
The foods are chicken ( meat ) , maize ( grains ) , soybean ( oilseeds ) , citrus ( fruits ) and potato ( vegetables ) .
Regarding chicken , for more than a decade demand has exceeded local production .
Until recently , the local industry suffered from high feed costs and very competitively priced imports .
However , during 2018 and 2019 the local producers saw their margins improve .
Local production is also climbing .

Weekly slaughters early this year were already 5% up on the figure for last year ( 20 .

Local production is expected to be even higher during the second half of this year .
Advertisement  South African maize production usually exceeds local demand .
Most times , 15% to 20% of the local crop is exported , both white maize for human consumption ( mainly to other Southern African countries ) and yellow maize for animal feed ( to world markets ) .
At the end of February this year , South Africa had a stock of white maize of 1 .
tons ( Mt ) .
This was enough for nearly four months of processing .
The yellow maize stock was 1 .
Mt , or almost three months ' worth , in processing terms .
This meant that there was sufficient maize to last the country until the new crop is brought in .
This is expected to be a large crop -- the Crop Estimates Committee estimates 14 .

South African human consumption of maize , as a basic staple food , is estimated as being 5 .

Mt/y .
South Africa should thus have plenty of maize this year , and be able to both export and to cut prices at home , benefitting lower income families .
Advertisement  BFAP also points out that , in addition to the formal maize sector , from which the above figures come , the country also has an informal maize sector .
The Bureau estimates that this usually produces another 400 000 t/y of white and 200 000 t/y of yellow maize .
Currently , local soybean production does not meet domestic demand .
But local production is increasing significantly .
Five years ago , South African production met 60% of local demand .
Last year , this proportion stood at 75% .
When processed , soybeans yield 75% oilcake ( for animal feed ) and 17 .

This means the country will have to import about 350 000 t of soybean meal this year .
Production in South Africa 's export-orientated citrus fruits sector far exceeds local demand ; no less than 70% of total production is exported .
The 2020 season has just started and a record crop is expected .
Local prices are significantly lower than export prices and the local market can not absorb the sector 's total production .
The global spread of Covid-19 is thus a very big risk for the sector , which requires its global export chains to continue working efficiently and for international demand to remain solid .
If things go wrong , the sector could suffer losses on a large scale .
Potatoes are the most important vegetable crop in South Africa .
For more than a decade , local production has exceeded local demand .
Potatoes are grown on 53 000 ha in 16 different regions .

However , the potato-growing area declined by 6% from 2019 to 2020 , although production volumes fell by a lesser figure -- 4% -- owing to good yields .
South Africa normally exports about 5% of its crop , largely to other Southern African countries .
