Coronavirus UK spread shows early signs of slowing -- key adviser  The spread of coronavirus in the UK is showing some early signs of slowing , according to Prof Neil Ferguson , a key epidemiologist advising the government .
Ferguson , whose modelling informed the government 's decision to impose a lockdown , said the data was showing some signs that social distancing measures were beginning to work , although it has not yet had an effect on the daily reported deaths .
He told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : " In the UK , we can see some early signs of slowing in some indicators .
Less so in deaths because deaths are lagged by long time from when the measures come into force .
" But we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions today for instance that does seem to be slowing down a little bit now .
It 's not yet plateaued as the numbers are increasing each day but the rate of that increase has slowed .
" We see similar patterns in a number of European countries .
"  Ferguson also said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not get any symptoms but there was no evidence to back up some claims that the vast majority of people are asymptomatic .
He said it appeared that around 3-5% of people in central London could have been infected , but the figure may be higher in hotspots , while the figure for the country at large is more likely to be 2-3% .
Ferguson said the next crucial step was the antibody test which can tell whether people have already had the virus and is in the " final stages of validation " , with hopes that it could be operational within days .
Ferguson 's assessment provides some hope that the lockdown could work , but he acknowledged testing would need to be ramped up .
Helen Whately , a health minister , told the same programme that the government was hugely increasing testing , including of NHS staff .
However , she acknowledged that still only 7,000 people were tested on Sunday , despite Cabinet Office minister , Michael Gove , and health secretary , Matt Hancock , claiming that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that was the new " capacity " but it had not been reached yet .
The government announced in early March that it would be testing 10,000 people a day , before increasing that target to 25,000 people .
However it has taken weeks to get the tests and laboratories ready for 10,000 tests , meaning many NHS workers are just starting to get tested .
Whately also declined to speculate on when the UK 's lockdown may end , after Jenny Harries , the deputy chief medical officer , said on Sunday that restrictions could last three to six months .
