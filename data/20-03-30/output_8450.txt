Tennis Association spokesman Chris Widmaier says an area that houses indoor courts at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows will begin to be converted into a medical facility starting Tuesday .
New York state and city officials are trying to increase hospital capacity by up to 87,000 beds to handle the outbreak .
Widmaier adds that kitchens at Louis Armstrong Stadium -- the second-largest arena used for the Grand Slam tournament scheduled to begin in late August -- will be used for putting together 25,000 meal packages per day for patients , workers , volunteers and schoolchildren in the city .

But then the group changed course and said it was shutting the site to the public .
The Wall Street Journal first reported on the use of the tennis center .
