MD Stay At Home Order Effective 8pm Tonight  This morning , Maryland Governor Larry Hogan enacted an executive order which institutes a Stay at Home directive .
No Maryland resident should be leaving their home unless it is for an essential job or for an essential reason , such as obtaining food or medicine , seeking urgent medical attention , or for other necessary purposes .
In addition , only essential businesses are allowed to remain open in Maryland , and those businesses must make every effort to scale down their operations in order to reduce the number of required staff , to limit interactions with customers , and to institute telework for as much of the workforce as is practical .
As we have previously stated , no Marylander should be traveling outside of the state unless such travel is absolutely necessary .
If you have traveled outside of the state , you should self-quarantine for 14 days .
This is a deadly public health crisis .
We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home -- we are directing them to do so .
This executive order will become effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
