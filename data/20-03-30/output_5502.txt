Though CM Nitish Kumar has expressed reservation against Yogi Adityanath 's move to arrange special buses and transport people in " violation of the lockdown " , the Bihar government has decided not to stop these vehicles from entering Bihar .
The step , Nitish Kumar is believed to have conveyed to the Centre , would defeat the purpose of the nationwide lockdown ? to stop the spread of novel coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) .
Bihar Water Resources Minister Sanjay Jha told India Today TV that Nitish Kumar on Saturday spoke to " everyone who matters in New Delhi " and apprised them of the " impending danger " that pushing the migrant workers out of Delhi would pose a huge problem to Bihar in view of the Covid-19 pandemic .
" Sending migrant workers via special buses is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disease and create difficult problems for everybody in checking or tackling it , " Jha said .
" The migrant workers travelling to Bihar are being disembarked from these buses at the bordering districts .
We are making them to stay for the night in the special relief camps put by the state disaster management department , " the minister added .
The influx of migrants has left Bihar with huge operational challenges , as 22 of Bihar 's 38 districts share borders with states of Uttar Pradesh , Jharkhand and West Bengal , besides Nepal .
Managing the 1,751 km long and porous Indo-Nepal with numerous open transit points is a difficult job too .
So far , more than 40,000 migrant workers already reached Bihar on Sunday .
" We are providing them food and shelter in specially created relief camps at the borders .
Doctors would screen each of them .
Then , all these migrant workers would be sent to their villages in vehicles arranged by the state government , " said Prtyaya Amrit , Principal Secretary , Disaster Management Department .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been tasked to keep each one of them in quarantine in the government schools and Panchayat Bhawans of their areas , " he added .
Incidentally , the Bihar CM has already released an amount of Rs 100 crore as a relief package to the state Disaster Management Department to help the Covid-19 victims .
" We will provide food and shelter for every Bihar resident , who is trapped in corona crisis , irrespective of his or her location , " said the chief minister .
The Nitish government 's package covers all who have been rendered vulnerable and left without a livelihood .
Helpless and jobless , thousands of people , mostly from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh , have left the Delhi-National Capital Region ( NCR ) , Punjab and Haryana for their villages after their workplaces were closed because of the lockdown .
