Some retailers have adapted with the times and built a formidable online presence or reverted to online only .
These retailers are now in a better position to survive as well as thrive .
In my opinion , the current situation has thrown up two excellent opportunities in the shape of JD Sports ( LSE:JD ) and ASOS ( LSE:ASOS ) .
JD Sports  JD Sports has been bucking the retail trend for a few years now .
Many businesses have fallen foul of the changing habits of the technology-savvy consumer .
JD Sports has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new retail world with thriving online platforms .
The market crash has seen a 40% decrease in the company 's share price , but this is part of the reason I am drawn to it .
It is currently trading near to 450p , which I see as a relative bargain .
Its share price , prior to the market crash , had increased almost 800% over the previous five years .
This is a mammoth performance for a time when other retailers have been shutting up shop .
Reviewing this top performer , its profit levels have increased every year since 2014 .
A staggering 400% increase in profit levels between 2014 and 2019 shows just how well the undisputed king of retail is performing .
Despite all high street stores closing down due to Covid-19 , JD Sports ' online store remains fully operational .
Its Christmas trading update , released in early January , was brief , but said it expected full-year profits to be at the top end of its forecasts of ? 403 to ? 433m .
This was revised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results would be delayed .
With dividend per share increasing year on year , JD Group could prove a worthy addition to any portfolio .
ASOS  With close to 1,000 brands available on its site , and shipping to almost 200 countries , Asos is a big fish in a rather big pond .
In a recent trading update , the four months to 31 December 2019 saw a huge 20% increase in retail sales compared to the same period last year .
ASOS also saw a 20% increase in revenue in this period compared to the same period last year .
These are promising results for the retailer , who had issues with fulfilment and stock the year prior .
Although much has changed since these results have been announced , I do feel as though ASOS will continue with some form of normality due to its purely online offering .
People still need to buy clothes , just maybe not as much until this pandemic subsides .
I believe the US market could be key to ASOS ' success .
Its recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US against last year 's figures .
ASOS figureheads have previously pointed towards the US market being room for growth and this result shows it is heading in the right direction .
The share price dipped 60% in the market crash due to Covid-19 but this could make it another bargain to pick up at a cheap price .
And with the Covid-19 virus now beginning to spread beyond of China and Italy , it seems very likely that the bull market we 've enjoyed over the past decade could finally be coming to an end .
Against such a backdrop of market worry , it 's little wonder that many investors are starting to panic .
( After all , nobody likes to see the value of their portfolio fall significantly in such a short space of time .
