The full unedited statement from Chief Minister Michael Gunner today on new border controls .
We 've just come out of a weekend in the Territory that was unlike any weekend before it .
For me , every Saturday normally starts at the Parap Markets , and there was no queues at Mary 's this Saturday .
That did n't happen .
The world is a very different place now .
It 's changed for all of us .
And it 's going to be different for a while .
But if we keep working together to stay safe and save lives , we can get the Territory back to what we all love .
By now you 're all aware of the Prime Minister 's announcements after National Cabinet last night .
There will be another National Cabinet meeting tonight .
I know it seems like every day the list of restrictions gets a bit longer , and trying to live a normal life gets a bit tougher .
But what 's happening is not normal .
We ca n't act as though things are normal .
If you ca n't keep up with all the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , just remember five words : Stay home , if you can .
Unless you 've got to work , or shop , or exercise - stay home , if you can .
I know it seems like the most un-Territorian thing to do - to stay inside , shut away from the great outdoors .
But being the best Territorian you can be right now means being safe .
Think of it this way .
When you 're out in public , around a lot of other people , you are rolling the dice with your health , and your family 's health .
So , instead of rolling the dice , choose the safest bet - stay home , if you can .
I think last week was when the reality of the coronavirus really hit home for us here in the Territory .
We started the week with five positive cases .
We ended the week with 15 .

It 's controlled , there is still no community spread , but all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the east , the rate of growth does appear to be slowing , but the numbers are still growing .
So this is n't the time to put the brakes on our work .
It 's time to keep doing whatever it takes .
We 've kept Territorians safe by always staying ahead of the game .
And staying ahead of the game means working round the clock to scale up our measures when we need to .
Over the weekend , we made two important changes .
First , the small number of people still arriving from overseas are now taken into forced quarantine for 14 days .
There is no self-quarantine .
Second , we moved to police checks for every person currently in self-quarantine .
So the one per cent who try to break the rules will get caught , they will get punished .
Over the weekend , I 've been working on additional options to strengthen our borders .
When the threat from overseas grew larger , we acted .
And I have now formed the view that the threat that the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great .
So this morning , I told my Cabinet I wanted even tougher border controls , and they have agreed .
Our actions so far have stemmed the flow of interstate arrivals to the Territory .
Now I want to stop the flow .
From midnight on Wednesday , people entering the Territory from interstate - including Territorians returning home - will be required to spend 14 days in forced quarantine , not self-quarantine .
The rule that apply to overseas arrivals will now apply to all arrivals .
So that means if you come Adelaide , Brisbane , Sydney , Melbourne - from anywhere - you will be directed straight to a hotel that is secured by us and guarded by us .
And you will stay in your room for 14 days .
And from midnight on Friday , if you still insist on coming to the Territory , whether from overseas or interstate , you will go into forced quarantine , but we will not be paying the bill .
You will be made to stay where we tell you to stay , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you enough notice .
And if you are starting to think I do n't want you here , you 're right .
Do not come here .
We do not want you here .
Sorry , but not right now .
When all of this is over , please come to the Territory , it 's the greatest place on earth and we 'd be happy to have you .
But not right now .
To those who say just close the borders completely : Frankly , that 's what I want to do .
And if I had the power to do it , I 'd do it right now .
But we are at the very limit of what we can legally do here .
We are drawing a red line right around the Territory .
And we are saying to the interstaters in the east , the south and the west : do not cross this line .
If you do , we 'll take you into forced quarantine , and we will keep you there .
So make it easier for yourself , make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now , we have to look after ourselves .
Right now , it is Territory first .
And if that means putting the other states last , we 'll do that .
