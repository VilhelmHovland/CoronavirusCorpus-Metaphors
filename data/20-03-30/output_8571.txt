Waiver granted for schools to provide lunches  Thanks to a federal waiver , Pennsylvania 's schools will now be able to provide free lunches to all children statewide -- regardless of their family 's income levels -- during the coronavirus pandemic .
The Pennsylvania Department of Education announced the move Monday .
" Schools and community organizations can now use recent and local economic data , including unemployment claims and business closures , to request approval from PDE to qualify as an open meal site , " said Vonda Ramp , state director for the department 's Child Nutrition Programs .
" Once approved , they can provide meals to all children in their community , age 18 and under , for free .
"  The United States Department of Agriculture , which oversees school lunch programs , granted the waiver request , state officials said .
Many of the region 's schools have been distributing lunches for the past week or more .
