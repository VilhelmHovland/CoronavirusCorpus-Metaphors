( CNS/Tyler Orsburn )  Americans do n't like talking about death .
It makes us uncomfortable .
But experts say discussing the end of life is necessary , especially now as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to upend much of our existing dying and grieving processes .
" Now , more than ever , is the time to try to open up these kinds of conversations around fears of death and dying and what that means , " said Anita Hannig , associate professor of anthropology at Brandeis University .
" For many , doing that during a pandemic might be way beyond their capacity , but when is a better time ? "  Hannig , who is an expert on the anthropology of death and dying , said this does not mean Americans should be apocalyptic and assume everyone will die .
That 's not what this is about -- while the virus is more fatal for elderly people , the majority of coronavirus patients will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ones around end-of-life wishes because " the last thing you want is to be blindsided , " she said .
Multiple experts told NCR that a century of expansions in the medical and funeral industries in the United States have led to a real distancing between the living and the dying .
Prior to the 20th century , people used to die in their homes and family members were heavily involved in preparing the bodies for burial .
Over time , as dying moved out of the home and out of the care of immediate family , death as a concept also moved largely out of mind for the average person .
Death became taboo in American culture , labeled as " morbid , " something we fear rather than discuss .
With the rise of coronavirus , Americans are now being confronted with those fears on a daily basis .
Headlines enumerate death tolls and Twitter threads detail miserable battles against the virus .
At a March 20 White House press conference , a reporter cited statistics showing millions of Americans are afraid .
When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Donald Trump responded , " I say that you are a terrible reporter .
That 's what I say .
" The exchange has led to further questions about the president 's ability to handle this crisis .
With limits on gatherings like funerals , the pandemic is ' really going to impact the way that we 're able to find closure in the face of death , which is something that we already fear so much .
'  At the same time that death is surging in collective American consciousness , preventative restrictions to stop the spread of the virus are widening the existing physical gap between the dying and their families .
In Italy -- where many Americans are looking to understand what is to come -- people are reportedly dying in isolation without any family or friends around .
Compounding the distance , Italy has also banned funerals , replacing them with graveside services for just a few people .
Immediate family members are sometimes forced to miss the services , stuck in quarantine themselves .
In the United States , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit the number of mourners physically present and livestream services to family and friends at home .
Catholic dioceses around the country are enacting guidelines of their own to restrict funeral sizes .
In Wisconsin , at Mary Flo Werner 's funeral , only her nine grandchildren and the priest were allowed inside their Catholic church to limit the gathering to ten , The New York Times reported March 25 .
Outside , in their cars , her four adult children watched the service on their phones .
This amounts to what Hannig calls a " cruel irony .
" The pandemic is " really going to impact the way that we 're able to find closure in the face of death , which is something that we already fear so much , " she said .
For Catholics , the inability to be near loved ones at the end of life or gather together for funerals will be especially hard .
" We use our physical connections to the sacraments and to each other to buoy our faith , " said Darleen Pryds , associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Theology in San Diego .
" Our faith is very relational .
"  Pryds , who is an expert on the spirituality of death , said , " Families who are not able to see one another at the end of life are often really quite traumatized by that .
"  Along those lines , Hannig , the anthropologist , said some historical examples -- violent military coups , natural disasters , missing soldiers -- show the long-term pain families can suffer when they are unable to perform traditional end-of-life rituals .
Michael Witczak , a professor of liturgical studies and sacramental theology at the Catholic University of America , told NCR via email that burying the dead is a traditional corporal work of mercy .
" The funeral liturgy speaks about ' the bonds we have formed in life .
' The funeral liturgy is rooted in the conviction that human beings are related and connected to one another , " he said .
In the face of the current crisis , finding creative ways to sustain strong relationships will be essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participates in a faith-sharing group that meets through Zoom , an online videoconferencing platform .

" You do n't have to wait until somebody is dying to have those meaningful one-on-ones , " said Hannig .
Pryds also teaches an online course on " The Spirituality of Dying and Death " that offers people a Catholic approach to conversations about death , grounded in the Franciscan tradition .
The course , which is geared toward both caregivers and people at the end of their life , offers opportunities for prayer , meditations and personal reflections .
Although culture historically has pushed us away from it , Pryds said that Christians are called to reflect on our mortality .
" That is a traditional Christian practice -- to reflect on mortality , " she said .
" Not to be morose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that around and realize that each moment is precious and that life is a gift .
