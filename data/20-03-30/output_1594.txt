As the coronavirus pandemic worsens , governments worldwide are scrambling to keep their economies afloat .
Doing so will cost money -- and lots of it .
In the UK we 've witnessed Chancellor Rishi Sunak deliver a series of emergency packages .
This began with ? 12bn to mitigate the immediate economic effects of the outbreak , followed by a huge ? 350bn stimulus package , ? 7bn of extra welfare spending , and multi-billion pound packages to support salaried and self-employed workers .
Around the world other countries are announcing similarly impressive and expensive interventions , such as the US 's $2tn stimulus package , Germany 's ? 600bn of " virus-aid " and ? 45bn released in France .
For governments , then , every scrap of revenue is critical , which makes the fact that they lose between $500bn and $600bn a year to corporate tax dodging -- and $7trn of private wealth that is hidden offshore -- harder to stomach than ever .
In the UK , the most recent HMRC figures reveal that the nation lost ? 35bn in uncollected tax , including ? 5 .
of corporation tax .
However , the price of our collective failure to tackle tax evasion and avoidance is not now limited to warding off an economic collapse .
As health systems around the world strain under the pressure of Covid-19 , it 's clear just how much we depend on strong , well-resourced public services in times of national crisis .
Put simply , the money lost through illicit financial flows ( IFFs ) could have been used to properly equip hospitals and train health workers -- as well as bolster other public services , like social care and community support .
Those profiting from tax avoidance and evasion remain largely insulated against the effects of the virus .
Instead , in the UK , the NHS goes chronically underfunded ; in the US , a wasteful and inefficient private healthcare system has made health a luxury rather than a right ; and throughout Europe , hospitals routinely struggle to access vital resources .
And those profiting from tax avoidance and evasion remain largely insulated against the effects of the virus .
Able to pay for private healthcare , stock up on essential provisions and avoid areas where contagion is likely ( such as shops , public transport and workplaces ) , the wealthy 's experience of the pandemic is worlds apart from the majority 's .
As the virus continues to spread , experts are warning that next in line could be some of the world 's most vulnerable people in the global south .
Lacking even basic healthcare provisions , a coronavirus outbreak in countries would be dire .
About one billion people -- 30% of the world 's urban population -- live in slum-like conditions .
With little ventilation , drainage and sewerage facilities , diseases spread quickly and easily , and so-called " social distancing " is impossible .
For this vast number of people , watching the coronavirus shut down country after county in the developed world must be terrifying .
Presently , African countries , for example , have access to just 1% of the world 's financial resources for health , but bear 24% of the global burden of disease .
And , in 2019 , cash-strapped African governments struggled with a health financing shortfall of $66bn a year .
But things need n't be this bad .
According to a report , Trapped in Illicit Finance , published by the international development charity Christian Aid , public revenue losses from IFFs in developing countries amount to around $416bn annually .
While it 's too late to reappropriate that money , the lesson could n't be clearer : there is a huge human cost to tax evasion and avoidance .
In the meantime , to give the global south the best chance of weathering the incoming coronavirus health crisis , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should delay loan repayments and allocate new loans ( and grants ) to the poorest countries .
Thankfully , it looks like that will happen .
If anything good can come from this crisis , it should include a focused and committed global declaration to eliminate tax evasion and tax avoidance .
In the UK , this could include extending and strengthening existing anti-avoidance tax legislation such as IR35 and continuing to remove other loopholes that allow corporate tax dodging .
Though it 's difficult to say exactly how much money governments could reclaim by closing the most glaring tax loopholes , we can safely say the total would be hundreds of billions .
That 's surely a good long-term goal for the UK , and other countries too .

The Digger Treasure Hunt  Mum Becky George , from Harpenden , says her son Daniel was due to have a disco party this year for his fifth birthday .
" It was going to be his first whole class party and he 'd been counting down the sleeps , " she says .
" When I had to cancel it , he was so disappointed .
"  Instead , George wrote him a digger treasure trail around the streets .
He had to follow the map , find picture clues , read information from signs , count how many sand bags he could see , and spot solar panels on particular houses .
" The route deliberately took him past several houses having building works , as Daniel loves diggers , " she says .
She then asked if his friends who lived along the route would put a picture of a digger in their windows for him to spot .
" Daniel was delighted to spot 100 diggers , many beautifully drawn by kids ! People also hung birthday banners and balloons , chatted to him through open windows and left him gifts and cards it their gardens for him to collect .
One garden even played ' Happy Birthday Daniel ' from a hidden sound system ! "  The trail took 90 minutes to complete .
" Daniel thought it was his best birthday ever , " she says .
The Grandparents ' Surprise  Will Hobson , from Sheffield , says it was his niece 's birthday this week -- she turned four .
As she could n't see her grandparents , they surprised her with a banner at the end of the drive and had a distant tea party .
The Sixth Birthday Street Parade  Mum Lisa Wood says it was her daughter Sienna 's sixth birthday last week .
" I was sad she could n't have her planned party or any friends over for tea , so I put a message on the street WhatsApp to see if anyone would come out to sing to her .
"  Everyone pulled through .
Lisa , from Cheshire , said the street came out in full force .
" All ages from the young to the old and everyone obeyed the social distancing , " she says .
" It was very emotional and she loved it .
We have a great community spirit .
"  Turning One In Lockdown  Joanna Drake had her daughter 's first birthday last week .
" It was really weird but tried to find the positives in it : we were all together when usually daddy would have been at work and brother Ted would be at school , " she tells HuffPost UK .
The family had a picnic in the garden in the sunshine and spaced presents out throughout the day .
" A bittersweet moment when my parents came and stood at the end of the drive to sing happy birthday and left presents for us to collect later , " she adds .
" But Zara was happy all day and loved the fuss .
"  The FaceTime Fiesta  Hannah O Donoghue Hobbs , from Manchester , celebrated her daughter 's third birthday in lockdown .
" I was really worried about it , having to cancel her party and not see friends or family , " she says , " but she declared herself the birthday boss and the sun was shining so we had a lovely day ! "  The family also had a picnic outside and they bought lots of garden toys for her , had a full FaceTime party with 10 of their family members and received lots of video messages and gifts on their doorstep .

The ' Costa-Del quarantine ' honeymoon at home  Ruth Barrett and her husband , Jordan , were thankfully able to get married before the UK lockdown began .
But the continuing Covid-19 situation meant their honeymoon has been put on hold .
It was also Ruth 's birthday last week , so her friend Danielle sent her everything she needed for a " Costa-Del quarantine " , including hula skirts , a cocktail making kit , a photo booth kit and some umbrellas for drinks .
" I 've been friends will Danielle for two and a half years , " says Ruth , 33 , from Newcastle .
" We work together and she 's honestly one of the nicest people ever with the biggest heart .
It was so incredibly thoughtful and sweet .
"  The package boosted Ruth 's mood , but she 's quick to acknowledge that there 's " so many people worse off than us right now " .
" Sure we could have been in the Maldives on our honeymoon , but I 'm still with my favourite person , " she adds .
The unexpected parcel drop-off  Laura Beattie , 31 from Manchester , is classed as vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19 as she has cystic fibrosis and is awaiting a double lung transplant .
Her two best friends , Hannah and Lisa , who are both teachers , have helped her stay positive by dropping off unexpected parcels .
Lisa dropped off a selection of vegan treats including crisps , sweets , cookies and a drink , while Hannah delivered an invite to her wedding , plus a beautiful card that was made by her primary school class .
" Both of these made me cry and have really helped me during this time , " says Laura .
" It was such a lovely thing to do and they are amazing .
I knew I was not alone .
"  " It made me feel so special .
Even though we ca n't be near each other , it meant so much that they wanted to give me stuff so I knew they were thinking of me and there for me .
"  The pick-me-up self-care package  Knowing how stressed she 's been , her friend , Jess , who 's a GP , sent a " pick-me-up " package in the post with some of Vicky 's favourite things , including the makeup she 'd said she would n't be able to buy for a while .
" Jess and I have been best friends since we were 12 , " says Vicky , 38 , from Leeds .
" Our friendship began on a school trip when we paired up with each other and we 've been best friends ever since -- from travelling to uni to being each other 's maid of honour and godparents to our children .
"  " Like most people , I feel anxious and overwhelmed with the uncertainty of the current situation , " adds Vicky .
" I 've built up a business over 18 months , and there is a fear that it could all just disappear .
"  Vicky was n't expecting the package from Jess at all , but it 's helped her smile in this tough period .
" In this time of crisis , it 's been a time more than ever I 've really valued my family and loved ones -- and Jess is part of that family , " she says .
" It was a welcome boost to morale and a reminder that I 'm not on my own .
With friends like Jess , I know I 'll be alright .

The handwritten window notes  Mayah Riaz , 37 and based in Nottingham , was cried happy tears when her university friend of 18 years , Sarah , delivered a care package and stuck notes to her window .
" I found it difficult not seeing friends and FaceTime just was n't cutting it , " Mayah explains .
" So she got me some shopping and popped it on my doorstep .
She also wrote notes which she stuck on my window so I 'd see them when I pulled the curtains back in the morning .
"  Mayah also received a care package including pyjamas , a candle , face mask , a book , tea bags , nail varnish and perfume .
And her friend gave her a subscription to a course so she could keep busy and occupied during this time .
She was completely blown away that Sarah went to so much effort , when it 's not her birthday or another form of occasion .
" She 's done all this because I was struggling at the thought of being home for so long , " she says .
" It 's had me in tears every time I think about it .

The Zoom call with a difference  Like many of us , Ceriann Smith , 42 , from Manchester , has been getting through the lockdown with Zoom calls .
She 's part of a group of five who all live locally , and have been friends for around six years .
On Saturday night , the group decided the Zoom call needed to be " taken seriously as if we were going out for the night " .
" Dressing up in lockdown for us meant big earrings and bright red lipstick , " says Ceriann .
" For me , it was reason enough to change out of joggers and into a decent outfit .
"  Ceriann 's friend Chrisa , " pulled out all the stops " and joined the call wearing a pink wig .
" We love her for going the extra mile , " Ceriann says .
" We laughed -- a lot -- and are planning to step it up a notch for the next call scheduled for this Thursday .
It turns out we own more colourful wigs between us than we realised ! "  You 're stuck at home , you 're stressed , and you 've got a cupboard full of booze .
It 's tempting to drink more than usual during the coronavirus lockdown -- there 's a communal sense that we " deserve it " for getting through this tough time , plus it 's harder for your boss to detect a hangover on Skype .
But the World Health Organisation has labelled drinking alcohol an " unhelpful " coping strategy for dealing with the stress of isolation and social distancing -- a sentiment echoed by the charity Drinkaware .
" Alcohol is best avoided when you 're anxious , " Drinkaware 's CEO , Elaine Hindal , tells HuffPost UK .
" It 's actually a depressant , and it can interfere with processes in the brain that are important for good mental health , as well as contribute to symptoms of severe depression .
"  READ MORE :  Alcohol also impairs judgement , so drinking more than you usually would may lead to accidents and therefore place an extra burden on health services during this stretched time .
" For example , with drinking one too many while cooking , it 's common to need hospital treatment after burning your arm badly on the oven , " says Hindal .
" Every year , thousands of avoidable accidents and injuries are attributable to alcohol .
"  Drinking heavily may also contribute towards you becoming particularly vulnerable to infections such as coronavirus , Hindal adds .
" That 's because alcohol can suppress a range of immune responses , and this is particularly the case for people who drink very heavily and regularly , " she says .
" Your body 's natural defences against infections may be compromised by excessive alcohol use and this could make you more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections .

So , we know why we should cut down -- but how do you actually do it if you 've slipped into the evening wine habit ? Laura Willoughby , co-founder of the mindful drinking movement Club Soda , gave us five tips .
Play it forward .
" You may not have control over the lockdown , but you 're in control of how you react to it , " says Willoughby .
" Look ahead to who you want to be when this is all over , and focus on the bigger picture .
Where do you want your life to be in 12 months ? What role does alcohol play in this vision of the future you ? "  2 .
Add some alcohol-free drinks to your shop .
You do n't have to ditch booze altogether , but save it for occasions such as the weekend to help maintain a routine and keep your consumption in check , says Willoughby .
Getting some alcohol-free drinks in to kick back in the evenings will help .
" The range of craft beers , spirits and wines are amazing and you can pick them up directly from the producers or from online stores like Wisebartender , as well as the supermarkets , " she says .
" Now is a great time to try out what 's on offer and find a new favourite tipple to help you moderate for the long-term .
"  3 .
Set some boundaries .
If you 've got alcohol in the house , find a new home for it , such as the garage or on top of the wardrobe , so it 's less visible and accessible in your daily routine .
" Have some clear rules about when you 're allowed to drink -- like no drinking when stressed or sad , or only drink with evening meals -- and lengthen your drinks , keeping to single serves with lots of tonic or spritzers to dial down the strength , " adds Willoughby .
" It 's easy to slip into new bad habits so having firm boundaries will keep alcohol in its place .
"  4 .
Talk about it .
If you feel like you 're slipping into bad habits , speak to your partner , friend or family member about it .
They might be able to offer advice , or share how they 're managing to cope .
Similarly , if you 've got a partner or other family member who is drinking a lot , talk to them about what you 're doing to keep your consumption in check , says Willoughby .
You could offer to help a partner or housemate with their health goals , she adds .
Make a project of finding new things to do together that do n't involve drinking .
Get a helping hand .
It 's important to recognise when our booze habits are teetering on dependancy .
Signs it 's getting out of hand include finding it hard to stop at two drinks , wanting to drink early in the morning , and physical symptoms of withdrawal such as sweating , shaking and nausea .
Or , if you did a huge booze shop because you were frightened of it running out and you 're struggling to avoid it , now might be a good time to address that feeling , says Willoughby .
There are resources to help you do this .
" Maybe a course like Club Soda 's Mindful Drinking programmes could help guide you through the next few weeks , " she says .
Alternatively , Drinkaware has an online self-assessment that can help you identify if your relationship with alcohol is about right , or if the amount you drink is risky to your health .
" We would urge anyone who is worried about someone else 's drinking to contact Drinkline on 0300 123 1110 or talk to a trained advisor anonymously online via Drinkchat , " says Hindal .
" The AA are holding online meetings and the Alcohol Health Alliance has a great roundup of online resources for people in recovery .
We Are With You also has advice on accessing services .
"  A new , continuous cough and fever are the two key symptoms to be vigilant of when it comes to coronavirus .
Most people with these symptoms will simply need to self-isolate for seven or 14 days ( depending on whether they live on their own or with others ) and will recover without needing extra help .
But for an estimated one in five people , hospital care will be necessary .
As it stands , people are urged to stay home and keep away from GP surgeries and hospitals if they come down with Covid-19 symptoms in an attempt to reduce the spread of the virus between people and households .

But if they feel they can not cope with their symptoms at home or their condition gets worse , they 're urged to use the NHS 111 online service .
Or , for those who do n't have internet , to call the helpline on 111 .
The issue is , different people have different thresholds when it comes to what actually constitutes feeling unwell .
So when should you seek help ?  Dr Claudia Pastides , a GP working with online private doctor app Babylon , reiterates that most people will experience mild or moderate symptoms that can be managed at home by getting rest , keeping hydrated and taking paracetamol where necessary .
Some people might need to seek help through NHS 111 , however .
Examples of symptoms which warrant this medical advice , says Dr Pastides , include increasing shortness of breath -- struggling to do normal things without feeling breathless , for example -- or feeling so ill that you ca n't carry out your usual daily activities like having a shower , watching TV or preparing a meal .
There may also be more urgent cases , you should call 999 for an ambulance and let them know that you -- or the person you 're caring for -- may have coronavirus , says Dr Pastides .
Such situations include : someone feeling so breathless they ca n't speak more than a few words at a time , developing blue lips or skin , or losing consciousness .
Two days into the coronavirus lockdown , I caught myself deliberately making my meals smaller .
Perhaps I 'll just do half the rice , I thought .
If I use less fish it 'll last longer .
Do I need to have coconut milk when water will do ?  The nagging voice was back , and I had barely noticed .
I was diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia three years ago , after nearly a decade of dancing around the point .
I 'm lucky enough to be able to say that my recovery , while slow , has been steady .
I enjoy life more now than I have for a long time , and feel more at ease in situations that would have sent me into a full-blown crisis a few years back .
But getting better has taken a lot of work .
It has involved the tearing down of a regimented world of silly rules -- do n't eat that , do n't be lazy , do n't let people in -- and the building of a new one in which I try to be a bit kinder , a bit more flexible and a bit more forgiving of myself .
For many eating disorder sufferers like me , life under the coronavirus epidemic will take a lot of adjustment .
Overnight , a new world of grimly necessary rules and standards has been created , many of which seem dangerously close to the old ones we have been battling to shrug off .
Take the new national conversation about food .
Every day now I think about whether there 's enough to go around , whether what I 'm buying is responsible or selfish , if I 'm cooking too much in case it runs out .
It 's hard to tell how much of this is reasonable worrying and how much is the old brain reasserting itself .
Every day now I think about whether there 's enough to go around , whether what I 'm buying is responsible or selfish .
In my weaker moments , I find myself getting a kick out of not being one of the shoppers hoarding food -- and I realise it 's a small step away from the virtuous feeling I used to get watching other people eat lunch while I went without at the nadir of my disorder : They 'll get fat and I wo n't .
They 're taking from NHS staff and I 'm not .
Social distancing too has upset the rhythm I lived by : breakfast at 7 , snack at 11 , lunch at 1 , snack at 3 , dinner at 7 .
Even when the meals were small , I 'd take pride in keeping that structure : challenging the disorder with a pattern that , by and large , kept me properly nourished .
But when there 's no beginning and end to the working day -- no set time at which others are eating too -- I find myself at risk of idle snacking or seven-hour stints on an empty stomach .
Neither of those things help .
A bad day used to be tackled with a run , working for months to find a distance that gave me a good workout but avoided tipping into me compulsive , damaging overexercise .
That too now looks fragile .
Gyms are closed .
Social media buzzes with people berating " selfish " joggers for sweating near them .
There 's talk of closing the parks for good .
People openly quip about putting on the ' corona stone ' .
It 's an unwanted annoyance to them -- but I find myself , once again , seeing it as the worst possible fate .
With much less daily human contact , there are fewer people to spot when I am being absurd , and to shake me out of it .
I find my mouth going dry , panic setting in at the thought of re-emerging Elvis-like from months cooped up here , a waddling version of myself met with howls of laughter .
In the aftermath of a global pandemic , my thoughts go , everyone will be looking at my waistline .
That is the kind of nonsense the unchecked eating disorder brain produces -- and with much less daily human contact , there are fewer people to spot when I am being absurd , and to shake me out of it .
I worry about the people who were nowhere near better when this crisis hit -- and hope they know that , even at a time when the world 's challenges feel huge , their own battle still matters .
" Eating disorders often work to minimise your worries , or make you feel as though your experiences are n't as serious as other people 's , " the eating disorder charity Beat -- which has produced a guide and chatroom specifically tailored to the Covid-19 outbreak -- has said .
And they add : " It may feel as though this concern is backed up by the huge focus on coronavirus , especially if you 're finding it harder to access regular treatment services .
But other health issues are not any less important , and those experiencing them still deserve treatment and support .
"  It 's early days in this strange new world , and spotting that this way of thinking is creeping back in is a positive thing .
It means that a good chunk of what I learned while getting better has lodged itself somewhere in my overheating brain .
But recovery from any mental health condition can be fragile in the face of change -- and those of us with eating disorders will have to be extra vigilant in the weeks ahead .

As soon as reports of a toilet paper shortage fueled by coronavirus panic-buying surfaced , social media mockery followed .
The posts asked , in tones ranging from incredulous to scathing , how stupid are these people ? What does toilet paper have to do with this pandemic ?  On the surface , of course , the answer is nothing .
But I 'm withholding my ire because I fully understand the urge to stock up on essentials .
As a hoarder with anxiety , I do it year-round .
My hoarding has taken various forms , reaching its peak when I lived alone in a two-bedroom Brooklyn apartment so packed with belongings I could barely navigate it .
I 'd have to step over piles of papers , magazines , books and clothes to make my way through the rooms , often tripping and falling as I went , and forcefully pull or push the door to get out or in .
During that time , hoarding was a hazard , to my safety and my mental health .
I hired a personal organizer for $5,000 to help me declutter , only to undo her efforts within weeks of going back to my old ways .
When I finally left that apartment to move into a New Jersey one with my boyfriend , I paid to have junk removers come to my home and clear out the debris .
In the seven years we 've lived together , my hoarding has shifted .
I 've discussed hoarding in therapy , and my boyfriend has made it clear that he wo n't tolerate my hoarding spreading throughout our home .
I no longer have much on the floor except a few stray clothes .
You might not even think I 'm a hoarder if you saw the outward presentation of my home .
But at heart , I still am , much of it locked inside closets , desks and drawers , and locked inside me .
The current circumstances have sharpened my hoarding instincts .
Before you condemn me as a selfish monster , let me share a little about why I find hoarding comforting .
For me , life is a constant unknown , with worst-case-scenario outcomes waiting to be unlocked at every turn , like a video game whose grand prize is eternal mental torture .
Even sleep is n't a respite ; the dreams I remember are almost always horrific , violent nightmares .
When I wake up from these dreams , rather than hazily acclimating to the day or night , it 's as if Homer Simpson 's miserly boss Mr .
Burns has proclaimed " Release the hounds ! " on all those rock-bottom possibilities I 'd hoped to escape from when I put my head down on my memory foam pillow .
It takes no time at all for my anxious mind to concoct more , leading me to catastrophize even when the world around me is running swimmingly -- so you can imagine what happens when the world is as off-kilter as it is now .
To help me feel as grounded as possible , I surround myself with objects that epitomize safety and comfort -- the more of them , the better .
Whereas my boyfriend is a minimalist , I 'm the opposite .
Throwing things out causes me stress , because I 'm always wondering : What if I need or want that item one day in the future ? Accumulating objects , whether it 's useful ones like paper clips or pens or fun ones like stuffed animals , makes me feel like I 'm prepared ( or at least , comforted ) .
For what ? I do n't know -- and that 's exactly the point .
When anything can happen , I need everything to guard me .
Hoarding is a way for me to try to reclaim some form of power over all those unknowns .
Hoarding used to control me , because I saved things but could n't easily locate a precious object when I needed it .
I hoarded old to-do lists and playbills , and pretty much anything that came into my home .
Swag from a conference ? Kept it .
Decades-old holiday cards with simply a signature ? Could n't part with them .
Those all disappeared when I moved , but I 'm not cured .
The way I hoard now is much more strategic .
During this time of social isolation , it 's even more important to me to feel like I 'm ready for whatever comes next .
The things I want to hoard are n't fun foods like giant bags of cheese crisps from Costco , but what I 'm most worried about running out of -- like toilet paper , paper towels , dish soap , decaf coffee , all of which have their own designated space .
The beauty of toilet paper is that I use it every day and know it wo n't go to waste .
More than any other belongings in my home , opening my storage closet and seeing rolls upon rolls of toilet paper , neatly stacked , fluffy , white and seemingly endless , offers me a sense of calm .
It reminds me that even when the present feels utterly out of control -- which is often -- there will be a future where the most pressing issue will be whether to bring another roll into the bathroom with me .
Right now , though , despite being well-stocked a few weeks ago , with my local grocery stores ' shelves bare , my supply has dwindled down to a dozen rolls , and with each roll , I lose a bit of my sense that everything is going to be OK .
Of course , I recognize the immense privilege I have in being able to stay home , in having work , and in having enough food and toilet paper to last me a few weeks -- and that I can afford to get more .
I know not everyone has that luxury .
But in order for me to get anything done other than staring hopelessly at my phone , I need to have a baseline of normalcy .
To achieve that , I 've even shelled out $94 for a case of 96 rolls , the only quantity I 'm seeing available , from a site that I hope actually can get it to me .
If that shipment arrives , I plan to offer some to my neighbors .
To me , this is n't about panic-buying , but about buying peace of mind ? as much of it as is available .
I wish I 'd been born with an innate sense of calm , an inner certainty that everything will be OK , or even " pronoia , " the optimistic opposite of paranoia .
Instead , I gravitate toward an inner truth that tells me doom is always lurking .
Late at night , I 've asked my boyfriend about the questions I 'm too sad to directly ponder during the day : What will we do if we lose our jobs ? Where can we move if we ca n't pay rent ? What happens if one of our family members becomes ill ? Should I update my will ?  Despite the logical knowledge that there 's little I can do to defend against these doomsday scenarios , I still prefer to make my home a fortress of security .
Hoarding has been my downfall , but right now it feels like it can save me -- or at least , save me from myself .
Hoarding is not always about selfishness .
In scary situations , I see it as the ultimate in self-care , a way to placate at least one of the umpteen worries circulating in my head at any given time .
It 's easy to mock hoarders as the troubled people you see on your TV screen , or hate on those staggering out of the grocery store with carts laden with toilet paper .
Washington Post columnist Monica Hesse scolded TP hoarders as either thinking they " are genuinely more worthy of comfort " or not considering that their purchase might deprive someone else of stocking up .
I agree , and think stores should be limiting purchases of essential goods so everyone who needs them can purchase them , but there 's a difference between cleaning out a store and padding your own supply a little bit .
Hoarding is not always about selfishness .
In scary situations , I see it as the ultimate in self-care , a way to placate at least one of the umpteen worries circulating in my head at any given time .
I get that people are anxious about running out ; the Newport , Oregon , Police Department took to Facebook recently to admonish people not to call 911 due to a toilet paper shortage .
I 'm not making light of that , but I believe there 's a hoarding continuum , and that all of us are susceptible to sliding closer to my end of it in times of crisis .
The longer this goes on , the more daily use things I will probably want to hoard -- printer paper , tissues , peanut butter .
The potential lack of any of these items , at home and in our grocery stores , has set my inner alarm bells ringing .
I know when that toilet paper shipment arrives , my mind will get a little quieter , and I 'll feel a little more ready for whatever the future holds .
Stocking up on what I can now feels more proactive than worrying about being out of work or anyone I care about falling ill .
I know not everyone 's in a position to do that , but I also know that this is what I need to maintain my mental health .
My soon-to-arrive surplus rolls are n't , of course , just about going to the bathroom .
They represent the utopian mindset I hope to someday have , where happiness and abundance and inner peace are simply there for the taking , rather than feelings I have to fight my own mind , tooth and nail , to acquire .
In lieu ( or loo ? ) of that ease of being , I 'll reach for a roll , and know that there 's plenty more where it came from .

Game for a graph ?  It was carefully caveated , it was measured , it was eminently sensible .
But for the very first time since these Downing Street press conferences started , chief scientist Sir Patrick Vallance seemed to have a real note of hope in his voice as he detailed the latest Covid-19 statistics .
?  Vallance 's graph , which showed the number of hospital admissions for those with the virus , was of course not good news , in the conventional sense .
The NHS is dealing with roughly a thousand more people every day who present with symptoms of this awful disease .
Some 9,000 people have now been hospitalised with coronavirus and that is undoubtedly " a very difficult number to deal with " , as he was at pains to stress .
With survivors graphically describing how they felt like they were ' drowning ' , it 's a terrifying ordeal , the spectre of death never far away .
Yet Vallance also pointed out the 1,000-a-day number was " not an acceleration " and in fact was " a bit more stable than it has been " .
Moreover , he added : " I expect the number of people coming every day to be about that " , though it may go up ' a little bit ' .
Stabilising the rate of increase in infections would be invaluable in buying the time the NHS needs to increase its critical care beds to deal with those growing numbers .
If , and it is naturally a big ' if ' right now , the number of hospital admissions remains stable then there could be grounds for cautious optimism .
?  Vallance himself said that the figures " may suggest that we 're already beginning to see some effect " .
Given that we have only been in ' lockdown ' for a week , and given the lag in response times , was he suggesting that even pre-lockdown measures ( advice about handwashing and staying 6ft away from others ) are having an impact ? And will the tougher ' stay at home ' edicts since last Monday really now flatten that curve ?  Vallance may have dampened some optimism when he said ( of the hospital numbers ) that " we expect this to get worse over the next few weeks because there 's a lag phase " .
If the absolute number gets worse that 's one thing , but if there is an acceleration then that 's altogether more worrying .
There 's good reason to be cautious .
The number of ' cases ' who have tested positive so far is not exactly meaningless but without widespread testing it is always going to be a massive underestimate of the total number of real cases .
?  And on deaths recorded , those are only for deaths in hospital .
We will find out tomorrow from the Office for National Statistics how many deaths have been ' at home ' rather than in hospital .
As with opinion polls , what matters is not a few possible outliers but the overall trend over a week or weeks .
But still , the fact that the number of deaths was 260 on Saturday , 209 on Sunday and 180 today , may again spark hope in some .
Another aspect of the press conference that would have been welcome to many was Dominic Raab 's urging the police to use ' common sense ' in their own reaction to the lockdown .
Amid reports of one force trying to stop people from buying chocolate Easter eggs , that was a reminder that the coronavirus curve can only be suppressed with public support .
Today , Boris Johnson distanced himself from Margaret Thatcher 's infamous ' no such thing as society ' image .
He is probably also keen to avoid that dreadful John Major line that led many to see him as a heartless robot on the topic of unemployment and inflation : " If it is n't hurting , it is n't working " .
?  Even without any ' acceleration ' , coronavirus is hurting many .
We 'll find out in the next two weeks if the Johnson-Vallance strategy is working .
And if today 's first ember of hope can glow a bit brighter .

However , the slides were not visible to many people watching from home , and the phrase " next slide please " quickly gained traction on social media .
Sir Patrick said at one stage : " This graph shows the total number of people admitted to hospital since the middle of March which is now 8,000 people with coronavirus -- that 's gone up pretty much the same amount each day for the last few days .

"  Fears are mounting NHS workers will run out of protective gowns amid reports the vital piece of clothing was in the national stockpile set aside for a pandemic .
Doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients on the frontline need the full-body medical gowns to shield their bodies from particles that leave them vulnerable to the contagion .
But a report in the Health Service Journal has emerged suggesting hospital chiefs were unable to order the gowns via NHS Supply Chain - the body which manages the supply of healthcare products to the NHS - last week , with procurement bosses sounding the alarm online .
The report quotes a tweet from Health Care Supply Association chief officer Alan Hoskins , since deleted , which said : " What a day , no gowns NHS Supply Chain .
Rang every number escalated to NHS England , just got message back -- no stock , ca n't help , can send you a PPE pack .
Losing the will to live , god help us all .
"  The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association , a trade union for hospital doctors , said in a tweet on Monday that NHS Supply Chain had confirmed the gowns are not included in the national stockpile in preparation for pandemics .
It follows concerns that some NHS trusts in London , where the disease outbreak is at its worst , are set to run out .
The government and NHS Supply Chain have been under increasing pressure to ensure frontline NHS workers have enough personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .
An NHS Supply Chain spokeswoman said gowns will be delivered to frontline staff at hospital trusts in the coming days .
" We have stock on order from the UK and European countries in addition to suppliers based in the Far East to continue to secure a pipeline and replenish our stocks to help ensure these products are delivered to the frontline .
"  The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Monday that a further 180 people diagnosed with the virus had lost their lives , taking the UK death toll to 1,408 .
Jonathan Ashworth , Labour 's shadow health secretary , told HuffPost UK : " There have been widespread concerns about the speed of supply and adequacy of PPE and this frustration will be shared by many on the frontline .
" It 's vital we keep NHS staff safe and ministers must urgently reassure us that no stone is being left unturned in getting everything to frontline staff as rapidly as possible .
"  The UK will provide special charter flights for tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad as countries around the world go into lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic .
Foreign secretary Dominic Raab announced a ? 75m partnership with airlines to bring home tens of thousands of stranded British travellers , who will need to pay for seats on the flights themselves .
British Airways , Virgin , Easyjet , Jet2 and Titan Airways will all take part initially and the list of partner airlines can be expanded .
In countries where commercial flights are still operating , airlines will be responsible for getting people home , including by offering alternative flights for little to no cost when routes have been cancelled , and allowing passengers to change tickets between different airlines .
Addressing people in countries where flights are still available , Raab said : " Do n't wait .
Do n't run the risk of getting stranded .
Please book your tickets as soon as possible .
"  Where there are no commercial flights , the government will provide financial support for special charter flights to bring UK nationals home .
They will be promoted through Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) travel advice and by the relevant embassies and high commissions , and travellers will have to book and pay directly through one travel management company .
The government is providing ? 75m to support those flights to " keep the cost down and affordable " for those seeking to return .
There will be priority for the most vulnerable travellers , including the elderly and those with pressing medical needs , and there will be a focus on countries where there are large numbers of Britons .
" For those stranded or for families nervously awaiting news and wanting to see their loved ones return home , we are doing everything we can .
" We have improved our advice and boosted the call centre so travellers get better and swifter information .
" We have put in place this arrangement with the airlines so that we can reach more British citizens in vulnerable circumstances abroad where commercial flights are n't running .
" And we are working intensively around the block with all of our partner countries and governments around the world to keep open the airports , the ports and the flights that bring people home .
" We have not faced an international challenge quite like this before but together we are going to rise to it .

Home abortions in England , Scotland and Wales are to be made easier during the coronavirus outbreak , the Department of Health has confirmed .
Under a temporary relaxation of the law , the two pills needed to terminate a pregnancy can now be prescribed after an online or phone consultation with a doctor , removing the previous requirement to attend a hospital or clinic in person .
The decision , which is a U-turn on advice issued just a week ago , was warmly welcomed by medical professionals and women 's rights groups who had warned that the national " lockdown " had made it difficult for abortion services to continue .
Over the next 13 weeks , it is estimated that 44,000 women in England and Wales are likely to need access to an early medical abortion .
A total of 13 different organisations -- including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists ( RCOG ) , the Royal College of Midwives and the British Advisory Pregnancy Service ( BPAS ) -- had written to health secretary Matt Hancock to urge him to liberalise the law .
As revealed by HuffPost UK last week , officials in the Department of Health had sent out an email and updated its website to signal a change in the law , but within hours that was withdrawn and Hancock had said there were no plans for a new policy .
However , on Monday , the department changed tack again to announce the shift towards a " temporary " liberalisation .
" Public safety and continued access to key services is our priority during this difficult period .
We are updating our guidance so women who need an abortion up to 10 weeks and ca n't access a clinic can use abortion pills at home , " a spokesperson said .
The change means that women can be prescribed and take at home both pills -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- needed for a medical abortion up to 10 weeks of pregnancy .
Labour MP Stella Creasy told HuffPost UK : " The secretary of state has made the right call reversing their decision to reverse the original guidance and ensure women can still access abortion services in England during the Covid-19 crisis .
" It should never be acceptable that in a crisis women 's healthcare needs are the first in line to be abandoned , so thank you to everyone who spoke up to ensure that this was n't the case .
"  Creasy added that women in Northern Ireland should now be given similar access to healthcare if they require it .
In Northern Ireland , abortion care is now lawful , but services are not yet in place and telemedical abortion care is not permitted .
Edward Morris of the RCOG said : " Giving women the option of taking both abortion pills at home following a video consultation is safe and effective and has rightly been judged as a vital and necessary step if we are to limit the spread of Covid-19 .
" Many women will no longer be forced to make the difficult decision between leaving their home and continuing with an unwanted pregnancy .
"  Ann Furedi , CEO of British BPAS , said : " We welcome the confirmation we have received today that the government will re-instate telemedicine for early medical abortion in England .
" This will prevent tens of thousands of women from having to travel needlessly to clinics and will also enable many of our healthcare professionals to provide teleconsultations and prescriptions from the safety of their own homes .
" BPAS staff have shown superhuman strength over recent weeks in order to prevent the collapse of services and ensure women can access the care they need .

Tiger King debuted on Netflix earlier this month , and has been sitting at the top of the UK streaming platform 's most-watched shows chart for the last few days .
According to Rotten Tomatoes , the documentary is the most popular show on TV right now , thanks in no small part to the number of people currently on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic , which has seen an increase in Netflix activity .
Many , though , believe the constantly changing situation is still not reaching some members of different communities .
" I think people need to hear the coronavirus messages in their own language to have that connection and recognition that it is something that is about them too , " Saima Mohsin , a British Pakistani woman living in south London , told HuffPost UK .
? Unless you see someone who looks like you and sounds like you , you do not necessarily think that what they are talking about applies to you .
"  Mohsin is frustrated that bodies such as the World Health Organisation or Public Health England ( PHE ) have not developed simple coronavirus video messages in all the different and diverse languages that exist in the UK .
Unless you see someone who looks like you and sounds like you , you do not necessarily think that what they are talking about applies to you .
Mohsin  Mohsin added : " There is massive information overload at the moment with daily briefings and health information -- and there is also a lot of conflicting information .
? A lot of people who are not from an English background are probably watching lots of different channels from their countries of heritage and are being bombarded with a lot of confusing and contradictory information .
? But not everyone watches TV and what is needed is messages in different languages which can be shared on different platforms putting across the key coronavirus messages in their simplest form .
"  Dr Samia Latif , who is based in Leicester , is a consultant in communicable disease control and is also chair of the BAME ( Black , Asian and minority ethnic ) network for Public Health England .
Her personal and professional view -- not necessarily that of PHE -- is that there are linguistic and cultural barriers in getting some communities to understand the coronavirus messaging .
" Language is a big hurdle and barrier when it comes to access to health services -- and that 's even in peacetime , let alone when we are dealing with a huge crisis like coronavirus , " she says .
To tackle this , she has recorded a podcast spoken in Urdu and is sharing it to increase awareness .
" I recorded the podcast in Urdu as I felt particularly the elderly in our communities would benefit from hearing it rather than getting confusing messages from other people .
" she told HuffPost UK .
Dr Latif , a mother of three , believes cultural and religious factors are also an issue when it comes to coronavirus preventative measures .
She said it was important to explain the reasoning to communities properly .
" I have heard people in my network say about the coronavirus pandemic : ' This is God 's will -- what will be will be .
'  " I have explained why this is not the correct approach and the way I have explained it to them is that you need ' faith with action ' .
" Yes , you have your faith and that is a good anchor during troubling times .
But faith without action is meaningless .
You need to take action as well .
" All major faiths will agree that it is not right to put other people 's lives at risk .
It is about taking preventative measures to protect other people as well as yourself .
"  While Dr Latif feels there is definitely an issue with a language barrier preventing messages filtering through to some people , she believes pictures and visual images are a great way of increasing awareness -- even for native English speakers .
" I think the messages from government are not fully penetrating through to everyone , even to educated people who have English as their first language .
There are a lot of rumours and scaremongering on social media .
" There are all sorts of misconceptions and people choose to believe what they want to believe unless you give them very clear and simple messaging .
"  Language is a big hurdle and barrier when it comes to access to health services -- let alone when we are dealing with a huge crisis like coronavirusDr Samia Latif  Mohsin , who was an international correspondent and presenter and has covered 28 countries , says her mission is to consider those who mainstream society sometimes does not .
To help increase awareness and education , she has created videos of herself speaking in Punjabi to encourage people to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying at home , and giving them the key messages on how to protect themselves and others .
She said : " The important points to get across are that we all need to take this very seriously , and the gravity of the issue for the most vulnerable .
" I have also highlighted that no one is safe from coronavirus , really , as some people have it without displaying any symptoms .
"  Karishma Patel , 29 , who lives in Preston , says there is a language barrier in some Asian communities , particularly among the older generation , and she feels some people are missing out on the government daily updates on the changing situation as they are only spoken in English .
However , she says that even when there are individuals who do n't speak or understand English , they usually have children or family members who can translate the coronavirus messages to them .
Karishma says social distancing and isolation to tackle coronavirus are especially important within Asian communities as health conditions such as diabetes , heart disease and asthma are common .
" In the Asian community , it is the older generation of parents and grandparents who are not realising the severity of the situation .
" she said .
" I do think there needs to be more messages put out in different languages such as Urdu .
And I feel messages in other languages from authority figures who they respect would help people take the coronavirus pandemic more seriously .
"  Not everyone agrees .
Atifa Hansrot , 25 , who teaches English as a foreign language , feels that the message has started to sink in with all communities , and does n't believe not speaking or understanding English is necessarily a barrier .
" I think maybe people did n't realise the severity of coronavirus at first , but as time has progressed and more and more people are dying of it , the enormity of it all is starting to sink in with everyone .
" she said .
" There are deaths all over the world and this is a global issue so just because you do n't speak English , I do n't think you will be unaware of what is going on .
" I think it is important that people who do n't have English as their own language should be updated regularly by family members who do speak and understand English .
"  Atifa told HuffPost UK that her own mother does n't really speak English but was too afraid to leave the house due to coronavirus even before the lockdown happened .
As a teacher to students who come from countries including the Middle East , Spain and Thailand who she is now teaching via online measures , she said they were petrified and before the lockdown , could n't understand why shops and restaurants in the UK were still open .
" I think the lockdown has played an important part in making people from all communities realise the implications and how serious coronavirus is .
"  At times of anxiety , people are much more reassured and are likely to heed messages in a language that they are familiar with .
It has a calming effect .
Sayeeda Warsi  Baroness Sayeeda Warsi , a member of the House of Lords and pro-vice-chancellor at the University of Bolton , has also recorded a few videos in Urdu to explain issues around coronavirus and to clarify social distancing to people .
Some 180 hospital patients in the UK have died of coronavirus in 24 hours , the latest figures show , bringing the UK total to 1,408 .
The statistics were released individually by public health chiefs in all four nations before being confirmed by the Department of Health and Social Care hours later .
The four nations ' 24-hour increases match the department , but they had self-reported total death counts that came to 1,415 overall .
It was not immediately clear whether the DHSC or one of the four nations was responsible for the discrepancy .
The deaths over a 24-hour period include 159 in England , one in Northern Ireland , 14 in Wales and six in Scotland .
Correction : an earlier version of this story stated that there had been an additional 22 deaths in Northern Ireland .
In fact there was a single additional death , bringing the total for that nation to 22 .
Politicians are telling us that the fight against Covid-19 is being led by expert advice .
They make managing health emergencies sound straightforward : experts advise , politicians listen and policy gets made .
Yet we are still seeing conflicting advice around questions such as , do we stay one or two metres apart ? Do we self-isolate for seven or 14 days if we are showing symptoms ? And why are we diverging in how seriously we treat the pandemic , how we deal with it and how we prevent it in future ?  The history of the World Health Organisation shows how global health has never just been about governments following expert advice .
We must be honest about the political forces which are shaping responses to the pandemic .
In 1946 a group of experts gathered in Paris to discuss plans for a new organisation , which became the WHO .
They all shared one key idea : the new body should be ' non-political ' .
Many of them had worked with the WHO 's predecessor , the League of Nations Health Organisation , which had been dragged down by the League 's failure in the 1930s .
To avoid the same fate , they argued that the WHO should be independent of the UN ( the reason why it 's not called the United Nations Health Organisation ) , that it should be a purely technical body above political conflict and that every country should be a member .
The WHO 's first director general predicted a new era of global health cooperation which would ' bring all the people in the world together .
'  The reality did n't live up to their hopes .
The major powers made sure that governments kept control of the WHO 's work and its budget .
Certain countries were excluded or withdrew for political reasons , like the socialist bloc countries in the 1950s .
And its early work , particularly on diseases like polio and smallpox , was shaped by Cold War tensions .
The Covid-19 crisis has dragged the organisation into the global spotlight .
The WHO 's director general , Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , has become a household name , and the organisation has won praise for its public information campaigns on social media .
Its work coordinating health experts around the world has become more vital than ever .
But the crisis has also shown how the WHO 's work is far from being ' non-political ' in the way its founders had aimed for .
Because of Chinese opposition , Taiwan has had to fight the pandemic without the benefits of WHO membership .
WHO advice has sparked political rows about national policies , not least in the UK .
And the crisis has drawn attacks from US conservatives , who have criticised the WHO 's supposed deference to the Chinese government .
It is clear that governments are not always listening to the WHO .
When Dr Tedros addressed G20 leaders last Thursday , he called for a united global response to the pandemic .
But the meeting failed to produce the kind of globally coordinated action seen during the 2008 financial crisis .
Governments are continuing to focus on national containment rather than cross-border cooperation .
The line between technical expertise and politics is sometimes blurred .
So why is politics apparently getting in the way of the experts and their advice ?  The line between technical expertise and politics is sometimes blurred .
Experts themselves often straddle the divide .
Dr Tedros , for example , is both a leading international expert on infectious diseases and a former Ethiopian foreign minister .
The same was true of many of the experts who founded the WHO .
This certainly does n't mean that experts should be distrusted .
But the idea of purely technical expertise entirely divorced from the murky realm of politics is too simplistic .
When politicians ignore advice it 's sometimes because they just do n't trust experts , as seems to be the case with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro .
But it is also because dealing with pandemics on the scale of Covid-19 is ' political ' in the purest sense -- concerned with the exercise of power over a population .
Politicians tell us they are listening to the experts partly because they want to avoid taking responsibility for their own decisions and make us forget their own inefficiencies and flaws .
When it comes to dealing with pandemics on a global scale , the politics of global health is even more important .
International responses to the current crisis will not just be shaped by the technical advice of WHO experts , but by the political dynamics which govern our world today -- the rise of populism and the far right , the conflict between China and the US , and the inequalities between rich and poor countries .
And it 's important to note that political influence is not necessarily a bad thing .
The eradication of smallpox in the 1970s might never have been achieved without the impetus which came from the Cold War tensions between the US and the Soviet Union .
We ca n't get through this crisis without listening to experts .
The desire of those experts in 1946 to create a ' non-political ' WHO was an admirable one -- we can appreciate today how political conflict can get in the way of fighting disease .
But the partial failure of their vision also tells us something important .
Global health is always entangled with global politics , and we must be honest about the political forces which will shape the fight against Covid-19 .
Dr David Brydan is a lecturer in the history of modern international relations at King 's College London  The UK is resisting pressure to extend the Brexit transition period amid the coronavirus pandemic and has insisted trade negotiations are continuing " informally " .
MEPs have warned the UK faces a " double whammy " if Boris Johnson insists on quitting the EU 's single market at the end of a year likely to be heavily disrupted by coronavirus .
The centre-right European People 's Party ( EPP ) , the largest group of MEPs in the European Parliament , stressed that extending the transition period beyond the end of the year was now " the only responsible thing to do " given the already tight timetable for agreeing a trade deal and the economic disruption of the pandemic .
But in response the prime minister 's official spokesman said : " The transition period ends on December 31 2020 .
" This is enshrined in UK law .
"  The spokesman also claimed that no EU countries had asked the UK to extend the transition , and that negotiations were ongoing despite the cancellation of face-to-face talks earlier this month .
" We have shared legal texts and they are the subject of informal discussions between ourselves and the EU Commission , " the spokesman said .
" They are basically conversations which are taking place via telephone as both sides analyse each other 's respective legal texts .
" We would expect those sorts of conversations to be carrying on this week .
"  Asked if the negotiations were still on track , he said : " As we discussed at the beginning of those both sides know the deadline which we are working towards .
" The structure of the negotiations has changed to reflect the current situation with regard to coronavirus , so there are more continuous discussions taking place rather than the set rounds which were originally envisaged .
"  European Commission spokesman Daniel Ferrie confirmed that talks between the EU and UK are " ongoing " and said both sides would provide clarifications on their proposals through " technical " exchanges between officials .
But the EPP said the coronavirus epidemic further complicated what many in Brussels already regarded as an unrealistically tight timetable for securing a deal .
MEP Christophe Hansen , a negotiator on the parliament 's international trade committee , said : " Under these extraordinary circumstances , I can not see how the UK government would choose to expose itself to the double whammy of the coronavirus and the exit from the EU single market , which will inevitably add to the disruption , deal or no deal .
" I can only hope that common sense and substance will prevail over ideology .
An extension of the transition period is the only responsible thing to do .
"  The warning comes as the EU-UK joint committee set up to implement the withdrawal agreement was set to meet for the first time .
Because of the outbreak , the talks will take place by video conference , with the British side led by Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and the EU by European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic .
The EU 's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is reportedly continuing to recover after contracting the coronavirus earlier this month .
German MEP David McAllister , who chairs the UK co-ordination group in the parliament , said now was the time for the UK to change tack over an extension to the transition .
From jigsaws to gardening , there 's lots of things we 've found ourselves doing during lockdown that we would n't usually -- and it seems we can now add crying at the Backstreet Boys to that list .
The boys recorded a surreal coronavirus-era rendition version of their hit I Want It That Way for Elton John 's Living Room Concert , which was televised in the US on Sunday night , and we have to admit we found it strangely emotional .
The five lads -- AJ McLean , Howie Dorough , Nick Carter , Kevin Richardson , and Brian Littrell -- are all social distancing in their respective homes in America at the moment , but through the magic of technology , filmed a version of their most famous song .
It certainly puts our HouseParty quizzes to shame , that 's for sure .

Buyers and renters have been left in limbo since the government issued new guidance about moving homes .
They were told : do n't do it unless absolutely necessary .
This has resulted in a lot of confusion , with many wondering whether they can still go ahead without being fined for doing so .
Alexa Cobbold , 31 , has been in the process of buying a house for several months and was near to exchanging before the lockdown hit .
The digital PR account manager , who lives with her partner in Leeds , told HuffPost UK : " We 're not even sure what 's going on anymore as our estate agents are not letting us know what 's happening .
"  While she recognises they 're fortunate as they 're still living in a nice flat , she said it 's " frustrating " to be in this state of limbo .
Related .
One of Cobbold 's primary concerns is whether their mortgage offer will last beyond this period -- particularly as they did n't get to the point of exchanging .
As it stands , mortgage lenders may be able to let customers who have exchanged contracts extend their mortgage offer for up to three months .
But the likelihood is that the rest will have to start over .
Another reader told us the delay was a " gut punch " as they 'd been waiting five years to move back north to their hometown but were unable to up until now due to child custody arrangements .
So if you 're in a similar situation -- whether you 're renting or buying -- what do you need to know ?  What is the new guidance ?  For buyers and sellers , the new guidance states that where the property being moved into is empty , people can continue because the risk of catching Covid-19 is far lower .
However , where the property being moved into is occupied , the government is encouraging people to " amicably agree alternative dates to move " .
Colby Short , founder and CEO of estate agent comparison site GetAgent .
, believes the market could see 290,000 transactions at risk .
There 's no need to pull out of a move , the government states , but you still need to ensure you 're following guidance to stay at home and away from others at all times .
This is easier said than done when you 're in a lengthy chain .
Rob McKellar , head of residential conveyancing at law firm Slater and Gordon , tells HuffPost UK that if the property you 're moving into is occupied , " it can still proceed if the move is essential " .
Anyone with symptoms , or who is self-isolating or shielding from the virus , should follow medical advice and not move house for the time being .
So you wo n't be fined if you move house ?  Some buyers contacted HuffPost UK anonymously with concerns they 'd be fined if they continued to move house .
If a move is critical and a new date can not be agreed , then " it is exempted from the emergency police powers and home movers can not , in those circumstances , be fined " , said McKellar .
" Where contracts have exchanged , this would qualify as a critical move if the seller and buyer can not reach agreement around alternative arrangements .
Equally , where a move is urgent and essential but contracts have not yet exchanged , this would qualify and movers can not be fined .
"  If you do go ahead , you must follow social-distancing guidance during the process -- so staying two metres away from others and regularly washing hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds .
Removal firms should still be in operation at this time and honour moves that have been booked in .
The latest guidance , as of 26 March , states that work carried out in people 's homes can continue , provided the tradesperson is well and has no symptoms or coronavirus .
How should estate agents be helping those who are moving ?  Short , from GetAgent .
, said estate agents have a valuable role to play and it 's important they keep clients in the loop .
The government has advised estate agents to " progress sales where this can be done " whilst following guidance to stay at home and away from others .
However , Jenny Jones* , a 28-year-old teacher , said she received little information from her estate agents .
Jones is currently living in a flat with her boyfriend in Boreham Wood and they 're looking to buy their first home together .
The process has been a " rough ride " anyway due to a big chain , she said .
Before coronavirus hit the UK , they were close to exchanging -- there was just one survey left to be done .
On Friday , the estate agents broke their silence to confirm everything is on hold with their move .
" It is down to the nation 's estate agents to demonstrate their worth by acting as the lynchpin between both buyers and sellers to keep them as informed as possible via any and all channels of communication , " said Short .
What if you 're renting ?  The government has advised renters not to move -- however , this is only guidance .
For people who had planned to move into a rental accommodation , McKellar said where contracts have exchanged or a tenancy agreement has been signed by both the landlord and the tenant , these documents will remain legally binding and enforceable .
" Neither a contract nor a tenancy agreement says you have to physically move on a specific day , " he added .
" What they usually say is that money must change hands on a specific day , and the landlord must make the property available for the tenant to move into on a specific day .
"  This means if you were worried you 'd signed an agreement and had to move on a set day , but were self-isolating or wanted to hold off moving because of the latest advice , you are within your rights to delay moving .
If you 're unsure about the status of your move , contact the landlord or estate agent .

What if you 're selling up ?  If your property had been on the market , but you were yet to have a buyer , you could boost its value in the meantime with some tactful renovations during the lockdown period .
" If you have the right equipment and know-how , easy fixes include a freshly-painted exterior or front door , cleaning the windows , clearing gutters and tidying the driveway , " said Mike Scott , chief property analyst at Yopa estate agency .
" Now is also a great time to get out in the garden .
With many people cooped up in flats just as the sun has started shining , outdoor space will be rising on the list of must-haves for buyers .
" Starting a regular weeding routine , mending any broken fences or giving them a lick of paint , cutting the grass and planting some new seeds could be all it takes to make your garden stand out from the rest .
"  The Trump administration has determined that the firearms industry -- from manufacturing to retail sales and shooting ranges -- is a " critical " service that should continue to operate amid the coronavirus crisis .
The firearms industry was added Saturday to a federal list created a week earlier of " essential critical infrastructure " elements during the COVID-19 emergency .
Other critical operations on the lengthy list include energy , telecommunications , food production , emergency services , government offices , transportation and health care .
The list is not a directive , but advisory for states and municipal governments as many shut down inessential businesses to help stem the spread of COVID-19 .
It 's " intended to help state , local , tribal and territorial officials as they work to protect their communities while ensuring continuity of functions critical to public health and safety , as well as economic and national security , " said the CISA statement .
Adam Skaggs , chief counsel and policy director of the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence , said it 's time now to focus on the " health and safety of all Americans -- not the bottom line of the gun industry .
"  The centre warned that " panic-buying " of firearms by a fearful public during the pandemic crisis will " help no one , " and " poses serious dangers .
"  Officials " should make decisions based on .
public health experts , not misinformation spread by gun industry actors attempting to profit off this crisis , " the centre warned .
Our supermarket habits are changing .
We 're trying to make the foods we have in our cupboards last longer , reduce waste , avoid stockpiling -- and limit the amount of times we need to head out to the shops .
To make things a little easier -- and make sure you save every portion of food -- here are some items you have safely put in the freezer .

Why freeze ?  It makes the food we buy last longer .
A freezer acts like a " pause button " , explains the Food Standards Agency -- meaning the food in a freezer does n't deteriorate and most bacteria ca n't grow in it .
Basically , the bacteria are still alive , but they stop growing or producing toxins , in effect pausing reactions .
You can freeze pre-packaged food right up to the ' use by ' date -- leftovers and homemade goods should be frozen as soon as possible .
Make sure any warm dishes are cooled before putting them in your freezer .
And , to stop cold air in your freezer drying out your food , place it in an air-tight container or wrap it well in freezer bags or freezer wrap .
Helen White , special advisor at Love Food Hate Waste , says labelling what 's in your freezer is always a good idea so you avoid UFOs -- unidentified frozen objects ! " And pop the date on your label too , " she tells HuffPost UK , " so you know how long it 's been in there .
" Your food in theory can stay in the freezer as long as you need , but the quality will start to deteriorate after about 3 -- 6 months , so keep an eye on those dates ! "  Cheese .
" Grated cheese freezes brilliantly and you can just grab a handful whenever you need it .
"  Herbs .
" Fresh herbs can be hard to use up in time , so chop them up , sprinkle them into ice cube trays , and pour in a bit of water .
You can add these to the pan next time you 're making a sauce , stir fry , or curry ! "  All your veggie offcuts and peels .
" Keep a container or reusable freezer bag in one of the freezer drawers and add whatever peelings you 've got .
When it 's full , use to make stock .
"  Bread .
" We all knew you could freeze bread , right ? Pop your sliced loaf in the freezer ( tap it on the counter first to separate the slices ) , and you can grab one whenever you fancy a bit of toast .
"  Leftover portions .
" These make perfect homemade ' ready meals ' for when you need something quick and easy .
Let your leftovers cool down before freezing and then you can keep them for another day .

How to defrost  When defrosting the food , there are a few guidelines to follow to make sure you 're doing it safely .
Do n't defrost food at room temperature , advises the FSA -- ideally , it should be defrosted fully in the fridge .
But if this is n't possible , you can use a microwave on the defrost setting directly before cooking .
Also , make sure your food is fully defrosted before cooking .
Partially defrosted food may not cook evenly , meaning that harmful bacteria could survive the cooking process .
Once food has been defrosted , eat it within 24 hours .
In his latest column for The Sun , published over the weekend , the former Top Gear presenter suggested that those who still have to go out while the country is on lockdown should try and get to their destination by driving .
He also suggested that driving restrictions , such as parking limitations and traffic cameras , should be abolished during the pandemic .
In the piece , titled " I have the answer to going out and staying safe .
it 's called a motor car " , Clarkson wrote : " I have a helpful suggestion for people who really do need to get to work .
A suggestion that no one will have considered .
It 's a means of transport that 's virus proof .
" You ca n't be infected when you 're inside it and you ca n't pass your infection on to anyone else .
It 's called the ' motor car ' .
"  He continued : " During the Covid-19 outbreak , when it 's important we keep our distance , all ? parking restrictions should be lifted .
" Cars should be allowed to use both bus and cycle lanes and all traffic cameras should be turned off .
I know this flies in the face of what the eco-mentalists say is good for us but buses are petri dishes so park them at the depot .
" Trains and the Tube are no better , so turn off the power immediately .
In the last three months of last year , 32 million people in this country had jobs .
And that 's handy because at the last count there were 32 million cars registered for use on the road .
" This means that everyone can get to their place of work , safely , in a virus-proof cocoon .
Strange is n't it .
For years we were told that cars would one day kill us all .
But now it 's obvious that actually , they are our knights in shining armour .
"  The following day , the Daily Mail published an article on their website based around the comments made in his column , with the headline : " ' You ca n't get coronavirus in a car ! ' Jeremy Clarkson urges people to keep driving during Covid-19 crisis amid government advice to stay at home .
"  However , the divisive quiz show host took issue with the piece , insisting on Twitter : " This is NOT what I said .
I said that if you need to go to work , or the shops , you should drive .
And parking restrictions and the congestion charge should be removed .
"  Gogglebox star Lee Riley has explained why he and on-screen partner Jenny Newby still appeared together in the most recent episode , despite the current lockdown .
Since they first began appearing on the hit Channel 4 show in 2014 , Lee has always joined best friend Jenny in her caravan to pass comment on the week of TV .
However , government rules aiming to prevent the spread of coronavirus mean that people are not allowed to accept visitors at their homes , unless there is a medical reason or they need to tend to a vulnerable person .
Answering any possible questions viewers might have had about how he had managed to get round the rules in order to film Gogglebox , Lee revealed he has actually moved in with Jenny so they can continue to do the show together during this period of social distancing .
He tweeted : " Jenny and me watching together as we are both on lockdown TOGETHER .
"  " Friends with no benefits I may add , " he joked .
Well what can we say it 's Friday and it 's still on #Gogglebox ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Jenny and me watching together as we are both on lockdown TOGETHER friends with no benefits I may add ? ? ? ? an hour of laughs stay safe stay well #StayHomeSavesLives  HuffPost UK has contacted a Gogglebox spokesperson to clarify if this is also the case for other families from the show who do n't all live in the same household .
The show 's makers recently announced that they had taken measures to allow " the families to take part without any contact from crew " with their homes fitted with remote cameras .
Channel 4 's director of programming Ian Katz said : " The coronavirus outbreak is an enormous creative challenge for all broadcasters and though it is having a profound impact on getting some of our productions onto screen , it 's also a time when public service broadcasters like Channel 4 can step up and help people navigate through the extraordinary challenges we all now face .

Harries said the three-week reviews on the measures to slow the disease 's spread are likely to continue for six months and their success would be judged on slowing its rate .
A sudden lifting , she said , could see the nation 's sacrifices " wasted " with another spike in deaths , which have reached 1,228 .
" We need to keep that lid on and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal , " she said .
Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said " we simply can not and should not " ask health workers to go to the frontline without adequate protective equipment , as he announced the nation was put on an " emergency footing " in an " unprecedented step in peace time " .

With a lack of equipment ( and sometimes motivation ) , there 's many of us who are struggling to adapt our gym routines for working out at home .
But spare a thought for Rita Ora , who has suffered an unfortunate exercise fail while doing a home workout .
The singer had been attempting to mobilise her fans with an Instagram Live of her exercising .
Rita had just got to the jump squats round of her workout when things took a rather unexpected turn due to the low ceiling of the room she was exercising in .
Trying to demonstrate the move , she squatted down low before thrusting herself in the air , but whacked her head on the ceiling above a bay window .
After a rather loud clunk could be heard on her livestream , she yelped : " Ouch ! Ah why am I so stupid ? I am losing my mind I am literally losing my mind , this is insane .
I banged my head on the window .
"  It certainly kept Radio 1 DJ Greg James entertained , who tweeted out a clip of the incident , writing : " Your first laugh of the day courtesy of @RitaOra .

Here are the latest updates on Covid-19 :  Huge Navy hospital ship arrives in New York City  The USNS Comfort -- a massive converted oil tanker used by the US Navy as a hospital ship -- arrived in New York City on Monday , in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure on healthcare services dealing with coronavirus crisis .
The 1,000-bed vessel had been undergoing planned maintenance but was rushed back into service to aid the city .
It 's understood the ship will deal with non-coronavirus cases , freeing up capacity in overstretched hospitals .
The state is fast becoming the global epicentre of the outbreak and accounts for almost half of the US 's 141,883 cases and more than a third of its 2,477 deaths , according to a Reuters tally .
Large sections of New York City 's iconic Central Park have also been converted to a new field hospital .
The USNS Comfort arrived at a Manhattan pier a week after its sister ship , the USNS Mercy , arrived in Los Angeles to perform a similar duty on the West Coast .
The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner .
It also has ICU beds , a lab and a pharmacy .
The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the US Navy , and some reservists .
Abortion rules relaxed after another health department U-turn  Abortion rules have been changed for the second time in just over a week to allow women to take pills at home during the coronavirus pandemic .
Last Monday , the Department of Health and Social Care ( DHSC ) said it would allow women and girls to take abortion pills at home , and for doctors to prescribe from their homes .
Just hours later , the statement was removed from the department 's website , with officials saying it was " published in error " .
Health secretary Matt Hancock later told MPs that abortion rules would not be changed as part of the response to the Covid-19 outbreak .
But now , in another U-turn , the department has said women needing an abortion up to 10 weeks can use abortion pills at home after a consultation with a medical practitioner over the phone or via the internet .
In a letter to various health bodies , the DHSC said Hancock has also approved measures to allow doctors to prescribe the medicines -- Mifepristone and Misoprostol -- from their homes .
The measures will last for up to two years .
It is understood the updated guidance has not yet been made public .
Carluccio 's and BrightHouse fall into administration  Carluccio 's and BrightHouse have collapsed into administration , casting a shadow over the future the 4,500 the two companies employ .
The former , a dining chain founded by Antonio Carluccio in 1991 , confirmed it has hired advisory firm FRP to oversee its administration .

Geoff Rowley , joint administrator and partner at FRP , said : " We are operating in unprecedented times and the issues currently facing the hospitality sector following the onset of Covid-19 are well documented .
"  Controversial rent-to-own retailer BrightHouse also sank into administration on Monday , just days after it closed all its stores due to the coronavirus outbreak .
Julie Palmer , a partner at restructuring expert Bebgies Traynor , said : " Coronavirus was the final nail in the coffin for BrightHouse .
" It was already wrapped up and squeezed by payment claims against it and new regulations were having a detrimental effect to its business model .
" As soon as its stores closed due to the pandemic it looked inevitable that this business would break .
"  Cabin crew will staff new coronavirus hospitals  Cabin crew will help staff the new Nightingale hospitals built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic , the NHS said .
Staff at Virgin Atlantic and EasyJet have been invited to volunteer at the new 4,000-bed clinic being built at the Excel centre in east London , and those planned in Birmingham and Manchester .
Volunteers will perform support roles such as changing beds after receiving expert training .
The news came as EasyJet announced it was grounding its entire fleet due to " unprecedented travel restrictions " caused by the Covid-19 outbreak , with bosses saying " there can be no certainty of the date for restarting commercial flights " .
EasyJet has already written to its 9,000 UK-based staff -- including 4,000 cabin crew trained in CPR -- to invite them to give their time to the NHS , with Virgin Atlantic set to ask 4,000 of its employees on Monday .
Any crew who sign up to volunteer will have their salaries paid by their airline .

"  Mercedes F1 team helps to develop breathing aid  A breathing aid that could help keep coronavirus patients out of intensive care has been developed by a group of researchers .
The continuous positive airway pressure machine ( CPAP ) , which delivers oxygen to the lungs without the need for a ventilator or for the patient to be sedated , was developed by a group including researchers from the Mercedes Formula One team and University College London .
The device was developed in under 100 hours from an initial meeting to production of the first CPAP .
Pending successful trials this week , it is hoped the machine could be distributed through the NHS , with the BBC reporting that the device already has regulatory approval .
Mercedes has said it could produce up to 1,000 of the new CPAP machines a day .
The device has reportedly been designed within a week by modifying and improving an existing model .
Professor Rebecca Shipley , director of the UCL Institute of Healthcare Engineering , said 50% to 60% of patients who were treated with the CPAP devices did not progress to mechanical ventilation .
" We already have 100 from Mercedes and UCL and UCLH which we are currently testing in our first patient trials , " she told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme .
" Mercedes can make 1,000 a day within a week and if the tests go well they can be in the NHS by the end of this week .

Donald Trump extends US coronavirus guidelines by a month  Donald Trump has said that US guidelines to prevent the spread of coronavirus will be extended to April 30 as deaths from the pandemic in the country continue to rise .
The president had previously said rules calling for social-distancing could be relaxed as early as Easter , with the initial 15-day period set to expire on Monday .
However , Trump 's impulse to restore normality met a sober reality check on Sunday from Dr Anthony Fauci , the government 's top infectious disease expert , who said the US could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic .
The federal guidelines recommend against large group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay at home .
People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants , bars , non-essential travel and shopping trips .
Many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on movement and gatherings .
The US had more than 137,000 Covid-19 cases reported by late Sunday afternoon , with more than 2,400 deaths .
Coronavirus fake news unit ' dealing with 10 stories a day '  The government 's unit to tackle fake news about coronavirus is dealing with as many as 10 articles a day .
The Rapid Response Unit -- which operates from within the Cabinet Office and No .

Up to 70 incidents a week , often false narratives containing multiple misleading claims , are being identified and resolved , the government said .

"  Dr Salaj Masand , one of the initiatives ' founders , told the Evening Standard : " It was a complete surprise , we did n't reach out to any celebrities - the crowdfunding company just pointed out that he had made a donation .
" We 're all speechless and it 's absolutely humbling that not only him but members of the public trusted us to deliver what we said we would .
"  Speaking about his decision to donate on Monday 's Good Morning Britain , James said : " You ca n't take it with you , which is something people have said for as long as we 've been making money , but we might not be taking it with us sooner rather than later .
" One of the incredible things that 's happening right now across the world is we are prioritising our health service , our care for the elderly , we are looking inwards , we are spending time with our families -- there are weird positives to come out of this new reality we find ourselves in , but one of the massive things is we 're all coming together regardless of financial status , birthright status .
We 're all in the exact same boat .
So far , the four doctors who launched the campaign have raised nearly ? 850,000 for PPE , as of Monday morning .
They had initially hoped to raise ? 200,000 , but later increased their target to ? 900,000 following the " phenomenal outpouring of support " .
They wrote on the crowdfunding page : " Unfortunately , current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can , healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients .
" Healthcare workers on the frontline without PPE ( personal protective equipment ) is the equivalent of going to war without armour and protection .
"  As well as the donation , James also made a video in support of the campaign .
He said : " NHS staff are heroes .
We must do all that we can to protect them , support them and thank them .
" Nurses and doctors have described a lack of personal protective equipment .
" Caring for people with Covid-19 without access to proper masks , goggles , gowns and gloves puts themselves and others at risk .
" That 's why I 'm supporting the efforts of four NHS doctors .
to plug this urgent gap .
Thank you NHS .

Make a silly video  If you 've got an iPad you do n't mind the kids using , a phone , or even an old-fashioned video camera -- the easiest way to keep them entertained is by letting them take silly videos of each other , or themselves .
Teach them the old trick of : record , pause , take something away , and record again -- to make it look like the " thing " or person has magically disappeared .
Remember to always keep your kids ' online safety at the front of your mind , though .
Make sure WiFi is disabled or child safety controls are activated so they ca n't post or send anything online without your permission .
Create a post box  I stole this idea from my son 's nursery homework -- but it 's simple , and most importantly , keeps kids entertained for about five minutes .
All you need is an empty PG Tips box or an old shoe box .
Cut out a 2-inch wide ' slot ' , and have your child either paint it red , or colour in a couple of pieces of paper with red crayon .
Stick them on to cover it .
then bargain with them to write a bunch of letters .
To their friends , their relatives , to their toys or to each other .
Bung them in the post box and stick it next to the front door until you can get to a real one .

Form a production line  This is cheating , because it probably belongs in the ' household chore ' section , but as every average parent knows -- make one activity sound like two , and you 're basically winning .
The ' production line ' idea works on the proviso of old childhood games -- the ones where you had to get from one side of the room to the other , without touching the floor .
I have my children pass things to each other , hand by hand -- we first line all of the things up in a row , so the transferral is seamless -- and they take turns standing on a stool to put them away neatly in the fridge .
Note : is also known more commonly as , " putting away the shopping " .
Make your own treasure hunt  This one comes courtesy of playHOORAY founder Claire Russell , who has a bunch of stay-at-home entertainment ideas available to download on her website .
Russell suggests creating a treasure hunt for household items and letting your kids run around for a while doing that .
She also suggests an alternative : going on a word hunt in a newspaper or magazine , or making your own word-search .
Trampoline time  My biggest lesson through the days of enforced isolation so far has been that trampolines are the world 's best invention , bar none .
If you 're fortunate to have some outdoor space , and it 's big enough to host an enclosed oval-shaped trampoline , get one .
My children barely gave it a look before , but now they 've got limited options , they 're spending hours out there .
Hours .
What 's more , it 's not just for bouncing .
They 've taken blankets out there and made dens , had teddy bear picnics , read books and used it as a wrestling ring .
If we 're still doing this in the summer , I fully intend to let them take sleeping bags out there and spend the night zipped inside it .
Anything , for a bit of peace .
You 're reading How I Cope , a series sharing self-care tips as we all adjust to the coronavirus pandemic .
There 's the tree blossom , obliviously starting its spring parade .
Then tulips , proudly standing in my neighbour 's garden .
Next , the abandoned packet of prawn cocktail crips , blowing across the street like tumbleweed .
And finally , a child 's coat as she toddles alongside her family -- across the road , of course , at a strict distance of at least two metres .
What do all four have in common ? They 're pink : my colour of the day .
And no , the coronavirus pandemic has n't caused me to regress to a reception-aged pupil .
I 'm writing this two weeks into working from home and almost one week into the UK lockdown .
Each day , I 've been trying to practise a simple mindfulness technique while out on my walk or run : you pick a colour , then see how many things you can count in that colour .
" If I 'm at home and I 'm feeling panicky , I try to just acknowledge where I am by looking around the room and looking for five things in a certain colour , " she told me .
" It brings you back to the room and gets you concentrating on something else .
"  The concept is so simple , yet it really does work .
Before I started using it , my lunchtime walks involved pacing up the road , stuck in my head , physically moving but mentally focussed on the latest coronavirus news .
My break was n't really a break at all and I noticed I was increasingly catastrophising , thinking about the worst case scenario .
Then , I spotted that first blossom and the world felt a bit brighter .
I remembered Rebecca 's words and decided to see how many other pink things I could spot .
Within minutes , my heartbeat slowed and my mind was given a genuine break from the C-word .
I 've used the technique almost every day since and each little burst of colour is a reassuring reminder that life continues -- even the litter .
You can try the technique with sounds or other focus points , too ; my fianc ? decided to count bees on our recent weekend wander .
His exited exclamations of " 10 ! " , " 11 ! " provided much-needed interruptions to the virus-related chat .
It may sound silly , but it gave two stressed-out adults approaching 30 a brief reminder of childhood escapism .
And with social distancing firmly in place , there was no one around to raise an eyebrow anyway .
Of course , counting colours or bees wo n't fix everything -- when you 've got loved ones in vulnerable groups , or risking their lives as front line health workers , it 's impossible not to worry .
Keeping the lid on the panic is a daily challenge , but armed with this little trick , it 's a challenge I 'm winning most days .
By now , many of us have been working from home for a couple of weeks -- and are probably settled in a spot in our home where we like to work .
But without the chair we usually have in the office , or the double screens some of us are lucky to use , it can be a bit .
achey , to say the least .
Find yourself hunching over to look at your laptop screen ? Or constantly rearranging yourself on your chair because it 's just so uncomfortable ? You 're not alone .
We do n't know how long we 're going to be working from home , so it 's best to make our set-up as pain-free as possible while we 're here .
" Most of us have found ourselves unexpectedly working from home for the foreseeable future , " says Jo Blood , resident ergonomics expert at Posture People .
" Whilst it poses many challenges , a well set-up workspace is something that can provide us with a tangible way to feel better and prevent aches and pains further down the line .
For the time being , we can utilise everyday household items to achieve a better , more ergonomic workspace .

Here , posture and ergonomics experts explain the hacks you can use to make WFH a little bit more comfortable .
Raise your laptop so you are n't hunched .
" This is the biggest back problem , " says Jane Sparrow , remote working expert and founder at The Culture Builders .
Work at a surface that keeps it high , or bung a load of books underneath it .
As a rule of thumb , Blood says you want to raise it so that the top of your laptop screen is in line with your eyebrows .
A laptop stand is a great alternative to books , if you have one or are willing to buy one .
Or , Bronwyn Clifford , chartered physiotherapist and ergonomics Consultant at Ergo at Work suggests using a lever arch file/folder .
" These make fantastic laptop risers allowing you to raise the laptop screen slightly when working , " she says .
" They can be used when sitting at a table or on even a sofa .
If sitting on a sofa raise the laptop on a cushion as well as a lever arch file to help you to keep your head back over your shoulders in a neutral position .
"  Use cushions as a bumper .
" Your kitchen table is the perfect place to work , but be aware that the average table is around 3cm higher than your desk , and your kitchen chair 3cm lower , " says Blood .
" Make up for this deficit by using cushions to support your lumbar and pad the bottom of the chair .
You 'll know you 're sitting at the right height by making sure that , with shoulders relaxed , your forearms run parallel to the table .
If your feet do n't touch the floor when you 've found the right height , use a chunky book to rest your feet on as this will take the pressure off your thighs and hips .

Try standing and working occasionally .
If you can pop your laptop up on a breakfast bar or work surface , great .
If not , you 'll need to improvise .
How about getting out that ironing board from the cupboard and using it as a stand-up desk ? Clifford suggests trying the top of a chest of drawers of book shelf .
" A large box placed on top of the kitchen bench can also work well , " she says .
Buy a lap desk .
If you do n't have anywhere to sit at a table , and you 're stuck with the bed of sofa , try a portable desk .
Many of these are foldable and adaptable at different heights .
Walk when you 're on a call .
Sparrow suggests taking a trip around the house when you 're on the phone to someone .
" I do this a lot and it keeps energy up and allows your eyes to rest from the video calls or screen work if you look out of the window during the walking , " she says .
Post-it note reminders .
" Put a post-in on the side of your laptop that says ' sit up ' and when you notice it , straighten your back , " says Sparrow .
Try to resist the sofa .
" If you work on a laptop on your sofa , you 'll have to crane your neck to look down which will cause all manor of neck , back and shoulder pain in the long run , " says Blood .
Get a keyboard and mouse .
If you 're willing to splash a bit of cash , buy a keyboard and raise your laptop even higher -- to eye level .
" Make sure you use a keyboard and mouse positioned close to you after you 've raised your laptop to stop yourself over-extending your arms and shoulders , " says Blood .
Alternate chairs .
The best place to sit is in a good quality office chair .
But if that 's not possible , try alternating chairs , says Sparrow .
From a dining chair to a stool , for example , to change things up a bit .
And also remember to .
: : Take regular breaks and stretch your whole body .
: : Try and give yourself a nice outlook -- if you can , locate yourself near a window for natural light and a view .
If you are struggling with your set up , approach your employer about it if you feel comfortable doing so .
They might be able to support you better .
We have a bit of good news for supporters of scruff : Beards , though likely covered in germs , are also probably not increasing your chances of getting and/or spreading Covid-19 .
It 's a question that has sprouted up amid the coronavirus pandemic , partially thanks to an infographic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that features guidelines for facial hair in extreme detail .
But , as Thomas Russo , a doctor at the Buffalo VA Medical Center and the chief of infectious diseases at the State University of New York at Buffalo medical school told HuffPost , those guidelines are in place for medical professionals who have to wear N-95 masks .
" For healthcare providers , beards present a problem because getting a good , tight fit for N-95 masks is difficult , " Russo said .
" Certainly , big fluffy beards are a big problem because unless they 're trimmed way back , you might not be able to get a good seal , making it not effective .
"  While there is still much to be learned about the new virus , it is thought to largely be passed through respiratory droplets from person to person , for example by coughing or sneezing in close proximity to them .
Russo points out that if you 're close enough to contract the virus from someone , you 're likely going to get it from proximity alone , beard or no beard .
" I can imagine that maybe the beard could collect a little bit of spit or something , " he said .
But then a person they might infect " would have to be in really close contact , and that would make them at risk from all the other mechanisms .
"  John Swartzberg , clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley 's School of Public Health who studies infectious diseases , was also hesitant to make any broad claims to The Los Angeles Times concerning beards and coronavirus , citing a lack of scientific evidence .
He told the outlet that though " theoretically " coronavirus could perhaps be transmitted to a person or someone else through a beard , he knows of " no science to support what I 've just said .
"  There is , however , scientific literature on adjacent topics , as Lucy Wilson , a professor in the department of emergency health services at the University of Maryland Baltimore County , told HuffPost .
Such studies mainly focus on bacteria , though , and not something like this virus .
" There are studies regarding beards actually showing decreased risk of bacteria from beards versus shaved areas in men , " she said .
" I have n't seen studies looking at viruses , but the theory is that the abrasions from shaving may increase risk of bacterial infection .
"  The guidance remains ? as we 've heard over and over again at this point ? to prioritise good hygiene and hand-washing .
" It 's reasonable to assume you could have droplets projected by someone sneezing or coughing into the beard , " Wilson said .
" Touching your beard or face with unwashed hands would be a concern .
It 's important to be careful with hand-washing and decreasing surface contamination .
Just like they say if you go to the store and come home it 's not unreasonable to take a shower , get the surface contamination off , that would include your facial hair .
"  I am hand-washing our laundry for the second time in three days .
The first time , I packed our wet clothes in a fury as we raced from the northern Balinese fishing village of Lovina to Denpasar , in the south , hoping to catch a flight home .
An hour into our drive , a mechanical issue with our scooter had us back at our homestay , our hastily packed , still-damp laundry now smelling of warm , wet dog .
Covid-19 is forcing my family to end our six-month Bali adventure earlier than planned .
My family and I live aboard our sailboat off the west coast of Canada .
Both work-from-home writers , my husband and I homeschool our two youngest children .
While living at sea offers us a peaceful and wildly beautiful life , it can make for some rugged and challenging conditions .
So it was that we decided to spend the winter in the warm , tropical embrace of Bali .
Bali has long been a popular tourist destination known for its vibrant culture and spirited citizens .
Spending six months in this magical land was to be a homeschooler 's dream ? language , culture , nature and global citizenry all wrapped up in one endless educational experience .
We arrived last October and set about exploring the island 's abundant temples , near-daily ceremonies and simply gorging ourselves on fruit .
Then January happened .
Reports began trickling through to mainstream media about a small outbreak of a pneumonia-like illness out of Wuhan , China .
On Feb .
1 , I received the first email from the Canadian Embassy about the novel coronavirus with generalised information for travellers on following basic health precautions .
We carried on exploring rice fields , taking jungle hikes and meeting locals who helped us along as we practiced speaking Indonesian .
I now receive a daily email with increasingly urgent language and instructions from the Canadian Embassy on the sole topic of covid-19 .
So , what 's it really like to be trapped in paradise during a global pandemic ?  It 's scary .
It 's beautiful .
It 's filled with anxiety and fear and calm and peace .
I vacillate between wanting to just get home and wanting to just stay put .
Do we risk exposure in the travel home or do we risk staying here ? I live in doubt followed by firm decisions , only to encounter more doubt , rethinking and changing plans , and , through it all , daily life continues around my family and me .
Do we risk exposure in the travel home or do we risk staying here ? I live in doubt followed by firm decisions , only to encounter more doubt , rethinking and changing plans , and , through it all , daily life continues around my family and me .
We have been staying at a homestay , Bali 's version of a bed and breakfast .
Staying here long-term through the pandemic would mean renting a villa ? a home where we can properly isolate ourselves if the Indonesian government orders us into lockdown .
And suddenly , a whole new realm of logistics opens before me of navigating morning markets and setting up a house with nothing more than the two motorcycle saddlebags worth of luggage we brought with us from Canada .
Our prime minister is urging all Canadians to return home while they still can .
Easy for him to say ; he has access to his passport and can simply book a flight .
Our passports sit in hiatus somewhere in the mysterious recesses of the Indonesian immigration office , awaiting what had been a routine tourist visa renewal three weeks ago .
Now that same routine visa renewal means we have no passports in hand and can not leave at a moment 's notice .
Or even a few days ' notice .
We can not leave .
We could cancel the renewal , perhaps .
But how does one go about stopping such an official process ? I speak broken , halting Indonesian .
I can say : " No , finish , slowly , closed , " but I 've no earthly idea how to even begin to say : " So here 's my logistical nightmare that 's full of ' If this , then that , but if that , then this .
' Can you help me with it ? "  I do n't even know the Indonesian word for help .
I am embarrassed at the realization that I once tossed the word " embassy " around with family and friends as though it gave me some sort of international cachet .
I felt important , special , cool .
I now whisper words like embassy , WHO and confirmed cases to my husband , hushed and nonchalant , so my children wo n't hear me talking about it .
It 's not cool .
It 's kind of scary .
I haul our wet clothes outside to hang on the drying rack .
Coconut palms set across the blue sky and the rhythmic thrum of surf surround me .
It is startlingly beautiful here .
How can the world be falling apart when this place is so pretty ?  " Mommy , is lunch ready ? "  " Daddy , where 's my other flip-flop ? "  " Mommy , can you fill up my water bottle ? "  " Daddy , I want to paint .
"  Where does lunch and art play even fit into a day 's plans that include emergency laundry , possible shady deals with a visa agent to expedite our visa renewals and emails from the Canadian Embassy ?  I see Ketut .
She and her husband , Komang , own the homestay we are living in .
She and I speak only a smattering of one another 's languages , but enough to fumble through half-English , half-Indonesian conversations with each other .
We chat and laugh , saying the Indonesian government had better not put ration limits on chocolate .
We stand apart , eyes searching to connect , as we stand at what would normally be a socially awkward distance between two people .
One week ago , we were folded together in our laughter , bent over in our shared giggles .
She would drape an arm around my shoulders .
I 'd rest my hand on her arm .
We 'd laugh , easy and normal .
Not now .
Not anymore .
We laugh , still dancing together in the human delight of connection .
But laugh at a distance .
On 19 March , my husband got an update from our visa agent : Our passports were to be delivered later that day .
We could finally book a flight .
But that was over a week ago .
We commence making a new plan .
Yet another new plan .
I 'm so sick of new plans .
My husband gets online and starts searching for a flight .
" Five thousand dollars ? " I shout .
" That 's too expensive .
What are you thinking ? " I blurt as he relays our flight options .
He flashes me a look .
We 're both tense .
I want to get angry , mad .
I want to blame somebody .
Not even blame , necessarily , but at least just yell at someone .
Anyone .
" Mommy , can we go to the beach now ? "  Breathe .
This moment is fine .
We 're all fine .
It 's only the future that 's making me worry , feel tense .
But the worry is wearing on me .
" Thank you for looking into flights .
I 'll let you do that and I 'll take these two to the beach for now .
"  And just like that , I 'm back on the damned beach .
Blue sky , palm trees , surf .
A million miles away from headlines and wait times and busy signals and health certificates and rules of quarantine upon arrival .
We secure a flight out of Denpasar , Bali , that connects through Taipei International Airport in Taiwan before flying us -- finally , finally , finally -- home to Vancouver , Canada .
We fly out in one week .
No less than two hours after booking the flight , smug smiles still plastered on our faces , the latest embassy email comes through .
It reads : " At this time , we understand that transit may not be possible via Taipei in the coming days .
"  What does " may not be possible " mean ?  Turns out it means the Taiwanese government is closing its international airport as a hub for connecting flights , the Canadian Embassy confirms the following day .
It means our airline has now contacted us with notice of our canceled flight .
It means we are still here , in Bali .
It means we need a new plan .
Again .
One week ago , we were folded together in our laughter , bent over in our shared giggles .
She would drape an arm around my shoulders .
I 'd rest my hand on her arm .
We 'd laugh , easy and normal .
Not now .
Not anymore .
We laugh , still dancing together in the human delight of connection .
But laugh at a distance .
We wanted to introduce our children to travel and new culture and the resourcefulness that world travel incites .
We 've been granted the ultimate opportunity to teach our children to be global citizens .
Beyond the language lessons , geography and discovery , there 's a chance to teach them patience and practicality .
Our skills as sailors serve us well in these uncertain times .
Much like a passage aboard our vessel , we are at the mercy of wind and weather , currents and tides .
We can check the forecast before casting off , but still , we must accept changing weather systems , equipment and system failures , and good-old-fashioned ups and downs in the mood and mindset of the crew .
No sailing voyage is ever predictable .
But it is filled with challenges and success , doubt and decision , beauty and wonderment .
It is a living metaphor for life .
Thursday 's email from the Canadian Embassy raises doubt about the accuracy of Indonesia 's reporting of actual cases , suggesting only 2% have been accounted for .
It warns that if we decide to stay in Indonesia , it is strongly recommended that we prepare for the worst and make preparations to be self-sufficient .
Of his assessment of Indonesia 's situation , our ambassador writes : " The ultimate number of fatalities will be very high .
"  I met a woman on the beach yesterday , a fellow stranded traveler .
Like Ketut and I , we stood awkwardly apart as we chatted .
I saw her anxiety , her fear , as she talked about her husband and children back home in Switzerland .
She came here two weeks ago to visit an uncle .
And now , she is alone and separated from her family .
Though I am facing wild upheavals of plans and choices , decisions and doubt , I am blessed to have my husband and children with me .
I am privileged to be in a place that offers such natural beauty , a stark contrast to the realities of so many currently in isolation around the world .
I suspect , too , our turn with mandated isolation is coming .
I 've met many travelers and locals alike during the last five months , and perhaps the greatest reprieve I have from the emotional and mental turmoil of navigating a global pandemic in a foreign country is when I set aside all the logistics and the worry , pick up the phone or send a message and ask a friend , " How are you today ? Is there anything I can do to help ? " Our online world offers us instant access to loved ones ? not quite but almost as good as being there in person .
Let 's use it .
Let 's connect and chat and take care of and encourage and help and support one another .
Of the many new friends my family has made over the past five months , an aged gentleman by the name of Putu has brought me grand comfort .
He is a holy man , a pemangku .
He taught me a new Indonesian word : sinkankan .
Literally translated , it means " allow it .
" But Putu uses it to mean " Do n't worry .
Be happy .
"  Even as I write this , I do n't yet know if we are staying in Bali or going home .
But I do know that a wise man taught me that while I navigate each day along my life 's journey , I have the choice to try and smile and say : " Sinkankan .
