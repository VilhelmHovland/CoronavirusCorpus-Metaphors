Media , arts and entertainment companies which stood down workers following the outbreak of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) should re-hire that workforce in light of the Federal Government 's $130bn ' Jobkeeper ' scheme , the Media , Entertainment and Arts Alliance ( MEAA ) has said .
The program will help to support businesses reporting a 30% loss in revenue , or 50% for businesses earning over $1bn .
The MEAA believes businesses should be re-hiring stood down employees and contractors , and working to keep them on the payroll .
The scheme would provide a $1,500 fortnightly subsidy for workers and is expected to be claimed by around 6m workers .
ADVERTISEMENT  MEAA chief executive Paul Murphy said the hope is that the scheme will support freelancers/ sole traders also .
" The vast majority of workers in the arts and entertainment industries are employed in insecure jobs , " said Murphy .
" Freelancers normally rely on income from job to job and gig to gig .
This precarity meant that COVID-19 threatened to push them out of our industries and into the never-never .
" An income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular places of work and to ensure the arts and entertainment industry is best-placed to rebound quickly once the current crisis is over .
" While more detail is required about how the income subsidy will operate , MEAA does welcome that the government has listened to concerns and ensured that sole traders/ freelancers are not left on the outer .
" We now call on employers in the industries MEAA represents to urgently re-employ staff they have let go since the pandemic began to have an impact on the industry .
" We are all in this together , and when they combine the income subsidy with other forms of business support including payments to boost cash flow , employers should pull out all stops to keep workers on their payrolls .
"  Under the Jobkeeper allowance , casual workers who have been with the same employer for under 12 months will not be eligible for the payment .
The MEAA believes this should be amended so workers are n't forced onto welfare .
