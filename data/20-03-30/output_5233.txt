IBA , Zambales -- The Zambales provincial government has put in place a six-point action plan that emphasized preparedness and capability-building rather than isolation to combat the spread of the new coronavirus ( Covid-19 ) .

Under Ebdane 's directives , the provincial government will establish quarantine facilities at the two provincial borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the south , where all new arrivals will be quarantined for 14 days .
This is in anticipation of more Zambale ? os coming back to their hometowns to weather the pandemic , he said .
Ebdane said he has received " hundreds " of requests from residents wanting to return , most are students and workers in Manila who are running out of money to last the expected month-long quarantine .
He also ordered extending the quarantine of persons under monitoring ( PUMs ) in the province from 14 days to 20-30 days and to set up quarantine facilities in each municipality for this purpose .
Ebdane said the provincial government will also strengthen checkpoint capability at the borders to supply members of the task force there with complete personal protection equipment ( PPEs ) and supplies , and enable the disinfection of both incoming and outgoing vehicles and cargo .
Another measure that Ebdane ordered is the stocking of sufficient supplies of food , medicine , and other essentials in the province .

" Funds have been allotted for importations of other needs , but home or backyard food production program will nevertheless be initiated through the barangays , and price monitoring and control will also be implemented stringently , " he added .
Meanwhile , Ebdane also ordered a census of all private medical professionals to come up with a list of " reservists " in the event that Covid-19 cases increased and the current medical staff fell short .
He also designated the President Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital in Iba as exclusive for the treatment of Covid-19 positives and PUIs .
All other regular and non-Covid cases will be moved to the two district hospitals in the province or to any hospital chosen by the patients .
" We will also be anticipating problems stemming from the above proposed solutions and we must be quick to determine and implement adjustments , " the governor added .
