WA has recorded nine new cases of coronavirus , showing a significant slowdown in the growth rate for the deadly virus in the State .
The new cases include a seven-year-old child and a 77-year-old person .
There are five females and four males among the new cases .
All the cases are from the metropolitan area .
The State 's COVID-19 tally now sits at 364 .
Health Minister Roger Cook said WA was not out of the woods yet but to have single digits at any point in time of the pandemic was amazing .
There are 54 coronavirus patients in hospital with 12 of them in intensive care units .
Seven of the patients in an ICU have come from the Artania cruise ship and two from the Ruby Princess .
" The patients in ICU are very sick , our thoughts go out to them and we wish them the very best , " he said .
Mr Cook said the State Government was creating a " Wuhan " like response and would virtually be creating a whole new hospital by freeing up beds across the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred all of our maternity services out of this hospital and consolidated them at King Edwards , " he said .
" This hospital will create 81 beds able to receive COVID patients .
" Hundreds of beds will come on tap in North Metro and South Metro .
"  A further $15 million of clinical equipment has been ordered and is on its way including more than 300 ventilators , 201 humidifiers and 200 ICU beds .
Mr Cook said there were only eight cases where the point of contact for picking the virus was not known .
WA chief health officer Andrew Robertson said in those cases there was believed to be a causal chain and the patients had not necessarily randomly picked it up .
He said overall cases have been dropping over the past three days .
" It 's certainly a very good start and we will continue to do the very effective identification , contact tracing that has gone with that , " he said .
" We will be looking at expanding our testing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review and overview of what is happening in the community .
" Given the cases have not been growing at all we expect that will just highlight we have this currently .
getting to stage where we are able to control and flatten the curve to a degree .
" We have had the people coming off the cruise ships and in more recent days quite a few people coming off aircraft from all around the world and those people are now staying at a number of hotels in the city , we may expect we get some further cases from that group .
"  Dr Robertson said now was not the time to be complacent and there could be further ceases and instances of spread in the future .
The chief health officer noted once broader community testing started -- which will see people with flu-like symptoms and respiratory issues who have not travelled overseas or had contact with an infected person tested -- he did not expect a big jump in coronavirus numbers .
Mr Cook said despite the lower number of positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 free " island " when the virus still existed all around it .
" What we are trying to do is manage the spread of that disease so it does n't overwhelm our health systems .
( as ) you 've seen in New York and Italy , " he said .
" Ultimately I expect we too will be confronted with difficult numbers and community spread .
"  The Department of Health will release COVID-19 " heat maps " in the next 24 hours which will provide a snapshot of where the larger levels of patients with the virus are residing .
