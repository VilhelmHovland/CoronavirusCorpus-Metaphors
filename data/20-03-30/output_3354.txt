LIONEL MESSI HAS confirmed that he and his Barcelona team-mates will take pay cuts of up to 70% in order to reduce club losses during the coronavirus crisis .
La Liga has been suspended since 12 March following the outbreak of Covid-19 , with an enforced two-week break later increased to an indefinite postponement .
With no games on the horizon meaning matchday and television revenue has dried up , Barcelona recently announced cost-cutting measures to keep the club viable as a business during the suspension .
Messi confirmed that he and the first-team squad have agreed to take significant wage cuts for the foreseeable future in order to help protect the jobs of the non-playing staff at Camp Nou .
In a statement in Spanish on his personal Instagram page , Messi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional situation and we are always the first ones to help the club when asked .
"  He added that the players , as well as taking 70% pay cuts , would make further contributions so that other Barcelona employees would be able to collect 100% of their salaries .
The statement also claims that figures within the club were putting pressures on the players to act , however there was always a plan within the first-team squad to make a gesture in solidarity with their fellow employees .
It reads : " Much has been written and said about the Barcelona team in regards to the salaries of the players during this state of emergency .
" We want to clarify that our will has always been to take a cut in the salary we receive , because we fully understand that this is an exceptional situation and we are always the first ones to help the club when asked .
" Therefore , it does not surprise us that from within the club there were those who tried to put us under pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " The agreement has been delayed for a few days because we were looking for a formula to help the club and its workers during these difficult times .
" Apart from the reduction of 70% from our salary , we will also make contributions so that club employees can collect 100% of their salary while this situation lasts .
" We do not want to say goodbye without sending an affectionate greeting and a lot of strength to all those having a hard time in these very difficult times , as well as to all those who patiently await the end of this crisis in their homes .
" Very soon we are going to get out of this and we will all do it together .
"  The Barcelona board and players across the club 's other professional sports teams , including " most " of the basketball team , have also agreed to salary reductions for the duration of Spain 's state of emergency , the club said in a statement .
" This additional contribution from the squad , plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% of the salaries of all non-sport staff , " Barcelona announced .
The La Liga champions added : " The club would like to thank the professional athletes for their involvement in a situation as exceptional as the one caused by this health emergency .
"  Barcelona said last week that certain measures would be brought in to " minimise the economic impact that the coronavirus crisis is causing " , although the club did not specify the precise degree of any wage reductions .
