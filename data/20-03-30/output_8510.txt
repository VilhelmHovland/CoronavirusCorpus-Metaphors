I 'm OK , you OK ? The COVID-19 epidemic is going to be hard on all of us .
This ongoing column offers thoughts and tips to help .
" I vhant to be alone , " Greta Garbo used to say .
Evidently not so easy for her .
Otherwise she would simply have been alone -- rather than always wanting to be .
And not so easy for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all supposed to stay away from each other .
Six feet , at least .
Which is just 4 feet shy of 10 feet , the regulation length of human loathing .
As in , " I would n't touch him with a 10-foot pole .
"  But what we 're also finding is that it 's not so easy to get away from each other .

Many , in this quarantine crisis , have been seeking the solitude of the great outdoors .
We look for obscure hiking trails and set out for the wide-open spaces where the deer and the antelope play .
Or , at least , where other human beings do not play .
But -- such is life , and such is coronavirus -- the state and national parks are reporting a new problem .
Everybody wants to be solitary with us .
Last Tuesday , Mohonk Preserve in New Paltz , New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facilities would be closed to the public until further notice .
The problem ? " Severe overcrowding , " says the preserve 's Facebook page .
The Sunday before that , the Minnewaska State Park Preserve and the Sam 's Point Preserve at Minnewaska , in Ulster County , New York , were pronounced filled to capacity .
They were shut down to visitors and traffic .
At a press conference the same day , Gov .
Andrew Cuomo complained of New Yorkers clogging the city 's public parks .
Stay away , he begged them .
( The city , incidentally , is also doing trial closings of major streets -- parts of Park Avenue , Bushwick Avenue , 34th Avenue and Grand Concourse were shut from 10 a .
to 7 p .
between Friday and the end of today ) .

Zion National Park in Utah has stopped most of its shuttles and limited its parking .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " It is irresponsible to urge people to visit national park sites , " Phil Francis , chairman of the Coalition to Protect America 's National Parks , was quoted as saying in a March 20 Associated Press story .
Apparently , nature is full up .
Though in these circumstances , that 's only natural .
Museums , theaters , stores , restaurants , libraries and sports venues are all closed .
Parks are -- at the moment -- one of the few things open for business .
And not necessarily business-as-usual , as Scott Fallon reported on NorthJersey .
on March 16 .
Entry fees were waived , earlier this month , at New Jersey 's state parks .
" Being out in the open and getting fresh air is a good thing , " Gov .
Phil Murphy said at a press conference March 16 .
So we go out in the open .
And the open has to be closed , because of congestion .
We wander , lonely as a cloud -- only to find that other cloudy wanderers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knows what microbes on their clothes and backpacks .
Even alone , we ca n't get away from people .
All this , in a way , is nothing new .
Being alone -- really alone -- requires a certain talent .
And it 's possible that most of us are just not good at it .
Just as the smartest animal is the one humans have n't discovered , the most solitary human is the one you have n't come across .
The rest ? Mostly impostors .
Henry David Thoreau is practically a byword for the solitary genius .
We picture him alone , in his cabin at Walden pond , forsaking humanity in order to commune with nature .
In fact , he had people trooping through his cabin all the time .
A railroad ran one-third of a mile away .
And his mother packed pies for him to take home to the woods .
Some hermit .
Most of us would n't be any better .
" Go back , Sam , " Frodo tells his friend in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going on alone .
" " Of course you are , " Sam replies .
" And I 'm coming with you .
"  Perhaps you 've seen old pictures of Coney Island beach in summer -- a million bathers packed like sardines from end to end .
All of them were escaping the crowds of the city .
And all of them brought the city with them .
The fact is , most of us -- even when we say we do , like Garbo -- do n't want to be alone .
We 're not used to it .
" Alone , adj .
In bad company , " Ambrose Bierce wrote in his " Devil 's Dictionary .
"  Obviously , we all need to practice social distancing , hard as that may be .
Hard because it 's unnatural for us .
And hard because other human beings are kind of inescapable -- even in supposedly out-of-the-way places like parks and nature trails .
Off the beaten track is no longer enough .
You 'll need to go off-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fellow says in " The Call of the Wild " -- the new movie currently not playing in theaters .
