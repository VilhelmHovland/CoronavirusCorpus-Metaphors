Lockdown set to prevent Fiat attempt to restart some Italian production  MILAN -- A probable extension of Italy 's lockdown could frustrate an attempt by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to resume some vehicle production at three Italian plants next week , a union representative said on Monday .
Italy has banned travel within the country and ordered a freeze on all non-essential business activities , including the car industry , until April 3 to curb the spread of coronavirus which has now killed almost 11,000 people in the country .
FCA informed unions last week that if the government gave it the go-ahead , the automaker would be ready to resume some of its operations on April 6 , said Gianluca Ficco , a representative for metal workers union UILM .
The sites concerned would be the assembly line for the Jeep Compass at the Melfi facility in southern Italy , Atessa 's plant making light commercial vehicles in central Italy and preparatory operations for the new electric 500 in Turin 's Mirafiori factory , he said .
Ficco however said he did not know whether the government would allow non-essential activities to restart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban .
Despite hopes among Italian officials that the downward trend in coronavirus fatalities nationally would continue , it appeared increasingly likely that restrictions would be soon officially extended .
On Sunday Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia said the government would " inevitably " extend containment measures beyond April 3 .
Italian media have reported that the extension could last for a further two weeks until about April 18 .
A spokesman for FCA confirmed on Monday that for now , the plan was to resume those three facilities next week .
Ficco added that , in any case , when operations restarted FCA would have to make sure that the highest health and safety conditions are assured in all factories .
Ferrari , which , like FCA , is controlled by Exor , the investment firm of Italy 's Agnelli family , said on Friday it would reopen its two Italian plants on April 14 , provided it had supplies .
Exor said last week that current plant closures at companies it controls , though temporary , might continue .
