Maqasid al-shariah emphasises the preservation of life  File photo : We witnessed the setting up of various emergency funds , including the federal government 's Covid-19 fund launched since March 11 that collected more than RM8 million .
- NSTP/MOHAMAD SHAHRIL BADRI SAALI  IN anticipation of worsening conditions due to Covid-19 , the government recently launched an unprecedented stimulus package totalling RM250 billion which takes up to 17 per cent of the nation 's gross domestic product .
The package has three primary goals -- safeguarding the people , supporting the business sector and strengthen the economy .
It provides cash aid not only to B40 households but also to the M40 .
For the rest of Malaysians , there are discounts in electricity bills , telecommunication services , incentives for frontliners , and fund withdrawing facilities .
The package includes measures to assist businesses and ensure the resilience of the economy .
In addition , we witnessed the setting up of various emergency funds , including the federal government 's Covid-19 fund launched since March 11 that collected more than RM8 million .
In the private sector , The Edge Covid-19 funds have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) and civil society have also initiated various efforts .
The charity does n't stop there .
The prime minister announced that cabinet members would be giving up two-months ' salary to the Covid-19 fund .
Religious institutions and organisations have also initiated Covid-19 fundraising efforts and one that sparked attention was the Musa'adah Covid-19 Fund launched by Senator Datuk Seri Dr Zulkifli Mohamed Al-Bakri , the new minister of religious affairs , who asserted that the fund has always included non-Muslims .
In general , Muslim jurists agreed that the maqasid al-shariah is to serve the public interests and to prevent harm .
This main objective of shariah is governed by the principles and concepts of mercy and guidance -- ( al-Anbiya ' , 21:107 &amp; Yunus , 10:57 ) .
Thus , all aspects of human life must conform to the objectives of shariah based on its priorities namely essentials ( dharuriyyah ) , complimentary ( hajiyyah ) and embellishment ( tahsiniyyah ) .
Under the essentials category , mundane and religious matters must be acted upon .
Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dignity and property are six important priorities in a human 's life .
Preservation of life is one of the essential priorities in the objectives of shariah after religion .
As such , funds collected for this purpose should be shared by all , regardless of religious background .
Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah has identified three main characteristics of maqasid al-shariah , namely ( i ) It serves the interests of all human beings ( jalb al-masalih ) and save them from harm ( daf ' al-mafasid ) .
According to Ibn Ashur , who subscribes to a broader angle , the objective of shariah invariably includes preserving the social order of the community and ensuring its healthy progress by promoting the wellbeing and virtue of the human being .
The most important objectives of shariah is to establish justice , eliminate prejudice and alleviate hardship .
For al-Ghazali , the importance of preservation of the ends of the shariah is the fundamental meaning of maslahah .
For that reason , according to al-Shatibi , maslahah is a principle which concerns the subsistence of human life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what his emotional and intellectual qualities require of him , as an absolute sense , including the administration of justice and worship .
So , it can be said with confidence that the Covid-19 funds are in tandem with the objectives of shariah and the principle of maslahah .
In times of harsh conditions brought by Covid-19 , such policy aids and charity funds can play a vital role and , for some , a lifeline in preserving one 's livelihood .
The situation may invoke the shariah rules of necessity which have an in-built universality that prevents any division based on race , colour and creed .
Therefore , as one of the five essentials of shariah , the preservation of life , regardless whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims , should remain one of the highest priorities of policymakers , institutions and society as whole .
