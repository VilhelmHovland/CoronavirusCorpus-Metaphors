Amid the frustrating school suspension over the coronavirus outbreak , Yew Chung International School ( YCIS ) is keen to maintain the momentum of its mission in teaching .
It was among the first schools in Hong Kong to launch an innovative Virtual Learning Programme which has won adulation from parents and educators worldwide .
Schools from various parts of the world , such as St .

Made possible through software like ' Zoom ' -- a remote conferencing service using cloud computing , such online learning has now become a city-wide norm in Hong Kong during school closure .
As early as November 2019 , when the Education Bureau suspended classes due to social disturbance , YCIS already kick-started a trial week of the virtual learning programme .
During school suspension again in the current COVID-19 epidemic , the school quickly adopted virtual learning since February 3 , and ensured its effective implementation across its Secondary , Primary and Early Childhood Education sections to minimize the impact and disruption to students ' learning .
Schooling as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the lessons according to the regular timetable while students continue learning all the subjects without leaving home .
YCIS also ensures seamless interaction between teachers and learners .
" The message we want to get across is that this is school as normal , with not a single lesson missed , especially for Secondary students , " says Martin Scott , Education Director and Executive Principal of YCIS .
" And we aim to achieve outcomes that are as productive as a regular school day .
"  That means students go through the same routine as usual , which entails waking up around 7:00 , having lunch about 12:00 noon , completing homework after class , and compulsory attendance for every lesson .
Absence from class needs to be formally notified and accounted for .
With students ' wellbeing in mind , a normal 55-minute lesson is shortened to around 40 minutes to ease the strain of looking at electronic screens for an extended time .
Matthew Mohrbach , the Pupil Progress Leader for Year 9 of YCIS , shared his teacher 's point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not missed a single lesson and teachers are teaching their full timetables via video sharing platforms in combination with Google Classroom .
We still hold staff meetings , department meetings and outside-of-school sessions for students in-need " .
Dynamic interactivity  As in normal classes at school , teachers and students communicate with each other in real-time through the video and audio functions of ' Zoom ' .
During the lessons , pupils can raise questions instantly or send messages through the Chat function .
For teachers , regular lesson delivery is maintained .
To monitor students ' learning progress , online tests , student project work and assignments are utilized for assessment .
In the Secondary school programme , YCIS adopts Google Classrooms as the homework system where everything is done on-screen for instructors to provide feedback right away .
A Project-Based approach  Scott points out that YCIS is committed to delivering collaborative learning even in a virtual environment .
To achieve the objectives of YCIS 's Learning Communities approach for the Secondary and Primary programmes , YCIS maintains Project-Based Learning and Integrated Subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects , students actively explore real-world problems and challenges .
During virtual learning lessons , pupils are assigned to small group discussions using the Breakout Room function , as well as various tasks under the facilitation of the teachers .
In the end , students conduct presentations on the project outcome via Zoom , which is joined in by teachers and parents .
Continuously evaluating the progress of children , these elements also ensure students enjoy their home learning experience , remain engaged and motivated .
Imparting non-academic subjects  Long upholding the significance of holistic development in children , YCIS goes beyond academic areas to cover non-academic subjects like sports , music and arts in its virtual learning programme .
Take PE lessons , students conduct yoga and exercising movement according to the teacher 's direction on the screen .
The Artist-in-Residence has also created Virtual Open Studio for students and parents , offering art demonstration , online workshop and interactive discussion with various artists .
The music teacher creates a sing-along video for the younger students in the Early Childhood Education Section to engage musically .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Music Competition has also been moved online by encouraging all students to send in their recorded music materials to be judged by the jury panel .
Being a Christian-based school , YCIS conducts assemblies via the virtual learning platform , often with around 300 students participating in singing or video producing activities .
" The diversified virtual learning elements ignite the creativity of both our teachers and students , enabling both to explore different fields of knowledge in YCIS , " Scott explains .
Parents are part of the YCIS Community  YCIS understands parents may encounter difficulties in the online operations , and have set up a technical helpline for instant support .
Making a concerted effort to communicate with parents , YCIS has also devised a questionnaire to seek feedback from parents , and adjust the system where necessary .
Accommodating students of different levels , the YCIS Early Childhood Education ( ECE ) team has curated interesting , engaging e-learning activities and programmes for children and their families to participate .
Furthermore , class teachers conduct a daily review and weekly calls with parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bi-weekly review of their learning journeys .
The ECE leadership team is devoted to continuously enhancing the teaching content by joining Zoom classes regularly .
" Although this is an extraordinarily challenging time for all of us -- students , parents , and educators , I 'm sure if we stand together as one community , the impact of school suspension will be greatly reduced .
The YCIS team will spare no effort in continuing to deliver virtual learning that 's highly interactive , rich in content , stimulating in its approach , and hugely rewarding for our students , .
