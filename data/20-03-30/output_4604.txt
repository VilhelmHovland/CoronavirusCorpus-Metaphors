It 's a slightly disappointing outcome for those investors who might have thought that the long-awaited ' bottom ' had finally come on Thursday after 2 rare , consecutive days of gains on the ASX .
But unfortunately , with the Prime Minister announcing yet another round of tighter social restrictions last night , this volatility is unlikely to fade out anytime soon .
It comes on top of another announcement last Tuesday night , in which the government effectively banned international travel for all Australians .
How did the markets end the week ?  As mentioned above , the ASX 200 was down 0 .
for the week , whilst the ALL ORDINARIES ( ASX : XAO ) finished up the week ( somewhat perplexingly ) in the green , with a 0 .
rise .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast to the 200 tracked by the ASX 200 -- meaning variations like this one are uncommon , but possible .
However , these seemingly insignificant statistics hide what was an incredibly volatile week , marked by huge shifts in sentiment and wild swings in the share market .
We started the week on Monday with a heavy loss of 5 .
Then 2 consecutive days of green ink saw the ASX 200 gain 12 .
by Thursday afternoon .
But Friday saw these early gains erased and the market ended up shedding its mid-week bounce with a 5 .
loss .
Just take a look at this graph of Friday 's ASX 200 moves and see for yourself .
Chart : fool .
On a side note and displaying itself as a rare beacon of stability , the Australian dollar appears to have found some support and has been trading around the 60 US cents mark for most of the week .
Which ASX shares were the biggest winners and losers ?  So , as always , let 's take a look at both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Let 's get the bad news out of the way first with the losers :  Chart : Author 's Own  As you can see , the wooden spoon on Friday went to oOh ! Media Ltd ( ASX : OML ) .
Advertising companies like oOh ! Media have been hit especially hard as the market prices in a likely massive hit to the short-term prospects of any business reliant on advertising dollars .
With the economy going into ' hibernation ' , there is likely to be a significant downturn in advertising spending by Australian businesses as a whole .
Sadly , oOh ! Media has now lost 80% of its market capitalisation since the start of the year and last week announced a deferral of its final dividend .
Obviously , with shopping centres around the country becoming deserted due to coronavirus restrictions on social gatherings , the short-term prospects for shopping centre-based companies are very bleak at the current time .
Not helping Scentre and Charter Hall 's prospects is the discussion of commercial lease suspensions by the government in recent days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
Credit Corp Group Ltd ( ASX : CCP ) also makes the losers list this week -- no doubt on the back of the government 's recently announced changes to insolvency procedures to assist financially struggling individuals and businesses .
As a debt collector , this does n't bode well for Credit Corp 's business model .
With the bad news out of the way , let 's take a gaze at Friday 's winners :  Chart : Author 's Own  The clear winner from last week 's final day was ALS Ltd ( ASX : ALQ ) .
This medical testing company 's shares were propelled into green territory after it informed the market that most of its laboratories across South America would be deemed ' essential services ' and allowed to remain open for the foreseeable future .
Fallen WAAAX angel WiseTech Global Ltd ( ASX : WTC ) also makes the list .
Its shares were up 5 .
on Friday , giving this logistics company a rise of over 30% for the week .
Although this would have elicited some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way off its 52-week high of $38 .
What is this week looking like for the ASX ?  The only thing that we can take with any hint of certainty about this week is the likely continuation of volatility on the ASX .
On Friday night , the American Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded a 4 .
fall , so things are n't looking too bright across the Pacific .
Something to look out for is further stimulus announcements from the government , which have the potential to move markets this week .
Also worth keeping an eye on is the COVID-19 infection rate , which also might instil some confidence in the markets if the curve shows signs of flattening ( fingers crossed ! ) .
In some good news for income investors though , there are a few ASX blue chips scheduled to pay out dividends this week .
These include Wesfarmers Ltd ( ASX : WES ) , Commonwealth Bank of Australia ( ASX : CBA ) and South32 Ltd ( ASX : S32 ) .
The cash from these dividends will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Additionally , anyone who has elected to have these dividends reinvested will be enjoying some relatively low buying prices .
So before we go , here is the lay of the land for the major ASX 200 blue-chip shares as we start the new week :  Chart : Author 's Own  And finally , here 's how some leading market indicators are looking :  S&amp;P/ASX 200 ( XJO ) at 4,842 .
points  ALL ORDINARIES ( XAO ) at 4,874 .
points  Dow Jones Industrial Average at 21,636 .
points  Gold is asking US$1,617 .

a barrel  Australian dollar buying 61 .
US cents  Foolish Takeaway  It remains a wild ride on the Australian share markets , and many of us are probably getting motion sickness from watching the peaks and troughs by now ( speaking from experience here ) .
