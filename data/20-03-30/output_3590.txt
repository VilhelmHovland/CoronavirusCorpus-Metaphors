Since I have n't seen any medical society from Sri Lanka providing safe practices and guidelines for avoiding COVID-19 , I thought of sending this in a summarized form .
I hope these and the links provided at the end of this email will be useful and save lives .
It is time that everyone takes personal responsibility and actions needed seriously , rather than waiting for the government to take care of yourselves .
The latter will not be materialized .
This includes but not limited to engaging in right personal hygiene ( no short cuts please ) , keeping the distance of 6 feet or more between people , avoiding crowded places , frequent hand sanitation , minimize travel , wearing face masks when going out , and other essential hygienic maneuvers .
One must take extreme precautions to safeguard yourself and others .
You never know who is infected , until it is too late .
So , eat healthily and stay at home and be safe .
Thus , unless you invite a person for a specific purpose , there is no reason at all for anyone to come inside your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your family 's safety .
Until proven otherwise , assume that he/she is bringing the COVID-19 virus with them .
If anyone insists that they want to talk to you , speak to them outside your home ( you do not even need to go out ) , but wearing a face mask .
Do n't be afraid to refuse entrance to strangers , including any official : Why taking unnecessary risk .
It is the right thing to do to safeguard you and the family .
All healthcare workers and others working in the frontlines are most vulnerable : they must be provided with effective face masks by the government and should take the utmost precautions .
Individuals should avoid visiting hospitals and clinics to see patients , visiting relatives , crowded markets , and any other exposures and gatherings .
Eating herbs , such as garlic , rinsing nose , drinking hot water or alcohol , will not help .
Work from home .
But use the described stringent precautionary principles , when going out of the house at the workplace/store , etc .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3M ) or another type of effective face masks , routinely .
Contrary to some faulty claims by politicians , this is important to minimize airborne COVID-19 infection .
The use of standard surgical masks when seeing patients ; while it protects patients , may not protect the doctors and nurses .
This might provide a false sense of security and could be the reason why so many healthcare persons getting infected with COVID-19 .
Despite precautions , in the U .
and several other countries , over the past two weeks , hundreds of healthcare workers have contracted COVID-19 ( e .
, over 160 is affected in Boston , MA , hospital system , alone ) .
Healthcare workers ( all of them ) vigorously working to protect you : affecting even one of them with COVID-19 is too many .
Together with handwashing with soap in running ( warm ) water for 20 seconds , every time returning to the office and home is essential .
The virus efficiently can enter via all mucous membranes , including eyes , nose , mouth ( buccal mucosa ) , gastrointestinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , do NOT touch any of these areas till you thoroughly wash your hands as described above .
Same after going into any restroom/toilet .
COVID-19 has a fatty outer covering it ; thus it is sticky ; that 's why soap and any detergent works ; it erodes the outer fatty covering thus , harming the COVID-19 .
Footwear also gathers viruses .
Thus , consider keeping outside footwear , " outside " the house or at least in the porch or garage .
With reference to clothing : COVID-19 can stay on clothing and any other material ( including shipping bags ) for up to 10 hours .
A longer period in damp conditions and/or with air conditioning .
Exposure of clothing to direct sunlight ( outside the house ) would help .
Fruits and vegetables can get easily contaminated in markets , by those carrying the virus , by coughing and touching them .
Pay extra attention and use your commonsense precautions .
Washing all food items , fruits , and vegetables , etc .
, in soap and water and rinse well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionally used to kill bacteria in vegetables will not work against COVID-19 , but detergents will .
For sterilization of surfaces , doorknobs , etc .
, spraying or rubbing diluted hypochlorite solution ( bleach ) or soap is apparently sufficient .
The rapid growth of virus : At the current rate of spread ( at 33% ; exponential growth phase ) the viral load can double every 3-days .
Thus , in the USA , the number of infected people could exceed 10 million COVID-19 positive patients in six-weeks ' time , unless the expected infectious peaks are " flattened " through effective social distancing and above mentioned all precautionary and proactive actions ( not merely by curfews ) .
However , the lack of access to food as a result of continued curfew ( a third of the population is starving ; it will lead to immune degradation ) , is likely to make the situation worse .
In addition , keeping the serum 25(OH) D levels in excess of 40 ng/mL ( 100 nmol/L ) will markedly increase the inherent immunity ( stimulating multiple immune pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the chances of getting any Coronaviral infections and the severity if they get infected .
This can be achieved by oral supplementation of 50,000 international units ( one capsule , once a week ; or a collection of a number of capsules to make a total of 50,000 IU ) for approximately , 8 to 12-week period ; till the threat is over .
Alternatively , 30 to 45 minutes of daily exposure to direct sunlight ( can be intermittent ) of a " third of the skin surface , between 9 .
AM and mid-day ( afternoons are too hot to be out in the sun ) , would generate an adequate amount of vitamin D to boost immunity .
This simple process applies to all countries and everyone ; it costs nothing .
The current trend is that otherwise healthy younger people are now getting the disease : it is no longer exclusively affecting the elderly .
In addition , younger people can be carriers of transmitting the disease .
Consequently , they and any others should not visit elderly or sick people until the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting them must strictly follow the mentioned hygiene and safety procedures , including wearing face masks .
These are suggestions to keep you and your loved ones healthy , and not considered as medical advice .
If you have questions or concerns , please contact your healthcare provider or the local health authority or hospital to obtain medical advice and additional information .
Everyone must take the current threat from COVID-19 very seriously and collectively work together to eliminate the threat , by abiding the above-mentioned public health guidance and local rules .
