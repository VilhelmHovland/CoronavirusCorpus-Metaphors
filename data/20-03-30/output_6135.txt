The doctor is ( temporarily ) out : The story of PH 45  Metro Manila ( CNN Philippines , March 30 ) -- It was just a normal day at the hospital .
But that Friday was a bit extra special for Dr .
Jose Luis Sollano III .
In just a few hours , he 'll be home to spend the weekend with his family and friends .
Something that only happens once every three weeks .
And just before the end of his day at the hospital -- a patient complaining of general body weakness came his way .
The patient was then admitted for cardiac problem .
After attending to the man , he went back doing his rounds .
Then the much-awaited weekend came .
Sollano made the most out of it .
He attended a family gathering and went out to see some friends .
Sunday night , Dr .
Sollano came down with a cold .
" I was about to have chills so I took paracetamol and multivitamins cause I was afraid something like this would happen , " Dr .
Sollano said in an online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bad news greeted the young doctor .
The patient who complained of general body weakness and cardiac problem tested positive for COVID-19 .
Contact tracing began .
Sollano was among them , of course .
But unlike many other contacts of the patients , the young doctor easily had a cold and itchy throat , so the hospital asked him to take the COVID-19 test .
As soon as the testing kits were available , samples of the patient 's contacts were collected including those of Dr .
Sollano 's .
Results came out after 48 hours .
Sollano recalled , " As soon as I was swabbed , I was sent home , quarantined right away , strict quarantine , then after two days I found out that I was positive on March 12 and I am DOH PH45 "  In a very quick turn of events Dr .
Sollano has been an addition to the number of confirmed COVID 19 cases in the country .
He is now DOH PH 45 .
" I was exposed to the patient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me to explain the ECG tracing .
very minimal exposure , " Dr .
Sollano said .
He got a call from the hospital and the Health Department 's officer in Quezon City .
Back then , there were still some rooms that can accommodate them , so he was asked to get ready for admission .
Sollano shares " the moment I found out I was okay like any doctor .
We just take the necessary precautions .
But the time it sunk in , I cried but just because I was causing hassle already , I never want to be the person to be causing stress .
Everything 's so fast and everyone involved is close to me .
that 's friends , family , they 're going to be quarantined , they 're going to be out of work and then more importantly I did my rounds "  Patients , colleagues , nurses , consultants and family who came in contact with Dr .
Sollano were placed in quarantine .
Beyond symptoms  And so the quarantine began .
Alone in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , he was also battling with his mind .
He remembered the people he saw over the weekend aside from his family and friends .
" The patients because I put everyone at risk and these people are people who have comorbidities or other diseases and I put them at risk for having the severe type of Covid .
The reason I was n't nervous about my self -- I 'm young , I do n't have comorbidities , so based on statistics , I have a very low chance to be a severe case , but everyone else , especially the patients that I exposed , were at risk for having severe cases , " he said .
His thoughts were equally difficult to fight with .
" The guilt there actually set in when we had a Viber group where we had all the people under quarantine updating ourselves to the doctors and infectious control specialists .
Most of the people 's exposures was me .
I was kind of emotional , it got me depressed that time because -- like you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media na hospitals are being overwhelmed , people are undermanned and -- I was the cause as much as I know no one wanted this , I 'm their initial exposure and I caused a lot of stress , " he said .
But Dr .
Sollano added it was n't something he ca n't conquer .
For him , it was just a matter of seeing the positive in every situation .
" If there 's anything I 'd like people to take from this actually , it 's this one huge massive opportunity .
It 's an opportunity for everyone in all senses , " he said .
" First , to educate yourselves on what 's happening with the world ; executing what is being told especially right now , we have protocols we need to follow , we need to be disciplined , we need to be responsible about certain things , and lastly , we need to encourage people to do what is being told of us right now , we are part of a bigger purpose right now .
"  Treating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sollano also felt something quite different , but he did n't have fever .
" When I went to the hospital something that 's peculiar to me was my senses of taste and sense of smell , I did n't think it was anything , it was very benign , " Dr .
Sollano recalls .
Upon reading several medical journals and articles , he later found out that it 's something common to some COVID-19 patients .
Sollano said the treatment for patients depend on their symptoms .
The World Health Organization said there 's still no drug specific for treating COVID 19 and that it will take at least 12 months to produce a vaccine against the viral disease .
In Dr .
Sollano 's case , he was given Oseltamivir , an antiviral drug .
According to medical websites , it 's used to treat influenza .
Aside from Oseltamivir , Dr .
Sollano also took zinc sulfate for his immune system consistently .
Four days later , he no longer exhibited any symptom .
But he ca n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital did n't want to discharge him until he tests negative .
But since the medical institution needed the facility for more severe cases , he was allowed to return home , but still under strict isolation .
Sollano says the delays in the release of results cause concern not just for himself , but many others who have been waiting .
" My swabs were taken March which is a positive one , I have pending results from swabs of March 12 , 14 and 24 .
To be discharged kasi before since it was early stages , I need to be taken two swabs which are two days apart , then strict quarantine for 14 days then I can go back to work .
"  However , until now , results of his tests have not been released .
As of March 30 , Dr .
Sollano has been in quarantine for 21 days .
During the Laging Handa Briefing held on March 26 , Health spokesperson Undersecretary Ma .
Rosario Vergeire says there are delays in releasing of results due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of focusing on the negative , Dr .
Sollano said he got by the days alone in his room seeing the bright side amid these dark times .
" At the end of the day it 's also an opportunity for yourself -- talk to that friend you 've always wanted to talk to , that you have n't talked in so lang .
Dance , sing , make a video , cook , do Tiktok .
These are things na you can do for yourself ( that ) you 've always wanted .
It 's a break , yes , it 's also an opportunity to do more good , but ' yon nga , do something you can do for yourself , " he said .
He believes it 's not something Filipinos ca n't beat .
" We may not be the most equipped country but we are more capable in fighting this .
We have shown this time and time again .
Together we can get through this -- a little bit of discipline , sacrifice and patience definitely , we 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that he 's negative of COVID 19 , PH 45 will return to the hospital , no longer as a patient , but as a doctor joining the front line once again .
" I want to go back to work right .
people have been stressed out , they 're tired especially right now , since everyone 's down so people are on the brink of getting burned out .
If I can do my part in helping , I want to go back to work as soon as I can , " Solano said .
