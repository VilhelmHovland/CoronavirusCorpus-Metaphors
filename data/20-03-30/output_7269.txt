PAUL -- In a troubling development in the pursuit of spreading out coronavirus-related intensive care unit use over time , the number of Minnesotans hospitalized for COVID-19 in an ICU setting jumped 50% on Monday , March 30 , from 16 to 24 .
The number of patients hospitalized for the illness jumped nearly 50 % on one day as well , from 39 to 56 .
With the the prioritizing of tests clouding the state 's ability to gain a clear picture of how widespread the illness has become , hospitalization and especially ICU utilization for coronavirus have become two of the few ironclad metrics that have not been suppressed by a national shortage of testing materials like swabs and reagents .
Moreover , the availability of an ICU bed is considered a primary driver of survival from coronavirus .

But the 50% relative rate jump is the highest yet , and unsustainable in the long term .
Above and beyond those used for other health conditions , Minnesota has just 243 available ICU beds , according to state health officials .
The climb in ICU cases came on top of another record one-day jump in new cases , as the state added 73 more confirmed cases and one death , bringing the state total to 576 confirmed cases and 10 deaths .
No information was immediately available on the location or age of the 10th person to have died from the virus , but officials in Martin County have reported a second death there , a man in his 80s who lived in a specialty nursing congregate living facility .

Health officials said Monday that 157 , or nearly one-in-four of the state 's 576 confirmed cases , have been diagnosed in health care workers , a figure that is partly a reflection of the focus on health care workers in state and private testing .
While tensions remain high among health care workers and their families over the potential of becoming exposed to the virus on the job , health officials said the illness was believed to have been passed from a patient to a health care worker in just two instances .
" The vast majority of exposures among health care workers have continued to occur outside of the healthcare setting , " said Minnesota Department of Health Infectious Disease Division Director Kris Ehresmann .
