Greece 's Ministry of Migration and Asylum reported on Monday that Minister Notis Mitarachi met with the mayors of the islands of Mytilini and Chios to review quarantine options for migrants .
According to the ministry , the mayors said they would designate buildings to quarantine migrants arriving at the islands for two weeks , as part of the measures by the government to contain the ongoing coronavirus pandemic .
The mayors also reviewed a request by Migration and Asylum Minister Notis Mitarachi , who said such facilities did not mean the use of " mountains , beaches or ports " and added that he " is willing to fund their operation until they are moved to areas safe to all involved .
"  The mayor of West Lesvos said he would not comply , but planned to propose a ship be used offshore for the purpose , while the mayor of Chios said the municipality would look for a privately owned facility within the urban area but not near its centre .
