As the world witnesses a global crisis , social media is making sure celebrities keep their fans informed and entertained .
One such celebrity --- Sameera Reddy --- is addressing issues children are facing , during this critical 21-day lockdown period .
Her mantra is simple -- take it one day at a time , while making sure your child 's mental health is taken care of .
In the video , Karan asked his son about what he thinks about the coronavirus .
The little one , who seems to have just had some chocolates , said , " very bad .
" When the filmmaker further probed him about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away while his attention was on his games and mumbled , ' playing ' .
Karan rightly pointed out that he is playing to fight the virus and everyone has their own game .
Earlier the filmmaker shared another video where he asked his kids about the current situations around the world .
However , Roohi and Yash could only answer about Peppa Pig and George instead of the coronavirus .
KJo said that his kids have not been keeping up with international affairs and he has to do something about that .
Sharing the video on social media , KJo wrote , " Need to start making them more aware of the current circumstance ! Much more than @officialpeppa and George ! "  Rakul Preet Singh , who was busy with shooting , is now homebound with her brother .
But the lockdown has n't affected her schedule much as the actress always led a disciplined life .
She is catching up on her reading , spending time with her brother and cooking healthy food while working out , practising yoga and meditating at home .
