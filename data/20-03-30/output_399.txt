It 's Time for Stand-ups to Prepare for the Worst  Entertainment is an industry built entirely on disposable income .
As the COVID-19 virus spreads , more and more people are being asked to stay home and practice " social distancing .
" First it started with large stadiums , then theaters , then places with more than 500 people , then down to 100 people .
In many cities , this ask has now transitioned into an order .
Cities like New York and Los Angeles have ordered bars and places of entertainment closed for weeks to come , and some places in New Jersey are even enacting a curfew .
Stand-up comedy , under its current model in most cities , is effectively dead at every level -- from the stadium act down to the open mic-er who just started last week .
I 've been a stand-up comedian for well over 20 years , of which the first nine I amassed over 500K road miles driving from gig to gig .
What 's happening to the economics of this country is unprecedented .
The entertainment industry will be hit very hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need to go to the movies .
You do n't need to go to a concert .
You do n't need to go to a comedy club .
Whenever this ship gets righted , what money people do have will be set aside for more food or any debts that they amass during this time .
You know it 's gon na be bad when power companies coast to coast preemptively announce that they are n't going to turn off your power .
But in the rest of the country , even if people can come to a comedy show , do they want to ?  Part of why I canceled my show in Raleigh , North Carolina , later this month was because even if I flew there and did the show under a 100-max ordinance , would anybody come ? To take that risk and possibly infect a loved one or co-worker did n't seem worth the risk -- not with the information we currently have on hand .
Comedian Kate Willett recently tweeted about low audience turnout , but she was also performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America right now .
There 's surely more hysteria there than places less affected .
This feeling of Is it worth it to go do the gig ? is starting to trickle out .
Long before mass-gathering ordinances were handed down , Trevor Noah , Nikki Glaser , Sam Morril , Joe Machi , and others started to move their dates around , which is to be expected , but for many comedians who are n't high enough on the fiscal totem pole , the financial fallout of this will be felt for months , if not into early 2021 .
There 's a lot of attempts by some to compare this to 9/11 .
Like many comedians , I performed on September 12 , 2001 -- the difference then is that people were n't sure if they could laugh .
Today , some people are n't sure if it 's safe to laugh .
If you have n't been in the business long enough , here are some things to consider about the stability of comedy as the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak ripple out .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they will be looking to reschedule in the fall , competing with one another and people already booked during that time frame .
It 's very plausible that some of these theater acts will trickle down into the comedy clubs , which means if you 're a performer that 's getting canceled right now or set to perform at a comedy club in the fall , your dates may not be safe .
The airline industry , which is only weeks into this crisis , has already begun layoffs .
If the airline industry is suffering , then the average 200-seat comedy room is going to be in dire straits when they reopen -- if they can reopen .
And when they do reopen , they will need big-name acts that can make a splash and help get the club out of the red .
To the credit of the comedy clubs , many have remained open , knowing that they 're going to be operating at a loss .
They do this for the sake of the comedians who need the money as well as their service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last chances for anyone to get money before the next governor passes the next ordinance .
The only thing that 's going to help are the big names that sell tickets .
The further down the comedy totem pole you are , the more out of work you 're likely to be .
Compounding this issue is a potential writer 's strike on the horizon , which will yield more writers and comedic actors on the road this summer and fall jockeying for a few club dates .
Their popularity is more than enough to sell a ticket or two during a financial downswing , and the clubs will be more inclined to book them because they 'll be coming off a few weeks/months of revenue .
It seems like simple logic , but after talking to some in the comedy community , I do n't think there 's a lot of considerations about what the back half of 2020 will look like .
We 're likely to see a gang of theater acts with nowhere to perform , coupled with funny actors and writers with nowhere in L .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomads end up .
The sad truth of this business is that many of these comedy clubs operate on budgets just as tight as the comedians ' .
There will be clubs that do not survive this .
In the long term , I know that the struggles of a city comic versus a road comic are different , but please , during this downtime , start considering other ways to generate revenue for yourself .
Start brainstorming with other comedians in the same boat as you .
No matter where you are on the comedy totem pole , you will feel the effects of this .
Even if you 're one of those What 's the big fucking deal ? I 'm still gon na go do my shows .
The people need to laugh .
More people die from the flu-type comedians .
That 's fine ; you have a right to do what you do .
But just because you want to perform does n't mean it 's going to make sense for the clubs to have you -- assuming that they 're still legally allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are n't a weekend act that 's already selling tickets consistently , the clubs that are hurting in attendance over the next few months could find themselves in a position where it does n't make sense to pay you your full fee to come entertain 50 people in a room that seats 300 .
The fiscally smart thing for the club to do is cancel you and put some locals onstage that will work for less and need the money .
No matter what level of comedy you 're at , whether you have dates or not , this shit ai n't safe .
I know we ca n't all afford to just walk away from shows , but be mindful about not getting guilt-tripped into doing a show for a person who ca n't pay your hospital bills .
If you get sick , the club ai n't gon na help you .
They 're trying to do the same thing we 're all trying to do right now , and that 's keep the lights on .
I 'm not saying do n't perform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you do so .
Comedy is such a great job , because no matter what , you either get money or growth .
But now , for the first time , we have to consider what we have to lose before hitting the stages .
I talked with a few comics already looking at alternate income .
Assuming the census still happens , they 're hiring , so that 's one way to go .
You 've just got ta be creative .
Look into call center jobs or almost anything in the gig economy .
If people are inside longer , grocery/food delivery could be the way to go , and at least it 's a gig job that does n't keep you in close quarters with a person , like Uber or Lyft .
I 'm hearing of comedians creating merch stores , OnlyFans accounts ( yes , that OnlyFans ) , and of course , good , old-fashioned fundraising .
Sam Goldstein has started a GoFundMe that 's attached to a supercut of comedians that have already lost road work .
The proceeds will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , but turning a profit on that in the short term is highly unlikely unless you can sell it to a podcast network .
And as I 've always said , register for SoundExchange ! For all you know , your shit is getting played somewhere and there 's money waiting for you to collect !  Above all , if you 're scheduled to perform in the next few weeks and feel uneasy about it , do n't let your concerns for your own safety be overridden by a club owner or people who might not give a damn about you .
You 've run your career on your terms up until this point ; do n't let the opinions of others waver you .
Whether you choose to keep performing right now or not , a financial crisis awaits this industry the same as all the others .
Make no mistakes , though : The job of comedian is n't going away .
No matter when this situation levels out , the world will need to laugh again .
But until that day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our potential looming problems .
Myself included .
