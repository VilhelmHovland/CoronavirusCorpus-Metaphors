Alexandra Witze  Search for this author in :  Technicians working to assemble the James Webb Space Telescope .
: Chris Gunn/NASA  The world 's most expensive telescope is the latest victim of the coronavirus pandemic that has been sweeping the planet .
The James Webb Space Telescope was supposed to launch in March 2021 , but the viral outbreak has threatened to delay this project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the Moon , and possibly a major mission to Mars this July .
Last week , NASA halted work on the US$8 .
James Webb Space Telescope , the flagship successor to the Hubble Space Telescope .
Webb had been going through final assembly and tests in Southern California -- a region now locked down by the state 's governor to keep people from spreading the coronavirus .
" The decision was made to ensure the safety of the workforce , " NASA said in a 20 March statement .
Engineers have been racing to finish Webb , which is the most complicated space telescope ever built .
After launch , it is meant to unfold like a flower and expose its 6 .
primary mirror , which will stare at distant planets and galaxies for clues to the early and modern Universe .
The observatory is fully assembled inside a clean room at Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems in Redondo Beach , California .
Technicians had been working to put it through a final round of tests -- intended to shake the entire telescope in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket to space .
The work had been mostly on track until NASA pulled its employees because of coronavirus concerns .
" Delaying launch is absolutely the right thing to do , if it will keep the people working on the mission safe , " says Zachory Berta-Thompson , an exoplanet researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder .
" We astronomers can continue to be patient .
"  Nobody knows how long the delays might last .
Webb is ultimately slated to launch from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana , which is itself temporarily closed because of coronavirus concerns .
Each delay now will push the launch date later -- meaning that NASA will continue to have to spend time and money on the telescope as it also tries to develop future missions .
The hold-up adds to a long list of woes for Webb , which has experienced years of delays and cost overruns .
The Mars question  NASA faces an even tighter deadline with its Mars mission .
The rover , named Perseverance , is slated to blast off between 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mars are temporarily aligned in the best way for spacecraft to travel between them .
If it misses the launch window , the mission must wait two years to try again .
The European Space Agency has already delayed a Mars rover it planned to launch in July , in part because of how the coronavirus has affected its employees ' ability to work on the mission .
Perseverance will drill and collect pencil-thin samples of rocks from Mars 's Jezero crater region , which future missions are expected to pick up and return to Earth .
So far , NASA is pushing ahead with Perseverance .
Engineers are working on it at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , which remains open despite the coronavirus outbreak .
They are doing " heroes ' work " in keeping the mission on track for a July launch , said Thomas Zurbuchen , NASA 's head of science , in a 20 March virtual town-hall meeting .
Earlier this month , they attached some of the final equipment to the body of the six-wheeled rover .
Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own aeroplane fleet to transport key staff from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , to Florida for the final weeks of preparation .
" Depending on the phase , this could be about 10 or so people per week , or less , " NASA spokeswoman Alana Johnson told Nature .
Internally , NASA is calling this plan Perseverance Airlines , Zurbuchen said .
Another likely coronavirus casualty is NASA 's plans to send astronauts to the lunar surface by the end of 2024 .
That self-imposed deadline was already hugely ambitious , given that the agency is still working on a heavy-lift rocket and crew capsule for the mission .
Now , work on those has halted at NASA facilities in Mississippi and Louisiana , which are closed because of the coronavirus .
NASA 's Ames Research Center in Northern California , which is working on a lunar rover destined for the Moon 's south pole , is also closed .
NASA missions that are already operating in space continue as planned , with staff running them remotely .
They include Hubble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sample from the surface of the asteroid Bennu as early as August .
The European Space Agency announced on 24 March that it has temporarily turned off science instruments on four Solar System missions , to reduce the number of people needed in its control operations centre in Darmstadt , Germany , where one employee has tested positive for the coronavirus .
The missions are Solar Orbiter , which launched last month and is on its way to the Sun ; two Mars missions , the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express ; and the Cluster satellites , which are investigating Earth 's magnetism .
One US astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts are slated to launch to the International Space Station on 9 April .
Like all visitors to the station , they will be in quarantine for two weeks before launch , to be sure they are n't carrying any infections .
