REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo  President Nicolas Maduro has been broadly discredited among Western nations after his disputed 2018 re-election , leaving few foreign financiers willing to provide funds to improve a health care system decimated by years of economic crisis .
Guaido , who has been recognised by more than 50 nations as the country 's rightful president , said a coalition government would be able to convince multilateral agencies to provide $1 .
billion in financing to address the outbreak .
" It 's crucial that we attend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hospital beds and ventilators , to provide ( water ) for hospitals , " Guaido said in a video interview , referencing the lack of running water in many public medical facilities .
" We have an existing humanitarian emergency in Venezuela , which will worsen the pandemic .
"  The emergency government would not include Maduro or other top allies , he said , a group of whom were indicted by the U .
Department of Justice on Thursday on accusations of narco-terrorism .
He declined to reveal the names of potential participants .
Maduro has dismissed Guaido as a puppet of the United States and in the past has rebuffed calls to step aside .
He denies charges of involvement in the drug trade .
Venezuela 's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Guaido 's proposal .
Guaido in 2019 called on the country 's military to rise up against Maduro to end the country 's economic crisis and create a transition government , but the military 's top brass stuck with Maduro despite the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venezuela is suffering widespread hunger due to an economic collapse that has fuelled the migration of nearly 5 million people since 2015 .
Maduro last year blocked Guaido 's allies from bringing U .
humanitarian aid into the country via neighbouring Colombia , describing the effort as a veiled invasion .
Delivering aid has also been complicated by the broad questioning of Maduro 's legitimacy and accusations that he and his allies are involved in illicit activities .
" Nobody will lend money to a drug trafficker , " Guaido said .
Venezuela as of Sunday had reported 129 cases of coronavirus and 3 deaths , and the country remains under quarantine ordered by Maduro to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
Opposition critics have said the quarantine will be unsustainable for a population that has suffered years of malnutrition , and due to growing gasoline shortages that have made complicated food deliveries .
