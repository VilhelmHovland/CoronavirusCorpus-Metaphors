Two passengers on the Zaandam were confirmed to be infected with Covid-19 , and four " older " guests died , the company said on March 27 .
Some crew reported being cleared by the ship 's doctor to return to work 24 hours after their fever abated , and most crew members who came down with coronavirus symptoms have not been tested for Covid-19 .

Several passengers have died aboard the cruise ship and a few people aboard the ship have tested positive for the new coronavirus , the cruise line said Friday , with hundreds of passengers unsure how long they will remain at sea .

The company said it follows Centers for Disease Control guidelines for in-home quarantines that do n't end until three days have passed without fever and seven days have passed since symptoms began .

The global cruise industry has been hobbled by the pandemic , with vessels from the U .

" Everybody with symptoms should be regarded as infected until proven otherwise , regardless of being crew or passengers , " said Kentaro Iwata , an infectious disease professor at Kobe University who created international headlines by criticizing Japan 's handling of the quarantine of the Diamond Princess .
More than 700 were infected and nine died on that ship .
" I would isolate them for at least 14 days and until they become asymptomatic , " he said .
" I may add even more because they still may carry virus .
"  The CDC recommends that passengers returning from cruises stay home for 14 days and practice social distancing because of the risk of infection .

Zaandam and the sister ship , Rotterdam , passed through the Panama Canal Monday and were heading to Florida .
The cruise line was given permission to transit through the waterway on humanitarian grounds after authorities initially refused it .
The Rotterdam arrived off the coast of Panama without passengers March 26 .
In addition to taking guests from the virus-stricken ship , it delivered Covid-19 test kits .
A flu-like outbreak has spread quickly through the Zaandam : 73 guests and 116 crew members have reported influenza-like symptoms , according to the company .
That 's a 37% spike from numbers released three days ago .

A few who experienced fever and coughs or sore throats had asked the ship 's doctors to get tested and were refused , according to their relatives .
Some crew members who worked in the kitchen or in roles related to dining were cleared by ship doctors to report back to work in as little as 24 hours after a fever , according to relatives and social media posts .
Crew in quarantine also complained about missed meals or insufficient food because of the shortage of workers .
A few meals included just pieces of bread , said relatives .
Florida Bound  In a video address to passengers on Sunday , Holland America Line President Orlando Ashford said the ship transfer of passengers was conducted to reduce the workload for crew and have open cabins to isolate people .
" Our first and primary goal is to manage and protect the safety , health and security of all of you , " Ashford said .
" I apologize for the fact that this has turned out to not be the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a safety and humanitarian effort .
"  Both ships , carrying a total of about 2,500 guests and crew , will be traveling together and are bound for Fort Lauderdale , Florida , said the company .
The Zaandam 's voyage began at Buenos Aires on March 7 , on a South America cruise that was originally scheduled to end at San Antonio , Chile , on March 21 .
Just a day after it departed , the U .
State Department cautioned consumers against getting on cruises , an advisory that was followed by other governments .
Chile would n't allow the vessel to dock and soon all ports were closed off to the Zaandam .
The second leg of its original voyage had the ship disembarking passengers in Fort Lauderdale .
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis , in an interview with Fox News , said he 's opposed to having Holland America passengers get off in south Florida and does n't want those who are n't residents of the state " dumped " there .
