Conclusions  Updated results from the MIG-1 study are numerically in favour of dose-dense chemotherapy , and suggest a long-term benefit of this approach in high-risk early breast cancer patients .
Introduction  High-risk early breast cancer patients are candidates to receive adjuvant chemotherapy .
Anthracycline and taxane-based regimens are superior to other chemotherapy combinations .
Several trials have tried to establish the best regimen and schedule of their **28;1852;TOOLONG With the introduction of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors , it became possible to reduce the interval between chemotherapy cycles , thus allowing the use of dose-dense ( DD ) regimens .
Most of the trials that investigated DD chemotherapy compared different regimen in the DD and standard-interval group , leading to a difficult interpretation of their results .
Nevertheless , five trials9,10,11,12,13 had clean comparison between DD and standard-interval groups in terms of administered dose , number of cycles , type of drug and total dose of chemotherapy .
In a recently published patient-level meta-analysis , DD chemotherapy was superior to standard-interval regimens14 at a median follow-up of 7 .
years .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results after a follow-up longer than 5 years , but none of the trials reported results beyond 10 years of median follow-up .
In the MIG-1 trial , started in 1992 , early breast cancer patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of the 5-floruracil , epirubicin and cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) regimen given every 2 ( FEC14 ) or every 3 ( FEC21 ) weeks .
Considering the significant risk of relapse up to 20 years after diagnosis in breast cancer patients , particularly in those with oestrogen receptor-positive tumours , 15 we decided to update the MIG-1 study in order to report the long-term results , which can be used to better establish the real impact of DD chemotherapy .
Patients and methods  Study design and treatment regimens  Details of MIG-1 study design were previously reported .
Briefly , MIG-1 was an Italian , open-label , multicentre Phase 3 randomised trial in high-risk early breast cancer patients .
High-risk status was defined as lymph node-positive disease ( no more than ten involved axillary lymph nodes ) or lymph node-negative with one or more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oestrogen and progesterone receptors ( defined as less than 10 ? fmol of receptor per milligram of protein or less than 10% positive cells by immunohistochemical analysis ) , tumour size larger than 2 ? cm , poor histologic grade and high proliferative tumours ( determined by a 3 ? Hthymidine-labelling index or by an S-phase fraction obtained with flow cytometry ) .
Patients were to have no clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastases and an adequate bone marrow , hepatic and renal function .
The study was conducted at 21 Italian centres after Ethics Committee approval ; written informed consent was obtained from all patients before trial enrolment .
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of FEC chemotherapy ( 5-fluorouracil at 600 ? mg/m2 , epirubicin at 60 ? mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide at 600 ? mg/m2 intravenously ) administered every 2 weeks with the support of filgrastim ( FEC14 ) or every 3 weeks ( FEC21 ) .
Patients with oestrogen- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumours received tamoxifen at 20 ? mg/day for 5 years .
Postoperative regional radiotherapy limited to the remaining breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endpoints and statistical analysis  The primary study endpoint was overall survival ( OS ) , as estimated from the date of randomisation to the date of last contact or death from any cause .
Event-free survival ( EFS ) , distant disease-free survival ( DDFS ) and toxicity were secondary endpoints .
The EFS event was defined as local relapse , distant relapse , second primary cancer or death from any cause , whichever came first .
DDFS was calculated from the time from randomisation until distant relapse .
In this analysis , we reported OS , EFS , DDFS and incidence of secondary primary malignancies at a median follow-up of 15 years .
As previously reported , 9 the study 's primary hypothesis was that a 50% increase in the dose intensity of FEC would be associated with a 20% relative reduction in the hazard of death .
This reduction corresponds to a 5 -- 6% absolute increase in 5-year survival , which was estimated to be between 65 and 70% in the standard-interval group .
For a type I error of 5 and 80% power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-year period .
The study was closed early due to the sharply declining accrual related to competitive trials , and the planned accrual was not reached .
All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principles , in that all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm were considered as belonging to the arm to which they had been assigned at randomisation .
OS , EFS and DDFS survival rates were obtained from Kaplan -- Meier analyses , and the primary comparison between the two study groups was performed with the log-rank test .
Subgroup analysis of OS and EFS was conducted among patients with hormone receptor-negative and hormone receptor-positive disease .
Moreover , we updated the previously published16 exploratory retrospective analysis on the efficacy of dose-dense chemotherapy according to Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) status .
HER2 status was assessed centrally by immunohistochemical ( IIC ) analysis .
Patients were considered HER2-positive only if IIC analysis was scored as 3+ ? .
At the time of the study , FISH testing was not widely available .
To evaluate the role of various prognostic factors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment in the subgroups of patients identified by the various prognostic factors , a series of Cox proportional hazard models were fitted to overall survival and event-free survival data .
All tests were two-sided .
IBM SPSS software was used in all statistical analyses .
Results  From November 1992 to June 1997 , 1214 patients were randomly assigned to receive FEC14 ( n ? = ? 604 ) or FEC21 ( n ? = ? 610 ) chemotherapy .
Baseline characteristics at study entry were previously reported .
Briefly , median age at study entry was 53 years .
A total of 288 ( 48% ) patients in the FEC14 group and 310 ( 51% ) in the FEC21 group were diagnosed with tumour = ? 2 .
? cm , while 387 ( 64% ) and 396 ( 65% ) had positive lymph nodes , respectively ( Table 1 ) .
At a median follow-up of 15 .
years , 351 deaths were observed : 166 ( 27% ) in the FEC14 group and 185 ( 30% ) in the FEC21 group .
In all , 15-year OS was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FEC14 group and 68% ( 95% CI : 64 -- 72 ) in the FEC21 group ( HR ? = ? 0 .

In total , 494 events were observed : 235 ( 39% ) in the FEC14 group and 259 ( 42% ) in the FEC21 group .
In all , 15-year EFS was 47% ( 95% CI : 41 -- 52 ) in the FEC14 group and 43% ( 95% CI : 37 -- 48 ) in the FEC21 group ( HR ? = ? 0 .

In all , 15-year DDFS rate was 72% ( 95% CI : 66 -- 77 ) in the FEC14 group and 72% ( 95% CI : 68 -- 77 ) in the FEC21 group ( HR ? = ? 1 .

) between FEC21 and FEC14 regimen .
The incidence of second primary cancers was similar in the two groups , being 7 .
in the FEC14 group and 8 .
in the FEC21 group .
Most of these events ( 4 .
) were ipsilateral or contralateral breast cancers ; other second primary cancers were gastrointestinal ( 1 .

No cases of acute leukaemia or myelodysplasia have been reported in patients in either arm .
Subgroup analysis  In the subgroup analysis , we found no statistical evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age , tumour size , lymph node status , oestrogen and progesterone receptor status , proliferative rate , tumour grade or menopausal status ( Table 3 ) .

Discussion  We report long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of the MIG-1 trial that compared DD versus standard-interval FEC chemotherapy in high-risk early breast cancer patients .
MIG-1 was a study of pure accelerated chemotherapy in that patients were randomised to FEC chemotherapy given at either 14- or 21-day intervals , with the same dose of drugs in both treatment arms .
With a median follow-up of 15 .
years , this is the study with the longest-term data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in the overall population ( HR 0 .
) is very close to the results observed in the individual patient-level meta-analysis , where , at a median follow-up of 7 .
years , a HR of 0 .
was reported .
Likewise , the reduction in the risk of recurrence in our updated analysis ( HR 0 .
) is very similar with that reported in the meta-analysis ( HR 0 .
The results of the analysis in most subgroups were numerically in favour of chemotherapy acceleration .
The trend towards a greater benefit of DD chemotherapy in hormone receptor-negative patients ( HR for EFS 0 .
, 95% CI : 0 .
-- 0 .
) and in HER2-positive patients ( HR for EFS 0 .
, 95% CI : 0 .
-- 0 .
) is hypothesis-generating .
It can be hypothesised that DD chemotherapy works well in the subset of patients generally defined as sensitive to chemotherapy , such as hormone receptor-negative17 and HER2-positive patients .
In this latter subgroup , a recent exploratory analysis suggests that the benefit of DD chemotherapy is lost when patients are treated with trastuzumab .
Beside the long-term result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early breast cancer patients treated with anthracycline only-based chemotherapy .
We observed an absolute 47% and 71% 15-year EFS and OS , respectively , for patients receiving DD chemotherapy .
Notably , in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours that received DD chemotherapy and endocrine therapy with tamoxifen for 5 years , 15-year EFS and OS were 42% and 72% , respectively .
This poor long-term prognosis may suggest that anthracycline-only-based chemotherapy is an undertreatment in high-risk breast cancer patients , including those with hormone receptor-positive tumours .
In our trial , some limitations should be acknowledged .
The study closed early and the planned accrual was not reached , so the statistical power is reduced .
Due to the low accrual and the low mortality rate in the study population compared with the mortality expected by the original study plan , our study was underpowered to detect the planned risk reduction in the initial publication .
With 351 deaths and 494 recorded events , our study had an 80% power to detect a reduction in the hazard of death of 27% and a reduction in the hazard of event of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in the hazard of death .
Moreover , an anthracycline-only chemotherapy regimen was used as adjuvant chemotherapy .
This is no longer considered a standard of care in this setting , but it is still adopted by some centres for low-risk luminal-like breast cancer patients .
Epirubicin was administered at a lower dose ( 60 ? mg/m2 ) than currently adopted ; tamoxifen was the only adjuvant hormonal therapy administered to patients with hormone receptor-positive tumours .
As well , trastuzumab and aromatase inhibitors were not available at the time of the trial .
Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was administered only to patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery , whereas nowadays , post-mastectomy radiotherapy is administered to high-risk patients .
No cardiac monitoring was planned during treatment or follow-up among patients enrolled in the study ; thus , no data on cardiac safety are available .
In conclusion , our long-term results are similar to those reported in the individual-patient meta-analysis , and support that the benefit of DD chemotherapy is real and sustained to at least 15 years .
