Greg Hunt intervenes to save private hospitals at risk of collapse  Private hospitals will be prevented from collapsing after their incomes plummeted when the national cabinet ordered many elective surgeries be cancelled to preserve masks and free up capacity for a coronavirus surge .
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt wrote to the private hospital sector late on Monday as negotiations with state governments threatened to fall apart and hospitals warned they would have to close their doors without income , after standing down thousands of nurses without pay .
In the letter , the minister pledged to " guarantee the viability of private hospitals " in addition to paying 50 per cent towards the states and territories ' agreed payments .
Private hospitals are struggling to reach agreement on their promised bailout deals .
Walker  " This is on the expectation that all private hospitals retain capacity for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and non-COVID-19 activities and are able to resume operations at the end of the pandemic , " the letter said .

State governments , which last week agreed to negotiate bailout deals with private hospitals to ensure their capacity to help respond to an influx of COVID-19 patients in coming weeks , are split over whether to cover running costs or simply pay to hold a limited number of beds .
While the Victorian government is close to signing a deal that would enable the state 's private hospitals to remain open for business - allowing them to keep paying suppliers and staff - NSW is pushing for a more conservative model that operators fear will lead to closures .
Australian Private Hospitals Association chief executive Michael Roff said all states must embrace the Victorian model .
" If we 're not getting any money in the door , then we do n't have the capacity to pay our staff , " Mr Roff said .

NSW private hospitals are dissatisfied with the state government 's approach of asking private hospitals to submit individual proposals outlining the number of beds they are offering to hold open , with the department to respond with how many beds they want to pay for .
Some hospitals in the state are being offered less than $1300 per day for each intensive care unit bed to remain available , a figure seen as too low to cover costs .
The split between the NSW and Victorian models was on Monday influencing negotiations in other states .
Mr Roff warned private hospitals could not simply close down , then reopen when they were needed .
Hospital operators are also pushing for personal protective equipment such as masks to be included as part of bailout deals , warning that international supply constraints have left some with less than two weeks worth of masks .

The source said the hospital had asked the NSW government to guarantee access to personal protective equipment , but this had been refused , sparking concern that nurses and doctors would put themselves at risk while trying to save lives .
" If you put someone who needs to be ventilated in front of them , and there is inadequate PPE , it 's impossible for many to walk away , " the hospital source said .
" That 's the attitude of the vast majority of health workers .
They 're going to run towards the danger .
"  The Morrison government has been providing masks through the national medical stockpile to GPs , pharmacists and aged care centres , but hospitals have been expected to source their own protective equipment .
Australia 's deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly on Monday said the federal government would consider giving private hospitals access to the national medical stockpile of masks and other personal protective equipment " as it becomes available " .
