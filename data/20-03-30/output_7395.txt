Austin doctors call for changes in coronavirus response  Julie Chang @JulieChang1  Monday  Mar 30 , 2020 at 11:52 AM  A coalition of more than 100 Austin-area doctors is raising an alarm about how the county is handling the coronavirus crisis .
The group is calling for better communication with clinicians , asking that COVID-19 patients be sequestered in specific hospitals , and requesting a place be created in the Austin Convention Center for those who want to voluntarily isolate themselves from healthy household members but have no where else to go .
The doctors sent the letter of demands Monday to city of Austin and Travis County officials , saying their recommendations will help curb the rise of the disease .
It comes as 206 people in Travis County have tested positive for the disease and 26 of them are hospitalized , according to health officials .
Greg Abbott said Sunday that statewide , hospitals were treating 176 people for the disease .
" I feel like we are so focused on flexing up that we are missing the important prevention side .
As we fight the fire ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showering ( on ) the uninfected population and causing new massive outbreaks , " Theresa Pham , an Austin internal medicine doctor , told the American-Statesman .
Pham is one of the drafters of the letter .
Austin-Travis County health officials are anticipating an increase in hospitalizations as more tests are being administered and the virus continues to spread .
Officials have reported two deaths from the disease so far in Travis County and 38 across the state .
Officials announced on Monday that they are designating two facilities , with about 100 beds total -- one in Williamson County and the other in Travis County -- to isolate and treat nursing home residents who test positive for COVID-19 but do not require hospitalization .
More isolation facilities could open in the future .
" Many of the other task forces are actively looking at things , such as .
hotels , etc .
, for people who do n't require ongoing or do n't have significant medical needs , " Dr .
Liam Fry , a member of the Austin Public Health nursing home task force , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The doctors say in the letter that they are concerned that a large part of the Austin physician community has not been adequately informed about how officials are responding to the spread of COVID-19 .
They do not know where to refer patients for testing or isolation if infected patients do not want to go home but do not meet the criteria to be admitted in the hospital .
The doctors have asked the Austin-Travis County health department to hold regular calls with physicians to keep them updated on developments .
Austin Public Health Director Stephanie Hayden responded to the letter in an email to doctors by saying officials have been sending information for physicians to the Travis County Medical Society and Texas Medical Association and have held calls with area medical directors and health care executives .
She also said that she and Interim Health Authority Dr .
Mark Escott have been responding to physicians ' emails .
CORONAVIRUS IN TEXAS : What we know , latest updates  In responding to Hayden 's reply , one doctor pointed out that not all physicians are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent private clinics that are left in the dark .
"  The Texas Medical Board has phone numbers for physicians , and communication with the medical community should n't be one way , the doctor said .
Separate the sick  Personal protective equipment , such as masks , can be better conserved by designating three area hospitals for COVID-19 patients , the doctors say in their letter , " instead of multiple hospitals admitting 1 to 3 patients each .
"  There are 22 hospitals in Travis County , according to state data .
" The more I read , the more it became clear to me that quarantining all positive cases is the only solution to shorten crisis , " Pham said .
Putting infected patients with each other should not worsen the severity of the illnesses that they have , Fry said .
Jason Pickett , alternate health authority for Austin and Travis County , said that large hospital networks , including St .
David 's HealthCare , Ascension Seton and Baylor Scott &amp; White , already have designated at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , because of the insidious nature of the disease , which can sometimes show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all , it 's impossible to entirely prevent an individual with COVID-19 from entering any hospital , " Pickett said in a statement .
In a joint statement , Ascension Seton , St .
David 's HealthCare and Baylor Scott &amp; White Health said that depending on their needs , coronavirus " patients may be transferred to the most appropriate site of care " and those who do not require hospitalization " are sent home to self-monitor with oversight from the local public health authority .
"  Abbott announced Sunday that the Dallas convention center will be used to house COVID-19 patients in Dallas County , which has the highest number of cases in Texas with more than 480 testing positive .
About 250 beds will be set up there initially .
The Austin doctors say Travis County should follow suit as separating the sick from the healthy helped slow the spread of COVID-19 in China .
Opening isolation facilities for Austin area nursing home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed , Pham said .
