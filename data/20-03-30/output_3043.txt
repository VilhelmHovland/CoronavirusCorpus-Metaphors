Email  LONDON : Azam Khan , who is regarded as one of the world 's best squash players , passed away at the age of 95 in London after a week-long battle with coronavirus .
tested positive for Covid-19 last week and breathed his last at London 's Ealing Hospital , family sources said on Saturday .
Azam Khan , the younger brother of the legendary Hashim Khan , won the British Open four times between 1959 and 1962 .
One of his victories was over Roshan Khan with a dominating 9-1 , 9-0 , 9-0 scoreline that forced the Squash Rackets Association to introduce a playoff for third place to make it worthwhile for the audience to buy tickets .
Azam was at the peak of his career when he last appeared on the professional circuit in 1962 .
The same year he clinched the most important hardball tournament , the US Open , for the first time .
Azam then retired from competitive squash due to an Achilles tendon injury .
Although his injury healed nearly two years later , he never returned to the professional circuit .
" Yes , the Achilles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest when my 14-year-old son died in 1962 .
Thereafter , my squash activities were confined to my club , " he said in a past interview .
Khan never played the game until he was 26  Khan stopped playing squash altogether a little over a decade ago due to osteoarthritis .
Born in Nawakille , a small village outside Peshawar , Azam had settled in the UK in 1956 .
There he established and ran the once-popular New Grampians Squash Club in Sheperd 's Bush , London .
After 50 years in operation , the club closed down a few years ago due to climbing overheads and dwindling memberships .
In a profile about the celebrated sportsman , British-Pakistani journalist Ijaz Chaudhry wrote : " The least-acclaimed of all the great squash Khans , Azam might have been the greatest of them all .
"  He added : " A member of the most successful family the game has ever seen , Azam Khan was also directly involved in the grooming of world champions from his adopted land as well as the country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own right .
But for two factors -- first respect for his brother and later mourning for his son -- Azam Khan might have been the greatest squash player of all time .
"  In a conversation with Ahmed some 14 years ago , Azam Khan described how his career began : " I was a tennis coach at the officers ' club of the Pakistan Air Force .
My elder ( and only ) brother , Hashim , who had won the last two British Opens , told me to switch to squash .
I was 26 at the time and had never played the game .
"  When asked why he left Pakistan , Azam said : " Although I was a coach in the Pakistan Air Force , I 'd been employed as a porter , with a monthly salary of 60 rupees .
In 1953 , when I reached the semi-final of the British Open on my maiden appearance , I was promoted to ' electrician ' and my salary rose to 100 rupees per month .
But the following year , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the level of porter .
The reason given was that the post of electrician no longer existed .
"  Azam added that in 1956 , he played an exhibition match against Hashim Khan at the New Grampians Club in Shepherds Bush .
" After the match , the owner of the club approached me and offered me the job of coach .
The offer included a salary as well as accommodation .
I had no option but to accept it .
