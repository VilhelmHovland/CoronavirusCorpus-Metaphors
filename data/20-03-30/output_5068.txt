The official count of the number of people with coronavirus , or COVID-19 , is likely to grossly underestimate the actual stats , according to a public health expert .
" Remember , we did not have testing rolled out when we should have .
a couple of months ago , " Dr .
Robyn Gershon , a clinical professor of epidemiology at New York University 's School of Global Public Health , told Yahoo Finance 's The Ticker .
" We were delayed -- now some of those tests are coming forward .
and the numbers I 've seen have indicated that this number is a small fraction of the actual number of positive cases in the U .
I 've seen estimates from anywhere between five to 15 times that number .
"  There are currently more than 770,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide , with 20% -- or 157,000 -- of those cases are in the U .
as of midday March 30 .
On Monday , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that " the United States hit 1 million samples tested " in total and that 100,000 tests were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen swabbing the occupants of a car at a drive through COVID-19 testing station at Chessington World Of Adventures Resort on March 28 , 2020 in Chessington , England .

In mid-March , one professor noted that people should n't believe the numbers they see because of how limited testing was at that stage .
Part of the problem , Dr .
Gershon added , is that local health departments are " so busy , so short staffed , that they are not capturing the numbers of positive cases in their own jurisdictions and forwarding it " to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention .
Trump announces that the U .
has now tested more than one million people for coronavirus -- a milestone his administration originally sought to reach by the end of the first week of March , more than three weeks ago : https : //t .
' Now what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The U .
epicenter of New York reported almost 7,000 new cases of the coronavirus on Monday , bringing the total to nearly 66,500 in the state .
While the number of hospitalizations continues to grow , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo did note a silver lining .
" We had a doubling of cases every two days , then a doubling every three days and a doubling every four days , then every five , " Cuomo stated .
" We now have a doubling of cases every six days .
So while the overall number is going up , the rate of doubling is actually down .
"  Confirmed coronavirus cases are still on the rise .
( David Foster/Yahoo Finance )  While testing is still relatively scarce -- about 1% of New York 's population has been tested thus far -- the city is likely to peak in the next week or so , Dr .
Gershon said .
" New York City , New York State -- the epicenter right now of the epidemic -- will peak around April 7 to April 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate in a way , because of how many resources it has at its disposal , she added .
" New York City is huge , dense -- over 8 million people living very close by , " Dr .
Gershon said .
And unlike other dense cities , " in New York City , we 're blessed to have over 40 hospitals .
11 hospitals alone in the public health system , " she added .
" So we do have the resources .
"  Confirmed coronavirus cases are still on the rise .
( David Foster/Yahoo Finance )  And while New York " obviously could have done a lot of things much better , " Dr .
Gershon stressed that other cities could learn from the city 's experience .
" We could have rolled out testing much sooner .
We could have done contact tracing at that point , we could 've identified those cases , figured out where they were , and looked for hotspots , really put down targeted quarantine procedures around those cases , " Dr .
Gershon explained .
She added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late for that -- now what we have to do is really identify the emerging hotspots like Chicago , Detroit .
Atlanta .
"  Public health experts are warning about the rise in cases outside of New York and are calling for more testing to better track the spread .
" It putters along and you think you 're OK , then it starts to go up a little and then bingo -- it goes up in an exponential way , " Dr .
Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease , told CNN .
" That 's what 's happening in New Orleans right now .

President Donald Trump takes a new COVID-19 test kit developed by Abbott Labs out of its box during the daily coronavirus briefing at the Rose Garden of the White House on March 30 , 2020 in Washington , DC .

President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed urgently .
Montana Governor Steve Bullock warned that the rural states were " going to have some real problems " if they ca n't obtain the necessary testing equipment , according to a recording of a call between the president and governors obtained by CBS News .
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan warned that huge spikes of infection in the Navajo Nation could " wipe out those tribal nations .
"  " We 're seeing incredible spikes in the Navajo Nation , and this is going to be an issue where we 're going to have to figure that out and think about maybe testing and surveillance opportunities , " she said .
" The rate of infection , at least on the New Mexico side .
we 're seeing a much higher hospital rate , a much younger hospital rate , a much quicker go-right-to-the-vent rate for this population .
And we 're seeing doubling in every day-and-a-half .
And it could wipe out those tribal nations .
"  Dr .
Gershon back in New York stressed how urgent the situation was .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , get them isolated .
tested .
in home quarantine , " she stressed .
" Because the sooner we can get that curve dropping down , the better it will be for our hospitals .
