Coronavirus delays Primary  The effort to slow and halt the spread of Coronavirus has led to some major decisions around the state and nation -- and one impacts Switzerland County voters .
Late last week the State of Indiana issued a directive that the upcoming Primary Election -- traditionally scheduled for the first Tuesday following the first Monday in May ( May 5th this year ) -- would be delayed .
Indiana will now hold its Primary Election nearly a month later , on Tuesday , June 2nd .
Switzerland County Clerk of Courts Gayle Sullivan said that the delay in the primary meant that the voting machine public testing that was originally set for Wednesday , March 25th was canceled and will be rescheduled closer to the new primary date .
Sullivan also reminded all county voters -- especially those who may be concerned with coming into close contact with others , that there is the availability of voting on an absentee ballot .
For those who may be worried about the virus , the clerk is advising that voters may request an absentee ballot , so that they can vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To request an absentee ballot , a vote can call the Switzerland County Clerk 's office at ( 812 ) 427-4415 ; or they can be requested online by going to : www .
