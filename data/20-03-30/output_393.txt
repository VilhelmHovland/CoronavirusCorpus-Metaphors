First Denial , Then Fear : Covid-19 Patients in Their Own Words  Judie Shape , 81 , who was diagnosed with Covid-19 and was a resident at Life Care Center of Kirkland , the long-term care facility linked to at least 29 coronavirus deaths , leaves the center after recovering , with her daughter Lori Spencer , in Kirkland , Washington , on March 26 .
Photograph : David Ryder/Reuters  Welcome to the first of what will be regular chapters of a living oral history of the Covid-19 pandemic , an attempt to capture in real time the stories playing out across our country , in the words of those who are experiencing the crisis .
This installment focuses on people who are ill right now ( or suspect they are sick ) because of the virus , along with the voices of doctors and health care workers taking care of them .
The project grows out of my work writing and researching an oral history of September 11th , a world-changing disaster that rewrote our geopolitics , our economy , and our society .
Now , of course , we 're all living through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to rewrite even more of our geopolitics , our economy , and our society .
Capturing the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic -- how this crisis unfolds and how our thinking about it changes -- is critical both to understanding it now as well as to the stories we someday will tell about it .
Each Friday , WIRED will publish a new chapter , weaving together as many stories as we can from across the country about living through this " Covid Spring , " trying to capture the story of American government , American business , and American life , and the titanic task ahead for our health care system .

None of us knows how many chapters it may take until we 're out of this .
Editor 's note : The following oral history has been compiled from original interviews , social media posts , and online essays .
Quotes have been lightly edited , copy-edited , and condensed for clarity .
I : Living With Covid-19  As of Thursday afternoon , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in the world , more than 85,000 total .
Yet that number still represents what is almost surely a fraction of the actual number of cases in the US , as testing has lagged nationwide and many who are ill and wish to be tested do n't meet the strict criteria to receive a test still in place across much of the country .
The scale of the nation 's epidemic also means that public health officials have quickly abandoned attempts to trace the contacts of those infected , leaving those sickened by the virus -- or those who think they 've been sickened by the virus -- wondering not only if they have it , but how they caught it .
Amee Vanderpool , writer and lawyer , Washington , DC : People are in total denial about this .
I even did that for the first three days .
The 21st was a Saturday .
Saturday is when I came out of denial .
I definitely had something that I 'd never had before .
I could get really sick .
Anne Kornblut , director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , California , via Facebook : I tested positive for Covid-19 last week .
I 'm relatively fine ; lucky , even .
Around here , officials have been preparing , so much so that I was able to get a test when I needed it .
Facebook sent us home many days ago , so it 's unlikely I affected a big group of colleagues .
I went supply shopping weeks ago .
Here 's what I did n't prepare for : telling my kids to back away from me , while informing them that this scary thing upending the entire planet is now inside our house .
Inside their mom .
My daughter cried and asked if I will get better .
I could n't hug her .
My son wrote an account of it for our home newspaper .
" Anne Kornblut has the coronavirus but do not worry it is not the bad kind , " he wrote on the front page .
" Please note that you should not be within 10 feet of Anne .
"  Morgan Madison , age 18 , Chandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all -- I did n't really care about the virus .
Trump told us it was never going to hit the United States .
He said there were like three cases .
I thought I definitely would n't get it -- if there are just a handful of cases , why would I be one ? I work at a car dealership , and my GM got back from a seven-country tour , and four or five days after he got back I had a sore throat .
Our receptionist got a horrible cough too .
She just stopped coming to work .
Last Monday , I got to my desk and just started hacking up a lung .
My GM came in and said , " Clorox wipe your office and go home .
" I woke up the next day and felt like trash .
I felt I had inhaled glue .
My throat was sticky .
I was coughing .
Lots of migraines .
Horrible migraines .
It just went from feeling great to taking a five-hour nap in the afternoon .
There was dizziness and confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lung came back .
There were a couple of times I 'll just be sitting on the floor hitting my inhaler .
Howard Yoon , literary agent , Washington DC : A week prior to getting a fever , I 'd developed a sore throat and a runny nose .
That was the seventh of March .
The idea of the coronavirus was creeping into everyone 's minds when they got sore throats .
Out of an abundance of caution , I stayed home .
I felt fine the next day .
That might have just been a cold or maybe that was the onset of the virus ? Since I felt fine after that first day , I went to New York that Wednesday .
I tried to take some precautions -- avoided the subway , walked most places .
That night , I had drinks with some friends and colleagues .
I knew I had it four days later on Sunday the 15th .
All the days leading up , I do n't know whether I had it and was developing all week or it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people I had drinks with , she has tested positive for the coronavirus .
I do n't know if I gave it to her or she gave it to me .
Advertisement  Anne Kornblut : Even when I got sick , I assumed I did n't have it .
After reading so many coronavirus stories as part of my job for weeks now , I thought I knew what to look for : a dry cough , a slow onset , a high fever .
I had none of those things .
Instead it hit me suddenly , with chills , aches , a mild fever , a sore throat , and a terrible headache , and then improved dramatically within three days .
Now I 'm just extremely tired , and because of a history of pneumonia , trying to force myself to sleep .
Amee Vanderpool : I felt like I was hit by a bus and very tired .
I felt like I was getting a head cold .
My breathing started becoming constricted around my lower ribs , not high up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I slept most of the day .
I tried to call my doctor 's office just to give myself a laugh , and I got the same recording that tells you to call 911 in an emergency and then to call back .
They do n't even give you the option of leaving a message anymore .
Howard Yoon : Saturday , I had a scratchy throat .
Then Sunday morning , the 15th , I woke up and my face was warm .
I experienced a lot of fatigue .
I did n't get out of bed .
I 'd purchased a smart thermometer , so I was tracking myself : 8:09 am on Sunday , I had a fever of 100 .
By Sunday afternoon , I self-quarantined in our basement apartment .
At 2 pm , I was at 101 .
At 9 pm , it spiked to 102 .
I was just rolling around in bed .
I was drinking a lot of liquids .
I felt parched constantly .
The weird thing is I had an appetite .
For a while , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne Kornblut : The health department called to inform me to stay away from everyone , including my children .
So who should take care of them if my husband tests positive , too ? " We have n't had that scenario yet , " the public health nurse said , offering to call me back .
Morgan Madison : I called my doctor , and they said , " Do you know three people who have it ? " No .
" Have you been to China , Europe , or these places ? " No .
OK , just try to get better at home .
Then I was seeing the news tags on Facebook ; I saw the news that there were now hundreds of cases .
After I found out I could n't be tested , I was thinking , " Who else ca n't be tested ? I 'm really sick and no one 's being tested .
"  Howard Yoon : The next morning , like a storm clearing , I woke up and my fever was just gone .
At 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing with a physician 's assistant that day .
She told me maybe I did n't have the coronavirus .
The teledoc said stay quarantined for one more day .
On Tuesday , I came back upstairs .
I 'd heard the MedStar in Adams Morgan , near where I live , was doing tests , and I went , but I evidently did n't qualify .
I needed to have a fever and a cough .
Even though I had been with someone who tested positive , it was n't enough .
Amee Vanderpool : I 've given up on getting tested for the time being .
I am already in self-quarantine and I do n't feel well enough to run around trying to find a drive-up testing center .
Anne Kornblut : Last Friday , my husband Jon 's doctor called to say he had it , too .
Jon hung up the phone and made a plus symbol .
Positive .
Even though it was probably inevitable , the news was strangely shocking .
The medical advice , already unclear , got more confusing .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we test our two kids ? No , the doctors said .
You should assume your kids have it , or already did .
So does that mean we can all hold each other , and be together in the same rooms ? Can I take off my mask and gloves ? No , the doctors said .
You do n't want to give them more virus -- more " viral load " -- and make them or both of you even sicker .
And absolutely no one can come or go from the house .
Advertisement  Amee Vanderpool : If you have ever been in a situation where you could not breathe for an extended period of time you will understand what I am saying here .
This Covid-19 is scaring the hell out of people with respiratory issues .
So far my lungs are totally clear , which is pretty much keeping me calm .
If that changes and I am not able to breathe , I will immediately go to the hospital .
Until then , I will self-quarantine and take extra good care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I say a lot , I mean a glass every hour and then one or two more for good measure .
Extreme dehydration seems to be a major component here , and I am hoping that staying hydrated is most of the battle .
Howard Yoon : I was still experiencing a lot of fatigue .
I 'd tried to work for a half-hour and then feel like I needed a nap .
That night , Wednesday , I went to cook a chicken I 'd defrosted before I got sick .
My wife came downstairs , and said , " What 's that smell ? That chicken has gone bad .
" I could n't smell it .
I put my nose right into it and realized I had no sense of taste and smell .
I still do n't .
Since then , I 've just been sleeping a lot .
As of three days ago , my energy bar is getting bigger .
Morgan Madison : When I cook , I do n't smell anything while I 'm cooking .
I can smell really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing sweet .
Anne Kornblut : With both of us now sick , we set the bar at survival .
We took turns with the kids .
We wore masks and gloves to make their food .
We begged them to put themselves to bed .
We tried not to seem sick , even though we took one step forward , another back .
I went from no fever to a low fever .
An odd headache recurred , one that felt like a kind of brain fog .
My breathing was up and down -- never very problematic , just enough to worry .
The weird loss of smell thing happened with me , though not Jon .
We both needed naps .
Coryn Wolk , photographer , Philadelphia : My father is recovering from a mild case of coronavirus , and my mother is making a show of staying six feet away from him until his quarantine ends .
Last night , we had a family conference call -- them , me , and my sister in Maine .
My dad held their landline phone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away .
Anne Kornblut : I gave up on the mask soon anyway -- slowly at first , then increasingly as it became clear that the kids needed our normalcy more than anything .
We kept our distance from each other and from them .
But we gave occasional quick hugs .
How do you tell a 7-year-old and an 8-year-old that it will be fine , their parents wo n't both die , without some little touch ? Our daughter , so ecstatic at her first hug after all that time , made me an " I 'm better ! " button and insisted I wear it .
It was premature , but I put it on anyway .
The kids ' questions were searing .
" How do people have funerals for the coronavirus if people are n't allowed to be together ? " " If I die from coronavirus , how would my friends who do n't know each other know to come to my funeral ? "  Morgan Madison : My work and my boyfriend 's work require a positive test for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to understand that we literally will not be tested .
I 've had multiple episodes where I 've been stuck laying on the floor , struggling to breath , head pounding , and sweating like I just ran a marathon , but I ca n't afford a $30,000 hospital bill to go get an oxygen mask and still no test .
Advertisement  Anne Kornblut : Every night I have dreams about infecting other people .
I 'm in a movie theater , sharing popcorn with someone , when I suddenly remember I have the coronavirus and tell the other person .
I 'm in a meeting , borrowing someone 's pen , when I tell them I 'm sick .
Night after night .
Yesterday I left the house for the first time in 13 days and took a walk in our neighborhood .
It 'll be at least another week and a half , and probably longer , before we 're out of quarantine , but doctors say we can go outdoors if we stay far from others .
So I veered 40 feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind carrying my germs .
By the time I returned home , I had to sleep .
II : Critical Condition  While the majority of people who are infected by Covid-19 will not require hospitalization -- about 80 percent of cases appear to be mild -- the virus has a remarkably high rate of severe , and even fatal , cases compared to the regular flu .
So far , the picture we have of what 's happening to the most serious cases of Covid-19 is limited .
Few first-person accounts have emerged of patients , and so far privacy concerns have kept reporters and cameras out of the hospitals as the crisis swells .
In an interview with CNN 's Brian Stelter , emergency physician Esther Choo said , " What would the zombie apocalypse be like if we only had verbal descriptions of zombies , but could never show them ? "  A rare first-hand exception came last week , when David Lat , the founder of the blog Above the Law and now a legal recruiter , posted a photo of himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case had developed in a multi-part Twitter thread , published on Wednesday , March 18 .
David Lat , legal recruiter , New York City , via Twitter : How did I get the coronavirus ? I have no idea ; it was true community spread .
And I was also contributing to that spread , because I ( stupidly and cavalierly ) brushed off my initial mild symptoms and went to the gym , office , etc .
On Thursday , 3/12 , I woke up fever-free without having taken fever-reducing meds , which struck me as great .
In fact , by that afternoon I was thinking that maybe I was over whatever little three-day bug I had .
Boy , was I wrong .
On Thursday afternoon/evening , I developed a nasty cough , replete with heavy chest congestion .
This continued into Friday , which is when my fever returned ( 101 .
I called my internist on Friday , 3/13 .
The physician 's assistant I spoke with said it sounded like a flu that turned into bronchitis .
She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better as early as the next day .
Unfortunately , I got worse over the weekend , my coughing having progressed to the point where it was making it hard for me to breathe .
On Sunday , 3/15 , I made my way to the emergency room at NYU Langone Medical Center , my nearest ER .
I described my symptoms at the ER , but based on all the horror stories I had read about the difficulty of getting a Covid-19 test , I was n't expecting much -- and I was right .
By Monday 3/16 , I could n't breathe again .
I rushed back to the ER -- and this time they were on their game .
They admitted me , gave me oxygen , put me in an isolation room -- and FINALLY gave me the Coronavirus test .
Last weekend , two nights after his Twitter thread , David Lat was intubated and put on a ventilator .
He has not tweeted since .
He remains in critical condition .
Advertisement  Update : On the evening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been moved out of the ICU but was still in the hospital in serious condition .
I do n't want to be presumptuous , since my condition is stable but still serious .
I require 24/7 oxygen , I need a nurse 's help for even the simplest tasks , and I only just now progressed to solid foods .
So I 'm not out of the proverbial woods yet .
I 'm upbeat and optimistic , strengthened by all your thoughts , prayers , and wishes for a speedy recovery .
The Caregivers  Instead of hearing from patients , the picture we 're beginning to have is emerging in harrowing terms from the social media posts and interviews with doctors , nurses , EMTs , and health care professionals who are on the front lines of the hospitals ' responses across America .
Mary Macdonald , emergency department nurse , Oakland County , Michigan , in an Instagram post : I 'm an emergency room nurse and have been working on the front lines of this coronavirus for the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had asked me 10-plus days ago if I thought that this was going to get as bad as it was , I would 've told you " no .
" You heard the rumors , you saw the trends , but until you see it firsthand you just have no idea what it 's like , what it 's going to be like , and it 's truly frightening .
Craig Spencer , Director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine , New **26;2262;TOOLONG University Medical Center , via Twitter : Walk in for your 8 am shift : Immediately struck by how the calm of the early morning city streets is immediately transformed .
The bright fluorescent lights of the ER reflect off everyone 's protective goggles .
There is a cacophony of coughing .
You stop .
Mask up .
Walk in .
Craig Spencer : You take signout from the previous team , but nearly every patient is the same , young and old : Cough , shortness of breath , fever .
They are really worried about one patient .
Very short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , but still breathing fast .
Esther Choo , to CNN 's Stelter : The truth is , the sickest patients are terrifying .
They are air-hungry , dropping their oxygen , confused , distressed .
We can never show that .
But it is terrifying .
Craig Spencer : You 're notified of another really sick patient coming in .
You rush over .
They 're also extremely sick , vomiting .
They need to be put on life support as well .
You bring them back .
Two patients , in rooms right next to each other , both getting a breathing tube .
It 's not even 10 am yet .
Mary Macdonald : Things have been changing for us on the front lines every single day -- hourly -- in regards to policies and procedures that we should be putting into place to fight off this coronavirus .
The numbers are starting to double and triple in regard to people that are coming in .
Most people are not getting tested , especially if you 're walking while you 're being sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Floor beds were converted to ICU beds on the fly as a cascade of patients in the ED and on the floor required emergency intubation .
Inspiring to watch RN , NP/PA and MD administration come together to find a way to care for these patients .
Rebekah Gee , CEO , Louisiana State University Health Care Services , in an interview Thursday with CNN 's New Day : We 're fighting a war , and when you think about how you fight a war you need two things -- you need to be equipped with what you need to fight that battle and you need personnel and strategy .
Unfortunately , our equipment is starting to reduce .
We 're a couple of days away from being out of masks .
We 're buying gowns on eBay in some cases .
Advertisement  Rob Davidson , emergency room physician , Michigan , via Twitter : As an ER doc I 've always known I could be exposed to a pathogen or toxin that could harm me .
But in the past , when the risk was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective gear needed to be as safe as possible .
Esther Choo , via Twitter : My heart may never recover from all the people dropping off personal supplies of gloves and N95 masks and offering to sew facemasks for hospital workers .
Covid-19 is uncovering our societal fault lines , but so much kindness too .
Meredith Case : Staffing these beds requires incredible resources .
Hard to say which will run out first -- staffing , physical beds , ventilators , or other life support devices , e .
Continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) machines to run continuous dialysis for the many patients developing renal failure .
Mary Macdonald : Resources are very slim .
We have no medications to keep these patients even ventilated -- let alone ventilators .
Medications like fentanyl or propofol that would keep a patient sedated while they 're intubated we 're out of .
We 're out of Tylenol .
We 're out of Tylenol .
And that 's not even going back to the fact that we do n't have any ventilators to put these patients on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions in regard to people 's care .
Esther Choo : This country is beginning to feel like the devil 's romper room .
Craig Spencer : Nearly everyone you see today is the same .
We assume everyone is Covid-19 .
We wear gowns , goggles , and masks at every encounter .
All day .
It 's the only way to be safe .
Where did all the heart attacks and appendicitis patients go ? It 's all Covid .
Mary Macdonald : It 's getting to the point now that we 're going to be just like Italy .
We intubated from 10 pm last night until this morning .
We intubated two of my patients within a half-hour , and I would say upwards of 10 patients were put on ventilators .
My patient took the last ventilator available in the hospital at 7 am .
Meredith Case : Today was the worst day anyone has ever seen , but tomorrow will be worse .
We are on the precipice of rationing .
Needless to say , these decisions run counter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Macdonald : I did n't choose nursing or the health care field to not help people , and that 's exactly what the choices are that they 're giving us .
They 're giving us no choice but to help only the people that they think can survive .
Rob Davidson : In addition to our own safety , some of us have faced -- and others will face -- decisions we never thought possible in this country .
We are making life-or-death decisions not based on research , data and evidence .
but based on a lack of ventilators .
Craig Spencer : Before you leave , you wipe EVERYTHING down .
Your phone .
Your badge .
Your wallet .
Your coffee mug .
All of it .
Drown it in bleach .
Everything in a bag .
Take no chances .
Sure you got it all ? ? ? Wipe it down again .
Ca n't be too careful .
Meredith Case : I am ending my night by delivering acetaminophen to a co-resident who spiked her first fever today .
She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rob Davidson : It 's a stressor that we bring home as well .
From changing out of our scrubs in a " safe place " at the hospital and disinfecting every item we carry back and forth , to disrobing in our garages and sprinting to a shower before greeting our loved ones , life is very different .
Bill de Blasio , mayor , New York City , in an interview with CNN , Monday , March 23 : It 's going to be bad this week , it 's going to be worse the following week .
We have to be honest about this .
This is just the beginning .
Rob Davidson : What will we do when a significant number of health care workers succumb to the coronavirus ? Who will staff our hospitals ?  Jean Schoening , pharmacist , Chicago : I am a retail pharmacist and encounter at least 100 to 200 people a day .
I have not coped well with working so closely to the public right now .
Minor issues that pop up in pharmacy regularly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried every day at work , occasionally due to panic attacks , since our area shut down schools and restaurants .
I cry from the anxiety of wondering every single day as I walk up to the store , " Will today be the day I catch it ? " This is during the initial upward movement of the curve .
What will the peak look like ?  Rana Awdish , medical director of care experience , Henry Ford Health System , Detroit , via Twitter : I lost my first friend to Covid-19 today .
He wo n't be the last .
Chris Albon , director of data science , Devoted Health , via Twitter : My wife is a doctor at University of California-San Francisco .
We sent our kids to stay with family two hours before the shelter-in-place order took effect .
We have n't seen them in almost two weeks , I do n't know when we will see them again .
Jean Schoening : I am currently the only one earning money as my significant other works for a nonessential small business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in money , is more significant than I had realized .
Another significant fear is that I will be the one that brings the virus into our house .
If we do end up with the virus , it will of course be the only person working outside of the home .
This thought consumes my day and night .
Rachel Patzer , PhD , director , Center for Health Sciences Research , Emory University , Atlanta , via Twitter : My spouse is a physician in the emergency department , and is actively treating coronavirus patients .
We just made the difficult decision for him to isolate and move into our garage apartment for the foreseeable future as he continues to treat patients .
We have a three-week-old newborn and two young kids and just ca n't risk it .
It pains me to wonder how many weeks will go by that he wo n't get to hold our new baby or see our older kids .
Mary Macdonald : This is truly scary and nobody is taking it seriously .
I want to jump through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with their friends still .
Esther Choo : Today some of my colleagues and I vowed to tell each other 's kids how much they were loved , if any of us are not around to tell them ourselves .
Advertisement  Craig Spencer : Everyone we see today was infected a week ago , or more .
The numbers will undoubtedly skyrocket overnight , as they have every night the past few days .
More will come to the ER .
More will be stat notifications .
More will be put on a ventilator .
Mary Macdonald : Do n't do anything that could put you at risk to have to see me at the end of the tunnel .
I 'm telling you it 's not worth it .
I do n't know what I can do to save people anymore .
For those health care professionals in areas of the country where the coronavirus wave has n't hit yet , days right now remain tense .
Candice Cody , anesthesiologist , Washington DC : The cases we 're doing , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , practicing for these massive intubations in the ER and the OR .
The wave has n't hit us yet .
Everything right now is cleaning and disinfecting three or four different times , three or four different ways .
At work , tension is high .
We 're doing the aerosol generating procedures , which are most dangerous for Covid-19 exposure .
I have several people in my department who are sick .
We 're still awaiting test results .
We have spouses who are sick .
We 're waiting for a number of us to fall .
In the call room the other day , someone broke down in tears , worried about bringing it home to her family ; she 's got a child with respiratory issues .
Another partner sent her children to live with her parents ; she does n't know when they 'll come back .
My husband John Cody and I are on two front lines ; one of us is doing intubations , the other is doing ER-receiving in the Covid tent .
There are young doctors who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if we both get sick , who is going to take care of our kids ? In the garage , we have two bins , for dirty clothes and clean clothes .
I have a 30-minute decontamination procedure I do at work , and then I come home and then I change into clean clothes in the garage , and go right to the shower .
I 'm washing everything down everyday with bleach .
We 're kissing the children on the hair only .
Our affection is touching feet together right now .
I 'm on my phone constantly ; how to disinfect my PPE to reuse multiple times , reading studies .
We have phone conferences every night .
There 's so much to learn so fast .
At least we have some time before the wave hits .
I really feel for the people in New York .
The messaging has been such a terrible disaster for the public .
President Trump is sending this message that it 's going to be OK .
He 's saying only older people are going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be open by Easter ? How can anyone understand this ?  Nora McGreevy contributed research to this article .
