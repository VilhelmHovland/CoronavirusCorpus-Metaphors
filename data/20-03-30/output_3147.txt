The U .
weighs the grim math of death vs .

By Ann Saphir and Jeff Mason  SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Hollstadt Consulting CEO Molly Jungbauer has had to let go 30 of the 150 employees at her St .
Paul , Minnesota firm to weather the drop in revenue from travel industry clients because of the coronavirus .
She 's worried about her daughter , who lives in New York and has the disease .
But she also worries that shutting the economy with open-ended stay-at-home orders could have an " irreversible " impact .
So she was relieved to hear Minnesota Governor Tim Walz 's plan last week : clamp down on commerce and social activity now but then reopen the state for business by May 4 .
" It is nice to know that we have somewhat of an end date , " she said .
Coronavirus shut-downs could lop 25% or more from U .
output , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of work .
( For a graphic , please see https : //reut .
) The U .
government and the Fed are mounting what could be a $6 trillion economic rescue .
And elected U .
politicians entrusted with public welfare are making calculations centered around the question : How many possibly preventable deaths are acceptable , as weighed against millions of jobs lost and trillions of dollars of economic output foregone ?  Declaring the cure ca n't be worse than the disease , President Donald Trump has said that by April 12 , he wanted churches all over the country to be " packed " with Easter celebrants .
On Sunday , Trump backed away from that goal by extending social distancing guidelines to April 30 .
More testing is critical , Trump advisor Stephen Moore told Reuters .
" Once you have testing you can open up the economy , " he said .
South Korea has tested a much bigger portion of its citizens than the United States has , allowing it to reduce infections and without stopping its economy .
The U .
has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states are making bigger inroads than others .
Also key , Moore said , is understanding if new cases are rising as fast in the Midwest as on the coasts , and if more people can , like the hundreds of thousands of workers at FedEx still on the job , practice social distancing and still work .
" You kind of have to look at the businesses that are running , " Moore said .
BUCKLE UP , MINNESOTA  U .
state and local officials are doing their own calculus .
" We will not put a dollar figure on human lives , " New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said .
Almost half of the 130,000 U .
cases to date have appeared in New York , where some hospitals are overwhelmed with critically-ill patients .
Other governors in states with fewer cases are forging ahead with plans to try to limit both deaths and economic damage .
On Wednesday , Walz - who is self-quarantining after possible exposure - told Minnesotans that models project an eventual 2 .
million infections statewide .
If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as 74,000 Minnesotans could die because too few hospital beds and ventilators means patients wo n't get the medical care they need .
Economically , he said , the state ca n't afford to stay shut for a year or more until a vaccine is developed , an approach an influential Imperial College study https : **39;3030;TOOLONG .
recommends .
So Walz is imposing a strict " stay-at-home " order for two weeks and a more relaxed version for a few weeks after that , to give hospitals the time to prepare .
Epidemiologists refer to this as " flattening the curve .
"  " I do n't believe it 's prudent to try to shelter in place until a vaccine is there , " Walz said .
" I 'm asking you to buckle it up for a few more weeks here .
"  Even that will be painful : state officials estimate 28% of Minnesotans will be temporarily jobless for the next two weeks , with about 40% of those without any form of paid leave .
Once businesses and schools reopen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep new cases in check .
But he acknowledged there will be more deaths .
" It 's agonizing and I find it nearly unacceptable , " he said .
" My job is to reduce it down .
"  Coronavirus is about ten times deadlier than the flu , killing one of every hundred that get it , according to Anthony Fauci , the top U .
infectious disease expert .
Given Walz 's estimate of 2 .
million Minnesota residents infected , that means 24,000 dead .
So far there have been 503 cases and nine deaths in the state .
FALSE TRADEOFF  For a growing chorus of economists , the notion of weighing deaths against the economy is fundamentally flawed .
" One can do those types of quite gruesome calculations " said MIT economist Emil Verner .
But evidence suggests " that in some sense , that 's a false tradeoff , " he said .
Verner last week co-authored a paper about the response to the 1918 flu epidemic and found that cities that restricted public gatherings sooner and longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stronger economic growth .
" Saving lives and saving the economy are not in conflict right now , " former Fed Chair Janet Yellen and more than 30 other current and former policymakers and economists wrote in a joint statement published earlier this week .
Paul Winfree , director of economic policy studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation , agrees that easing restrictions too early could be damaging .
But , he said , allowing the downturn to deepen into a depression would ultimately negatively impact health .
" The White House is starting to weigh the long and short term health consequences of coronavirus and mitigation .
( and ) they are hearing from the business community that there needs to be some level of certainty , " he said .
The question remains if the American consumer , who is responsible for about two-thirds of U .
GDP , will be confident enough to go to crowded malls and cozy restaurants if the death toll is still rising .
UCLA professor Andy Atkeson says that though lifting lockdowns may seem like an economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot right back up again .
" Americans would lock themselves down , afraid to go out to shop and work given the illness and death around them , " Atkeson wrote .
