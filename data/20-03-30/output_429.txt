Today politicians , public health officials , and economists debate whether to roll back social distancing and other containment measures by Easter in order to open the economy .
Our nation faced similar challenges in 1918 .
The start of the influenza pandemic began in March 1918 , with more than 100 reported cases at Camp Funston in Fort Riley , Kansas .
That pandemic , the worst in modern history , occurred in three waves , infecting a third of the world 's population and killing 50 million people , including 675,000 in the United States alone .
The movement of troops at the end of World War I contributed to the spread of influenza , with the second wave in the fall of 1918 being the most deadly .
The third wave subsided in the summer of 1919 , 15 months later .
The lessons of the 1918 influenza pandemic remain relevant to a COVID-19 response today for three reasons .
First , the costs of an unmitigated pandemic overwhelms .
More people died of the 1918 pandemic in 15 months than from four years of conflict in World War I .
To put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent pandemic today would kill 200 million people , including 2 million in the United States .
ADVERTISEMENT  Second , pandemics may have multiple waves until a sufficient number of individuals become immune , either by surviving infection or through effective vaccination .
How the global community 's current approach to slowing the novel coronavirus pandemic will result in future waves remains to be seen , but the risk is real .
China , for example , has reported their caseload shift from sustained community transmission to ongoing imported cases , requiring continued high-level alertness to detect , contain and prevent a large second wave .
Having initially been considered a model for containment efforts , Hong Kong recently reported an increase in cases , largely the result of imported cases from overseas .
Waves of pandemic disease are typical in many infections .
The seventh pandemic of cholera , for instance , began in 1961 and continues to cause outbreaks today , sometimes with devastating consequences as was the case in Haiti in 2010 and Yemen in 2017-2018 .
Third , a domestic approach to blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more broadly ; not only is this the right thing to do , but subsequent waves can be more deadly than the first , as America experienced in 1918 .
In other infectious diseases , this is often the case .
Studies of the genomic lineage of cholera in Africa , for example , demonstrate that since the infection was introduced to the continent in 1969 , it is not inherently entrenched there , but has been repeatedly re-introduced from Asia .
As a result , public health interventions in Asia are essential to cholera control in Africa and , likely , globally .
It is nearly impossible to contain a pandemic by addressing an outbreak in only one nation .
There are significant structural deficits in global public health that will accelerate transmission of COVID-19 and put the U .
at risk of future waves .
First , like the 1918 influenza , war will continue to facilitate the transmission of today 's pandemic .
The grinding conflicts in Syria , Yemen , Libya , Afghanistan , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo represent potential unmitigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These countries do not have central governments or functional health systems .
There is often damaged health infrastructure , a lack of laboratory capacity , and few skilled health workers serving populations with low literacy rates and pervasive food and water insecurity .
ADVERTISEMENT  Second , social distancing is not feasible for any prolonged period of time in many instances .
As a result of war and insecurity , millions of people are forced to migrate to internal displacement camps or to cross borders as refugees .
Turkey , Lebanon , Jordan , Bangladesh , and Ethiopia for example , all host large refugee populations .
These refugees , living in dense , insecure camps and temporary shelters will find it materially impossible to self-quarantine or socially distance themselves to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 .
The undomiciled and incarcerated face similar challenges to self-quarantine and social distancing .
Approximately 1 .
million Americans will spend some time in a shelter in a given year .
Worse yet , given the economic collapse , there may well be a surge in homelessness in the months ahead .
Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low- and middle-income countries will be unable to cope with the capacity demands of the pandemic because of chronic neglect of surveillance and outbreak response infrastructure , and a major deficit in both the built environment and the health workforce .
While some progress has been made in creating platforms for diagnosing and treating HIV globally , other pandemic diseases like tuberculosis ( TB ) demonstrate the failures of public health delivery , despite longstanding diagnosis and treatment protocols .
This failure has consequences : 1 .
million people die from TB each year -- making it the world 's top infectious killer .
India , China , Indonesia , Philippines , Pakistan , Nigeria , Bangladesh and South Africa account for two thirds of these new tuberculosis cases , illustrating the limitations of existing global health systems .
COVID-19 could devastate many countries in Africa and South Asia , creating massive and unmitigated hotspots across continents and much of humanity .
Given the likelihood of emerging hotspots and the lack of aggressive containment measures , there is a real risk that multiple waves of COVID-19 could extend throughout this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current epicenter of the pandemic with the world 's highest caseload .
The administration must better control the current spread , reduce the risk of subsequent waves , and help lead a global response not only to alleviate the suffering of the world 's most vulnerable but also to protect the homeland .
