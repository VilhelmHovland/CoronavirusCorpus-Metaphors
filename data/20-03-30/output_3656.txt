In other parts of the province communities asked tourists to leave before lockdown began and turned others away , saying that they would not tolerate ' Corona tourism ' .
In a video statement the mayor for the Kouga District Municipality , Horatio Hendricks , confirmed that a man who tested positive for the coronavirus while in Cape St Francis was " from out of town .
" He said due to patient confidentiality he could not give more information .
" I have learnt this morning , with regret , that we 've got our first case of Covid-19 , " he said .
" It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is currently in St Francis Bay , " he said .
" The Department of Health has stepped in and all quarantine protocols are being observed , " he said .
" Our thoughts and prayers are with the patient and the patient 's family , " he said .
Hendricks also thanked the medical responders .
Health spokesperson Siyanda Manana said tracking teams looking for people that the man had been in touch with will work across provincial boundaries to track any contacts .
" We ( will ) follow his path and will let the other provinces know how , where and when he travelled .
The tracer teams will find those who were in contact with him , " Manana said .
" For the next 14 days the man will be kept in quarantine in his home , " he added .
" We do n't want him to be a danger to anyone by travelling .

Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said doctors had isolated the five latest Covid-19 cases in their homes .
" Isolation of people who have mild symptoms of Covid-19 is in line with the coronavirus treatment protocols , " Mabuyane said .
" They are not allowed to go outside their homes during the period of isolation .
" He said three of the five people who tested positive had been travelling internationally while two had travelled locally .
The Eastern Cape provincial government is now tracing people that came into contact with these five to conduct further tests to ensure there was no transmission of the virus .
Last week spokesperson for the Amadiba Crisis Committee ( ACC ) Nonhle Nobuthuma announced that they had " locked down " their area of the Wild Coast and had stopped tourists from entering .
" The goal is to stop the coronavirus from entering the community .
After the meeting , tourists were asked to leave the Mtentu Lodge and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish also were asked to leave .
" People from cities must abandon plans to drive to Wild Coast in Amadiba to escape the lockdown .
' Corona tourism ' will not be allowed , " Nobuthuma said .
" During the lockdown , the Mtentu Lodge will not pay rent to the Amadiba Coastal Community Development Trust .
In return , the tenant will continue to pay full wages to community members working at the lodge .
As ACC , we think this is a blueprint for how it should work during the crisis .
All workers should be paid , " Nobuthuma said .
" When this is over , tourism will start again and we will develop it further .
"  " If the virus spreads in rural areas like Amadiba , it can end in a major catastrophe .
It is the same in townships and informal settlements .
There is no clinic on the Amadiba coast and there are no ambulances to transport the sick .
From many areas , you have one hour to travel to the only clinic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not stopped by Panado , " Nobuthuma said .
