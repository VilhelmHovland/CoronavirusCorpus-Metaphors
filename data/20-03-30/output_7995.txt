more  Photo : Alex Brandon  Grim images dashed Trump 's Easter plan  1 / 1  Back to Gallery  Washington  The two doctors spread out their charts on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office .
The projections were grim : Even if the U .
were to continue to do what it was doing , keeping the economy closed and most Americans in their homes , the coronavirus could leave 100,000 to 200,000 people dead and millions infected .
The totals would be worse if the nation reopened .
Those stark predictions grew more tangible and harrowing when paired with televised images of body bags lined up at a New York City hospital not far from where Trump grew up in Queens .
The confluence of dire warnings and tragic images served to move the president off his hopes for an Easter rebirth for the nation 's economy .
But while Trump sided with the White House doctors over its economists , at least for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beset with divisions and a commander in chief torn between an instinct to embrace the image of a wartime president fighting an invisible enemy and one protecting the nation 's bottom line as he barrels into a bruising re-election fight .
The abrupt change in Trump 's tone was startling : Easter was no longer going to be the sunrise after darkest night .
It could , in fact , be the blackest moment before dawn .
" We 're thinking that around Easter that 's going to be your spike .
That 's going to be the highest point we think , and then it 's going to start coming down from there , " Trump said Monday on " Fox &amp; Friends " .
" The worst that can happen is you do it too early and all of a sudden it comes back .
That makes it more difficult .
"  The bleak forecasts were carried into the Oval Office by Dr .
Anthony Fauci and Dr .
Deborah Birx , who displayed to Trump projections that , on the low end , could yield 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have soared past 2 million had there been no mitigation measures .
" We showed him the data .
He looked at the data .
He got it right away .
It was a pretty clear picture , " Fauci told CNN on Monday .
" Dr .
Debbie Birx and I went into the Oval Office and leaned over the desk and said , ' Here are the data , take a look .
' He just shook his head and said ' I guess we got to do it .
' "  Over the weekend , the death count in New York City skyrocketed , the silence of the city 's empty streets shattered only by ambulance sirens .
Makeshift medical tents were hastily erected in Central Park .
And hospitals , including Elmhurst Medical Center in Queens , not far from Trump 's childhood home , were so overwhelmed that patients were lying in hallways and corpses stowed in refrigerated trucks .
" I 've seen things that I 've never seen before , " Trump said .
For weeks , those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations would cripple the economy -- and Trump 's re-election chances -- had the president 's ear and pushed him toward the idea of restarting business in the states where infections were low .
Trump 's decision to extend national guidelines to clamp down on activity left them disappointed .
