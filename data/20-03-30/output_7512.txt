Giants LB Blake Martinez experienced in remote learning  Recently signed New York Giants inside linebacker Blake Martinez got a taste of learning remotely during his days at Stanford .
It 's going to be put to good use with his new team .
Like many of us , Martinez is staying close to home as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the globe without discrimination .
Normally , the 26-year-old Martinez would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program .
When that will happen now is uncertain .
Since agreeing to and finally signing a three-year , $30 million contract in free agency , the former Green Bay Packer has n't had a chance to do much .
He did help his father put the finishing touches on a gym in the basement of his home in Tucson , Arizona .
It 's where he signed his new contract .
His conference call Monday was his first interaction with the New York metropolitan area media since reaching the deal two weeks ago .
He has spoken to new coach Joe Judge by telephone a couple of times , renewed his friendship with former Packers assistant coach and current Giants defensive coordinator Pat Graham , and talked to inside linebackers coach Kevin Sherrer .
That 's it .
Martinez has n't met with any new teammates .
That was to have happened on April 6 when the offseason training started .
The NFL has not rescheduled a date for that or any other workouts .
The Giants have sent him an iPad with videotapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has no idea when he will get a new playbook .
It normally happens at the start of offseason training , so that makes it even tougher for a player switching teams .
" Kind of in limbo now , " Martinez said .
" Working out and waiting for the next step within the virus protocol of what we are allowed to do , whether it 's meetings with coaches and things like that , and try to soak up as much information .
" Once I get the playbook it will be my starting point of writing enough down to do the things necessary so I know the plays and the checks and everything , " said Martinez , who finished second in the NFL last season with 155 tackles .
The thought of remote learning does n't scare Martinez .
There were times in college , Martinez said , when they used conference calls and on-line lessons for school and football .
He left Stanford in 2015 .
" I have an understanding of how to survive through that , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit in the same room and get to know each other that way .
But it is one of the things you just make the most of it , and it 'll be interesting to work through .
"  Martinez noted the advantages and disadvantages to that type of education .
He felt the biggest deficit is that learning in a group setting builds camaraderie .
It will be hard to do that online .
Smart players will benefit from the learning remotely , he added .
" It will be a big advantage to those guys who can pick up things quickly , take good notes and understand what the coaches are telling them without having to take reps , because overall I think that is the biggest disadvantage of this whole thing , " Martinez said .
" I think OTA reps and the ability to just walk through things as a group helps you out so much .
"  Martinez does n't know many of his current teammates .
He has met defensive back Michael Thomas through Stanford .
He has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will try to get to know players through chatting , video games , zoom calls , whatever , " said Martinez , adding that 's a lot better than having to introduce himself when the NFL gets back to normal .
Looking back on free agency , Martinez said his chances of re-signing with the Packers were roughly 50-50 .
He said it become clear they were far apart on his worth as a player , noting he felt he was a clean-up guy on a defense where others got to make the big plays .
Hence , his high tackle totals .
Martinez had 52 starts in 61 games for the Packers .
He had 512 tackles , 10 sacks , three interceptions and 29 tackles for losses .
" I am able to do what I have to do , " he said .
" I can go cover right ends .
I can go cover running backs .
I can play in zone .
I can do all the things you need to do as an inside linebacker .
