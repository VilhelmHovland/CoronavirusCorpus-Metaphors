A majority of the sports world has stopped during a global pandemic , with one notable exception : college recruiting .
The NCAA has prohibited in-person contact with recruits at least until April 15 .
However , telecommunication and social media have allowed coaches to work remotely and continue offering scholarships -- to football prospects like Eaglecrest 's Kaden Weatherby .
The 6-foot-6 , 265-pound sophomore offensive lineman woke up Sunday morning with the biggest news to date from his recruitment .
Weatherby , with scholarship offers from Colorado State and Kansas in hand , added another from a familiar face in a different place .
It was Michigan State offensive line coach Chris Kapilovic , formerly on the CU Buffs ' staff , who presented Weatherby a spot in the Spartans ' 2022 signing class .
" ( Kapilovic ) said ' We 're going to give you an offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus and talk to the coaches , ' " Weatherby said .
" The hard part is that we have to wait until all of this clears up , and at this point , we do n't know when that 's going to be .
Obviously , the offer from Michigan State was over the phone instead of being in-person .
It 's definitely a big switch that a lot of people are n't used to yet .
"  Weatherby is among thousands of high school football players nationally who quickly canceled visits to college spring games , junior day camps and unofficial visits amid the spread of COVID-19 .
In response , football coaching staffs at CU and Colorado State are working remotely this week , according to their respective sports information departments , while keeping their feet on the recruiting gas pedal .
Since Friday , the Buffaloes have offered scholarships to six defensive backs , according to their recruits ' tweets .
The Rams , while less publicly active , have maintained a strong social media presence including a video tour of Canvas Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise to Matt McChesney , a former CU and NFL offensive lineman who runs the Six Zero strength-and-fitness training facility in Centennial .
The gym , catering to area high school football players seeking college scholarships , was open this week with CDC protocols in place .
( Arapahoe County enacted stay-at-home orders starting Thursday ) .
McChesney has spoken to several college football coaches in the past few days , and three of his Six Zero offensive linemen have received scholarship offers since last week : Holy Family 's Cord Kringlen ( Fresno State ) , Regis Jesuit 's Grayson Stovall ( Michigan State ) and Weatherby ( MSU ) .
Barring in-person recruitment , though , has created an uneasy feeling among college programs .
" Coaches are panicked , because everything in college football is done by structure , " McChesney said .
" It 's been going the same way for years , and this is a huge wrench .
"  The recruiting reality is even worse for non-revenue-generating NCAA spring sports .

Other seniors still fighting for a scholarship now ca n't showcase their skills to college coaches during their final prep season .
" They 're going to have to do more by video , and hopefully they 'll get to play this summer so the in-person recruiting can take place , " Johnson said .
" I have a few of those players who may be in a situation -- if this thing extends into the summer -- where they 're forced to walk on with no scholarship help and try to prove themselves .
"  More in Colorado Buffaloes  New Buffs football coach Karl Dorrell who was hired Feb .
23 to replace Mel Tucker , admitted in a conference call last week that there 's a possibility that spring practice wo n't be undertaken , or resumed , at all -- and that even the regular season could be affected by ever-increasing extensions of social-distancing orders .
