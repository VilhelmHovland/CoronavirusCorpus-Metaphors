Prior to that , extreme weather set polling back a day in the northern provinces .
Brisbane-based adjunct professor for Asia and the Pacific at Griffith , Tess Newton Cain , who is a Vanuatu citizen , has been following the election closely .
She said based on unofficial election results four major parties had emerged with similar numbers of MPs - namely Graon Mo Jastis , Reunification  Movement for Change , Vanua'aku and Leaders ' Party of Vanuatu .
Ms Newton Cain said these four parties had between six and 10 MPs each , depending on who you spoke to , so in keeping with past elections the next government of Vanuatu would be formed by coalition .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grouping come together with a minimum of 27 , " Ms Newton Cain said .
" But obviously to have something that is a bit more stable they would be looking to put together a group of around 30 .
"  Vanuatu media reports indicated lobbying was already well underway and it was likely that by the time the official election results were declared , ( the electoral commission said next week ) , coalition agreements could already be gelling and the wooing of single party MPs and independents could be well advanced .

" Obviously there is a lot of momentum within the society generally and among the officials that are needing to deal with this issue .
There is a  lot of momentum for parliament to sit as soon as possible and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
