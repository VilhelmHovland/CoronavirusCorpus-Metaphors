Panic buying highlights the strengths and weaknesses of Ocado 's model  Let 's be honest , all supermarkets have struggled this past month to meet the demands of their customers .
This is natural , of course , given the surge of panic buying that goes far beyond normal demand ( not to mention good sense ) .
While high street stores simply offered empty shelves to unhappy customers , online retailer Ocado ( LSE : OCDO ) has been forced to place people in long virtual queues .
It even shut down for a few days this month in order to implement a number of new systems to deal with panic buying .
Global stock markets may be reeling from the coronavirus , but you do n't have to face this down market alone .

There is some truth to the criticism .
But in many respects , Ocado is better placed than its competitors to take advantage of the surge in demand for online grocery shopping .
Robotic warehouses  One of Ocado 's best advantages is that its warehouses are automated .
Robots do almost all the work -- from picking the food off the shelves to packing it .
Even the delivery routes are automated .
For the majority of high street stores , this same process relies almost entirely on people .
Online orders involve a human either picking the products in a warehouse or from the shelves in a traditional store .
Bricks and mortar grocery stores were never designed for online shopping , of course , whereas Ocado was .
This is n't to say Ocado is without issues .

This appears to involve queuing systems and slot allocation rather than increased capacity itself .
Overcapacity or inefficiency ?  It may be natural for people to think a company like Ocado should always be able to meet the massive demand we have seen in recent days .
But the recent surge in demand brought about by panic buying is an exception rather than business as usual .
It may even be a once-in-a-generation occurrence .
A company should not be expected to stand ready to meet such crazy demand at all times .
It would be inefficient , a waste of money , and probably lead to the company 's downfall .
I suspect Ocado is actually well placed to take advantage of the coronavirus physical distancing measurers put in place .
It will be natural for more people to shop online rather than go to their local stores .
In the online retail market , Ocado has , for the most part , the best advantages .
