ANALYSIS : RBI Das swings market mood by delivering when it counts  Friday , Mar 27  By T .
Bijoy Idicheriah  MUMBAI -- " We are closely monitoring .
" -- the almost template sounding line at the end of all key communication from the Reserve Bank of India when faced with a crisis , had become a joke in policy and market circles for the last few days .
This was largely on account of the growing impatience with the RBI 's decision to not act on policy rates , even as globally almost every major central bank had done so , to combat the economic fallout of the spread of COVID-19 .
Worse , the central bank 's decision to provide more than adequate liquidity support through long-term repo operations , special repo window or even open market market operations , was quickly shrugged off by the markets that had decided that a repo rate cut was what they wanted .
Today , the RBI after an unscheduled meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee announced a larger-than-expected 75 basis points reduction in the repo rate to 4 .
If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 100-basis-point reduction in Cash Reserve Ratio for a year along with offering targeted 1 trln rupees of long-term repos which would lead banks to invest in corporate paper and help end a freeze in that segment .
RBI also announced a three-month moratorium that allowed for payment deferral on all term loans , along with easing working capital norms for banks , to help stressed borrowers tide over the cash flow hit from the national lockdown .
There was relief on banks liquidity maintenance and even a regulatory reform such as permitting Indian banks to trade in offshore non-derivable rupee derivative market , just to show that the RBI had n't forgotten its regulatory reform role .
What separates the RBI probably from most other central banks is that it has taken what are easily sweeping measures that have a wide ranging impact on financial institutions , borrowers and the economy at large , is that this has been done with little by way of fiscal support to the economy from the government .
To be fair , the government has been holding briefings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can best be described as a ' welfare package ' to tackle the humanitarian fallout of the nationwide lockdown for 21 days .
But , a stimulus package announcement has been relegated to news headlines discussing its possibility , and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman twice repeating that it will come " soon " .
This is where the RBI has stepped in .
As per insiders , the central bank was hoping for a co-ordinated action across the board that would encompass all regulators and the government too , giving ' bang for the buck ' for all measures .
As that is yet to materialise , the central bank has used its full arsenal .
There are many beliefs , such as RBI reluctance to allow forbearance on stressed loans , delaying Basel norm implementation on Indian banks , or strict stance on CRR level and maintenance that have been left debunked , as the situation demanded the central bank take a broader view .
Using CRR cut as a tool , even if for a year , is a sign that RBI is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The MPC also must be commended as despite little visibility on what growth or retail inflation levels would be in the future , the rate setting panel chose to go all in with a large repo rate reduction , with the only quibble being whether the cut should be 50 bps or 75 bps .
Many have questioned the wisdom of central banks cutting policy rates globally , as unlike the global financial crisis which was a financial system problem , the coronavirus issue is mostly a health issue , and demands a more holistic active role from the government and state authorities .
But , despite this , there is space to provide succour to those companies and retail borrowers that have been impacted by the lockdown , who will benefit both from lower rates and the temporary moratorium on repayment .
These borrowers will definitely be thanking Das &amp; Co today , and will be better placed now to recover from the cash flow hit on their lives and livelihoods .
Das will allow himself to crack a smile today , after weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on acting , as even the most strident critics have lauded the central bank 's broad range of measures .
Das had famously started the February policy interaction with the line -- ' .
It is important not to discount the RBI " .
Today , the markets will have learnt that when the RBI says its monitoring , it is only preparing to fire its weapons at the right time and get the best impact for its actions .
