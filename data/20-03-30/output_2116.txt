Sorrento and SmartPharm To Collaborate in Development of Novel Gene-encoded Antibody Vaccine Against COVID-19  In response to the government call for rapidly deployable countermeasures , Sorrento Therapeutics , Inc .
( Nasdaq : SRNE , Sorrento ) and SmartPharm Therapeutics Inc .
( SmartPharm ) today announced a research and development collaboration to develop a next-generation , gene-encoded antibody vaccine for COVID-19 .
The collaboration will utilize monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus discovered and/or generated by Sorrento that will be encoded into a gene for delivery utilizing SmartPharm 's non-viral nanoparticle platform .
" Over the past 10+ years , Sorrento has extensively utilized the G-MAB ? Library , one of the largest and most diverse fully human antibody libraries in the biopharma space , for discovering potent immuno-oncology and anti-infective antibodies against over 100 drug targets .
In the effort to more quickly resolve the global COVID-19 crisis , our company has initiated a rapidly accelerated program for the identification of potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus antigens that may be used for either treatment or prophylaxis , " said Henry Ji , CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics .
" We expect our platform to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful gene delivery platform .
We look forward to our partnership with SmartPharm as part of our goal to make a meaningful impact in this truly global effort .
"  " As a company founded by infectious disease physicians , including myself , we are passionate about applying our novel gene delivery platform to this national and global health crisis , " said Jose Trevejo CEO of SmartPharm Therapeutics .
" Given the disproportionate mortality in elderly and immune-compromised , it is critical that we develop novel technologies that will better protect our populations that are particularly vulnerable to severe coronavirus infection .
"  Unlike classical antigen-based vaccines , which rely on a patient 's immune system to establish efficacy , SmartPharm 's gene-encoded antibody platform is designed to directly neutralize the coronavirus by producing the protective antibody directly in the muscle of the individual .
This gene-encoded monoclonal antibody delivery platform or Gene MAb ? bypasses the in vitro antigen production process and potential for vaccine-induced side-effects in immunized individuals .
This is especially important in susceptible populations like the elderly , where antigen-based vaccines are significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenza or coronavirus .
The companies expect that this novel approach will enable faster progression to clinic , pending agreement with the FDA .
As part of the collaboration , Sorrento and SmartPharm expect to develop a gene-encoded antibody or antibodies that can be administered as a prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection .
Plans for the collaboration may include candidate development as well as filing of an IND application in the next few months .
N4 Pharma has announced that it will be undertaking a proof of concept research project using a COVID-19 DNA plasmid for the purpose of demonstrating the ability of Nuvec ? to be used as a delivery system by potential collaboration partners developing COVID-19 DNA or RNA vaccines .
