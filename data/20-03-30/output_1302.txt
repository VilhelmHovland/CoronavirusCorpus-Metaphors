OPINION : Economic impact of pandemic could see clubs go to the wall  In the greater scheme of things , given the increasing loss of life daily not just on these shores and the mainland , but globally , the postponement or cancellation of sporting fixtures is relatively minor .
Play at rugby clubs across Ireland has been put on hold due to the Coronavirus crisis .

Copyright : Freelance  As the UK and Ireland moved into ' lock in ' mode this week as a result of the Coronavirus Outbreak the reality of the situation was hitting home to most people .
This is a case of survival .
It is a worrying time for everyone and that includes professional sportsmen whatever their discipline .
In the case of rugby players , the heroes of many supporters , they are simply normal human beings and find it hard just like everyone else to deal with this crisis .
Sign up to our daily newsletter  The i newsletter cut through the noise  Thanks for signing up !  Sorry , there seem to be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  They , too , are working from home and in isolation .
They have lost earnings , just like the staff employed by the Irish Rugby Football Union , having agreed to take a deferral in earnings .
Like others currently , there are the fears of even job losses .
Players who were still negotiating their contracts prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 will find themselves in a sticky situation - this is not a great time to be seeking a job either within rugby or even outside it .
And while the IRFU intends to reimburse the deferred payments , giving the constantly changing picture , they may not be in a position to do so .
The suspension of the Six Nations - Ireland have two games to fulfil at home against Italy and away to France - Guinness PRO14 , where there are almost a third of fixtures to be completed , and the European Champions Cup , which had reached the quarter-final stages - has seen rugby shut down - and it is the same in most parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss incurred as a result .
As for those who are out of contract at the end of the current season they will likely have seen offers frozen or even withdrawn , they may have nothing on the table and with the expected cut backs , there could be smaller squads in the PRO14 , Premiership and Top 14 , meaning fewer contracts available .
But it is not just the professional game that is suffering .
The padlocks were already on many of the gates of the 209 clubs across Ireland before the Union announced on March 19 the 2019-20 domestic season had concluded with immediate effect !  It was the right decision but now the clubs are facing their own battles of survival with no regular income - just like other businesses out there , they will hope they can come out on the other side able to continue .
The IRFU this week confirmed they would make half a million Euros ( ? 436,945 ) available to the club game , although no details had yet been confirmed of how the fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 209 clubs , it is just over ? 2000 per club , but there will certainly be criteria applied and those smaller clubs , who perhaps need assistance more , could be left struggling .
Loans in excess of four million Euros have been available to the clubs under the Union 's Financial Assistance Scheme .
A moratorium on all club loan repayments will be put in place for a period of four months , effective from Wednesday ( April 1 ) .
This will benefit the 56 clubs with payments outstanding to a value of over ? 150,000 during this period .
The other advice from the Union is for clubs to draw on any Government assistance available to them .
The Union is to be applauded in attempting to reach out to the grassroots , but it may still not be enough to see some of them through this period and like several businesses , it will not be surprising to perhaps see some clubs go to the wall .
That will not be as a result of not having gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The very businesses who support the clubs in sponsorship have had to close their doors as well as a nation looks to save lives and reduce the spread of the disease and when it is all over , some may not return .
The loss of jobs in those firms is more impactful than being able to support the local sports club , but it is the reality for the clubs who have relied on it .
In England , the RFU announced a funding package of ? 7million to provide support for clubs below the second tier Greene King IPA Championship , including ? 5million in loans - those figures reflective of how serious the situation is .
And while there were 25 per cent wage cuts agreed by many of the top tier clubs in the Premiership , it has been met with some opposition .
Premiership clubs were confident the salary reductions would safeguard them against grave financial problems provided there was a resumption of the league in September .
The Premiership clubs had asked players and staff to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while it can not be enforced it seemed most were willing to do so given the graveness of the situation .
However , it has since emerged that some players who may find themselves out of contract at the end of the season may consider a legal challenge to the proposed cuts , believing it to be a breach of contract .
It may be understandable , but in contrast , Juventus football players and their manager have agreed to waive four months ' wages ( approx ? 80million ) to help the club 's finances during the pandemic - Italy as a nation having been hit particularly hard .
A challenge from some players in the Premiership will be frowned upon given the crisis gripping the nation , and I can say that with authority given I myself will be an unemployed freelance journalist as from today - these are the times we live in and many others are affected in the same way .
The professional clubs in rugby and football are holding out hope that there may be a resumption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the 2019-20 campaigns could effectively be written off and uncompleted .
The domestic clubs ' cricketers may not even get a ball bowled in the 2020 season .
In the bigger picture , given what some families have already suffered , there are more important things to focus on .
Stay at home ( for those who can ) , stay safe , stay well and follow the advice being offered .
