' We 're not isolated ' : How Alabamians found hope , joy during pandemic  After working a 12-hour shift at Huntsville Hospital for Women and Children , Lauren Zito found hope scribbled on the sidewalk Thursday night .
As a registered nurse who assists mommies and their newborns at the hospital , Zito does n't really feel like she is on the frontlines of fighting COVID19 .
But the risk of bringing home the virus to her immunocompromised grandmother wears on her daily .
As a precaution , she strips down in the garage as soon as she gets home and washes off the day in the guest bathroom downstairs before entering the main part of the house .
Anxiety , anger and fear of the unknown ran wild in Zito 's mind Thursday night until she stumbled upon a series of positive colorful , positive messages and pictures that trailed from the hospital 's entrance to the garage where hospital employees park .
If you are arriving , thank you for what you are doing , one message said .
If you are leaving , thank you for what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last .
Tough teams do !  And Zito 's favorite : Your smile is more contagious than COVID19  Goosebumps rose on Zito 's arms as she admired the messages .
She does n't know who did it , but she has a message for them .
" Honestly , for the ten minutes I spent walking and reading , I forgot about all my worries , " Zito said .
" What an amazing thing for someone to do , to take the time out of their day to think of our staff during this difficult and emotional time .
Thank you , from the bottom of my heart , for reminding me to breathe .
"  Zito , like many Alabamians , are trying to find moments of joy and peace during a pandemic .
Some found comfort by helping total strangers .
Others are finding solace by spreading joy to children .
Many of them found happiness after enduring the tug of war between the grief over their pre-coronavirus life and the acceptance of a new normal .
If there 's one community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Alabama 's teachers .
Daphne Elementary School teacher Melissa Spriggs was n't aware that March 12th would be the last time she would see most of her third-grade students in Baldwin County .
On that day , a Thursday , her 23 students had just finished the last chapter in math .
By the following Monday , only 11 students were in her class .
By March 19 , all of Alabama 's public schools were closed to slow the spread of the coronavirus .
Spriggs was hoping to see her kids again when classrooms were supposed to be open on April .
Since Daphne Elementary ends at third grade , Spriggs ' current class will enter into a whole new building next school year .
Kay Ivey ordered all school facilities to remain closed on Thursday and for schools to finish the school year using " alternative methods of instruction " , such as online learning .
Spriggs got choked up as she talked about how she would welcome her kids every school day with a high-five or a hug .
Now those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't ever get to hug them again is insane , " Spriggs said .
Thanks to social media , Spriggs and another Daphne Elementary teacher , Autumn Zellner , found a remedy for their grief .
They decided to organize a teacher parade .
The trend of teachers hopping in their cars and riding around their students ' neighborhood with posters adorned with positive messages has tugged heart strings across the country .
A few have been planned in Alabama .
So Spriggs and Zellner planned one for their school 's neighborhood .
On Monday , March 23 , Daphne Elementary students waved at their teachers during the almost two-hour parade .
To practice social distancing and safety , the students were n't allowed to come near the teacher 's cars and the teachers stayed in their vehicles .
But the students expressed how much they loved and missed their teachers with their signs .
Teachers made their own signs to let the students know that they are loved , missed and that they were going to be OK .
Zellner kids needed to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxieties of COVID19 as they hear the worry in their parents ' voices as they talk about money and the potential of their grandparents getting sick .
Citizens over the age of 65 are more likely to suffer from severe symptoms if they get the virus .
Zellner believes the parade gave the kids peace of mind .
" They have their moms and dads , but they also have us , " Zellner said , " We love them .
They are our babies .
We wanted to let them know that we are still here , and everything is going to be OK .
"  The students and teachers were n't the only ones who benefitted from the parade .
Spriggs said it was a positive influence on her daughter who rode with her during the parade .
" I told her , ' We are doing this so we can make other people smile , ' " Spriggs said .
" So she kept saying ' Where 's another kid ? I want to make them smile .
' It grew my teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put so much love back .
"  Although the kids wo n't be back in a traditional classroom setting again , the parade was proof of something stronger : That they were more than just teachers , parents and students -- that they were a family .
And the family was going to get through this tough time , Zellner said .
" We feel so isolated at times .
We ca n't see our friends and we ca n't see our students , " she said .
" But this was a nice little reminder that our community is amazing .
We have amazing parents .
We have amazing students and it was neat to see how we can all come together - that we are not isolated .
"  Another tightknit " family " is the food service industry .
A statewide ban prohibiting restaurants and bars from allowing customers to dine in has put a chokehold on Camille Henry 's revenue stream at Crestwood Coffee Company in Birmingham .
Her staff of five usually gets about 30-35 hours a week each .
Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of like a community gathering space and a big part of our business is people coming in with their laptops to work , study or sit with family and friends to have a sandwich or a coffee , " Henry said .
" Obviously , we have not been able to do that right now .
So , this has definitely impacted our revenue .
"  Despite the financial woes , Henry has created a relief fund on GoFundMe so she can feed the services workers who have fed the community for so long .
She wants to raise $4,500 , which will provide 300 free meals for Birmingham 's food service workers .
She has raised more than $3,000 since she started the fund on March 17 .
Bartenders , servers and other members of the food service industry can grab a free meal simply by coming to Crestwood coffee and telling the staff they are part of the food service industry .
Henry was n't expecting so much support when she created the GoFundMe , especially since many people outside of the service industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expresses her love for others by making meals for them , and she thanked the donators who are allowing her to do that .
" Despite all the fear and uncertainty in our daily lives now , the overwhelming community response to this call for help has reminded me that there is still so much that is good and kind in the world , " Henry said .
" The people who have come in for meals have given us far more than we 've given them -- solidarity , community , conversation and more thanks and praise than we deserve .
"  " The best things , I think , to come out of all of this is the way that people are coming together to support their communities and their neighbors , " she said .
One of Kathryn Chew 's greatest joys in life is harnessing the time-traveling power of food .
As a pasta and pastry chef at Bottega , a renowned Italian restaurant in Birmingham , Chew crafts dishes that remind people of their grandmother 's kitchen , the comforting meals their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homemade chocolate chip cookies .
But Chew has been separated from that love -- and many others - since COVID19 forced many businesses to close .
Along with her culinary career , Chew is also a bartender and a musician known as Kat Delacruz .
Chew said her life started to feel empty when she was furloughed from all three of her jobs .
But one thing that has buoyed her happiness is starting and managing a Facebook group called Quarantine Cuisine .
The more than 3,000-member group is not only place where people can share their dishes , recipes and the successes -- as well as failures -- of making those meals .
But it 's also a space where people can get " mentored " by experienced cooks and get connected to local farmers during a time when some store shelves are still almost empty of produce and meats .
She started the Facebook group while staring at her pantry filled with random , non-perishable items like canned ravioli and tuna , ramen noodles and crackers .
Chew and her partner called them their " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow chef friends would soon be reaching into their wheelhouses of creativity to feed their families without the luxury of having farm-fresh , first-rate ingredients , " Chew said .
" Then I imagined a world of five-star chefs living off Vienna sausages and hamburger helper and thought it would be fun to start a food group since we would only be able to communicate online .
"  People from all over the world have joined a group whose description is " a page for the everyday Doomsday Chef .
" The group has evolved into space to vent and heal through food .
One minute a member will post about their " sous vide lamb shanks " .
The next minute , it 's about " leftover hotdogs with hash browns .
" The juxtaposition of the posts makes everyone laugh , Chew said .
Conversations between the chef " mentors " transform into peer counseling sessions as members adjust to a life where they must socially distance themselves from their friends .
" They are all finding hope and inspiration from each other and hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting from the group lifts me up so much , " Chew said .
" I get to witness perfect strangers lifting each other up and sharing ideas .
It brings tears to my eyes some days .
"  The sense of community cultivated from Chew 's Facebook proves a theory she has known for a long time : Food -- like love and hope - brings the world together .
" One thing everyone can agree on , no matter their social status , their demographic , or their political views , is that food is wonderful , " She said .
" No political jargon can make you close your eyes and be transported to that trip you took abroad or that favorite childhood memory , but food can .
It is universal .
It is family .
