In 1990 , the Federal government declared March 30 to be " National Doctors ' Day , " enshrining into law a day that had already been unofficially celebrated since 1933 .
Now more than ever , this is a moment worth observing , as physicians across the United States find themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in honor of this work that we 've decided to turn the floor over to them .
Reporters from our health team -- Alex Knapp , Katie Jennings and Leah Rosenbaum -- reached out to 15 doctors , ranging from pediatricians to pulmonologists to primary care physicians , across the country , all of whom have leadership roles in their positions and are dealing with the pandemic in different ways .
These are their stories .
Paris is an emergency medicine physician , who has been treating COVID-19 patients for more than three weeks .
One thing that we 're all blown away by is how fast it spreads to just everybody .
It 's unbelievable .
The numbers on the television are not accurate ; we 're not testing everyone .
I just tell people that it 's everywhere .
We 're seeing situations where people are sort of okay but then fall off a cliff and deteriorate quickly .
It 's not like what we see with the flu or pneumonia -- it 's more rapid and it 's affecting younger and healthier people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it , so I 'm living with a lot of stress now worrying about them , worrying about my patients , worrying about myself .
I 'm not very political and this whole situation has made me very political .
We 're a rich country , why are we rationing ? We spend trillions of dollars on the military to go to war in other countries , but now we 're fighting a war here and not getting that level of support .
It 's only a matter of time before every hospital has no space .
It 's inevitable if the spread continues .
We do n't allow visitors now , and I 'm finding it very sad .
We have a 30-year-old on a ventilator and he 's dying alone .
I want this to end .
How long can we survive as healthcare workers , going in every day , taking care of incredibly sick patients , worrying about running out of resources -- feeling isolated from everyone ? Mentally it 's a very difficult thing to overcome .
It 's anyone 's guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible right now , and it 's going to get worse .
What gets me through the day are the texts , phone calls and meals sent from my friends and family constantly reminding me that they 're rooting for me and love me .
I am grateful to work with a smart and caring team that will continue to show up every day to give patients the best care that we can .
Walton is a clinician at Brigham Women 's Hospital .
He 's also CEO and cofounder of Build Health International , a nonprofit organization helping to build healthcare infrastructure in impoverished communities .
I come at this from a different angle .
I have worked in global health for a long time .
I was in Haiti during the cholera epidemic and in Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic .
This is the first time in dealing with an epidemic that I 've encountered shortages .
We 've always had the appropriate PPE in the places I 've worked .
Here we 're reusing our N95s .
We 're reusing our goggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to compound and get increasingly worse .
I 'm very comfortable " MacGyvering " but I do n't think everyone else is .
I think I put my risk of falling ill within the understandable risk of doing my job .
This is what we signed up for .
I wish I could tell you that I have a positive outlook , but I do n't think that 's realistic .
I 'm bracing myself for things to get much worse , just based on science and what we know about the virus transmission .
I 'm worried about what happens to our healthcare system when it bends to the point of breaking and we can not deal with the patients we are receiving .
If you look at Italy , it 's a real wake-up call to what could happen here .
I think there will be worse outcomes for people who are marginalized .
When I think about the mortality rate -- that 's in places where you have ventilators and you have hospitals -- what happens when this pandemic ravages countries that have such fragile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike anything we 've seen before .
Hosoda is a physician of internal medicine , who works for health system MultiCare and also has her own concierge private practice .
Her hospital is near Seattle and treated some of the first cases in the area .
In 2015 , when the Ebola outbreak happened , I got a letter from the CDC telling me to stock up on personal protective equipment .
The one and only reason I have N95 masks and hazmat suits in my private practice is because of that letter .
This time around the CDC gave us nothing except denials of the science regarding the virus and instructions to wear bandanas to work when masks run out , despite some studies showing a cloth mask is worse than no mask .
It 's just really ridiculous .
The government and healthcare systems knew this was happening in China , and they should have prepared us .
Countries that took it seriously , like Taiwan and Singapore , started testing and quarantining back in January .
Taking something seriously makes all the difference .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindsided by how fast it 's moved and how deadly it 's been .
I think one of the major fears we physicians and nurses have is the lack of personal protective equipment and the fact that healthcare authorities are not considering that the virus can remain airborne for 3 hours after an aerosol procedure , despite a Harvard research letter strongly indicating that that is true .
I think we just did n't realize how many young people would die from it , because the reports from China seemed to say it was mostly older people with a lot of medical problems .
But there are young people in the hospital .
There has been more than one healthy 40-year-old on life support in our area .
One was an ER physician in a town about 30 minutes away , Kirkland , which was the epicenter of the first U .
outbreak .
With all the cases coming into the hospital , it could crash all of it .
It 's something I 've thought a lot about , because it 's coming and it 's only going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the vice president and Chief Population Health Officer at NYC Health + Hospitals , the largest public healthcare system in the United States , and he is a primary care physician at Bellevue .
I grew up in Louisiana and worked on disaster response at the Department of Health there after Hurricane Katrina .
That 's the closest experience I have to this , and there are a couple of lessons I 've taken from it .
The first is that people will step up in truly extraordinary ways in times of crisis .
I am already seeing that among my fellow doctors , nurses and other clinicians taking care of patients with COVID-19 at our hospitals .
But the other lesson , that we ca n't forget about , is that people already living on the margins -- whether because of poverty , illness , discrimination or something else -- are the most likely to be further marginalized , and that 's what I 'm most worried about when it comes to COVID-19 .
Beyond the direct suffering of people who are ill because of COVID-19 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly on poor and working-class New Yorkers , who are suffering from the economic dislocation caused by the disease .
So we 're coordinating with a number of city partners to make sure people have their basic needs met , from food to money to rent .
This disease is as formidable as they come , but so is our team .
Part of my job is to make sure they have what they need to meet this challenge , and their safety and morale is front of mind for us all .
Our system has met similar challenges in the past , whether it was Ebola in New York City or Super Storm Sandy before that .
And you know , for over two centuries doctors at Bellevue have been facing challenges , whether it was yellow fever in the 18th century or cholera in the 19th or HIV/AIDS in the 20th .
So we have our forebears to look to in times like these and to whom we can turn to find the courage to meet those challenges .
Vento directs the infectious disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now coordinating its pandemic response .
Intermountain recently added a coronavirus symptom checker to its telehealth website , which over 80,000 people accessed in the first week .
Intermountain also expanded its nurse-staffed coronavirus advice line to address statewide demand , and averaged 2,800 calls per day during the first week of cases in Utah .
Almost 100% of my time is now spent on COVID-19 activities and duties .
I 'm pretty much up to 16- to 22-hour days at this point .
I 've had experience with other outbreaks , and with the Ebola epidemic in West Africa , and a lot of those lessons learned helped during our initial coordination efforts .
As of this moment , we 're at 602 cases in Utah , and have seen a consistent daily rise in cases since the second week of March .
We 're not currently facing any equipment shortages , but we have had an increase in our lab capacity that led to a temporary shortage of nasal swabs , so we 've adapted to use different supplies to address this challenge .
Intermountain already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more creative about using telehealth in multiple areas to minimize exposure risks to patients , nurses , physicians and other healthcare workers .
We 've quickly trained providers who did n't have telehealth experience to perform outpatient clinic and COVID-19 screening visits , so that patients can still receive care without being unnecessarily exposed outside of their homes .
Because of my prior outbreak experience , the extent of respiratory virus disease spread is n't necessarily shocking to me , but the amount of misinformation and lack of acceptance of sound public health interventions is ( and it 's disheartening ) .
Governing authorities and the public need to heed the message of aggressive social distancing and isolation so that we can prevent more cases in the community and limit the risk of severe illness in vulnerable patients .
Otherwise , the numbers of cases will greatly stress our healthcare systems and workers .
It is essential to minimize risks to these populations so that we can withstand the burden of disease that the virus has shown it is capable of causing .
Black is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital .
Previously , she did disaster response in Haiti after the Haiti earthquake and Hurricane Matthew and in Liberia during the Ebola epidemic .
Since March 11 , I 've been working on expanding our ability to care for patients with possible COVID-19 .
We had a small clinic , the Medical Walk-In , at the start , then about a week after we expanded to a unit in what had previously been the women 's health outpatient clinic .
Then the following week we opened up in a larger off-site sports medicine clinic .
It 's been a continuous evolution of finding larger and more appropriate areas to take care of sick and contagious people .
Our exam rooms have been completely stripped down .
There are no pillows or paper on the tables .
There are no chairs .
There is one stethoscope that stays in the room , because once a patient is seen in there , the entire room , along with equipment , needs to be cleaned .
This is usually done by the physician in the room to lessen the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings , such as Haiti and Liberia , have been low-resource settings .
That 's a very different infrastructure .
I have learned in those settings how to manage a disaster situation , how to keep a team together , and how to move quickly .
There needs to be a very clear chain of command on how to get things done .
My biggest worry is that there are not going to be enough restrictions to make sure that we can stop this virus , and that people wo n't pay serious attention to the need for social distancing and isolation .
But I am choosing to be hopeful .
I think that everyone is taking this seriously now and working hard .
The world has experienced Spanish flu , polio and other infectious illnesses , and I do think that we 'll come out the other side of this .
Kim is a doctor with the California Department of Corrections .
As far as he knows , nobody in his nearly 3,000-person prison has been infected with COVID-19 , but it 's impossible to know for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
At this point at the prison , the first thing we have to do is identify patients who show symptoms of coronavirus .
We have to figure out if they 're critical , severe or mild cases and stratify them .
Our access to tests is limited , so we have to be very selective about whom we give them to .
We 've canceled all the routine care we do .
None of that is happening now .
We 're focused on anything urgent and also anyone showing possible coronavirus symptoms .
To this scale , to this kind of craziness , I 've never seen anything like this before in my life .
I 've never seen Ebola or SARS or anything like that here .
I was n't trained to deal with something like this .
I 'm also very concerned about the shortage of personal protective equipment for our doctors and nurses .
We 're the richest country in the world and we ca n't afford PPE .
It 's a question of when , not if , this disease is coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
I 'm hoping that outside the prison , we can flatten the curve to try to get out of this .
Elnahal is president and CEO of University Hospital in Newark , New Jersey .
The hospital is the level-one trauma center in northern New Jersey and serves as regional coordinator for coronavirus patients requiring complex critical care in the region .
My job is to make sure that the front line is supported as much as possible with resources .
We already have over 50 patients under investigation for infection and 20 confirmed cases , whom we 're treating with some of the drugs we hope will work .
To prepare for the surge in patients , we 're progressively retrofitting spaces throughout the hospital and campus .
For example , the dental school offered up its clinical training space .
Thankfully , I have n't had to isolate myself from my family .
But functionally , because of the hours I 'm working now , I do n't really see them .
We 've been literally past our due date for our third kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough not to be there for my wife .
This area is the global hot spot for this pandemic , and we are going to need healthcare capacity that is way higher than our current capability .
Our coronavirus infection peak is going to be pretty close to New York City 's peak , delayed by a couple of weeks at most .
As a region , we have some things that New York City does n't have that may make this work out better -- namely , the benefit of time to plan across a larger number of hospitals .
So I think if we do this right in collaborating with each other , we will hopefully be able to meet the needs of incoming coronavirus patients .
But my concern is that we will put every bit of effort into creating the capacity we need and it wo n't be enough for the load of patients that we get .
But we have to try our hardest regardless -- every bit of effort could mean another life saved .
Note:Since this interview .
Elnahal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Awdish is director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Program at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit , Michigan .
Her hospital took care of its first COVID-19 patient less than two weeks ago .
Now Wayne County is one of the hardest-hit areas in the country .
We had the really good fortune of being in the middle of the country and seeing what was happening in both New York and Washington State , and having more time to prepare .
So I can say we have n't faced shortages yet , and we 've tried to secure what we think we 'll need going forward .
But we 've had people in every sphere of our work test positive : from environmental service workers to nurses to physicians .
I think all of my colleagues I 've talked to just sort of assume we will get it , but I feel safe in the hospital .
We 're truly learning as we go , from each other .
I participated in a conference call with physicians from Wuhan , China , to learn from their experience .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled this so much better than our country .
They have better personal protection equipment than we have here .
It was really the first time I 've felt behind in medicine .
I 'm worried that the pace of the disease will outpace our ability to care for patients in a way that 's aligned with their needs .
But I 've been amazed at how willing to self-sacrifice people in healthcare are .
Everyone 's walking directly into the fire , and there 's no thought about what that means for their own personal well-being .
Fox is an urgent care physician for Multicare Immediate Clinic in Burien , Washington , which is near Seattle .
This state has been the site of over 3,700 COVID-19 cases , with over 170 deaths .
I realized this was a big thing as soon as it hit the nursing home .
If it was there , it must be in other places and spreading fairly rapidly .
During planning , some kept referring to the disease as an " invisible enemy .
" It 's not invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what precautions to take at the time .
I 've had to pick up extra shifts to pitch in for providers who have gotten sick or gone into quarantine .
I would love to be able to test anyone that comes in who had a fever or symptoms over the past few days , just to see if they are in a recovery phase .
But the labs are being overwhelmed .
Some of these tests are n't even getting to the labs because there are so many of them .
But the limited testing is causing issues .
We 're just telling patients there 's a good chance you have it , so just go home and quarantine .
I think there 's a lot of room for things to get worse , but the best thing the government 's done is to put in the social distancing and shelter-in-place .
But one thing that 's been beautiful to see is the community coming together to help each other .
They 're finding the best of themselves .
It 's good to remember that .
Meislich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care , and part of that hospital 's decision making team with respect to COVID-19 .
Every day I open up my email and I am inundated with information .
I sort through and check in with my colleagues elsewhere in the country to try to pool information , so I can best take care of my patients .
My practice has changed a lot since COVID-19 .
We have an HIV program for kids and young adults , and we 've been calling and texting them regularly , but holding off on having them come in unless there is an urgent need .
I am also still seeing private patients referred by pediatricians in the community as well as hospital follow-up patients .
Recently our hospital did change policies about masks .
I wear one mask all day long , and it 's good for 12 hours so if I leave before then , I put it in a paper bag and when I come back , as long as it 's not soiled or wet , I put it back on .
I work with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same day .
In our office , we 'd be a foot and a half apart when not with our patients or students .
Now we 've started to alternate days .
I 'm 63 years old now .
That worries me a little bit , but it 's not changing what I do .
I 'm just more vigilant about my hand hygiene .
I 'm feeling a little bit more comfortable now and I 'm still plowing through , because that 's what I do .
Pedneault is a psychiatrist at the Woman 's Division of the L .
County Jail .
The jail has been screening inmates before they enter the jail and quarantining those with fevers or have other risk factors .
The courts have also been temporarily closed for a two-week period .
I 'm on the front lines of evaluating people with mental illness who come in , often with conditions such as hepatitis C , cardiovascular disease , HIV or diabetes .
I am treating as well as educating these patients as some of these illnesses would put them at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only medical provider that has frequent contact with them .
The staff in the jail follow social distancing rules , and the officer 's dining area has become a " takeout area " for now .
I think we 've done pretty well compared to what I 've read about Riker 's jail in New York , so I have n't run into any patients who have been directly impacted , which is great because this is the largest jail in the country .
Social media is really sort of hyped up and I think it creates a lot of anxiety .
Just looking at the real-time facts , you know , I think mitigation has been pretty successful .
But I guess the big concern I have is about the unintended consequences of this social distancing continuing .
I would expect to see a lot more anxiety , a lot more depression , and domestic violence and abuse .
We 're not really hearing much of that yet .
Mukherjee is a pulmonologist and medical director of the Intensive Care Unit at Methodist Jennie Edmundson .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and putting a lot in isolation .
We know it 's in the community .
I 've been living separately from my family for a week so far .
It 's been very difficult because they 're scared .
My son called me a few nights ago because he had a bad dream that I got the coronavirus .
Beyond that , I have had to cancel a lot of visits with my patients because of the high risk of exposure and because I 'm so busy right now .
I spend four hours a day in meetings with hospital administration to prepare for the pandemic .
Hospital volumes have picked up significantly and when you add in all the planning and preparing , it 's been long days .
But this is going to be a vacation compared to what I 'm going to be dealing with in two to three weeks here .
I think what was surprising was the reality of the shortages .
We are grossly underprepared for being able to deal with this type of pandemic ; I think that 's very evident around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lung issues .
We 're not trained to deal with a breakdown of the system .
I assume that when I go to intubate a patient , I 'm going to have a ventilator and I 'm going to have the right medications .
Honestly , my biggest worry as this goes on is how I 'm going to deal with the situation where I have to decide who lives and who does n't .
Up until this point in my life I 've always been able to say I 've done everything I could .
I 'm trying to remain positive .
I 'm trying to be prepared .
But I 'm certainly scared , and this is like nothing I 've ever seen before .
Borneo works for the Alameda Health System at Highland Hospital .
She treats patients at all levels of care .
The pandemic has basically created a level of anxiety and fear in our workplace about exposure .
And you really want to advocate for yourself , and for your colleagues and your patients .
We need to find a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
At home , my spouse and I are a two-physician household and we have already separated ourselves and are sleeping in separate rooms .
We come into the house and go straight to the shower , and use alcohol to clean our things -- cellphones , pagers , badges , eyeglasses .
We try not to bring anything into the house .
I am wanting to be optimistic that the social distancing in California was a little bit earlier than in places like New York , and that will help us to maybe mitigate a little bit of that surge .
But the numbers will definitely increase .
There 's no doubt of that .
I have been pleasantly surprised by a lot of the proactiveness in the community to come together and try to be helpful .
Whether it 's a drive to collect PPE for the hospital or some level of reaching out , that 's been really wonderful to see .
Pak is the acting medical director at the Chinatown Public Health Center in San Francisco , which serves a large population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't had any confirmed coronavirus cases yet at the clinic , but that 's probably going to change very soon .
We 're definitely preparing for the surge .
We have set up our clinic with isolation rooms and everything to get ready for folks who come in with respiratory symptoms .
Because of the mayor 's order to stay at home , we have converted a lot of in-person visits to telephone visits .
It 's been kind of fascinating how we 're the richest country in the world , but at the same time , we have such limited testing capability .
And I think that 's the reason why we have n't been able to truly know how many folks in the country have been infected .
Here in San Francisco , we 've been working with private partners to expand even more testing sites for the public while looking for ways to internally boost our own public health lab testing capabilities .
The other important thing has been education for patients .
The entire Department for Public Health has been working pretty hard to decrease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communication with the Chinese community , where there has been a lot of misinformation on social media , and part of my job is , of course , to tell people to wash their hands and maintain social distancing .
So I 've done a lot of work with my colleagues to ensure that correct information is being disseminated in different languages .
What I worry about is not being able to protect the people we want to protect because of the lack of equipment , or just not being able to communicate lifesaving information .
