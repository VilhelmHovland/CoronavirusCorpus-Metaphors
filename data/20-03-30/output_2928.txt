Nova Scotians with cool film jobs part four : Likely 's art of creating a believeable world on film  EDITOR 'S NOTE:This series of profiles of some of the creative Nova Scotians working behind-the-scenes in the film and TV industry at home and abroad was begun before the COVID-19 outbreak .
We are running it now to highlight the talents of those who will be working to help get the cameras rolling again once things are under control , either with years of experience under their belts , or just getting started in the world of media production .
When Halifax-based film and television art director Matt Likely first heard that director Robert Eggers was considering making his gothic cinematic nightmare The Lighthouse in Nova Scotia , he thought it was too good to be true .
Likely had seen Eggers ' previous feature The Witch , and loved the care taken to make its 17th century New England setting come alive .
He was also aware that its production designer  Craig Lathrop was an old friend who 'd hired him on three previous projects , including the 2007 thriller Stuck , shot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror maestro Stuart Gordon .
Then came Lathrop 's phone call in November of 2017 .
" He told me a little bit about the project and that they 'd be scouting some locations in Nova Scotia , " recalls Likely .
" He had all kinds of questions for me , he had never done a show here , so he was asking about local crews and whether there 'd be enough people to do a project of this size .
"  Lathrop told Likely they were planning to build a 70-foot lighthouse , and were looking for the perfect rugged coastline to place it on .
Even with his enthusiastic sales pitch for Nova Scotia film crews , Likely thought it was still a longshot that The Lighthouse would come here , but that soon changed .
" Then Craig and Robert Eggers and some of the producers came in December , and toured some of the locations with Nova Scotia location manager Shaun Clarke , " he says .
" He took them to Yarmouth and they looked at Cape Forchu , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vista , all of it .
"  In January , Lathrop returned and he and Likely were working on a budget , " trying to figure out a way to build this damned lighthouse .
" It was a combination of all kinds of different elements to build it , but Craig had a good idea in mind when he came to town , he 'd been thinking about it for a long time , but he brought me in as the art director and I brought in more of the local crew like Kevin Lewis as the key scenic artist .
"  Working on an Academy Award-nominated feature film is exactly the kind of thing Likely dreamed of doing when he had his first major assignment ; as a graphic artist on the locally-shot remake of the 1970s figure skating romance Ice Castles in 2001 .
He jokes that he did n't even know how the film industry worked when he first got hired , working his way up from designing signs and building props to designing sets , " coming up honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
His role is to help to match filmmakers ' visions for their projects in the sets and other constructions required , usually on a budget and working with locations that often need to be altered or dressed accordingly .
Likely says the most fun thing is to design and build sets , either in a studio or on location , starting from scratch to provide a unique background for a given scene , with a distinctive visual look .
" You 've got more freedom , " he says of that approach .
" There are always budgetary concerns , but at least you 're custom-making something for the script and making all the choices from the ground up .
" You 're choosing the trim for the door , or the type of wallpaper , the colour of the walls or the ceiling height .
All of those choices dictate the kind of space you 're going to have .

Putting together a 70-foot lighthouse for the Academy-Award nominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Contributed  Following The Lighthouse , upcoming Halifax-shot projects bearing Likely 's stamp include the cryogenic lab he built for Seth Smith 's horror/sci-fi hybrid Tin Can and the post-apocalyptic streetscapes he sketched out for the miniseries based on Clive Barker 's Books of Blood .
" I 've been lucky , " he says .
" We had problems with the tax credit situation in 2015 , and a few of my friends have moved away to work in Toronto and Vancouver .
I had just bought a house here in Dartmouth and I wanted to make a go of it here .
" I had been working my way up through the art department , getting to design and art direct some smaller projects , and then I had the great fortune to do production design for Weirdos , for ( director ) Bruce McDonald , and I was almost pinching myself at the time .
"  There was a lot about the Cape Breton-shot Weirdos that attracted Likely , from the fact it would be shot in black and white to the 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be assigned to a project even more unhinged , the CBC-TV comedy series Cavendish , about supernatural happenings in a small Prince Edward Island town , dreamed up by former members of the Picnicface troupe .
" I felt like once ( co-creators Andy Bush and Mark Little ) saw what we could do , they were upping the ante each time , " he says of the series that presented a different challenge with each episode .
" Whether it was creating a wax statue of Fred Penner or an edition of the Necronomicon : The Book of the Dead .
It was just one thing after another , and I feel so lucky to be able to work with such talented people .
"  On and off the set , Likely works hand-in-hand with construction coordinators , scenic artists , set builders and props masters .
" The craftspeople I 've worked with here are incredible , " says the art director who was amazed at how quickly things moved for The Lighthouse once it was a go , and Willem Dafoe and Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combative " wickies .
"  " But I was most excited by the thought of what we were going to build , it was all beyond what I had ever managed as far as being an art director goes , " he says .
" It just came together so well .
We did it , we had paint drying just before the camera started rolling , it was unbelievable .
"  With Tin Can and Books of Blood about to see the light of day , and the Stephen King-inspired mini-series Jerusalem 's Lot waiting to begin production once things return to normal , Likely calls The Lighthouse a game-changer that should continue to build momentum for the film industry .
" We needed a win , basically , " he says .
" Even without the Oscar nomination for cinematography , the popularity and the reception of the movie in terms of the reviews and so on were huge for us .
We 're always wanting to prove ourselves here , and maybe there is n't as strong an opinion about the industry here as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vancouver or the States .
" But for a film like that to come here , which required all these skills and trades to not only deliver what was required but to have it be praised so highly after the fact .
That sort of thing is huge , and certainly builds confidence for anyone who wants to come and film here .
