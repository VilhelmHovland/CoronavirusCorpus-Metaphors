Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something similar to the larger natural catastrophe claims we have had througn the past few years .
"  Lloyd 's largest net loss last year was Typhoon Hagibis , which cost ? 500 million .
The industry has come under fire for its response to the crisis after suggestions most claims will not pay out due the wording on many business interruption policies , which mostly do not cover pandemics .

Bruce Carnegie-Brown said Lloyd 's had identified at least 14 different types of policy which may be triggered by corona claims including event cancellation , travel claims and workers compensation .
He said : " We think there will be a large number of claims which come through .
" The controversy over business interruption is specific to the fact that these covers are available but most people do n't buy them .
" We see customers who experienced claims on things like Sars and Ebola buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine it was a risk to the business .
" It was not seen as a risk so it 's not surprising a number of people find themselves uncovered for a risk that now seems pretty serious .
"  The corporation swung back into profit last year after two consecutive periods in the red .
