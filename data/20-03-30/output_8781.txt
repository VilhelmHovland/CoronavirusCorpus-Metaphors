Fun FREE lockdown challenge game #WeGotThisNZ for kiwi kids to play on GooseChase app  Fun FREE lockdown challenge game #WeGotThisNZ for kiwi kids to play on GooseChase app  By : Auckland parent contributor : Jacquelyn Collins  Published : 30 March 2020  When Hattie and Joe , my seven year olds heard the news that the April school holidays were starting a couple of weeks ahead of schedule because of Covid-19 they were absolutely delighted !  As a parent juggling a four-day-a-week job as an Activation Advisor at Auckland Council and working on my Master 's thesis , I was slightly less excited .
We have been in our " bubble " since Tuesday morning .
So far , it 's not going too badly , as Shouty Mummy has n't yet made an appearance !  One reason for this is that the kids have been occupied and enjoyed playing with the FREE cool virtual scavenger hunt #WeGotThisNZ Lockdown Challenge that our team developed at work ( along with input from my children ) which you can play the game on the GooseChase app .
Kids ( and parents ) can complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home or while you are out on your daily walk .
The #WeGotThisNZ Lockdown Challenge provides Kiwi kids with something to keep them happy and occupied when they ca n't go anywhere .
Jacquelyn Collins and her children Hattie and Joe balancing  Hattie and Joe are at the perfect age for something like this because they can tackle a lot of things independently and can follow instructions well .
It 's been a godsend in our house ! Every few hours , when tempers are fraying and the kids are getting scratchy , we pull out my phone and find something fun to do .
The missions are n't a source of stress , so there 's very little fiddly craft stuff to do , and a lot of easy things like " do a cartwheel " or " play a board game " challenges .
When there is something that involves parental involvement , like " bake a yummy treat " , it also says that this is only an option if parents in the house have the time and energy ! There are also a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like ' wash the family car ' and ' do the washing-up ' too .
Missions  Paint some rocks mission  Daily walks were becoming a little boring as we kept covering the same old ground , but the missions have helped to keep things fresh by encouraging us to leave chalk notes for nearby friends , or to look out for friendly cats , or public art .
We 've also been able to include other activities , like the adorable Bear Hunt .
Hattie is very sporty and has latched onto anything that involves moving a lot , so she likes the ' jump on the trampoline ' type missions , whereas Joe loves playing games and building things , so he 's keen on missions that ask for board game challenges , or obstacle courses .
The beauty of the #WeGotThisNZ Lockdown Challenge is that there is a huge variety of missions so there is something for everyone .
Game on : Colins family playing Connect Four game  It 's really easy to join the FREE #WeGotThisNZ Lockdown Challenge just:1 .

After joining you will you will be taken straight to the mission let and can start playing !  New missions are added every day , and it 's been brilliant to see more and more families join in .
It is open for everybody in New Zealand to play and people from all around New Zealand are playing .
Rankings  This is such a stressful and uncertain time , but playing the game with Hattie , Joe , and my husband Tristan has really helped us to find some fun in every day .
I believe that young people are far more likely to be active if we make things like a game .
It 's certainly what I 've found with Hattie and Joe , anyway -- they 're do just about anything if we ask them in silly voices , or promise to time them .
Play is so important for kids , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make other families happy ! .
