Hogan issues stay-at-home order for Maryland to stop spread of the coronavirus  Due to the coronavirus , Governor Larry Hogan has enacted a Maryland stay-at-home order .
Marylanders may only leave their homes for essential work or urgent medical care , to get food or prescriptions or for other " absolutely necessary " reasons , Gov .
Larry Hogan said Monday under a new " stay-at-home " directive to stop the spread of the coronavirus .
" This is the deadly public health crisis , " the Republican governor said .
" We are no longer asking or suggesting that Marylanders stay home .
We are directing them to do so .
"  The governor said he was also worried about the possibility the disease could spread to " literally thousands " of facilities in Maryland , including hospitals , detention centers and nursing homes .

No additional businesses are required to close and residents do n't have to stay in their homes at all times .
" People have to go out and get food .
They need to get prescriptions , " Hogan said .
" You should be able to get outside for your own physical and mental well-being and go for a walk and take your dog for a walk .
"  But with the new order and with blunt language , Hogan sought to get the attention of residents who did n't take earlier directives seriously .
" Marylanders need to know that , unfortunately , we are only at the beginning of this crisis and it is going to get considerably worse before it gets better , " Hogan said .
" I realize this is incredibly difficult on everyone in our state , but I want people to know that we have been through difficult challenges before and that we are going to get through this together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maryland from other states should self-quarantine for 14 days , and he discouraged residents from traveling out-of-state .
" This is a rapidly escalating emergency situation , " the governor said .
Congregating in parks or shopping for home goods is not OK , he emphasized , urging people to exercise " common sense .
"  Monday afternoon , after the announcement , lines formed at liquor stores and some Marylanders posted on social media about the need to make alcohol purchases before 8 p .

Supermarkets and pharmacies can remain open as long as social distancing measures , such as keeping customers 6 feet apart , are respected .
People seeking guidance on the order Monday flooded the Twitter feed of the governor 's spokesman , Mike Ricci .
Nearly 50 people tweeted about being able to get fresh air , walk a dog or get a car repaired .
Ricci replied that those were all acceptable , as long as people continued to practice social distancing .
The situation could continue for months , said Fran Phillips , Maryland 's deputy health secretary .
" We have no vaccine to protect us against this virus , " she said .
" We have no treatments to cure this disease .

" This virus and this disease are sneaky , " Phillips said , adding , " What you do today , what you do tomorrow , matters .
There are some very sick people here in Maryland .
"  To increase the ability for people to be tested , the state opened drive-thru sites at Motor Vehicle Administration emissions stations in Glen Burnie , Waldorf and Bel Air , Hogan said .
Another opened at FedEx Field in Landover .

Mayor Bernard C .
" Jack " Young said he backs Hogan 's decision to put more restrictions in place to protect the public and he urged city residents to follow the governor 's orders .
The stay-at-home directive will not impact essential services , Young said , and trash and recycling will still be picked up .

, a Democrat , said Hogan 's decision to issue the stay-at-home order " was the right one .
"  Howard County Executive Calvin Ball , also a Democrat , cautioned county residents : " There is no excuse for taking this directive lightly .
In order to slow the spread , it is vital that we stay home and reduce contact with one another .
"  Many other measures are underway to respond to the crisis throughout Maryland .
To prepare for a surge in patients , the governor said the state has ordered 500 beds for hospitals to add more capacity on their campuses .
A request for another 500 has been made so they can distributed as hot spots arise .
Hogan said the state also has ordered more medical tents .
The governor called doctors and nurses " true heroes .
" To help protect them amid the supply shortage , the state 's school systems have donated various items , such as gloves , masks and gowns .
" We are all going to need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to take care of each other .
We are all in this together , " Hogan said .
An outbreak in the region is especially alarming because more than 404,000 federal workers live in Maryland , Washington and Virginia and are on the front lines of the government 's response .
Among the federal agencies based in Maryland are the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration .
" A major outbreak among our critical federal work workforce could be catastrophic , crippling the national response , " Hogan said .
He has joined Northam and Bowser in asking Republican President Donald Trump to make the region a priority for federal support .
Currently , the region has 2,709 confirmed COVID-19 cases .
