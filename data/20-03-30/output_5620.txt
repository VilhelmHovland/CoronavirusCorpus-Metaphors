( Photo Credit : File Photo )  New Delhi :  Supreme Court on Monday observed that the migration of labourers out of panic and fear is becoming a bigger problem than the coronavirus .
Hearing petitions seeking relief for thousands of migrant workers , the top court said it would not create more confusion by issuing directions on measures that the government is already taking to deal with the issue .
Supreme Court , however , sought a status report from the Centre by Tuesday on the measures taken in view of the large-scale migration of labourers to their native villages .
Many migrant workers are leaving big cities en masse as they lack resources to sustain during the 21-day coronavirus lockdown issued to contain coronavirus outbreak .
A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justice L Nageswara Rao took up two separate PILs filed by advocates Alakh Alok Srivastava and Rashmi Bansal on the issue of migration of labourers through video-conferencing .
" We do n't want to deal with the things government is already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your petition had prayers , some of which have already been taken care of by the government .
"  Solicitor General Tushar Mehta , appearing for the Centre , said the migration of labourers needs to be stopped to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and the Centre as well as the states concerned have taken the requisite steps to deal with it .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the 21-day lockdown on March 24 .
Since then , there has been an exodus of migrant workers from big cities to their villages due to the lockdown .
These migrant workers , who worked as daily wagers in big cities , have started journeying towards their native villages .
Many of these workers have been walking to their destination as there is no public transport .
Centre has asked all state governments to seal the borders to stop the movement of migrants in an attempt to stop community transmission of coronavirus .
State governments have been asked to provide food and shelter to these migrants at wherever they are .
