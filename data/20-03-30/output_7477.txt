Why is Trump obsessively trying to humiliate this PBS reporter ? It 's not working  Published  3 hours ago  on  March 30 , 2020  By  - Commentary  On Monday , he lashed out at her for pointing out that the United States ' coronavirus testing regime is lagging behind that of other nations , such as South Korea , on a per capita basis .
He immediately became defensive , saying that the United States is much less dense than South Korea .
He pushed her to see if she knew the size of the population of Seoul , the country 's capital .
He falsely claimed that its population was 38 million , when in fact , it 's under 10 million .
( Some pointed out that he might have gotten this fact wrong because Wikipedia lists the city 's elevation as " 38 m .
" )  ADVERTISEMENT  He then attacked her for asking the question at all : " You should be saying congratulations instead of asking a really snarky question , because I know exactly what you mean by that .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humiliate Alcindor before a national audience .
Just the day before , Trump lashed out at her when she confronted him with the fact that he had said states were asking for equipment to fight Covid-19 that he did n't think they needed .
Trump said he did n't make this claim , even though she provided a direct quote from his recent interview with Fox News ' Sean Hannity .
" Be nice , " Trump told her .
" Do n't be threatening .
"  She had n't been threatening at all .
A few weeks ago , she asked him about criticism he has faced for disbanding the National Security Council 's pandemic office .
" I just think it 's a nasty question , " he sneered .
He falsely claimed that he did n't do it .

@Yamiche : You said you do n't yet responsibility for any failures , &amp; yet you disbanded the pandemic response team .
What do you say to criticism of that ?  TRUMP : " I just think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have a group of people .
I do n't know anything about it .
" **26;289;TOOLONG  But few reporters seem to stir Trump 's ire as frequently as Alcindor .
It 's notable because , while she does ask tough , fact-based questions , she is extremely polite as soft-spoken .
She never gets angry or raises her voice back in response , even as she handles Trump 's verbal abuse .
In a tweet , she suggested her treatment by the president may be a function of her race , gender , and role as a reporter :  ADVERTISEMENT  President Trump today at the White House said to me : " Be nice .
Do n't be threatening .
"  I 'm not the first human being , woman , black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job .
Speaking with Pod Save America 's Jon Lovett about the treatment , she explained : " The reason why I became a journalist is because Emmett Till , this 14-year-old boy in Mississippi , was killed .
And it sparked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart a civil rights journalist .
And I 'm at my heart someone who is constantly thinking : We do n't have time for foolishness .
We do n't have time for sideshows .
The reason why I 'm a reporter is because I really believe vulnerable people in this country do n't have a voice .
And I think about them every day as I craft my question .

The aggressive actions of local governments in the San Francisco Bay Area may have successfully bent the coronavirus curve .
" State leaders and doctors are cautiously optimistic that the Bay Area 's early moves to lock down residents two weeks ago have prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region 's health care capacity thus far , " Politico reported Monday .
" Six Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics with an enforceable March 16 order requiring residents to stay at home , " Politico noted .
" After 14 days -- the outermost period at which symptoms are believed to emerge post-infection -- doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected to see at this point , and officials credit the lockdown with stemming the tide of patients they feared would flood into emergency rooms .

He said Google was helping .
