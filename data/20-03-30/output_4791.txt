Opinion  We 'll all have a recession , but your postcode will make a big difference  By Matt Wade  Official confirmation wo n't come for months but the queues outside Centrelink offices tell the story : we 're in for a shattering economic downturn .
For Australia it will be the first recession since the early 1990s .
But three decades of continuous growth has transformed the national economy since then .
Illustration : Simon LetchCredit :  One important change that gets little attention is how the regional economic picture has become more complex .
Powerful forces including the rise of knowledge-intensive service industries , the mining construction boom ( and bust ) , the changing nature of manufacturing and the growing importance of health and aged services have affected cities and regions differently .
Advertisement  Our regional economies are now much more diverse .
And that means greater disparity in the way regions experience the coronavirus-induced downturn and recovery .
The national economy was more homogenous back in the 1980s .
Examining economic statistics at the national level would have been a fairly good indicator of conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more uniform performance was the big contribution made by manufacturing in both cities and regions .
In 1990 manufacturing accounted for more than 15 per cent of Australia 's economic output but that 's now fallen to about 6 per cent .
Loading  The town of Wangaratta , about 250 kilometres north of Melbourne , illustrates how important manufacturing was for many regional centres .
Despite its relatively small population ( now about 30,000 ) Wangaratta was a major producer of IBM personal computers during the 1980s and 1990s .
It exported computer equipment worth $200 million in 1993 .
But like factories in many regional towns , the Wangaratta IBM plant has disappeared .
Economist Terry Rawnsley , who researches the performance of Australia 's regional economies , says three decades of " economic evolution " has created far more fragmentation .
Big cities have become hubs for high-value , knowledge-intensive services such as finance , professional services , IT , communications , education and research .

But overall , growth in regional Australia has lagged that in the capital cities for more than a decade .
One telling illustration of this more fragmented landscape is the economic gulf which has opened between Australia 's two biggest cities and the rest of their respective states .
Sydney 's economic output per person was a record $31,300 more than in the rest of NSW last financial year .
Melbourne 's output per person was $22,000 more than the rest of Victoria -- also a record and double the difference in 1990 .
Like many big globally connected cities , Sydney and Melbourne have performed strongly in recent years amid robust population growth .

Author and urban theorist Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small group of elite districts forge ahead , while most others struggle or fall behind .
Rawnsley says the way Australia 's various regions now perform from year to year is quite varied and " that means they are exposed to different one-off shocks and different long-term trends .
"  The coronavirus pandemic is one of those shocks .
Major industries in Melbourne and Sydney have been among the earliest casualties , including international education , international tourism , aviation , events management and arts and recreation services .
" In the short-term it is Sydney , Melbourne and to some extent Brisbane that will feel this first because they are more globally connected and the structure of their service sectors will be affected , " says Rawnsley .
That might reduce the economic gap between the big cities and their hinterlands , at least temporarily .
Elements of the federal government 's economic stimulus measures may also favour regional areas , particularly special payments to those on welfare .

" There are a lot of cheques going to pensioners and Newstart recipients and they are over-represented in regional areas , " says Rawnsley .
But the scale of the disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak means the economic damage will eventually become very widespread .
Loading  While cities were hard hit at first , they are likely to recover more quickly than smaller regional towns .
Big urban populations can be expected to quickly fire up demand once the coronavirus emergency passes , especially near major employment hubs .
Rawnsley warns : " Firms that close down in less populated regional towns will take longer to spring back .
"  Australia 's more complex regional picture will make crafting nationwide policies to assist with recovery following the downturn more difficult .
The economic gap between city and country is already one Australia 's most disruptive political fault lines .
