SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY  Thanks for signing up !  Aussie model Lara Worthington has slammed the government after her mum was put up in a boutique hotel to quarantine .
Worthington is not in self-isolation herself , but her mum Sharon Bingle has just returned to Australia and must follow the government 's new 14-day quarantine measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus .
The two were n't happy with the accommodation , which taxpayers are footing the bill for as a public health precaution .
The accommodation in question is The Urban Newtown , a self-described boutique hotel in Sydney 's trendy Inner West .
It appears Worthington or her mother must 've mistaken the hotel 's exposed ceiling and rustic decor for some kind of architectural defect .
" Our boutique studio rooms , combined with our industrial design will ensure that your stay will differ from the rest , " the hotel 's website reads .
On Booking .
, reviewers have most widely praised the hotel 's " comfy beds , " , " friendly staff " and " boutique style " .
On TripAdvisor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good " .
Worthington later clarified to News .
that she 's more concerned about the health of her 63-year-old mum .
" We understand everyone is in this together and has their own issues in these increasingly concerning times , " she said .
As of Sunday , all Aussies returning from overseas have been put up in a variety of hotels .
In Sydney , these include the 5-star InterContinental and Hilton hotels , as well as the budget Ibis .
In Melbourne , new arrivals are staying in Crown hotels .
Many replied to Worthington 's tweet negatively , pointing out that there are Aussies are in much tougher situations during the coronavirus pandemic .
Seriously ? ? So maybe she should have come home earlier .
I have no sympathy -- there was no guarantee of 5 star accommodation .
You take what you get and just because she 's your mom does n't mean she is entitled to 5 star service .
Call the hotline to flag her symptoms and follow their instructions .
I am begging you not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse off who have a lot less than you do .
You will manage .
This " Grunge " style accommodation is all the go these days , you should know that Lara ( whoever you are ) I just stayed in a similar one in Phuket City .
As a photographer I can also see your little attempted trick at making the room look dark and dingy .
Fail , sorry .
Umm this looks very much like The Urban in Newtown and this is the vibe of the hotel .
Its industrial and has exposed beams etc as part of its decor .
Stop trying to make it look worse to sell a story https : //t .
Could always be worse , she could be on Christmas Island or Nauru quarantining ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? and maybe spare a thought for the 16 or 17 people that do n't get today or anymore tomorrow 's because of this virus .
