Local historian sees parallels between current COVID-19 situation and past pandemics  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues , some may be reminded of health crises and pandemics from the past .
Alyssa Currie , Executive Director of the South Peace Regional Archives , says a lot parallels can be drawn from the current situation to the Spanish Flu epidemic that struck Alberta and the Peace Region in 1918 .
" One of the first things that was implemented in Grande Prairie was a cancelling of all public gatherings , so you see that today in the social distancing measures that are being similarly implemented .
They also implemented mandatory face masks for those that did have to go out in public .
"  Currie says the Spanish Flu was mostly brought over by settlers and returning soldiers from World War I .
According to the archives , by the fall of 1918 when the Flu came to the Peace Region via the railway , around 1,000 cases were already reported in Edmonton .
She says during that time , many community members and organizations volunteered their help and created temporary solutions .
" The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was turned into a makeshift hospital , "  During this time , the local undertaker , J .
Oliver , was serving overseas , and the man in his place had fallen ill .
" Our community actually wrote to the Canadian Military requesting that J .
Oliver be returned to us to take care of our community , and unfortunately that was denied , " said Currie .
" So local hotel owner and race car driver , Frank Donald , stepped in and acted as the undertaker for our community .
"  Currie says during Donald 's time as the temporary undertaker , the Bear Creek Cemetery was established .

" You see reported throughout the newspaper both a number of obituaries and unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also see letters of thanks from the families for the people that were taking care of those community members , and for all of the community members that really stepped up and did their part in the time of need for the community .
"  Currie says that the coverage of the Flu mirrors the current novel coronavirus outbreak occurring now .
