Warning comes as experts say it could be up to six months before life returns to ' normal '  Michael Gove has warned the British public to prepare for a " significant period " of lockdown , in a signal that the government could extend restrictions beyond the three weeks initially announced by Boris Johnson .
Speaking on the BBC 's The Andrew Marr Show , Gove said : " I ca n't make an accurate prediction but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place .
"  The warning came as England 's deputy chief medical officer , Jenny Harries , said that it could be six months before life in the UK returns to " normal " .
Appearing at the daily coronavirus briefing , Harries said the government would review the lockdown measures for the first time in three weeks .
Harries said : " We must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living .
That would be quite dangerous .
If we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next six months , we will have a three-week review .
We will see where we are going .
We need to keep that lid on - and then gradually we will be able to hopefully adjust some of the social distancing measures and gradually get us all back to normal .
"  The government 's leading epidemiology adviser sounded a similarly cautious note , warning that the entire population may need to stay at home for up to three months .
Neil Ferguson said that even when the lockdown is lifted , there would probably still be months of social distancing , adding : " We 're going to have to keep these measures in place , in my view , for a significant period of time - probably until the end of May , maybe even early June .
May is optimistic .
"  The warnings came as Boris Johnson sends a letter to every British household , warning that " things will get worse before they get better " and that he will " not hesitate to go further " if necessary .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two criteria would have to be met before the prime minister would lift the lockdown ; the number of new cases must be stable or falling , while the critical care capacity of NHS hospitals must not be exceeded .
The latest UK figures offer a " glimmer of hope , " reports the Mail on Sunday , as infection rates dropped for the second day in a row .
However , with the death toll rising by 209 to 1,228 and infections up by 2,483 to 19,522 , the immediate picture remains grim .
