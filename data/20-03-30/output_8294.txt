What can I do to find legit ways to make some money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the coronavirus pandemic hit the world 's economies , and you can expect that the bad guys will ramp up their scamming efforts .
There are a lot of legitimate online resources that could allow you to generate a little income regardless of your skill set , but the more specialized your skills are , the more lucrative the options may be .
Signs of a scam  Let 's start with some basic red flags that should make it easy for anyone to sniff out scams .
Anything that sounds too good to be true , especially when they make it sound like you do n't have to do much to make a lot of money , is an obvious red flag .
Legitimate work-from-home options will be very specific , as they tend to be task-based , so anything you see that has a very general or hard to understand job description , especially if there is no vetting process , should be another red flag .

Remember , the bad guys are preying on those who are in need of work and will create amazing-sounding opportunities that are designed to get you excited so you 'll drop your guard .
High-pressure tactics are another sign of a scam .
Any time an " opportunity " requires an up-front fee , special equipment that you must purchase from them first or direct access to your checking account ( pretending to be direct deposit ) is a huge red flag .
A simple Google search for any company should provide you with feedback from others as well as clear ways to contact them .
If you ca n't find either , I suggest you take a pass .

Crowdsourcing platforms  Crowdsourcing opportunities are different from a typical job because you 're generally competing with many others to get paid for a specific task , such as creating a logo or solving a technical problem .
The creator of the task generally places a reward for the task and invites as many people as possible to submit their work to be considered .
The downside to this kind of work is that you can often do the work and not get paid if you are n't chosen as the " winner .
"  It 's better suited for creative types who can generate a lot of work in a short period of time , which increases your chances of making money .
