The coronavirus pandemic has really gripped the world , bringing nearly everything unrelated to health , food , water , basic utilities , and primary government services to a standstill .
That means all kinds of motoring events are either postponed indefinitely or canceled outright , especially motor shows .
One such event was one of the world 's Big 5 : the Geneva Motor Show which was slated to happen earlier this month .
Now , another one of the Big 5 has been canceled .
Organizers have said that they have decided to cancel the June 2020 staging of the Detroit Auto Show , officially known as the North American International Auto Show or NAIAS .
But compared to Geneva 's cancellation which was more precautionary , Detroit 's reason is more direct : the venue of the event could become a field hospital .
The U .
Army Corps of Engineers , backed by the U .
Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) in this time of crisis , has designated the TCF Center in Detroit , Michigan as a feasible site for a field hospital .

Currently , there are about 140,000 confirmed cases of patients with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the subsequent Coronavirus Disease ( COVID-19 ) in the United States ; the country with the highest number of cases the world after they surpassed China 's 81,000+ cases a few days ago .
NAIAS is the premier auto show in North America and serves as a launchpad for the latest models and concepts of American automakers such as Ford , General Motors , and Fiat Chrysler .
All three major U .
automakers are now shifting their production to medical equipment such as personal protective equipment ( PPEs ) , ventilators , and the like .
Detroit , Tokyo , Germany ( formerly Frankfurt Auto Show ) , Paris and Geneva are the world 's 5 most prestigious auto shows .
Detroit and Geneva have both been canceled .
The motor shows in Tokyo and Germany are slated for 2021 , though the commercial vehicle show of Germany is still slated for later this year .
Paris still has n't been canceled but is slated for October 2020 .
