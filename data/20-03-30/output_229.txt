Report from RNZ by Leigh-Marama McLachlan Courier drivers for New Zealand Post in Wellington say the company is not doing enough to make them feel safe as they work through the lockdown .
Some workers said they had only been given a pair of gloves and a small bottle of hand sanitiser , and up to 100 people are being forced to share a few , dirty toilets .
They said they were not given the option of not working , and catching Covid-19 was constantly at the back of their minds .
Wellington courier driver Meyer Peteli said the past week had been his busiest ever , as New Zealanders panic-bought before the lockdown .
On Monday , Courier Post staff were advised to deliver parcels without touching clients .
But Peteli said they had not been equipped to keep safe .
" It was yesterday that we just got a little baby hand sanitiser , but before that , we honestly , the courier drivers , we had nothing , " he said .
" They gave us gloves and I tried to wear the gloves , but they started cutting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight .
"  Peteli said they had not been briefed at work about what safety precautions they should take as they worked through the next few weeks .
And to make matters worse , the fleet managers locked their office doors on Monday , keeping other workers out .
" They had signs up on their doors saying that we could n't use their facilities , for example making a coffee , washing our hands , using the water filter , using their toilet , " Peteli said .
" We had to go down to another facility where there is so many people that use that toilet , use that water filter , it is honestly filthy .
"  Peteli said it meant up to 20 people in the management office have their own facilities , but up to 100 workers at a time are now restricted to sharing one kitchen and a few toilets .
He said it had increased tension in the depot because workers were under the impression that they were less important than management .
Dirty depot increases fear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be named , has described the workplace as " rough and raw " and safety measures had not been adequately ramped up .
" For this organisation that we have been working for a while to not even have a plan , it is just a bit of a shock , " he said .
" It is paru as down there as well but being a contractor , I am just looking after myself -- so I am making sure I have got all the gears , but not everyone down there has got the gears to keep clean .
" Health and safety is huge and it just ai n't there .
"  He said there was one sanitation area , and he feared that his workplace conditions were increasing his risk of catching and spreading Covid-19 on the job .
" You would not think we are working under an Alert Level Four lockdown .
"  NZ Post said it shared safety information with staff this week that highlighted the need for social distancing , washing hands and staying home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spread , and explains that face masks are not recommended for couriers , and more alcohol-based sanitiser will arrive in a couple of weeks .
The company said it had implemented new processes , shifts and break structures in its mail and parcel processing sites .
But another courier driver , who wanted to remain anonymous , said the changes were not effective and it was difficult to keep two metres apart in their line of work .
She said the health and safety measures were not up to standard and their level of communication was not good enough .
" It just feels like they do n't care about you , " she said .
The woman said she was under pressure to work , and had sent her children to stay with their grandparents for the next few weeks to protect them if she got sick on the job .
" Because we are contractors , there was no option .
There was no -- if you feel uncomfortable with this .
It was just , if you feel sick , stay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't work , we do n't get paid , and if they cover our run then they will charge us .
"  She said she has not seen the cleaner all week , and she refused to use the kitchen and toilet at work out of fear of " catching something .
"  NZ Post would not be interviewed , but in a statement it said :  " At the beginning of this week we starting separating our operational sites from other workers , to protect the health of our operational staff .
At this site in question , this has not affected access to the toilets normally used , " a NZ Post spokesperson said .
It said it had changed the way it delivered goods and staff were observing social distancing of two metres .
" Our cleaners have been identified as an essential service and will continue cleaning the sites .
We are providing our people hand sanitisers and wipes , but as our network includes over 200 operational sites we do acknowledge that sometimes there may be delays in getting these out .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will work harder to make sure all of our people feel safe and know what we are doing to protect them .

March 2020 , 9:57  This sounds like a repeat behaviour by the courier companies from a few years ago vis a vis hours worked by drivers in relation to their level of pay .
The companies have a duty of care to their staff ( whether or not they are contractors ) -- it 's called worksafe .
