Man on assault charges after allegedly coughing at Tesco workers  A 33-year-old man appeared in custody before Galway District Court this morning on assault charges after allegedly coughing in the direction of two Tesco workers yesterday .
Konrad Prokopczyk , a Polish national who resides with his sister at 70 Esker Hills , Ballinasloe , was arrested by Garda David Sheffield at 5pm on Sunday afternoon at Tesco in Ballinasloe , and brought to the local Garda Station where he was later charged with assaulting both employees , with breaching the peace and with giving a false and misleading name and address .
Garda Sheffield said the accused replied " I did n't do it " when charged with giving a false name and address and made no reply to the other charges .
Garda Sheffield objected to a possible bail application under the " O'Callaghan rules " , citing the seriousness of the alleged offences and the possibility he may reoffend .
" He showed no remorse and thought the offences funny and was laughing at the two injured parties who are employees at Tesco , " Garda Sheffield told Judge Marie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed to represent Prokopczyk under the free legal aid scheme , applied for bail .
She said her client had no previous convictions or outstanding warrants and would abide by any bail conditions set by the court .
Ms Moran said her client was a Polish national who had been in the country for two years and had recently been laid off from his job .
Sergeant Aoife Curley , prosecuting , again objected to bail , saying : " He did n't seem to be respectful to the Government guidelines regarding Covid-19 and showed no respect for the employees .
" The allegations are he coughed in the direction of both employees and showed no remorse afterwards .
There is a fear this type of behaviour might happen again , " she said .
Ms Moran said her client was very aware now of the seriousness of the current situation and was notified of the consequences .
Judge Keane said it was with the greatest of reluctance that she would grant Prokopczyk bail .
" It 's utterly despicable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Ballinasloe District Court next Thursday , April 2 .
Bail was granted on condition he continue to reside at his address , observe a nightly curfew between 8pm and 8am , comply with Covid-19 Government guidelines , provide a mobile phone number to Gardai to be answered at all times , and not enter any retail outlet of any description during the current emergency .

Medical firms including London listed Smith &amp; Nephew are turning to the old remedy of silver as they seek innovative ways to combat the nasties and superbugs .
Silver has **25;2178;TOOLONG properties and is often a critical element in bandages used to treat surgical wounds .
I am pleased to report an in vitro laboratory study conducted by Smith &amp; Nephew indicated that a silver coated dressing could kill anti-biotic resistant superbugs .
The product is already on the market as a dressing for burns .
In my humble opinion , bacteria and viruses have great difficulty in developing immunity to silver because the silver breaks down cell walls and interferes obviously with their respiration and reproduction .
Before World War 2 , the most powerful anti-viral , anti-bacterial and anti-fungal substance known to medicine was colloidal silver , or small parts of silver , colloidal in size , suspended in distilled water .
It was effective against more than 650 different illness-causing bacteria , viruses or fungi .
