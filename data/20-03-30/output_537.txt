SACRAMENTO , Calif .
( AP ) -- Salvador Calzadillas is n't worried about catching the coronavirus when he 's picking mandarin oranges in the trees in central California .
But he said the mere act of getting to the groves each day puts him and his wife , also a farmworker , at risk , and there 's nothing they can do to change that .
Farmworkers , after all , ca n't work from home .
Calzadillas and his wife are among half a dozen workers who crowd into a car or van to get to the groves a 40-minute drive away .
There , they are huddled in a group to get daily instructions -- without regard for social distancing , he said .
" There 's been no changes so far , everything is the same , " Calzadillas said .
" Many of my co-workers say it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same .
There 's no prevention , and we keep working .
"  The 31-year-old is one of many workers on farms operating as essential businesses in the heart of California 's farm-rich Central Valley , supplying food to much of the United States even as schools , restaurants and stores have closed down because of the virus .
More than a third of the country 's vegetables and two-thirds of its fruits and nuts are grown in California , whose farms and ranches brought in nearly $50 billion in 2018 , according to the state Department of Agriculture .
Agriculture groups and union leaders are urging employers to take extra precautions to prevent the outbreak from spreading among California 's farmworkers , who are already in short supply .
Workers getting sidelined by illness could jeopardize crop yields and disrupt the food supply .
Some farms are heeding the call , union officials and growers say .
But it can be difficult to separate workers by 6 feet ( 2 meters ) as recommended because of the way certain crops are grown , said Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family farmers in California , Arizona , Colorado and New Mexico .
And efficiency is also critical , he said , with farmers facing pressure to restock grocery shelves .
" You would have to stagger the workers who are harvesting , " Puglia said .
" That is a very inefficient and a very , very costly way to operate , and most farmers would n't be able to do it .
They would be losing way too much money .
"  Western Growers said many members have added sanitation stations in the fields and required hand-washing before and after work as well as spaced out workers in packing facilities .
United Farm Workers is using the moment to push for longstanding requests , including removing the need for a doctor 's note and other hurdles to getting sick pay .
In a letter to the agriculture industry , the union said workers should be able to wash their hands frequently and be encouraged to stay home if they are sick .
" What we 're finding is that most growers are not communicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practice best practices ( like ) washing your hands " and keeping distance from others , said Armando Elenes , secretary treasurer at United Farm Workers , which represents up to 27,000 seasonal workers .
Joe Pezzini , president of vegetable grower Ocean Mist Farms , said his office and sales staff are working remotely wherever possible .
He said the company , which operates in California 's Coachella Valley and Central Coast , had workers use gloves and sanitized equipment to ensure food safety long before the virus appeared .
" One of the biggest changes is just in the training and education , " he said , including encouraging workers to keep a safe distance from each other , even on breaks .
" Partly for personal safety , but it 's also for , ' Hey , we 're feeding the nation .
We 're creating food the nation needs right now .
' "  The coronavirus crisis has drawn fresh attention to farmers ' critical role , with residents finding some supermarket shelves cleaned out by people stocking up and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .
As of Friday , more than 90 people have died of the virus in California and over 4,600 have tested positive , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University .
Most cases are in the San Francisco Bay Area and around Los Angeles .
Leti Martinez , who picks mandarin oranges , said her employer told her little about the virus except to explain that the farm is allowed to keep operating .
The 31-year-old said she wears gloves to prevent her hands from getting cut and wraps a cloth around her face to keep out the dust .
But she is worried about her commute with other workers and said they sometimes face a shortage of running water in the bathrooms once they 're there .
Another concern is conditions for foreign workers in the U .
on temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in close quarters , sometimes with bunk-style beds or in motels provided by their employers , and commute together in vans and buses .
A coalition of farmworker advocates has asked U .
officials to require employers to provide at least 6 feet between beds for such workers and that they be tested for the virus before entering the country .
A Labor Department spokesman said this week that there were no announcements about changed working conditions for H-2A workers .
Those workers account for a small percentage of farm labor overall but are significant in Colorado , which has a shorter growing season , and for certain crops , like berries , said Puglia of Western Growers .
To address conditions at the thousands of farms that the California Farm Bureau Federation represents , its president , Jamie Johansson , said he has told farms to have workers go out in smaller groups " when possible .
" His organization also says hand-washing on farms is routine for food safety reasons .
Some small farms are taking extra measures .

Steve Heringer said workers now have more hand sanitizer and already use their own gloves for field work .
" If they 're working in rows , ( we ) have them working back to back " to maximize distance , he said .
" It 's had pretty little impact on the vineyard side , but we have a heightened awareness .
