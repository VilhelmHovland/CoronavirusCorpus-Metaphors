More than 9,000 families say they need a laptop from Jefferson County Public Schools in order for their children to take part in distance learning -- a setup that could stretch through the remainder of the school year .
" We expect many more requests tomorrow , as the phone lines were jammed most of the day today , " said district spokesman Mark Hebert .
As of Monday evening , 9,366 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .
Earlier in the day , the district 's social media channels asked for patience from those unable to get through via a telephone request line .
Families have until 5 p .
Tuesday to submit a request for one of 25,000 available Google Chromebooks , the district previously said .
JCPS plans to ship the Chromebooks to families by the end of the week at a cost of about $250,000 , the district said .

The district is offering one Chromebook per family .
Those eligible include families with children who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch or who receive special education services at school .
Students still learning English or considered homeless are also being given special consideration , JCPS said .
Eligible families should have received communication from the district over the weekend about how to apply , JCPS said .
Those with questions should call the district 's help line : 502-313-HELP .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district -- Kentucky 's largest -- prepares to launch at least two weeks of remote learning .
JCPS spent last week rounding up Chromebooks from dozens of its campuses .
The 98,000-student district will kick off its nontraditional instruction , or NTI , on April 7 .
All Kentucky schools are scheduled to return to in-person learning on April 20 , but it 's appearing increasingly likely that districts will remain shuttered longer -- perhaps through the end of the school year .
But JCPS has also said that access to an internet-based device wo n't be necessary for students to continue learning while school is closed .
Students can pick up paper materials at any of the district 's meal sites , the district said , adding that students will be able to drop off their completed work at the sites , too .
JCPS said it is working with Mayor Greg Fischer 's office , as well as private foundations , to secure 6,000 internet " hot spots " for children with special needs .
The district planned to release more information early this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebert said .
Michael Pedelty , a regional spokesman for Charter , said demand for service under that offer has been " strong " but declined to share how many Jefferson County families have requested service .
Attendance under remote learning is counted by a teacher communicating with a student either through an email , phone call or by the student turning in an assignment virtually .
Educators and students should communicate at least once a week under state law , but JCPS Superintendent Marty Pollio said last week he hopes for more communication .
If there are Chromebooks remaining after initial requests are filled , JCPS will open availability to all families with the remainder of the computers distributed by a lottery system , the district said .
