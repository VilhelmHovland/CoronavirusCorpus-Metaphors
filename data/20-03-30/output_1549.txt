The spread of coronavirus in the UK is showing " early signs of slowing " , a Government-advising scientist has said .
Imperial College London Professor Neil Ferguson said social distancing measures bought in by Number 10 had helped hospital admissions from Covid-19 " slow down a bit " .
Despite positive signs , stringent measures could still last for up to six months , with restrictions gradually lifted to avoid another bout of infections , England 's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said on Sunday .
" In the UK we can see some early signs of slowing in some indicators -- less so deaths because deaths are lagged by a long time from when measures come in force , " Professor Ferguson told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme .
" But if we look at the numbers of new hospital admissions , that does appear to be slowing down a bit now .
" It has not yet plateaued , so still the numbers can be increasing each day but the rate of that increase has slowed .
"  He also said the epidemic was spreading at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Jenny Harries said distancing measures would be lifted gradually in the UK ( via REUTERS )  " It is quite clear across the country , the epidemic is in different stages in different parts of the country , " he added .
" In central London it could be as many as 3 per cent to 5 per cent of the population has been infected -- maybe more in individual hot spots .
In the country as a whole in the UK , maybe 2 per cent or 3 per cent "  He said antibody tests , currently in final stages of validation , would be " critical " to the understanding of the epidemic , adding they would " hopefully " be available in days .
The comments come after Dr Harries said the nation will not be in " complete lockdown " for half a year but said social distancing measures will be lifted gradually .

" But we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living , that would be quite dangerous , " she said .

Read more  " Three weeks for review , two or three months to see if we 've really squashed it , but three to six months , ideally , but lots of uncertainty in that but then to see at which point we can actually get back to normal and it is plausible it could go further than that .
" This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months , but as a nation we have to be really , really responsible and keep doing what we 're all doing until we 're sure we can gradually start lifting various interventions which are likely to be spaced -- based on the science and our data -- until we gradually come back to a normal way of living .
