Project CURE Hosts Drive to Collect PPE for First Responders  Publishedon March 30 , 2020  During the coronavirus pandemic , healthcare workers have faced serious supply shortages , and on Sunday Project CURE used the parking lot of one of Chicago 's most iconic sports venues to help address those shortfalls .
The group hosted a supply drive at the United Center on Sunday , hoping to solicit donations of personal protective equipment for first responders and healthcare workers who are in desperate need of medical supplies as they help the public deal with COVID-19 .
" This mission today hit very close to home , " Dr .
Tricia Moo-Young said .
" I think we need to understand that the shortage is literally strangling the effort to strain this epidemic .
"  Moo-Young was one of the volunteers at the Sunday event , as she called on the public to donate their extra supplies of PPE so that healthcare professionals can be safer in their efforts to help people afflicted by the disease .
From containers of bleach to boxes of gloves , a line of cars showed up to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one box of gloves , that 's one box of gloves the community did n't have before , " Project CURE Executive Director Beth Rottman said .
Typically Project CURE focuses its efforts on other countries , but the need has never hit closer to home than it has during the COVID-19 pandemic .
President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the federal government 's social distancing guidelines will be extended by two weeks and continue until April 30 .
" They are large , and people need a lot of supplies of just basic things , " she said .
" Bleach , wipes , gloves , masks , gowns , things that until a few weeks ago we never imagined we 'd need in our hometown .
"  For those residents who missed the drive Sunday , the group is still asking for help .
Project CURE is accepting donations at its warehouse in suburban Woodridge , and potential donors can give financial donations on the group 's website .
