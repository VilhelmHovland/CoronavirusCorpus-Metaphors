Torquay Tiger Vlastuin misses the den as pandemic reality bites  When footy stopped Nick Vlastuin did what he does whenever the football merry-go-round offers a break : he retreated to the beach .
Vlastuin is in Torquay completing two townhouses he has been building .
He is a qualified carpenter and working towards his building licence .
The places are at lock-up stage and with footy in limbo he has spent his time on the tools doing the finishing touches .
Nick Vlastuin is spending football 's down time working on two townhouses but is keen to get back to playing .
Images  From an unwelcome break , it was a welcome opportunity .
But , like everyone , he is sick of looking at four walls , no matter how perfectly straight he has now made them .
He 'd rather see 40 teammates .
He 'd rather see a dozen coaches and medicos .
He 'd rather see a Sherrin and the clock on the Punt Road silo .

So he can barely get to the beach now , let alone get a wave .
He does n't have weights or a gym at Torquay so he is stuck improvising with building materials in the backyard for weights , going for runs and kicking a ball to himself .
" I have to do the running , I ca n't afford not to do the running but I can afford not to do weights for a while and pick it up again , " he said .
Vlastuin loves the summers at Torquay , which makes for a conundrum as football looks to push back into his regular summer break .
On the one hand he gets to play , which is good .
On the other hand he has , well , the complexion for winter sport ( he might be a keen surfer but wetsuits offer more protection than a black and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " I am not usually too good in the hot weather and the sun , being pale skinned so footy in the off-season when you are usually wanting to do something else is not great but playing footy is better than not playing footy , " Vlastuin said .
" I would like to fit those games in and be able to play .
And then we wo n't have to do as long a pre-season for next year , which is a positive .
"  Nick Vlastuin in action during Richmond 's first-round match before the postponement .
The coronavirus at one point appeared likely to present Richmond with a competitive edge over the rest of the competition as an experienced and physically mature group .
And perhaps if teams return to play again this year after a long limbo it will be the more physically mature teams that cope best with the impact of the hiatus on training .
" There was talk about that early days when restrictions were coming in that it could give us a competitive advantage because the club looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this but let 's go over and above to get an advantage , " Vlastuin said .
" Now who knows if the season goes ahead or not .
At the moment we have bigger things to worry about .
"  Vlastuin said he was glad the season started and enjoyed the novelty of the crowd-free game , but thinks the novelty will get old fast and players will miss the crowds as much as crowds miss the players .
That said he was also relieved when the season was postponed .
" We had already had new measures in , training was only in groups of six .
One of the best things about footy is hanging around with 40 of your mates , so by the end of the week it was like what is the point ?  " We did n't have a choice in the end .
When it got called off it was a bit of a relief in the end because of the keyboard warriors .
" It was nothing personally directed towards me but you would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top comments were people hammering players for playing .
" But then on the other hand my mates and heaps of people you would speak to were rapt about footy going ahead .
"  Richmond , as the reigning premier , the team that has two flags in three years , returned this year and in round one looked to have lost no hunger .
All sides will be frustrated at the season being taken away but for a side with a strong early claim on this year 's premiership and thus for a flag that would enhance its historic standing , or dynasty , it is an added frustration to the postponement .
It is not an aspect Vlastuin gives voice to .
" Maybe in 10 years we will look back on this season and say what if we got a full season ? But at the moment footy seems second fiddle to everything else .
People are losing their lives .
' ' Maybe in five years or 10 years people will look back and say that .
"  The bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the townhouses he is building and not his 40 teammates .
It is looking around and knowing that the coaches and people he works with so closely are not there , they are at home without a wage and the deep uncertainty of whether they will have jobs at the end of all of this and how they will put food on the table in the meantime .
" All of our coaches have been stood down and are not getting paid , I want to get back playing as soon as I can so they can get paid and get their .
