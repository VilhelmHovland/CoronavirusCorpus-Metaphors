Sanlam warns of Covid-19 impact on growth , but says it has a R760m pandemic reserve  13:14 30/03/2020 Lameez Omarjee  The Covid-19 pandemic will negatively impact the growth prospects of financial services group Sanlam and its subsidiary Santam , but both businesses say that they are well-capitalised to weather the storm .
Last week , President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a nation-wide 21-day lock down which started on Friday .
During this time , only essential service providers such as banks and the JSE , as well as supermarkets and pharmacies , are able to operate .
Sanlam and most of its service providers , including Santam , are classified as essential service providers which will continue to operate during the lockdown .
In line with JSE requirements , both Sanlam JSE : SLM and Santam JSE : SNT on Monday issued shareholder notices on the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on their operations .
Sanlam noted that in many of the markets in which it operates globally , such as Namibia , Morocco , Lebanon , Malaysia , India , the UK and Cote d'Ivoire , lockdowns have been implemented to slow the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather the current conditions - we have a solid balance sheet , strong operational processes and some of the best expertise available in the market , " the group said .
Both Sanlam and Santam provided an operational update for the first two months of the year and reported solid performance .
Covid-19 claims  Sanlam said that so far it had not been exposed to any major changes in claims .
" The development of claims experience will be dependent on , among others , the infection rate in the markets where we provide cover , the ability of the local healthcare infrastructure to cope with the number of individuals requiring hospitalisation and the eventual mortality rate .
" The swift action taken by many governments , in particular lockdowns , should limit infection rates and mortality experience , " the group said .
The group 's policy liabilities as at 31 December 2019 included a pandemic reserve of R760 million , it was created a number of years ago for an event of this nature , Sanlam said .
" This reserve is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Short-term insurance provider Santam is in a process of reviewing relevant policy wordings , in order to assess the insurance exposure related to Covid-19 pandemic and how best its policies can respond to the related claims .
" The impact of Covid-19 on general insurance claims is , among others , dependent on governments ' response to the pandemic .
Some governments are considering requirements for insurers to pay medical costs even if this is not covered under the policy contracts , or to contribute voluntarily to relief funds .
" Despite limited contractual exposure in many instances , measures implemented by governments may therefore still have an impact , " the group said .
Sanlam said that business interruption insurance only applies to business interruption caused by damage to property such as a fire or machinery breakdown .
As for health insurance , exposure to Covid-19 claims is dependent on policy conditions , which vary between countries .
" These conditions in general exclude pandemics and/or pandemics where quarantine is implemented , " Sanlam said .
" The full financial impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined after the lockdown has been lifted , there is a return to normality and its consequences have been properly assessed , " Santam said .
It added that shareholders would be updated on developments .
Earlier this month , Sanlam released its financial results for the year ended 31 December , 2019 .
Its headline earnings declined 18% to R7 .
billion .
At the time , CEO Ian Kirk warned of a tough year ahead , anticipating negative impact of load shedding as well as Covid-19 on economic growth of the markets in which the group has operations , Fin24 previously reported .
