The thermometers and their app upload temperature readings to a centralized database , allowing Kinsa to track fevers across the country .

Only strict social-distancing measures -- closing bars and restaurants , asking people to shelter in place -- led to a significant drop in fever readings , while declaring a state of emergency or limiting the size of public gatherings had little effect .

The Kinsa readings certainly look " like a way to prove that social distancing works , " Dr .

" But it does shows that it takes the most restrictive measures to make a real difference .
