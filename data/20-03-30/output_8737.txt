George Zhao : Honor was the Second Largest Smartphone Brand in China in February  At the end of Honor 30S launch event , Honor President Zhao George said that his brand performed well even during the hardest of times amid lockdowns due to the coronavirus outbreak in China .
As per Strategy Analytics , global smartphone shipments fell 38% YoY in February but still Honor managed to secure the second position in the Chinese smartphone market .
February 2020 was the worst-performing month for smartphone makers in terms of YoY decline in history .
The cause for it was none other than the infamous coronavirus outbreak which led to lockdown across China , the manufacturing hub of the world .
Thus , supply chains and offline sales were severely disturbed .
But , according to Mr .
Zhao , Honor has recovered rapidly since the beginning of March and it is even growing at a higher rate than the same period last year .
He further boasts that Honor achieved a new record in difficult times by becoming the second largest smartphone brand in China .
