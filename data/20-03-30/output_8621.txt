Red Bull boss Helmut Marko has revealed that he pitched an idea to have his drivers get exposed to coronavirus whilst the season was suspended .
Marko made the stunning admission whilst speaking to Austrian public broadcaster ORF , proposing that they held a training camp with drivers from the Red Bull and Torro Rosso teams so that they could build immunity when the season recommenced .
" We have four Formula One drivers , we have eight or 10 juniors and the idea was to hold a camp where we could bridge this rather dead time mentally and physically , " Marko said .
" And then it would be ideal , because these are all young , strong men in really good health , if the infection comes then .
" Then they would be equipped , if it starts up again , for a really hard world championship .
"  Naturally , this idea did n't go down well with the rest of the organisation , who immediately shut it down .
" Let 's put it this way : it has not been well received , " Marko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F1 community , with former F1 driver Felipe Massa calling it ' completely insane ' .
