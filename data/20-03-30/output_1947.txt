CORONAVIRUS : Hatch at pharmacy in bid to stop spread of virus  CORONAVIRUS : Hatch at pharmacy in bid to stop spread of virus  A YORK pharmacy has barred off access to most of the shop - with medicines passed through a serving hatch - in a bid to protect staff and customers from the coronavirus .
Monk Bar Pharmacy in Goodramgate says its ' hatch and queueing system ' will help keep staff and customers as safe as possible .
Up to a maximum of two customers can queue inside a small area just inside the shops 's front entrance , with staff standing on the other side of newly installed perspex and timber screens .
One hatch in the screen is designated for prescription drop-offs and collections , and also for sales of medicines .
A second hatch is for advice and consultations , ' blue prescriptions ' for methadone and NHS 111 referrals .
Signs read : " New hatch and queueing system .
In order to keep our customers and staff as safe as possible during the Covid-19 pandemic , we have implemented a temporary hatch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and we hope to get back to our normal set-up very soon .
"  The pharmacy 's manager was unavailable for comment .
The Press reported last week how Boots ' store in Coney Street had imposed restrictions on customers to reduce the risks of customers and staff getting the virus , or passing it on to someone else .
The store was only allowing a maximum of 12 customers inside at any one time , with the restriction being enforced by a member of staff .
A patient line of customers was standing in the street outside the store , each person standing two metres apart from each other in line , following social distancing guidelines .
A Boots spokeswoman said it was doing everything it could to help its customers and staff to stay healthy and safe whilst the Covid-19 situation was ongoing and had made changes in its stores to help manage the social distance government guidance .
" New signage will be placed in our pharmacies , asking patients to stand two metres apart whilst waiting and some seating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for social distancing , " she said .
" To help manage the number of people in some of our stores , our colleagues may also limit the number of people within the pharmacy at the same time during busy periods .
"  A spokesman for LloydsPharmacy , which has several outlets in York , said it needed to ensure customers kept two metres apart and was asking them to be a little more tolerant of waiting times .
He said that at times , staff might not be able to spend as much time with customers as they usually would , because volumes had increased dramatically and some of the workforce was in isolation , leaving some employees doing the jobs of two .
