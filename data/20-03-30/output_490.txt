Earlier this month , activists protested in front of the Supreme Court to demand ongoing access to abortion .
Jacquelyn Martin/AP/Shutterstock  On March 18th , as the reality of the coronavirus crisis was becoming painfully apparent to Americans , the Idaho legislature was turning its attention to healthcare concerns of another kind : making sure that women were denied access to abortion at some nebulous future date .
Across the country , state legislatures had gone into recess , heeding the social distancing advice of medical professionals .
Not Idaho .
For at least an hour on the floor of the House , there was vigorous debate over Senate Bill 1385 , a so-called " trigger law " that would immediately criminalize abortion in the state if Roe v .
Wade were overturned or a constitutional amendment gave states the right to criminalize it themselves .
Under the law , performing an abortion would be a felony , except in instances of officially-reported rape or incest , or to save the life of the mother .
" Everyone needs to face the consequences of their own personal choices , " Representative Megan Blanksma said in her closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way to Governor Brad Little 's desk to be signed , which it was last Tuesday .
Related  While states like Texas , Ohio , and Iowa have ignored the directives of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and used the coronavirus pandemic to attempt to declare abortion a " nonessential " surgery ( Texas ' attorney general even barred medication abortions , which are n't surgical at all -- though a judge blocked those measures , at least for now ) , other states , like Idaho , have forged ahead with business as usual , pushing through anti-abortion ( and anti-trans and anti-affirmative action ) bills while their constituents ' attention is understandably pulled elsewhere .
In other words , COVID-19 has provided just the excuse the right has long been seeking to overturn Roe by way of subterfuge .
As Rahm Emanuel put it , " Never allow a crisis to go to waste .
"  In early March , Idaho lawmakers conceded to Governor Brad Little 's plea to transfer a mere $2 million to the Governor 's Emergency Fund to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was considered before the legislature finally adjourned on March 20th .
Yet on March 4th , the House had taken the time to pass a bill that would defund Planned Parenthood , pulling money that would never have gone toward abortions ( federal and state money was already restricted in that regard ) but rather would have paid for cancer screenings , STI testing , and birth control .
On March 16th , just four days before the indefinite shutdown , the Senate State Affairs committee passed that bill out of committee , readying it for a vote .
" We 're talking about life-saving healthcare , and they 're attacking that , " says Mistie Tolman , Idaho State Director of Planned Parenthood Votes , a political action committee .
" They 're spending their time in the state House trying to defund a healthcare provider during a global health pandemic .
"  Despite statements from Governor Andy Beshear asking the legislature to quickly pass a budget and go home , the Kentucky legislature still remains open .
That means all eight anti-abortion bills that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for consideration , including a constitutional amendment that would declare that there is no right to abortion in the Commonwealth ( if approved by 60% of each chamber , it would go on the ballot at the next general election , where it would need to be approved by a majority of voters ) .
On Thursday , the Senate Judiciary committee heard House Bill 451 , which would allow Kentucky 's anti-abortion attorney general to have oversight over abortion facilities and regulations , sidestepping the more neutral Cabinet for Health and Family Services .
It would also give the attorney general power to enforce the governor 's ban on elective medical procedures , adding the language that this was " including but not limited to abortion .
" After it was passed out of committee with a unanimous vote , Senate Republicans actually tried to fold it into SB 150 , a COVID relief bill -- meaning they tried to restrict healthcare in the very bill meant to provide aid during a healthcare crisis ( it was later removed ) .
Meanwhile , SB 9 , a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27th , awaits debate in the Kentucky House when it reconvenes this coming Wednesday .
While purporting to protect infants born alive after failed abortions ( a basically nonexistent situation ) , what it would do is further stigmatize the procedure and force doctors to provide life-support to -- and prolong the suffering of -- babies whose medical issues make them unable to live outside the womb .
Not only is such a bill controversial , but it 's also redundant with a 2002 bill passed by the U .
Congress .
Its purpose in the face of the current health crisis is baffling .
" I mean , the state is practically shut down .
Schools are shut down .
Daycares are shut down .
Movies theaters , bars , restaurants are all shut down .
We should n't be fighting controversial bills at this moment .
We should be working to help people who are directly impacted by all of these shutdowns who do n't know where their next paycheck is coming from , " says Tamarra Wieder , Kentucky State Director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , as the Capital has been closed to the public since March 17th .
" There is not an ability for people to democratically participate in this process .
"  Kentucky Democratic Representative Charles Booker ( who happens to be running for Mitch McConnell 's seat in the U .
Senate ) agrees .
" They 're playing politics , " he tells me .
" I know very clearly that they are using this moment -- when a lot of opposition , a lot of opposing perspectives , can not be there -- to quickly move these types of bills forward that they know that they 'd catch a lot of hell for if the public were there .
" Out of concern for his health -- and as a type of protest -- he 's refused to show up for hearings or cast his vote on any bill that does not directly address COVID-19 relief or the budget , which the legislature is required to pass before adjourning .
" I 'm a type 1 diabetic , and I 've got two little girls , a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells me .
" Right now our legislature has not been leading by example .
"  Which calls into question the motives of those legislators who are focusing on pushing abortion legislation instead of on the health and well-being of their colleagues and constituents .
" For some legislators , I think abortion is a really held conviction , " Wieder says .
" But I think it reinforces that they 're not pro-life ; they 're just pro-birth .
" Her hope at present is that , as other states have done , Kentucky will end its session promptly .
" I do n't know where this ends , to be honest , " she sighs .
" I really don't .
