/  Originally published on March 30 , 2020 3:51 pm  The trade war with China includes about $5 billion worth of tariffs on medical products from the country .
And while states across the country are struggling to get medical supplies they need to fight the coronavirus , President Trump confirmed on Friday that reports he 's considering pulling back on those tariffs are not true .
Chad Bown , a senior fellow and trade policy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , says Trump 's move would be a mistake .
Tariffs are hampering America 's fight against COVID-19 , he found .
A lot of the medical supplies that the U .
health care system desperately needs to fight the coronavirus are the same supplies that were hit with tariffs , he says .
Although some of those tariffs were removed , Bown argues they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical and emergency respondent suppliers to be able to prepare for a pandemic like what we 're seeing today .
"  Interview Highlights  On how much the U .
relied on China for medical products before the trade war  " Before the tariffs went on , it was about 25% or so of our overall imports of these products .
Now , we do produce a lot of these things in the United States .
We buy a fair amount from other countries as well .
But China really was a pretty significant source for a lot of the equipment that our responders need .
"  On where the U .
got medical supplies from after the tariffs went into effect  " Well , it 's hard to answer that question precisely .
When I looked at the data , there are imports of these products coming in from other countries .
But it does n't look like they 're coming in at a much greater rate from these other countries that would fill the gap that China 's lost sales into the U .
market would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items , you ca n't just switch and find an alternative supplier somewhere out there .
It can take one , two years for a manufacturing facility to be certified by the Food and Drug Administration .
A lot of these are safety items and we want to make sure that they 're safe , and so it 's not as easy to switch as one might hope .
"  On whether there are still tariffs on certain Chinese medical products that are needed in the U .
to fight the coronavirus pandemic  " I think they 're likely still are , and I think the administration likely thinks that there still are some tariffs in effect as well .
They have excluded temporarily some of the products , but basically what they 've done there is they 've responded to requests by American companies to have these tariffs removed .
They just put out another call and said , ' Hey , if we have n't taken the tariffs off something that you want to buy , let us know and we 'll consider it .
' Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers out there that have n't been paying attention to the details of the back and forth of the trade war , and they do n't know about this .
Now they 're fighting a pandemic .
And so this really is kind of a haphazard way of making it easier for the American medical community to get these sources from wherever they can possibly get them from at this stage .
"  On whether the trade war as a whole has made it more difficult for the Trump administration to deal with coronavirus because of the strained relationship between the U .
and China  " Yeah , I think absolutely .
The Trump administration , in taking this approach with China , has really frayed relations .
They 've been very , very antagonistic .
Even in the best of times , this pandemic is going to require a level of cooperation globally that we have never experienced before .
And right now , we are basically starting off at kind of the lowest point almost that one could imagine between the United States and China .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U .
administration to be able to engage more proactively with China so that everybody can come up with positive solutions to help deal with this crisis .
