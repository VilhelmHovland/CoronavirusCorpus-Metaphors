ACLU calls for early releases for some Indiana inmates as threat from COVID-19 escalates  The ACLU of Indiana has called on the Indiana Supreme Court to " immediately issue emergency steps " to reduce the number of inmates in the state 's prisons and jails to thwart what could be a devastating spread of coronavirus behind bars .
" We 're asking the Supreme Court to , among other things , direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are either in the DOC or in county jails to determine if they can be released to try and avoid the spread of the COVID-19 , " said Ken Falk , legal director at the ACLU of Indiana .
" The only way of hoping to stop the deadly spread of COVID-19 is to take these additional steps in the criminal legal system .
This will benefit not just people who are incarcerated but those who work in jails and prisons and go back and forth to their families and communities every day .
"  A spokesperson for the Supreme Court did not respond Monday to a request for comment .
Whether any state inmates or county jail prisoners have tested positive for the coronavirus is unclear .
A DOC spokeswoman directed questions to the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute , which did not respond Monday to IndyStar .
Three civilian employees and an inmate who worked in the laundry at the Marion County Jail were placed in quarantine after one of the employees tested positive in mid-March .
Another inmate who displayed symptoms when being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended Monday , and a spokeswoman said no other inmates have tested positive .
Intervention by the Supreme Court would be an extraordinary , but not unheard measure , Falk said .
The ACLU says steps similar to those being requested have been taken in New Jersey , South Carolina and several other states .
He added the request is not intended as criticism against sheriffs , the Department of Correction or lower courts .
" We by no means wish to imply or state that courts and the DOC or sheriffs are not , at this point , doing a lot of things to try and address COVID-19 , " Falk said .
" But given that the Supreme Court is the ultimate director and head of our judicial system , it seemed appropriate to ask them to step in and direct immediate action .
"  Falk said overcrowding in Indiana 's prisons and jails -- which hold nearly 50,000 men , women and juveniles -- exacerbates the threat of the virus spreading rapidly if it gets into a correctional facility .
Prior to this health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at or above capacity , according to the ACLU .
" I think we all recognize that jails and prisons are particularly prone to the disease given how it spreads , and we are asking that steps be taken to try to minimize the population to the greatest extent possible , " he said .
" Obviously , if you depopulate a jail or prison , it becomes a safer place for those who are left behind .
"  The ACLU request includes a plea for " waiving bail requirements for pretrial detainees who do not pose an immediate threat , and in the case of convicted persons , determining whether a sentence reduction or suspension is warranted so the person may shelter at home .
"  Several county jails , working in conjunction with local courts and prosecutors , have released some low-level offenders .
But that practice has not been widespread across the state .
And just last week , Indiana Department of Correction Commissioner Rob Carter denied a request from prisoner advocates to consider early releases of nonviolent state prisoners who were nearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Katie Carlson , spokeswoman for the Marion County Sheriff 's Office , said officials have taken numerous steps to address the COVID-19 threat , including additional sanitizing of jail facilities .
" The determination whether inmates should remain in custody or be released is not a decision of the MCSO , but of the Marion County Courts , " she said in a statement .
" The courts are working with the Prosecutor 's Office and the Public Defender 's Office to lower the jail population .
They have also implemented video court hearings .
Lastly , the courts have requested that all Marion County law enforcement agencies issue summonses for non-violent misdemeanor cases .
"  The changes have significantly reduced the number of jail inmates over the past two weeks .
More than 2,100 prisoners were being held in three lockups as of March 17 .
The number Monday had dropped to 1,674 .
And all but 60 were being held on felony charges .
