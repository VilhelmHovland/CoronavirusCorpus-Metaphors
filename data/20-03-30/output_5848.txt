' Business owners keeping positive mindset '  Many businesses in the CNMI , big and small , have temporarily closed their doors , changed operating hours or have migrated their operations online -- all due to COVID-19 concerns .

In its announcement last Friday , it stated that the temporary closure is due to the COVID-19 pandemic .

The famous fried rice of Shirley 's Coffee Shop will be missed for a while as they closed temporarily effective last week .

Bed-and-breakfast owner Shey Fernandez-Owens said she and her husband had to pull the plug on their business because their rental unit is next to their house .
" We have three little children and their health and safety are very important to us .
So even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only choice we had , " she said .
The Owens have guests from the U .
mainland and Guam , but their clientele are mostly from China and South Korea .
Owen said she actually had to contact AirBnB to ask it to cancel bookings because AirBnB has penalties if hosts cancel bookings , " so I had to explain why , " she said .
" Honestly , it is very hard to stay positive as we have not even reached a year since we opened .
However , the only way to survive this is to have hope that this crisis shall soon pass .
We can not be consumed by despair , sadness , or stress because that can be detrimental to our health .
As parents and small business owners , we have to stay positive for our own state of mind and , most importantly , for our children , " she added .
Isla Montessori School , a non-profit school in Dandan , closed their campus last March 16 .
" Following the announcement from the governor and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and their families .
we used the first week of closure as our spring break and , during that time , teachers worked to create their distance learning opportunities for the students .
We began official school days on March 23 and have just completed our first week online , " said school co-founder Susan Book .
" The health of our island is at the forefront of most people 's minds .
I 'm sure there will be some more closures in order to keep our community safe .
My hope is that we can still support our small businesses , nonprofits , schools , etc .
during this time so that they will still be there when we come out on the other side , " Book added .
Green Flash Dive in Chinatown , a dive services company that provides air fills , equipment , instruction , and dive guiding to all dive companies on Saipan , began to limit hours coinciding with the governor 's first directive , where business are supposed to operate from 6am to 1pm every day .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning yesterday , we only allow air fill service with customer pickup , " said owner Rhea McDoulett .
" We stay positive because we are confident in Saipan 's resilience .
We also know we live in one of the most beautiful places on earth and people will always be drawn to the beauty of our islands , " McDoulette added .
The increase in the number of business closures is not farfetched , especially in the wake of two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the CNMI , as announced last Saturday .
" More businesses are recognizing the need to protect their staff , families , and themselves by slowing the spread as much as possible .
In addition , the likelihood of an extended economic closure makes many in business confront the possibility of real closure , " McDoulette said .
" We recognize that we are not alone in this difficulty .
It is when we focus on the individual effect that it begins to cause anxiety and stress .
We also do n't dwell on finding fault in this catastrophe .
Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back at this period and remember all of the good people did to overcome a worldwide problem , " McDoulette added .
