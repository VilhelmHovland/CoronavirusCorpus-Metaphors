Brandon Dahlberg  Interested in this topic ? You may also want to view these photo galleries :  Matt Wilson woke up last Thursday morning and asked himself , " What can I do to help people in Memphis that are feeling helpless right now ? "  The idea that popped into his head was to host an online concert series fundraiser on the roof of the Chisca building .
Wilson , who owns Swanky 's Taco Shop and Cheffie 's Caf ? , often stages live music events at his taco shops and knows how music can not only entertain , but also bring people together -- even when staying apart at home .
Four days later his dream became reality .
On Sunday afternoon , more than 12,000 people tuned into Facebook Live to watch the Memphis band Walrus perform for two hours from the rooftop of the Chisca building in Downtown Memphis .
Walrus performs a benefit concert live from the roof of the Chisca building , Sunday , March 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahlberg )  Wilson chose the Chisca building for two reasons .
First , it 's the home of his Downtown restaurant , plus the historic building is a Memphis landmark with strong music ties .
The Chisca was the home to WHBQ radio station where DJ Dewey Phillips debuted Elvis Presley 's first recording of " That 's Alright , Mama .
" Presley also later performed at The Chisca in 1956 .
Wilson has named the virtual concert series #dontletmedownmem .
The inspiration for the name was The Beatles ' iconic " Do n't Let Me Down " rooftop performance .
All proceeds from the series will be donated to Slingshot Memphis , a nonprofit that " aims to create a demonstrable reduction in poverty by promoting a results-driven poverty-fighting ecosystem .
"  " I hope to raise $10 million , " said Wilson , who is funding the concert series out of his own pocket .

People are encouraged to watch the concert online versus coming to the Chisca .
