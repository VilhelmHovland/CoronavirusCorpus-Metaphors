NIAID-RML/Handout via REUTERSNIAID-RML / via REUTERS  After six new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the region this weekend , the Eastern Ontario Health Unit said Monday more cases could pop up as the turnaround on tests starts to speed up .
EOHU medical officer of health Dr .
Paul Roumeliotis said there are about 200 tests they 're waiting for , including some that were done in Ottawa .
" So far , say for those positives that we got , everything else has been negative , " said Roumeliotis .
" We 'll also get the negative results , but there 's still some pending as well .
"  " We also believe that while there are several thousands , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratories are really ramping up their ability and they would be able to catch up quite quickly .
I would not be surprised that , at both the provincial level and the local level , we see cases that lagged on that were tested literally six or seven days ago .
That period of waiting is going regressively down to about a day or two days within , I would say the end of the week is what I 'm being told by the province .
"  Of the six cases -- five in Prescott-Russell and one in Akwesasne -- one is a woman in her 50s who was transferred to the intensive care unit at the Cornwall Community Hospital .
Roumeliotis provided some information behind the transfer Monday .
The hospitalized patient was initially sent to Hawkesbury and District General Hospital but was referred to CCH .
Roumeliotis said that is not unusual to do that , and that CCH had the ventilator capacity to assist the woman .
He dispelled rumours they were bringing in the virus to the Cornwall area by transferring a positive patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transfers .
" I wo n't be surprised at all if some of the tests that we 've done in the last several days in our local SDG area are positive , " said Dr .
Roumeliotis .
" That has nothing to do with this case .
"  He said there could be a case where a patient at CCH ends up transferred to Ottawa .
" Our paramedics know what to do , our hospitals know what to do , our sending hospitals know what to and our receiving hospitals know what to do , " said Roumeliotis .
" This does not put anybody at risk .
"  Related  In terms of the other five cases confirmed over the weekend , a man in his 50s and a woman in her 20s are self-isolating as they have travelled to the United States .
A man in his 50s who came in close contact with someone who was tested positive for the virus previously is self-isolating and a woman in her 60s , whose contact remains under investigation , is also at home .

, and is also self-isolating .
Roumeliotis said about 90 per cent of individuals who acquire the virus will not require hospitalizations .
" Most people recover from the virus and do very well but it 's a collective effort to decrease the number of people getting infected so that translates into the less number of vulnerable people getting infected as well , " said Roumeliotis .
" Now it is the critical time .
I would say the next seven to 10 days is the time where we really need to step it up to be able to decrease and flatten that curve .
"  In Ontario , there are 1,706 confirmed cases , 431 who have recovered , and 23 deaths , for a total of 2,160 .
With the shortages announced of personal protective equipment across the nation , the Winchester District Memorial Hospital is looking for donations to support frontline staff .
It is looking for procedure masks -- PG4-1204 with ear-loops , N95 masks , nitrile gloves with extended cut off and chemo isolation gowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted on Facebook calling for procedure masks with or without visors , visors and or safety glasses , hand Sanitizer " table-top 500 ml , " isolation gowns both level 2 and level 3 , Nitrile gloves ( latex free small/medium/large ) , and N95 masks ( all types ) .
Those who have the requested items can contact the hospital at **32;1767;TOOLONG .
Roumeliotis said his office was getting multiple complaints and calls about individuals who have returned from on overseas trip and are not self-isolating .
" There 's a national quarantine act now , it 's mandated by the federal government , and that means all individuals who are returning from travel outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days when they return and that means you can not go to work , you can not go to grocery stores or for a walk at all , " said Roumeliotis  He said this also applies for individuals who have symptoms , whether or not they have shown symptoms , those over 70 years old and/or have underlying medical conditions .
