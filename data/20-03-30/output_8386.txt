Pandemics arise when a virus is capable of spreading disease across a wide geographic area .
Like the spread of viruses , racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks can also be virulent , traveling like pathogens through populations .
As fears over the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) have grown , so too have documented incidents of harassment and violence against Asian Americans .
While pandemics do not discriminate based on skin color , racism does .
This weakens host resistance by taking hold of the mind and body .
Amid the coronavirus outbreak , protective face masks -- an early symbol of defense against the virus -- have also emerged as a touchstone for xenophobia , with news accounts of Asian Americans being verbally and physically assaulted for wearing them .
ADVERTISEMENT  In China , as in many parts of East Asia , face masks are common attire and often seen as a symbol of collective and personal responsibility to reduce the spread of disease .
The duality in meaning of masks as both protection against COVID-19 and efficient vectors of racism is palpable .
Fears of coronavirus have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model minorities , " who face little in the way of racial barriers to upward mobility .
Increasingly , however , psychological research has challenged this stereotype , demonstrating that Asian Americans , like other people of color , experience considerable discrimination and unfair treatment and that these experiences can have an adverse effect on both mental and physical health .
Our own research indicates that beyond overt forms of racism , subtle forms of everyday bias and discrimination are also important sources of stress for racial minorities in general and for Asian Americans in particular .
The findings from this research and related qualitative work are beginning to reveal a richly nuanced picture of Asian Americans ' experiences of racism and discrimination in everyday life .
Prominent among these racialized experiences are the pervasive , contrasting beliefs that , on the one hand , Asian Americans have " made it " in society and experience little prejudice and discrimination , and on the other hand , are perpetual foreigners and thus " aliens in their own land .
"  Racialized pandemics like Ebola , Zika , SARS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallpox in San Francisco was blamed on the local Chinatown .
It strengthened calls to stop immigration and contributed to the federal government passing the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act that banned the immigration of Chinese men to the U .
This act was not fully repealed until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 , which ended the longstanding policy of limiting immigration based on national origin .
Just as mitigating the transmission of pathogens requires a robust immune response , halting the spread of bigotry and fear necessitates mounting a vigorous community response .
This will require that we collectively , as an informed and enlightened populace , speak out against acts of discrimination and violence .
Perhaps then we will be able to build and strengthen our own immunity against racism , through solidarity .

Health experts and parks advocates have warned that recent crowding at national parks could contribute to the spread of the coronavirus , threatening the public and parks employees , and emails sent last week show growing concern among many at one of the country 's most popular parks .
An employee of the Grand Canyon 's emergency medical services ( EMS ) branch said in a March 25 email to other staff members that the park " has closure support from the Grand Canyon Superintendent , Regional Director , and NPS Director as well as the Coconino County Board of Supervisors , the Navajo Nation , Tusayan Chamber of Commerce , and the Tusayan Fire Department .
"  ADVERTISEMENT  The email , which was obtained by The Hill , also said that the park 's incident management team was continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public and that it has sent documentation to both the NPS and the Interior Department .
It said the documentation was under review and that it includes " objective data and facts regarding critical operational limitations ( i .
, public health , wastewater treatment , EMS staffing , etc .
"  The NPS declined to comment on the email 's authenticity but said in a statement that " no decision has been made by the National Park Service about the full closure of Grand Canyon National Park at this time .
"  The agency also stressed that the park " has made significant changes to operations " to implement guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) as well as state and local guidance .
" Discussions and evaluations of park conditions and operations remain ongoing , using the decision factors the NPS has been consistently applying to all operations , " the NPS said .
" Currently , the NPS is working within the guidance of the Arizona Department of Health Services and the CDC .
It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona Department of Health Services has not asked for any additional park modifications or closures .
"  As of Monday , the Grand Canyon was open to visitors , albeit with limits on access to facilities and programs .

" We are writing with extreme concern for any decision to keep the Grand Canyon National Park open in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic , " Coconino County , Ariz .
, Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Elizabeth Archuleta and Chief Health Officer Thomas Pristow wrote in a letter to Grand Canyon Acting Superintendent Mary Risser on March 27 .
" Our County Health and Human Services department is advising all residents and tourists to practice social distancing and implement appropriate public health measures to help contain and mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 .
We encourage our federal partners to model that same behavior for the public health of all in the county , " they added .
The Board of Supervisors followed up with a statement last week , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the world to come here and risk spreading COVID-19 is an unnecessary risk .
"  Among the voices calling for the closure is House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Ra ? l Grijalva ( D-Ariz .
)  " Why expose both the public and the workforce of the park to the situation of this virus ? " said Grijalva , whose committee oversees national parks .
" You 're putting their health in danger and I think it needs to be closed .
"  " We should n't play around , " he told The Hill on Monday .
" There has to be a uniform policy .
and that obviously includes the Grand Canyon .
"  Multiple other national parks have closed amid fears of spreading the virus , and experts have warned that large crowds could make the situation worse .
" People want to be able to get out and exercise and have some fresh air , but when they congregate together it poses a risk of spreading the virus , " Matthew Freeman , an associate professor of environmental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The administration , however , seemingly invited people to visit the parks by waiving fees earlier this month .
" This small step makes it a little easier for the American public to enjoy the outdoors in our incredible National Parks , " Secretary David Bernhardt of the Interior Department , which oversees the NPS , said in a statement at the time .
In Arizona , where the Grand Canyon is located , Gov .
Doug Ducey ( R ) issued an order on Monday directing state residents to stay at home until the end of April .
Meanwhile , last week , Wendy Smith-Reeve , the then-director of the state 's Division of Emergency Management , abruptly resigned , citing a disagreement with how Ducey had structured the state 's response to the pandemic .
