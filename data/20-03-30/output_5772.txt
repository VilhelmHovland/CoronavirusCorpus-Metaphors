ANALYSIS : Extra ration under PDS gives FCI breathing space  Monday , Mar 30  By Sampad Nandy and Stuti Chawla  NEW DELHI -- It is not just the poor who would be cheering the government 's announcement to distribute additional food grain for three months to tide over coronavirus lockdown .
Food Corp of India , too , would be relieved .
The nodal food grain procurement agency was staring at a storage nightmare .
Its grain stocks were at a seven-year high of 58 .
mln tn at the start of March -- enough to feed all beneficiaries under state-run welfare schemes for a year without procuring even a single grain more .
The agency 's stockpile was expected to increase even further by the end of June once wheat procurement got over , as purchases this year are likely to be quite high due to chances of bumper production .
The government 's grain stocks were expected to touch 96 .
mln tn by the Jul 1 , more than double the buffer requirement of 41 .
mln tn .
With total storage capacity at 87 .
mln tn , inclusive of storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inventory seen at about 96 mln tn , the agency was expected to run out of space to store the food grain .
Anticipating a storage crisis , the agency had floated tenders for creation of ' covered and plinth ' storage of 9 mln tn in four key wheat-procuring states to find at least a temporary solution to its storage problem .
There is now some relief for the agency on the offing , as the government has decided to offload some of the excess stock .
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week announced a relief package for poor who are hit hard by the lockdown imposed for containment of coronavirus in the country .
Among a slew of measures she announced in the 1 .
package was the government 's decision to give 5 kg of additional food grain every month to all beneficiaries of the national food security plan free of cost for the next three months .
The government currently gives 5 kg of food grain -- -rice at 3 rupees a kg and wheat at 2 rupees -- -to 813 .
mln beneficiaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more grains to them for the next three months would entail an additional outgo of 12 .
mln tn .
Even if the grain inventory reduces by about 12 mln tn , the government would still have close to 40 mln tn of excess grain , if procurement of wheat goes as planned .
Distribution of the excess grain to the poor was what FCI had been proposing anyway .
A steady increase in procurement over the last few years , coupled with limited offtake had led to piling up of grain inventories .
Concerned that the accumulated grain would start rotting , the FCI officials had last year asked the government to distribute additional 2 kg grain to all beneficiaries of the food security plan over a period of six months .
The move would have helped whittle down stocks by nearly 10 mln tn .
The finance ministry at that time had brushed off the proposal citing fiscal constraints .
It had instead asked the food ministry to look at other options to reduce inventory .
The food ministry had lowered the price at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher offtake .
It had also proposed allowing exports from the central pool , but commerce ministry had shot it down as it would have flouted norms of the World Trade Organization .
Giving away more than 12 mln tn food grain now , that too free of cost , is expected to cost the exchequer more than 400 bln rupees now .
But this is not the time for fiscal prudence .
The extra grain allocation would help millions of daily wagers who find themselves without work due to the lockdown .
The government , in fact should be open to giving away even more food grain to the poor , if needed .
After all , this is why it builds an inventory in the first place .
