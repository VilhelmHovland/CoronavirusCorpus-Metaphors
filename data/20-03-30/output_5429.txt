March 2020 will live long in the memory in investors ' minds .
The unprecedented shutdown of developed and emerging market economies to halt the spread of coronavirus has wide-ranging consequences for global financial markets .
Some of the ramifications of economy-wide shutdowns are now being seen in the incoming economic data , while there have been some very interesting developments in the valuations of several asset classes .
Reflecting the unusual time that we live in , here are three charts that caught my eye last week .
Jobless claims in the US are a measure of how many people are out of work at a given time .
Initial jobless claims represent new claimants for unemployment benefits , and last week 's data was truly frightening .
A record 3 .
million Americans applied for unemployment benefits , surpassing anything seen on record by a huge margin .
There is even some speculation that this number underrepresents the true amount of new unemployment claims , as many states in the US have reported their systems for processing claims have crashed under the weight of unprecedented volumes .
Research was also released by the Federal Reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could rise from the current 50-year low of 3 .
to 32 .
in Q2 .
Astonishing .
The Reserve Bank of Australia 's cash rate has hit the effective lower bound of 0 .
, it has embarked upon quantitative easing for the first time , and it has put in place a term funding facility for the banking system to improve the flow of credit to small and medium-sized businesses .
Additionally , the Australian Federal Government has already passed $80 billion worth of fiscal stimulus .
How did the bond market react to these measures ? It began to price in deflation .
The Australian 5-year breakeven rate fell to a record low of -0 .
and has since risen to 0 .
If the bond market is right , then this suggests that interest rates will remain at their record low for the foreseeable future .
Finally , it looks like consumers fearful of contracting coronavirus have been trying to boost their immune systems by loading up on orange juice .
Frozen concentrated orange juice ( made famous in the 1983 film Trading Places starring Eddie Murphy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March , up 18 .
Whilst there is no shortage of orange juice , people have been rushing to buy it regardless .
Longer-term , the outlook for orange juice is n't as bright , with global demand declining in recent years due to consumers shifting away from sugary drinks to healthier alternatives .
