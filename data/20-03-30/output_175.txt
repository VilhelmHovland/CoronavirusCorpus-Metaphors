' A brewing storm ' : Economic impact of COVID-19 on Sri Lanka  Over a quarter of the world 's population is currently under movement restrictions .
For the first time in recent human history , coronavirus has shattered the myth that the economy must come first .
While public health concerns , undoubtedly , should take precedence over all other considerations when dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic , it would be unwise to ignore the economic costs of the current situation .
Reviving an economy where production grinds to a halt in a hitherto unprecedented manner is not an easy task , and if not done properly , will lead to further damage .
Small economies such as Sri Lanka , in particular , whose economic backbone is made up of micro , small , and medium sized enterprises ( MSMEs ) , dependent on export revenue for foreign currency generation , and is simultaneously managing a critical debt and fiscal crisis , are going to be particularly vulnerable .
This blog provides an overview of the economic impacts of COVID-19 on the Sri Lankan economy and explores potential measures that could be taken in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture : Impending Global Recession  The economic implications of COVID-19 are unprecedented .
The most recent pandemic that spread to this extent was the Spanish Flu in 1918 .
The nature of economics currently , however , is vastly different from a century ago .
Economies are much more interlinked with each other through supply chains , migration , and vast volumes of international trade .
As a result , countries are much more vulnerable to external shocks now than ever before .
Under such circumstances , the economic implications of COVID-19 on Sri Lanka , hinge not only on the situation within the country , but also on critical markets such as the United States , Europe , and China .
It may well be that the world is yet to experience the worst of the pandemic , and the global economy will see further significant turmoil in the months to come .
Most recessions are caused by a ( i ) demand shock ( e .
post 9/11 downturn ) , ( ii ) supply shock ( e .
OPEC oil embargo in 1973 ) , or ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .
Covid-19 promises to cause all of them in one blow .
As entire populations move into lockdown , and consumer demand falls drastically , the demand shock is clear .
Some initial data suggests that global GDP may have fallen by as much as 5% during the first quarter of 2020 .
Similarly , as noted earlier , supply chains around the world have been severely disrupted , creating supply shocks .
Even as China restarts its economic activities , the situation in Europe and US will likely cause continued disruptions in the supply chain .
Finally , amidst a push by governments to pass stimulus packages , MSMEs that work on small margins and very little reserve cash are likely to face a liquidity crunch , leading to foreclosures and bankruptcy .
The US Federal Reserve has already injected US$ 500 billion into the repo market , which suggests that there are concerns regarding an impending financial shock .
As such , an imminent global recession is inevitable .
High Risk of Unemployment in the Sri Lankan Export Sector  A global recession is likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lead to considerable job losses .
During the Great Recession from 2008 to 2010 , an estimated 90,000 Sri Lankans lost their jobs due to downsizing amongst manufacturing firms , especially in the apparel sector .
Sri Lanka is also susceptible to delays in accessing raw materials for manufacturing from China .
Moreover China 's economic slowdown could severely inhibit a major source of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to the economy .
In fact , in a recent research paper by the Overseas Development Institute ( ODI ) , Sri Lanka was identified as one of the most vulnerable middle-income countries due to the impacts of COVID-19 and a resulting Chinese economic slowdown .
In more bad news , the current crisis will gravely affect the tourism sector .
In January and February alone , tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka fell by 6 .
and 17 .
respectively , compared to 2019 .
The closing of the Sri Lankan border for foreign passenger arrivals in mid-March , combined with global travel restrictions , will undoubtedly lead to further losses .
Combined with the loss of revenue last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel will lead to further job losses both in the formal tourism sector as well as ancillary informal services .
Moreover , unlike the Great Recession and other recent external shocks , both developing and developed countries are likely to face significant economic downturns during the pandemic .
Therefore , given the scale and cross-sectoral nature of the crisis , its economic impact is assumed to be greater than during the 2008 financial crisis .
Even more worryingly , unlike in 2009 , there does not appear to be a coordinated global response to minimise the effects of a global recession .
Social Distancing , Curfews , and the Domestic Economy  Meanwhile , enforcing the necessary social distancing measures , and subsequently , curfews have effectively stalled the local economy .
Whilst some economic activities that can be carried out remotely continue , particularly in the services sector , manufacturing and retail services have effectively come to a standstill .
Moreover , even though the government has allowed agricultural production to continue unhindered , uncertainties surrounding temporary lifting of curfew hours and means of distributing essential goods to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and storage of perishable agricultural goods .
Whilst many will feel the economic hardships , the exact short-term impact is difficult to estimate just yet .
Daily wage earners and MSMEs , including those in the informal sector , are going to be disproportionately affected during the current crisis .
MSMEs account for 52% of total GDP and 45% of national employment .
Meanwhile , nearly a half of the population is employed in the non-agricultural informal sector .
Therefore , the absence of any meaningful economic activity for an entire month , and possibly longer , will severely affect the wellbeing of those involved .
Since many MSMEs operate on thin margins and low levels of reserve savings , a prolonged lockdown without adequate support would lead to unemployment and foreclosures , with few surviving until the resumption of economic activities .
Policy Solutions Unlike Any Other  As noted earlier , the public health considerations and the economic stakes of the current situation are unprecedented .
Therefore , the government should be open to unique policy solutions to address a unique crisis .
Thus far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the public with an emphasis on low-income households .
During the past week alone , the Central Bank has announced additional liquidity measures and downward adjustments to policy interest rates , the government has issued debt moratoriums for SMEs in identified vulnerable sectors such as tourism and construction , debt moratoriums to the self-employed , relief on personal loans and credit card payments , and reduced the prices of some essential goods , to name a few .
Further measures may be introduced .
The government has also requested debt-relief , in the form of suspending debt repayments for a time period , from its lenders in an effort to gain greater flexibility to address the current crisis .
These measures have created some breathing space by easing up an element of financial constraints for firms and workers , and crucially injecting a measure of liquidity into the economy .
That said , these measures do not necessarily create a swift cash flow into the hands of vulnerable groups such as daily wage earners and most MSMEs , especially those in the informal sector .
Therefore , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to policies such as price reductions , since the continuation of curfew or a lockdown would severely constrain disposable income amongst these groups and heighten difficulties in accessing basic essentials .
The broader challenge for the government , however , will be to design an effective fiscal response that allows businesses to sustain themselves through this period and minimise job losses , whilst simultaneously managing a constrained fiscal landscape .
The high level of government expenditure required for such stimulus packages , alongside an approximately Rs .
650 billion revenue loss due to tax cuts introduced following the Presidential election last year , as well as delays in revenue collection during this crisis will all create a significant fiscal burden .
An economic relief package may not help all small businesses , but will at least reduce the potential for a cascade of small business defaults , high rates of unemployment , and a resulting domestic financial crisis .
Importantly , this situation has to be managed as a public health crisis .
Countries should be careful not to move too fast in trying to ease restrictions on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood of the virus spreading again .
China is currently attempting to approach this delicate balance , but Sri Lanka is not close to that point yet .
Failure to contain the possibility of community spread before easing restrictions will only lead to a catastrophic burden on the national health system and will inevitably lead to greater economic losses .
This is unchartered territory for all , and uncertainty regarding the pandemic as well as global and domestic economic effects will pervade all policies made at least during the next six months .
However , it is in Sri Lanka 's best interests to prepare for the future and enact proactive policy measures to mitigate potential economic costs as much as possible .
