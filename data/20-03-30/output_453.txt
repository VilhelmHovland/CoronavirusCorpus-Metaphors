Norah Martone packages an order for curbside pickup at Rosemont Market &amp; Bakery in Portland 's West End .
Derek Davis/Staff Photographer  Marie Beckim has been working at the Cumberland Farms store in Bath for eight years .
She 's the breadwinner for her family , which includes a son in middle school and another in high school , and she puts in 40-hour weeks .
In recent days she has seen customers squabble over milk , toilet paper and baby wipes .
She worries that , instead of coming together as a community , the social fabric is tearing apart .
She also worries about the health of her customers , and of her family , in the age of coronavirus .
On Friday she heard that one of her regulars , an older fellow who came in multiple times a day to purchase scratch lottery tickets , tested positive for the virus and is now hospitalized .
" I see hundreds of people a day , and I 'm not protected at all , " she said .
" I have two kids at home , so it is really scary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work .
I have no choice .
I 'm the sole provider .
"  Beckim 's situation is one shared by many grocery clerks , convenience store cashiers and others in the retail industry who regularly deal with a public that has been advised to stay at home and practice social distancing .
The hope is to curtail the spread of coronavirus so that the health care system does not become overwhelmed with patients .
Since the outbreak , Beckim , 44 , said she is doing more cleaning and sanitizing at the store , following a checklist provided by the home office that she repeats every two hours using a disinfectant that includes bleach .
" We literally have to bleach anything that anybody touches , " she said .
" It 's a lot , but we do it because I do n't want to get sick and I 'd hate for somebody to come in and get sick from here .

Customers are buying entire cartons rather than one pack of cigarettes .
The coffee remains fresh , and Cumby 's has kept its regular hours , but traffic has lessened .
" I think people are starting to realize this is serious , " Beckim said .
" It has slowed right down .
"  A few miles south at Waldo 's General Store in Falmouth , Cindy Little said the deli area of the store has closed , but gas and convenience items are available .
She wears gloves , as has always been the case when handling food items .
" I feel OK about coming to work , " said Little , who celebrated her 60th birthday Friday .
" I 'm not saying I 'm not scared , but we 've been protecting ourselves .

Minnesota , Vermont and Michigan have recently reclassified grocery store workers as essential emergency workers , affording some benefits , in particular child care , similar to those offered health care providers and first responders .
Operations at the Rosemont Market &amp; Bakery in Portland 's West End changed quickly last week .
On Tuesday there was a limit of five customers inside the store at a time .
By Wednesday only curbside pickup was allowed , with employees filling orders taken over the phone or online and handing off the groceries outside the shop .
" The transition was a little weird , but we pretty much have it down to a science now , " said Luke Smith , 27 , the store 's assistant manager .

Derek Davis/Staff Photographer  Smith 's wife has a compromised immune system , so he was particularly attuned to precautions involving the novel coronavirus .
Cleaning , sanitizing and hand-washing all became even higher priorities than normal .
On Sunday at the large Market Basket in Biddeford , 16-year-olds Sarah Shaw of Sanford and Avery Cadorette of Biddeford were at the store 's entrance cleaning the handrails before switching to checking out customers .
Shaw said she was " not that worried " about her own health but has started wearing gloves while working .
Inside the spacious store , the crowd of customers was slightly smaller than on an average Sunday , said a clerk in the meat department .
He was stacking chicken breasts below a sign that told customers only two packages of poultry could be purchased per transaction .
Similar signs were posted around the store .
While the dairy and produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common items liked pasta , ground turkey , frozen vegetables , and Tylenol ranged from skimpy to sold out .
Cadorette said the most difficult thing for her is when she has to enforce the purchase limits , noting it 's hard to tell customers they ca n't buy a fifth can of soup or a third small-sized container of liquid hand soap .
Oakley Garlow , 28 , of Biddeford has worked at the Biddeford Market Basket since it opened in 2013 and is now a front-end manager .
" Every day we 're cleaning constantly and making sure we have the disinfectant , " Garlow said .
" We take measures .
We have gloves for people .
We practice that .
And companywide we do not have any cases .
"  Customers at the store were subdued and purposeful on Sunday .
Garlow said he believes most understand that not every item will be available .
" We 're here to serve for you , " Garlow said .
" We 're doing the best that we can do .

"  Meanwhile in Wells , Abby Hanson , 19 , is back home because her first-year classes at Central Maine Community College have transitioned to online .
An education major who hopes to one day teach English in high school , she works as a cashier at the local Super IGA Food Market and is constantly spritzing her hands with sanitizer .
" I frequently get people who are afraid to touch surfaces , especially the ( credit ) card machine and the belt where people put their items down , " she said .
" I probably sanitize it every five minutes .
"  She said she tries to take precautions herself , and even finds herself retreating to her boss 's office if she feels a sneeze coming on .
" I am young , so I 'm not too worried about it , " she said .
" But I keep up with the news .
