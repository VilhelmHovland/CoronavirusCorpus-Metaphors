Animals at the LA Zoo are Missing Human Visitors  LOS ANGELES -- The closure of public spaces , due to the coronavirus pandemic , has led to interesting times at the Los Angeles Zoo .
While zoo employees continue to report to work and care for the animals , they 're noticing some unique behaviors .
" It 's been very interesting to see the behavior of the animals .
Animals that do n't usually pay much attention to the crowds , all of the sudden , if you 're in a public space , they 'll come up to the fence and look at you .
And sometimes even vocalize , " said Beth Schaefer , Director of Animal Programs at the Los Angeles Zoo .
Zoo staff is also taking preventative measures with animals that could possibly be susceptible to COVID-19 , such as great apes .
" Because they 're so closely related to us , we 're not interacting with them closer than 6 feet , " said Schaefer .
" So we have implemented basically the same social distancing that we do with humans .
