So far four people have been convicted under Operation Stovewood , with a further 24 suspects charged and 68 interviewed under caution .
The investigation has recorded 648 grooming crimes over a 16-year period .
In Rochdale , Greater Manchester , 19 British-Pakistani men have been convicted after 47 girls were found to be victims of sex abuse , and last year it emerged up to 1,000 children could be victims of a huge sex ring in Telford - seven men were convicted over the abuse in 2013 .
In 2018 a group of 20 British Asian men from a grooming gang were convicted of more than 120 offences against 15 girls in Huddersfield .
After a series of convictions of Asian men , Mohammed Shafiq , chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation , previously warned the Pakistani community of the dangers of " burying their heads in the sand " on the matter of sexual grooming .
The carer , from Croydon , added : " But they know what their husbands are doing , they know what their brothers are doing , they know what their family members are doing .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Bobby has urged them , and victims , to speak out to stop abuse from taking place and bring abusers to justice .
She added : " They should be thinking ' do you know what , if they can do that to these little girls , they could do that to our daughter ' .
But they wo n't think like that , because they 've brainwashed them .
" It grooming seems to be a problem there within the Asian community .
" I really want to go round to areas like that , I 've contacted a couple of Asian resources down there but they are just like , they seem very scared .
I 'd want to go there to talk .
" At the end of the day , they live here .
These people who live here and have indefinite leave to remain , they have a duty of care .
They are scared of them , they have a life here - the majority of them are from Pakistan , they 'll say ' we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been accepted as members of this community and of this country , and is this how you repay them , by grooming the children of England ?  " It 's their mentality , the Asian mentality - and that will never ever change -- which is to keep quiet , which is if you know ' whatever is heard or said in this house stays in this house , gets brushed under the carpet - you shut the door and forget about it ' , that 's it .
"  Due to this Bobby said it took her years to admit to her family the real reason why she ran away more than 30 years ago .
She had been groomed and abused by Sayeed Shah as a child , when he was in his 20s .
He became close with her family when they moved to Shirley , as one of few other Asian families in the area .
Shah showered the young Bobby with gifts and sweets - she had an entire glass case full of Care Bears from him - before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  She suspects some of his family thought his close relationship with her was strange , but her parents had no idea why he engineered to spend so much time with her until she confessed a few years ago .
After bravely deciding to speak out , her case against Shah went to the Old Bailey , where he was sentenced on August 13 , 2018 , to 12 years behind bars .
She said : " I get very angry because the people that say that ' let 's leave it , let 's not say anything about it , whatever , my mum 's not got to live with it ' -- I have .
" I have lived with it for so long , and I have to live with it .
" Because of this , I have got mental health issues because of what he did to me - I can not be normal .
" I suffer from panic attacks , I am on long term medication , I ca n't sleep at night .
" Our parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it they are not going to be here forever .

"  ' PROFOUND ABUSE ' IN MANCHESTER  Police investigating child sex exploitation in Manchester knew children were suffering " the most profound abuse .
but did not protect them " , a damning report has found today .
The review , launched after a child 's death in 2003 , found at least 97 " predominantly Asian men " were suspected of offences , but " very few " were brought to justice .
It was prompted by the death of Victoria , 15 , a girl under the care of Manchester City Council , who reported being raped and injected with heroin by a 50-year-old Asian man .
She died of a drugs overdose two months later on September 29 , 2003 .
The police operation identified at least 57 victims and 97 potential suspects , some involved with Victoria , and a " compelling picture of the systemic exploitation of looked after children in the care system " was established by detectives .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under-resource the investigation and a decision was then made to close it down in April 2005 .
The report looked at a " sample " of cases from the time , detailing a series of allegations of rape and sexual abuse made by girls that were not followed up and with no further action taken by GMP or the council .
As a result , " very few of the relevant perpetrators were brought to justice and neither were their activities disrupted " .
This was despite " clear evidence " teenage girls , aged 12 to 16 , were being sexually abused " generally perpetrated by a group of older Asian men " including the police having their names , where they lived or worked and the flats above take-away shops where the abuse took place .
It included plying girls with drugs and alcohol , physical abuse , rape and being forced to have sex with multiple men at " sex parties .
