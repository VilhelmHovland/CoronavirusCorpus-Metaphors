Now , more than ever , you need to be vigilant about the news you are sending around .
It 's not simply good enough to send something , be called out for spreading misinformation , and then say ' oh , it was sent to me by XYZ , sorry ' .
Worse still , I see people sharing misinformation on social media , being called out on it , and not deleting the post with the misinformation .
Before you forward something on via WhatsApp , or post to social media -- I can not believe I have to say this -- use Google , and use common sense , and think carefully about whether or not you 're actually helping the current situation .
A good case in point is the recent WhatsApp voicenote that did the rounds this past weekend ( and is still doing the rounds ) , purporting to be from Dr Diana Hardie , a top expert at Groote Schuur Hospital .
The nearly 16-minute long voicenote ( already a crime , because there is no need to send 16-minute long voicenotes ) was sent around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice note from Diana Hardie the Head of Virology , Grooteschuur Hospital , Cape Town .
It 's her latest data on the Corona Virus and what she is preparing for .
it 's does n't predict a pretty short term future .
( sic ) "  OK , but just the one problem -- this was not from Hardie , who confirmed this with Health24 , saying she " would like to put on record that this voicenote was not from me or any other virologist at Groote Schuur Hospital " .
At first , the original source of the voicenote was a mystery but has since been confirmed to be a message from a concerned young doctor , sent to her mother , that was not meant to be shared .
Health24 can confirm that the recording was not meant to be circulated , but was meant for the mother of the person who recorded it , only .
On the voicenote , the person speaking refers often to Professor Zilla , which Health24 further established was Professor Peter Zilla , head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery .
After reaching out to Professor Zilla , he confirmed that the voicenote was not intended to be shared .
" This was a private message of a young doctor to her mother to scare her into staying home , as she falls into a high-risk group , " Professor Zilla told Health24 .
It was never meant to end up as an objective truth on social media , he said .
This was either a case of broken telephone , with the voicenote being shared and the misinformation being unwittingly added at some stage along the chain , or it was a malicious intent to sow panic and fear .
At the same time , the voicenote was not a complete hoax , recorded by somebody with the intent to spread fake news and misinformation , because it was actually a young doctor sending a genuine message to her mother .
Voicenote -- genuine .
Added information about it being from Dr Diana Hardie , a top expert at Groote Schuur Hospital -- fake news .
However this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everyone should exercise extreme caution at present , before sending this sort of thing around .
Remember .
The government has warned of repercussions for people who create and spread fake news .
On the government 's website , it clearly says : " Anyone that creates or spreads fake news about the coronavirus Covid-19 is liable for prosecution .
Verify the information before you share information .
"  For legal reasons , and also because you do n't want to be the person that sows undue panic at a time when so many are already fearful of what the future holds .
