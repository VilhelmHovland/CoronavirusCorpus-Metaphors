I attended my first virtual funeral over the weekend .
I hope it 's my last  The coronavirus has changed life and death , making the aftermath all the more difficult  On Saturday , from the comfort of my couch , I live-streamed a funeral on my iPad .
A bizarre , unconventional and utterly heartbreaking scenario , but one many of us will find ourselves in over the coming weeks .
With the coronavirus changing every aspect of our lives , it 's not surprising that is has altered the way in which we grieve .
The wake , so wonderfully Irish in its movement , is no longer a possibility .
The very idea of a long line of mourners touching the hands of others is past the point of apprehension .

Human nature  Sometimes it feels like the Irish people have a fond affiliation with death .
It could just be human nature but we are attracted to it in ways other countries and cultures are n't .
We like to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be why we also honour the dead in ways others ca n't .
Our funerals are as much of a celebration as they are a farewell .
We laud every inch of the person .
We revere in the good , the bad and the ugly .
We sing songs .
We laugh .
We cry .
We touch .
We come together as a community to rally behind those left in the lurch .
With the current circumstances , this togetherness is lost and I ca n't fathom the difficulties families now face .
The funeral was for a family friend , someone particularly close to my father , and as I watched both him and my mother watch the proceedings through the lens of technology I did n't know how to feel .
I am not religious but it did n't feel right .
The internet and everything that comes with it has been such an integral part of my existence .
I can say without doubt that I ca n't imagine modern life without this technology but this was new territory I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churches across the world are now streaming services for churchgoers and this is a particularly vital development for the elderly .
For those who believe , it provides them solace and affirmation at a time when it is hard to find it in this world .
However , on Saturday , the virtual world and the one that holds real-life blended , and all I felt was melancholy .
A pane of glass with a computer chip separated them from us .
How weird it is to sit at a funeral service with the remains of the morning 's breakfast laying beside you .
While both my parents agreed it was lovely to see and to be a part of it , the loss of connection was clear ; it did n't feel right .
It unsettled them .
Nothing would compare to being there to lend the gentle hand of support , an act so small that says so much .
A warning  The stories are filtering through of families who could not be with their loved ones as the curtain of life began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters , and brothers unable to touch their most adored as they drew their last breath are hard to hear .
Yesterday , Emily Glynn Homan from Dublin spoke of how she could not kiss or hug her father goodbye as he succumbed to coronavirus .
Speaking to RT ? she said : " My brothers all said goodbye through FaceTime .
My mother wanted to get into the bed beside my dad to lie with him in his final moments , but that was n't allowed .
"  Then there was the story of Tom Best , who could not say goodbye or attend the funeral of his wife of 51 years , Anne , who was the first person to die of the virus on the island of Ireland .
Mr Best had been advised to self-isolate and so could not say goodbye to his soulmate .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic , atheist , spiritual or not , death binds us .
It is an unavoidable end but is now made all the more difficult to process .
The finality is absent and so much is left unfinished .
The aftermath is sacred for families and I ca n't imagine how cold the passage now feels .
Both Emily and Tom shared their story as a warning .
Stay indoors and listen to the advice , so that more families can be spared from the pain .
The quicker this ends , the sooner these people are given the send-off they deserve .
And the people left behind are allowed to mourn , to celebrate , to laugh , to cry and to say goodbye .
In the way that only we can .
