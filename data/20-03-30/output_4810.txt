SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY  Thanks for signing up !  The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on the livelihoods of thousands of people across Australia .
Hospitality workers , retail staff , musicians and live performers are among the hardest hit , but a group that is often forgotten is the sex work industry .
With lockdown measures providing obvious hurdles for face-to-face sex work , scores of industry professionals are turning to online-based subscription services like OnlyFans to supplement their income .
PEDESTRIAN .
spoke to sex worker Molly Blush* , who detailed her experience of how the spread of COVID-19 has impacted her job , and how we can support sex workers during this trying time ( even if you 're not interested in purchasing their services yourself ) .
Prior to the pandemic , Molly told us that the majority of her income came from face-to-face services .
However , self-isolation has forced her to adapt in recent weeks ; employing online services and other more resourceful means ( " selling webcam chats by the minute as well as items such as polaroids , toys and panties , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people who are self-employed , Molly 's income largely depends on her " effort and activity , " but she asserts that the key to the business is actually consistency .
" When I first started offering online services about three years ago , my private snapchat crashed and burned because my clients expected daily and consistent content and I simply was n't providing that , " Molly stated .
" OnlyFans has a queue option these days which helps but I still find myself accidentally not posting for sometimes three days at a time .
" " This always reflects in my income , as does my social media engagement .
Being active is good for the algorithms so consistent posting means consistent subscriptions , and consistently posting on OnlyFans means they 're more likely to resubscribe , buy private content , tip me or request a custom video .
"  But if it was n't already hard enough to find work when face-to-face clients are out of the question , Molly and others are now constantly faced with people either mocking their profession , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having supported sex work previously .
When asked how she felt about people jumping in on the industry amid the coronavirus-fuelled unemployment crisis , Molly categorised it in two groups .
Those who are making a joke of the industry , and those who are serious .
" I have no qualms with an ally joining us , " Molly said , " but to see people who have never shown support , or people who have made whore-phobic jokes and comments sharing their OnlyFans link , I 'm just disappointed .
The industry flood is hurting us right now and half the people joining are cutting grass they never considered watering .
"  Many people seem to think sex work , particularly selling nudes , is an easy way to make a quick buck .
But to those people , Molly offers a simple , yet effective response : " Good luck .
"  Molly also stated that one of the most overlooked aspects of sex work was , in fact , the amount of admin work that professionals have to put in .
Effectively acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " keep an eye on the strength of the AUD , I have diaries to keep track of my posts and growth , I do all my own taxes , I have to keep my safety and privacy a high priority while still giving my clientele what they want in an industry that is forever more saturated and always demanding more .
"  As part of her non-camera work , Molly said " I write scripts and edit videos , I network with photographers , porn stars , content creators and more .
I have such a workload that I often outsource some of my work ( mainly editing which is emotionally tolling for me ) to trusted friends and colleagues .
"  Despite the hard work , Molly asserts that sex work has been " hands down , without a doubt , the most empowering experience of my life .
"  " It has taught me a love and respect for myself and other women that is unmatchable .
It has enabled me to leave domestically violent situations and has given me the resources to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Even still , the mental health aspect of the job is a difficult one to reconcile , particularly for those viewing the industry from the outside .
" I think the hardest thing for anyone to grasp , even myself , is that I can be empowered and sexy and confident and all that while still feeling like dog shit , " Molly said .
" I wake up some days and do n't even wan na look in the mirror due to my mental health but I somehow need to spend 3 hours editing a video of myself completely naked and exposed ? That shit is very difficult .
"  If you are genuinely considering entering the industry , we asked Molly has two crucial pieces of advice , ones that she wished she 'd heard when she started .
The first is the stark warning that " There is no way to ensure your privacy .
"  " If you do n't want a video of you fucking your own bum to be leaked , " she warned , " never sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The second , much more uplifting piece of advice Molly has is to foster your community , particularly online .
" Engaging with other sex workers helps you ! " she stated .
" Share their posts , build relationships , collaborate , help each other out ! Call it karma or call it an algorithm , there is no money in solitude , only in solidarity .

Alternatively , Molly encourages people to engage with sex workers on social media , and ( respectfully ) take part in their Q&amp;A 's to educate yourself on the industry .
We 're going to be socially distancing for the foreseeable future , so why not take this time to educate yourself on the sex work industry ? If women like Molly are feeling empowered by their career choice , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
