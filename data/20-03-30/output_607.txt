In the last week , Hunterdon Central High School has donated 1,600 surgical masks and 45 boxes of gloves to Hunterdon Medical Center .
The surgical masks came from a supply that was designed to be used in the event of a large-scale illness on campus at Hunterdon Central .
With school closures , the masks were not needed by the Hunterdon County school .
The gloves were surplus supplies from the district 's health offices .
The donation adds to an statewide effort to get much-needed supplies to medical facilities .
