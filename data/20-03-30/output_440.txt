" Our current models suggest we are likely several weeks away from a peak in the number of cases here in Michigan , " Khaldun said .
" The goal of our response has been to slow the spread of the disease as much as possible , particularly so we protect our most vulnerable and so that we do not overwhelm our hospitals .
Unfortunately , we know that several of our hospitals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
"  Whitmer signed an executive order Sunday to relax medical practice laws in an effort to bring more health care workers into the fight against the coronavirus .
It temporarily suspends provisions in the state 's Public Health Code to give qualified health care professionals more flexibility in treating COVID-19 patients and supporting doctors , at the discretion of health care facilities where they work .
The governor said her order gives hospitals more flexibility in managing physician assistants , nurses and other health care providers to address a growing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Michigan .
At a Monday press conference , Whitmer made an appeal for retired doctors and former health care practitioners to " consider coming back and helping out .
" The state launched a website to assemble health care volunteers at **25;2290;TOOLONG .
" We expect a great need for additional medical support in the coming days , " Whitmer said .
" Please .

"  Khaldun said " there 's no question " that there is a shortage of medical professionals in Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest risk patients .
" We are aggressively loosening the scope of practice laws , calling for volunteers and also are going to be looking across the state for medical professionals working in areas where they might not be as hard hit right now to perhaps volunteer , " Khaldun said .
Khaldun said hospitals are expanding their capacity as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases rises each day .
There were 5,486 confirmed cases of the infectious respiratory illness and 132 deaths as of Sunday .
The state is still in need of medical equipment , including ventilators and personal protective gear for health care workers , Whitmer said .
Michigan received a shipment of supplies from the Strategic National Stockpile last weekend , but the governor said it wo n't last long .
Michigan received 112,000 N95 masks from the national stockpile , with another 8,000 on the way , Whitmer said .
However , she said one Detroit-area hospital can go through 10,000 masks in just one day .
Private businesses have assisted the state in accumulating medical supplies as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 million masks , nearly 9 million ounces of hand sanitizer , 255,000 boxes of gloves , 2 .
million gowns , more than 2000 beds 210,000 testing kits , 3,000 thermometers 185,000 face shields 22,000 cartons of disinfecting wipes and other supplies .
There 's also a large need for ventilators , Khaldun said .
The large and costly machines help critically ill patients who ca n't breathe on their own by pumping air directly into their lungs .
Khaldun said an additional 5,000 to 10,000 ventilators will be needed in the coming weeks .
The state has around 1,700 right now , she said .
Michigan hospitals have begun to develop emergency policies that would be implemented in case of shortages .
A policy at Henry Ford Health System states " patients who have the best chance of getting better " will be first in line to access the breathing equipment .
" We know we 're on the upslope right now of cases , we know our hospitals are going to need more beds , " Khaldun said .
" We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to get sick .
"  FEMA is establishing a temporary care center at TCF Center in Detroit .
Khaldun said patients who are not critically ill will be served at that facility , and other alternative treatment sites are being worked on .
Whitmer said she sent a letter to U .
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper requesting a federal directive to build temporary hospitals with the help of the U .
Army Corps of Engineers .
People who are n't medical professionals can also use the state 's volunteer page to find places to donate blood and supplies in their local community .
" Michigan needs you , " the website states .
Whitmer 's order allows medical students , physical therapists , and emergency technicians to work under the supervision of doctors as " respiratory therapist extenders " operating ventilators and performing other tasks .
It also maintains several types of medical certifications that were set to expire throughout the emergency .
The order also reinforces an existing law that protects hospitals and health-care workers from liability for taking necessary steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated health care professionals continue putting their lives on the line every day during this unprecedented crisis , and we must do everything we can to empower them to do their jobs , " Whitmer said .
