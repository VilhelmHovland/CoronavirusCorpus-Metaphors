Johnson is the first world leader to announce he is sick with Covid-19 , the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
But other administrations also seem to face similar questions .
Hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed on Friday , 27 March , he had the coronavirus , his health minister said he did too , and England 's chief medical officer announced he also had symptoms .
It is n't a huge surprise .
More number of officials testing positive  There can be no way to know if they infected each other or caught the illness from another person , or different people .
But the three men had met a handful of times in person over the previous 10 days , according to Johnson 's official diary , to formulate Britain 's response to the outbreak .
On Tuesday of last week , when most ministers video-conferenced into a cabinet meeting , Health Secretary Matt Hancock and chief medical officer Chris Whitty sat in the room with Johnson .
Whitty had also stood alongside the prime minister at three of the 11 news conferences on the coronavirus since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many at Downing Street and beyond is : how many other people did the UK prime minister come into contact with before testing positive ?  Asked about whether those who became ill believed they had done so from meeting Johnson , a government source noted that scientists say it takes around five days from transmission to developing symptoms so people who became ill at the same time " almost certainly " did not give it to one another .
boris johnson  British PM : First world leader with COVID-19  Johnson is the first world leader to announce he is sick with COVID-19 , the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus .
But other administrations have faced similar questions .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and U .
President Donald Trump say they have tested negative for coronavirus , while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went into self-isolation earlier this month after his wife tested positive .
Michel Barnier , the European Union 's chief Brexit negotiator , has tested positive , as have several members of the U .

Johnson 's spokesman , asked repeatedly about the prime minister 's contacts with other people , told reporters on Friday the prime minister had not been in close proximity with anyone " from the moment he had symptoms " .
According to Johnson 's statement , that would mean Thursday of last week .
And according to his public agenda , Johnson had scaled back in-person meetings , in accordance with the UK 's wider lockdown rules , from Monday March 23 .
Face-to-face meetings  Yet scientists say the virus ' incubation period is estimated at between one and 14 days , and there have been anecdotal accounts of people spreading the disease without having symptoms .
And despite the scaling back , Johnson still met Whitty in person or via videolink at least eight times in the last two weeks and Hancock around nine , according to his diary , to plot Britain 's response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other staff , according to two sources close to the prime minister .
One Downing Street source said that 75 of the 200 staff who usually work at Number 10 -- an approximately 100-room town house - -- are still working there in separate rather than overlapping shifts to reduce the risk of infection .
Johnson also had regular in-person news conferences with journalists at Downing Street until March 24 , when he switched to ones where the journalists attended by video link .
Some journalists who attended the in-person conferences have said via social media or have told colleagues that they are now self-isolating .
The PM 's live video  " Here in Number 10 we have been observing the advice .
we have wherever possible been using video conferencing , you 'll have seen the prime minister ensuring he is a safe distance from colleagues when he is taking part in press conferences , " Johnson 's spokesman said on Friday .
The prime minister also ventured beyond Downing Street last week .
On Wednesday , a day before his positive test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Commons chamber .
In the live video , Johnson is seen speaking with several lawmakers .
Minister for Scotland Alister Jack , who sat next to Johnson before the session , said on Saturday he had developed a temperature and a cough and was now working from home in isolation .
Asked whether Jack believed suggestions he may have become ill in parliament that day , the Office of the Secretary of State for Scotland declined to comment , saying it had nothing to add to Saturday 's statement .
Distancing  At first , Britain 's response to the spread of the virus was not as stringent as in other countries .
It was only at the beginning of the week from March 16 that the UK position began changing -- and Johnson 's rhythm too .
In addition to more video-conferences , audiences with Queen Elizabeth -- usually held weekly -- have been held by telephone for the last two weeks , according to Johnson 's spokesman .

On Friday , just five hours after Johnson said he had tested positive for coronavirus , Whitty wrote on Twitter that " after experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 last night .
I will be self-isolating at home for the next seven days " .
He said he would continue to advise the government .
Officials testing COVID-19 positive  The same day , Hancock said he had also tested positive and was self-isolating at home with mild symptoms .
He has since been active on Twitter , but has not commented on his condition .
The health ministry said on Sunday it could offer no update on the conditions of Hancock or Whitty .
Apart from Hancock and Whitty , the other person who has spent the most time working on the British government 's response is the government 's chief scientific adviser , Patrick Vallance .
Whitty , Johnson and Vallance were seen so often at news conferences together in the second and third weeks of March that they were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy with Steve Martin .
After Johnson made his announcement , Vallance tweeted that he had no symptoms .
Vallance could not be reached for comment .
