India Ratings and Research ( Ind-Ra ) has revised its FY20-21 gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth of India down to 3 .
from 5 .
The key reasons are : the spread of COVID-19 and the resultant nation-wide lock-down imposed till 14 April 2020 , crippling most economic and commercial activities .
The revision is based on the assumption of lockdown continuing till end-April 2020 ( full or partial ) and gradual restoration of economic activities May 2020 onwards , the ratings agency says .
To minimise the adverse impact of COVID-19 and the lockdown , both , Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , have announced several measures .
The government has so far announced measures which are focussed on easing business-related processes and compliance and a package for the vulnerable sections of the society .
Similarly , the banking regulator has responded to the evolving situation in two tranches .
In the first one , it has announced measures to avert any immediate disruption in the financial system through a liquidity infusion ; and , in the second one , it has eased the regulatory and supervision related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system .
Ind-Ra says it expects the government to announce more measures in the coming days or weeks to mitigate the pains and concerns of the other segments and sectors of the society as well as the economy , since the role of the government is crucial in terms of containing the spread of COVID-19 and simultaneously mitigating the adverse impact of the lockdown on the economy .
Although there is limited available fiscal space , Ind-Ra says it believes this extraordinary situation demands extraordinary measures .
In view of the lockdown , the ratings agency says it has even revised the FY19-20 GDP forecast down to 4 .
from the National Statistical Office 's advance estimate of 5 .
" Ind-Ra expects the GDP growth to come in at 3 .
in fourth quarter ( 4Q ) of FY2020 and 2 .
in 1QFY2021 .
Average growth is forecasted to decelerate to 2 .
in first half ( 1H ) of FY2021 against 5 .
in 1HFY2020 and recover to 4 .
in second half ( 2H ) FY2021 compared with 4 .
in 2HFY2020due to the base effect and a gradual recovery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the ratings agency , some of the initial and visible impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the India economy has been the disruption in the production of select manufacturing sectors due to the breakdown of supply chain , near collapse of the tourism , hospitality and aviation sectors and a rise in the work load of the healthcare sector .
Also , micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSME ) , irrespective of the sector they operate in , have begun to witness cash-flow disruptions .
This is not to say that other sectors were not impacted or are not likely to be impacted .
However , Ind-Ra says , some the services sectors , such as financial services , IT and IT-enabled services have greater flexibility in their operations and they quickly readjusted and/or are readjusting their operations by allowing employees to work from home .
" Yet , the panic has gripped the Indian capital markets like elsewhere in the world .
A changed outlook of investors has led to a huge outflow of capital and the rupee has come under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consumption levels , " Ind-Ra says .
With the rabi crop maturing , disruption in harvesting and inability of agricultural markets to timely procure them could be a blow to the farmers ' income and rural demand , the ratings agency says , adding , " A stop on the construction activities will accelerate the problems of the real estate sector which is still struggling to access funding in the middle of a meltdown in the NBFC and banking sectors .
"  After agriculture , construction is the largest employment generator in the Indian economy .
Ind-Ra says , closure of non-essential commercial establishment and multiplexes will have a ripple effect on many sectors and demand for consumer durables , entertainment , sports , wholesale trade , transport , tourism , and hospitality will decline .
It is often said that every crisis also brings in new opportunities and some advantages .
Indeed , the spread of COVID-19 has also done so .
" First , several manufacturing activities will de-risk their operations by locating themselves outside China .
Also , the disruption in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electronics and chemical products could be an incentive for Indian manufacturing sector to become part of the supply chain , " the ratings agency says .
Ind-Ra says it believes this will require significant government and policy support and will play out only in the medium- to long-term .
It says , " One of the near-term advantages of the spread of COVID-19 for the Indian economy would be lower global commodity prices especially crude oil .
However , to what extent this could benefit the Indian economy would depend on the pace of restoration of normalcy and the ability and nimbleness of the Indian businesses to take advantage of this opportunity .
However , converting this advantage to an opportunity would not easy , because the Indian economy is reeling under low consumption and low investment growth , coupled with rupture in the financial system .
"  Global monetary easing is now in full swing with the lead being taken by the US Federal Reserve .
Thus the US Fed has cut policy rates to the zero bound , launched a new asset purchase program of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undertaken other measures to facilitate credit flow including cutting reserve requirements and announce a primary dealer credit facility .
Other central banks have acted as well , both in provisioning of liquidity as well as in reducing policy rates .
The US administration is talking of a substantial $850 billion stimulus package with the intent to deliver this fairly quickly .
In the new developing scenario post the virus outbreak many forecasters are now beginning to build in more than a 50% shave-off of 2020 world growth .
The sequence of spread of the virus , and the consequent implementation of lock-down measures , will also dictate the timing of the worst economic impact on various geographies .
Thus while China may have seen the worst effect in Q1 of the calendar year , for a large part of the developed world this may happen over Q2 .
Why monetary easing is needed  Massive monetary easing and a world financial system again awash with liquidity is very reminiscent of the post Global Financial Crisis ( GFC ) format of the world .
However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramping up leverage .
It is hard to see another round of the same in response to the new round of global monetary easing .
Also the nature of this growth shock is very much embedded in the physical inability of economic activity to proceed .
To that extent , it can be argued , monetary policy will likely be more inefficient than usual .
These points have some merit .
However , in reaction to this shock and the related uncertainties , financial conditions ( defined here as a composite of liquidity , currency movement , credit spreads and equity prices ) are rapidly tightening .
Even if monetary policy intervention is ineffective to address the growth issue at hand , the least central banks can do is to not allow financial conditions to tighten from what they were before .
It is in this light that monetary measures should be looked at in our view , even though the bulk of the solution may indeed be with health and fiscal authorities in the current circumstance .
An Indian Assessment  India has had a challenging growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had impacted us , there have been two persistent internal drags on India 's growth : 1 .
Stagnant income growth 2 .
Continuous impairment of lender balance sheets .
On the back of a challenging financial year FY20 , it is now exceedingly likely that FY21 growth will also take a big hit owing to this global shock .
A continued depressed growth environment will further stress the weaker aspects of India 's current macro .
In our view , the following are two of the weakest :  Credit : India 's perpetual impairment of lender balance sheets comes as a result of two successive ' boom-bust ' credit cycles over the past 13 - 14 odd years : the first pertaining to the ' old economy ' corporate assets which ran for the first 5 -- 6 years of this phase , followed by the massive expansion cycle in the non-bank space ( which has had strong linkages with the banking system as well ) which saw its own culmination of sorts from 2018 .
Some topline growth rebound ahead would have possibly alleviated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ micro issues with respect to specific balance sheets would have likely remained ) .
However with another year of subdued growth now almost a certainty , general pressures on the somewhat weaker balance sheets are likely to continue .
Fiscal : India 's fiscal issues , including the effective public sector deficit versus just the center 's headline deficit , have been well documented .
A large part of the pressures recently have come about owing to a fall-off in nominal GDP growth rates in a time when relatively recent measures like GST were still in the process of stabilization .
As in the previous financial year , we see risks that in FY20 the actual revenue collections will fall short of the revised numbers presented in the Union Budget .
This will make the FY21 projections look quite aggressive , especially given the continued growth shock that India is expected to witness in the year ahead .
Furthermore , the FY21 budget relies heavily on non-tax receipts including from telecom and disinvestments .
Actual realizations here may be considerably lower than projected now .
All told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excise duty on petro-products , we see a 100 bps risk to the current fiscal deficit target of 3 .
for FY21 .
Against these vulnerabilities , a great strength for India at the current juncture is its substantial forex reserves and a positive basic balance ( current account adjusted for net foreign direct investments ) .
This safeguards the external account in a time of capital flow uncertainties and allows significant freedom for local policy makers to address local growth conditions .
Indian Policy Responses  As discussed above , even without undertaking significant new expenditure plans the government will likely face significant fiscal stress in the year ahead on account of the revenue side .
Thus the bulk of response has to come from monetary and macro-prudential policy .
The principle is similar to that described before with respect to other global central banks : general financial conditions are tightening ( notably via the equity , rates , and credit spread channels in India ) which the RBI needs to compensate for .
Indeed the central bank has already swung into action .
It has moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Next , it has announced another INR 1 lakh crores of long term repo operations .
While policy rates have yet not been cut in any emergency move , the market is largely assured that they are coming sooner rather than later .
The RBI has also been consciously using the market mechanism for greater transmission of policy rates .
Thus Governor Das has said that the objective of the so-called ' twist ' operations was to influence corporate bond yields via government bond yields .
Also although the long term repo operations ( LTROs ) are aimed at incentivizing lending , they also have been providing an important channel for market transmission since there has been no end use restriction on the long term money that the RBI has provided at the repo rate .
Given these if at all the RBI seems to have ' missed a trick ' , it is to not yet show its hand in the market channel of transmission in the current sell-off .
Thus between foreign portfolio investor ( FPI ) selling as they de-risk from emerging markets and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a substantial retracement in bond yields , particularly in quality corporate bonds .
This retracement is of the order of 75 -- 100 bps in some cases and for the time being has completely undone the market transmission achieved over the past 6 months or so .
What Should Investors Do  Markets are providing little actual signal at the current juncture .
Thus local bond markets are today hostage to the panic selling pressures as described above as investors ( both local and global ) scramble to create liquidity .
This comes when market volumes are relatively thin as normal functioning at many places may possibly be impaired owing to social distancing measures adopted at many organizations .
Having said that , it is still a bit of a mystery why banks are not showing a stronger hand in buying front end assets given that they are fresh off absorbing a large LTRO program with more on its way .
Thus while market expectations are firm that the next 50 bps rate cuts are coming , they are only currently getting expressed in swaps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields have spiked substantially .
Ideally , the RBI should have been somewhat more proactive in containing this after having revealed earlier that it is indeed using the market mechanism for transmission .
Nevertheless , we do think that this intervention will be forthcoming in some form or fashion and sooner rather than later .
Investors should welcome this retracement as representing yet another opportunity to allocate to quality fixed income .
At 200 bps or more over the repo rate currently , front end ( up to 5 year ) AAA corporate bonds are offering a lot of value in our view , in an environment where more rate cuts are possibly around the corner , liquidity is heavily surplus , and the RBI is actively removing pressure on deposit rates to rise by providing much cheaper long term money at its repo rate .
Finally , it is a false perception in our view that yields on lower rated credits are attractive .
At a headline level , the majority of the spread expansion over the past year is owing to a sharp sell-off in select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standalone basis , very few investors would still want to own these credits .
Also , there is limited market appetite currently for lower rated housing and non-bank finance companies causing spread expansion in this segment .
If one makes these two adjustments , spreads on other issuers in the AA category have not materially increased over AAA compared with the last few years .
These spreads are n't compensating investors by any stretch of the imagination for the significant financial market and macro risks that are currently in play .

User  The Indian government may use the falling crude oil prices to further increase excise duty on petrol and diesel in the country to raise additional resources required for keep rising deficit under check and meet additional expenditure needs arising from coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak .
In addition , the COVID-19 will have an impact on the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) through trade , hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pressures on fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP , says a note from State Bank of India ( SBI ) .
In the report , Dr Soumya Kanti Ghosh , group chief economic adviser of SBI , says , " Ideally , as per our estimates , a $1 dollar change in crude prices results in 50 paisa change in retail prices .
Based on such trends , the fall in crude oil prices from $50 per barrel to less than $30 per barrel could potentially lower the petrol and diesel prices by Rs10 to Rs12 per litre from their present prices assuming excise had stayed at the previous level .
" However the rise in excise duty of Rs3 on petrol and diesel prices by Union government may lead to maximum cut of Rs4 .
on petrol and Rs3 .
on diesel from the current level .
We , thus , expect the government may further limit such fall in retail prices and thereby increase the excise more .
"  During , the first nine months ( April to December 2019 ) of FY19-20 , total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crore .
If the same run rate continues for FY19-20 , then there could be shortfall of at least Rs14,000 crore , SBI says .
According to SBI , the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to impact India 's fiscal numbers in FY19-20 though it might be too early to say , possibly in FY20-21 .
However , it says , it will be completely foolhardy to stick to any mandated fiscal rules in times of current crisis that is now threatening to rip apart the entire global financial ecosystem .
Globally , state loans , income subsidies and tax deferrals are the most common fiscal packages being offered .
" Apart from fiscal measures , we believe that Indian government may think of unconventional fiscal measures like tax moratoriums , payment extensions on social charges , loan guarantees and wage subsidies for workers who can not work or move to part time roles if COVID-19 in India reaches to third or fourth stages , " Dr Ghosh from SBI says .
In India , the number of active cases have risen to 177 with 30 fresh cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we analyse the occurrence of active cases in seven most affected countries apart from China , in the second week , the number of cases jumps almost seven times compared to the first week .
In some countries like Iran and Spain even the active cases rose to 13 times in the second week compared to the first week .
Though India has already taken plethora of steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 , all eyes are now on the rise in active cases in the current week and next as this determines the extent of our preparedness , " SBI added .
Meanwhile , based on current tax revenue trends , additional expenditure rationalisation of Rs1 .
lakh crore might be required in the current fiscal , if India has to stick to mandated 3 .
fiscal deficit .
SBI says , " In FY2021 , nominal GDP growth is at 10% and every 10 basis points ( bps ) slippage in nominal GDP numbers in FY2021 will push up fiscal deficit by roughly one basis point .
We are already estimating that the impact of a 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel and transport and transport , storage and communication segment that could be spread over FY2020 and FY2021 , with a larger impact in FY2021 .
The government has already announced an additional borrowing through short term papers in FY2020 .
