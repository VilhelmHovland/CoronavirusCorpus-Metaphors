NEW YORK -- A possible strike by Instacart workers highlights the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the grocery delivery business , where workers are worried about their safety as they try to meet a surge in demand for online groceries .
A group called the Gig Workers Collective is calling for a nationwide walk-out Monday .
They 've been asking Instacart to provide workers with hazard pay and protective gear , among other demands .
Instacart said Sunday it would soon provide workers with a new hand sanitizer upon request and outlined changes to its tip system .
The group said the measures were too little too late .
While some workers say they intend to join the strike for at least a day -- or have stopped filling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , newer workers are content to have a paying job at a time of mass layoffs in other industries .
The San Francisco-based delivery app is trying to hire 300,000 more workers -- more than doubling its workforce -- to fulfill orders it says have surged by 150% year-over year in the past weeks .
The company said 50,000 new shoppers joined its platform in just the past week .
Some customers are waiting days to receive orders .
Instacart currently has a workforce of more than 200,000 contracted workers who make multiple trips a day to various grocery stores to fulfill and deliver orders that customers make through the app .
It also directly employs about 20,000 part-time workers who are assigned to a single store , collecting groceries that are subsequently delivered to clients by a contracted Instacart worker .
Chloe Grozdina , a part-time Instacart in-store shopper assigned to a Mariano 's grocery store in the Chicago area , says workers are seeing " a lot of apocalypse orders " from customers hunkered down in their homes .
Panic shopping has cleared out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's orders with a lesser item or notify them that it 's not available .
Grozdina , who makes $13 an hour and does n't get tips , said the crowds of fellow Instacart shoppers have made it tough to keep a safe distance while racing to fulfill orders .
Grozdina said she wears a mask to work that she bought herself and immediately showers when she gets home .
Among their demands , the strike organizers want hazard pay of $5 an order and supplies of hand sanitizer , wipes and cleaning supplies free of charge .
On Sunday , the company said it had contracted with a third-party manufacturer to make a hand sanitizer spray that workers can request at no cost via a website starting Monday , with shipments starting in a few days .
Data show online grocery orders jumping even before some cities and states imposed " stay at home " orders .
During the week of March 2 , Instacart , Amazon , and Walmart grocery delivery services each saw at least a 65 percent sales increase compared to the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Instacart has started offering bonuses of between $25 and $200 for its hourly employees dependent on hours worked until April 15 .
Instacart also announced a month-long extension of a temporary policy giving 14 days of paid leave to workers who are diagnosed with coronavirus , or have been ordered to isolate themselves .
The strike organizers that policy extended to workers with a doctor 's note verifying a pre-existing condition that could make them more vulnerable to the virus .
They also demanded that Intacart raise the tip default in its app to 10% from the current 5% .
Instead , Instacart announced Sunday it would change the default to the amount the customer last tipped , saying tips have increased considerably during the virus crisis .
Instacart said previously that it has added more " promotions " -- or extra pay for contracted full-service shoppers to accept certain orders .
That was not enough to lure back Shanna Foster , a single mother who stopped working her Instacart gig two weeks ago out of fear of contracting the virus .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be guaranteed , " said Foster , of Simi Valley , California .
Other companies such as Amazon and Walmart have also announced hiring sprees to meet a surge for both deliveries and in-store essentials .
Amazon has increased pay for its workers , including those at its Whole Foods Grocery stores .
While such low-wage jobs put people on the front lines of the pandemic , many people are applying as layoffs surge in retail , restaurant , hospitality and other industries .
Summer Cooper , 39 , started working as an Instacart shopper in the Tampa Bay area recently after losing her position as a server at a hotel restaurant .
She was unaware of the possible strike .
" I 'm grateful to have some way to make money , " Cooper said .
Darrin Burdette , an Instacart shopper in Colorado Springs , said joining a strike would " not help me in any way .
"  An Uber driver , Burdette said he relies entirely on his Instacart gig since demand for ride-hailing services plunged .
He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders rise .
On his app , he can see that many orders have come from people using the service for the first time .
Michelle Ellwood , 43 , began using the app shortly after her family returned from a trip abroad and decided to self-isolate for two weeks .
She said Instacart shoppers have gone out of their way to fulfill orders .
One , she said , returned with a chicken after previously being unable to find meat at local stores .
" It 's amazing that they are doing this .
I 'm grateful .
I 'm hopeful they are able to take care of their families through this , " said Ellwood of Canandaigua , New York .
They do n't have to put themselves in harm 's way , but the volunteers of France 's well-known Civil Protection service have chosen the front line in the fight against the coronavirus .
They are often the first to knock on the doors of people calling for help , and who may have the infection or whose confirmed case has taken a downturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same story is playing out in some of the world 's most unequal regions , where tens of millions live in crowded slums without adequate water , sanitation and access to health care .
