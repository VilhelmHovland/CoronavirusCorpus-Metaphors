Bangladesh garment makers say $3bn in orders lost to virus  DHAKA : Bangladesh garment manufacturers say fashion retailers have cancelled or put on hold more than $3 billion in orders due to the coronavirus outbreak , though a handful have agreed to pay anyway .
The data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association released Monday reflected both orders already made or in the works and planned orders from the country , which is the world 's second largest exporter of clothing after China .
The cancelled orders , according to reports to the BGMEA from manufacturers , included tens of millions in purchases from many big buyers , including European buyers C&amp;A and Inditex , Primark of Ireland , Britain 's Marks &amp; Spencer and Tesco and US retailers like Walmart and Target .
Bangladesh is just beginning to feel the direct impact of the pandemic and its government has ordered a shut down of most businesses to help contain it .
But shocks to the country 's export markets have been cascading into its economy for weeks .
A survey of factory owners in Bangladesh released Friday showed millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severance pay they are owed .
The BGMEA reported that $1 .
billion in orders have been put on hold and another $1 .
billion have been cancelled .
Cancellations of planned orders , for April-December , amounted to nearly $1 .
billion , it said .
The figures are conservative because they exclude orders that would go to multiple buyers .
The new data were incorporated into a report by Pennsylvania State University 's Center for Global Workers ' Rights and the Worker Rights Consortium , a Washington , D .
labor rights organization , .
Bangladesh manufacturers and labor groups have been appealing to big retailers to honor their commitments to suppliers .
Sweden 's H&amp;M has said it will pay suppliers for orders already under production .
PVH , which owns the Calvin Klein , Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage brands , has told suppliers it is releasing invoices that had been put on hold since March 18 .
Later invoices will gradually be processed .

" PVH and H&amp;M are doing the right thing , in contrast to the long list of brands refusing to pay for goods workers have already made for them , " said Scott Nova , executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium .
Big Western brands came under heavy pressure to improve conditions in factories after huge fires and other disasters killed hundreds of workers .
The store closures and other disruptions from the virus outbreak are straining a fragile supply chain in which big buyers have been squeezing their suppliers for years .
More than 1 million of the more than 4 million garment workers in Bangladesh already have lost their jobs or have been furloughed because of order cancellations and the failure of buyers to pay for canceled shipments .
