Defiant youth in Tehran targeted a center of the suppressive forces in Tehran 's Sohrevardi Street on Saturday evening , March 28 , 2020 .
This is while the regime 's security forces are on full alert to prevent the outbreak of any protest under the pretext of combating Coronavirus .
The same day , defiant youth also set fire to one of the main centers of plunder of people 's wealth , Khomeini 's so-called Relief Committee in the city of Qom .
Authorities have ignored repeated calls to allocate part of the massive assets of financial foundations and institutions controlled by Khamenei and the IRGC , including Khomeini 's so-called Relief Committee and the " Executive Headquarters of Khomeini 's Directive , " to fund efforts to counter Coronavirus and pay people 's living expenses so that they would not be compelled to go to work .
