Amazing Basketball Court Comes Out of Quarantine Boredom  Everyone handles boredom differently , but I can probably boil everyone into two categories during this pandemic : Productive , and unproductive .
The unproductive lot does as little as possible besides maybe catching up on a few emails , social feeds , and exotic animal documentaries .
If that sounds productive to you , you definitely fit in that category .
Other , more productive members of society , are taking this time to renovate their house , learn a new skill , or paint large slabs of concrete .
That 's right , one Red Raider out there has taken his productivity to the extreme by painting his home basketball court in a proud display of the Scarlet and Black :  It 's a court that could proudly host a Keenan Evans step-back , or a Jarrett Culver to Owens alley-oop any day of the week .
When all the COVID-19 shutdowns are lifted , I 'd love to see Coach Beard and a few players out there getting some shots up from the slab .
Those Double Ts look like they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
