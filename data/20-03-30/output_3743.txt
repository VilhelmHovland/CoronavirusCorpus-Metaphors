Sinn F ? in calls for accommodation refunds for students who vacate early due to COVID-19  PRIVATE and public student accommodation providers have been asked to adopt a " uniform approach " in terms of granting refunds to students who left their accommodation early due to COVID-19 .
Deputy Maurice Quinlivan , Sinn F ? in , said it is his party 's view that all public and private accommodation providers " should provide these students and their families with refunds " .
The Sinn F ? in representative says many students have returned home with " colleges and universities now physically closed " and are being denied refunds " despite giving notice that they want to vacate their student accommodation early due to the COVID 19 outbreak " .
He said , " It is important for students in purpose-built accommodation to know that their licences are covered under the Residential Tenancies Act .
" Where landlords are denying refunds of pre-paid rent or deposits beyond the required notice period , they should make formal complaints to the Residential Tenancies Board .
"  Deputy Quinlivan noted it would be " helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement calling for refunds from all student accommodation providers " .
A spokesman for University of Limerick ( UL ) told the Limerick Post , " The on-campus accommodation at University of Limerick has remained open and operational and there are 700 students living in the village residences .
