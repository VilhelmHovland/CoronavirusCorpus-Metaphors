Ravens ' Derek Wolfe opens up about elbow injury that ended his season  Longtime Denver Broncos pass rusher Derek Wolfe is now joining the Baltimore Ravens upon testing the free agent market this offseason .
While only recently inking a deal with the Ravens , Wolfe knows first hand how different this offseason has been for players .
That would be due to none other than the " coronavirus " pandemic .
In Wolfe 's case , he had his season ended due to a dislocated elbow in 2019 .
That injury may have been something that caused him to sign after the first couple weeks of free agency .
Due to the " coronavirus " outbreak throughout the United States and beyond , free agents were unable to visit with franchises this time around .
That has made things a bit complicated for players like Wolfe .
" I think the coronavirus happened and you ca n't get guys in for physicals and you ca n't meet guys , " Wolfe said , via Mike Klis of 9News in Denver .
" I dislocated my elbow and that scares people .
But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  Wolfe is referring to a video that he posted on his social media accounts late last week .
It 's one that showed him working out without having any major trouble .
Of course , this is far from being examined by a medical doctor .
But perhaps it helped the longtime Broncos defender land his newest role with the Ravens .
Wolfe ended up landing in Baltimore under unusual circumstances .
That is because the Ravens ' deal with defensive end Michael Brockers fell through .
Brockers ended up re-signing with the Los Angeles Rams .
It ultimately led to Wolfe 's deal with the Ravens .
