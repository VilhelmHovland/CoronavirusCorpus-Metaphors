Star comment : Not too early to start thinking about end of coronavirus crisis  Although we are still nowhere near the worst of this unfolding crisis , it is not too early to start thinking about what things will be like when we overcome it and start the process of recovery .
Subscribe to our daily newsletter  The impact has been on every aspect of our lives .
Public health -- saving lives -- is paramount .
The economy , and therefore jobs , has already taken a big hit , despite the Government efforts to provide a measure of shielding .
There is going to be much rebuilding work to be done but , unless we are faced with a total wasteland , over time the nation will bounce back .
Measured up against such issues , the future of education has fallen into the shadows , but how this sector pulls through will determine to some extent the shape of the new , post-virus nation .
The educational challenge is both in the fields of finance and in learning .

well , let 's just say that you may not find it easy to park , as across the region councils are closing car parks at parks and beauty spots .
This is to stop scenes like we saw in Snowdonia the previous weekend , when huge crowds descended .
The breath of fresh air is not the problem , but the huge crowds are the problem -- a social distancing problem .
Getting away from it all is not getting away from it all if everybody else is getting away from it all to the same place .
With coronavirus , we have to think locally .
Shop locally , and only when necessary .
Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course .
These are ways of living to which many of us have become unaccustomed .
If this pandemic has been a product of globalism , it 's rather appropriate that a good way to fight it is through localism .
