Florida Church Jammed For Sunday Service Despite Pandemic  Monday , March 30th 2020 , 7:52 AM CDT  Updated :  Monday , March 30th 2020 , 7:56 AM CDT  By : CBS News  WTSP-TV  A Florida church was packed with worshippers Sunday despite a local " safer-at-home " order designed to help curb the spread of COVID-19 , reports CBS Tampa affiliate WTSP-TV .
A live-stream of the service at The River at Tampa Bay Church showed its crowded main sanctuary .
WTSP says the sheriff told church leaders they were in direct violation of the order , which was issued by Hillsborough County officials and went into effect Friday .
It requires that businesses and organizations considered essential abide by social distancing guidelines and keep people six feet away from each other or shut down .
Attorneys for local officials and the church were working to resolve things as quickly as possible , WTSP reported .
The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people stay six feet apart and not gather in groups of 50 or more , according to WTSP .
In a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the church explained why it 's keeping its doors open when so many other places across the state and nation are closing .
The statement read in part , " In a time of national crisis , we expect certain institutions to be open and certain people to be on duty .
We expect hospitals to have their doors open 24/7 to receive and treat patients .
We expect our police and firefighters to be ready and available to rescue and to help and to keep the peace .
The Church is another one of those essential services .
It is a place where people turn for help and for comfort in a climate of fear and uncertainty .
" Therefore , we feel that it would be wrong for us to close our doors on them , at this time , or any time .
In a time of crisis , people are fearful and in need of comfort and community , more than ever before .
