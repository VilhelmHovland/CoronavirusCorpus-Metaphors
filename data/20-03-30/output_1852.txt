Meituan Dianping projected losses and a revenue fall this quarter but warned of uncertainty over the course of 2020 , joining fellow tech giants around the world now struggling to come to grips with the economic and logistical shocks from Covid-19 .
Backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd .
, the food delivery and internet services giant is one of the most exposed of China 's major tech corporations to the spread of Covid-19 .
Many restaurants in its home country either shut or reduced their operating hours during the outbreak , while widespread travel restrictions also crippled its hotel-booking and ride-sharing businesses .
The company 's outlook is further clouded by China 's worsening economy , which may contract this quarter for the first time since 1989 , denting consumer spending .
Meituan joins sector bellwethers from Sony Corp .
to Apple Inc .
and Twitter Inc .
that have emphasized the difficulty of parsing an unprecedented black-swan event like the coronavirus pandemic .
The Chinese company projected revenue will decline year-over-year in the March quarter but said it could n't fully determine the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will hurt its operations in 2020 .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations of our merchants , including restaurants , local services merchants and hotels , which in turn resulted in downward pressure on our own operations for the first quarter of 2020 , " Meituan said in its filing .
" Due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation , we are unable to fully ascertain the expected impact on full year 2020 at this stage .
"  That 's after the internet services giant posted a solid set of numbers for the December quarter .
Meituan reported a better-than-expected 42% jump in revenue to 28 .
billion yuan ( $4 billion ) in the three months ended December , compared with the 26 .
billion-yuan average of analysts ' estimates .
It booked a profit for the quarter of almost 1 .
billion yuan , versus expectations for a loss .
Meituan had been diversifying from its core takeout delivery business and investing in other online services including travel , competing directly against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .
But others are elbowing their way into Meituan 's turf .
Ride-hailing giant Didi recently launched a delivery service similar to Uber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid 1 .
in Hong Kong before earnings were announced .
While they 've dropped since mid-January when Covid-19 spread across China , Meituan 's stock rally last year helped secure its place as China 's largest publicly traded internet firm after Alibaba and Tencent .
