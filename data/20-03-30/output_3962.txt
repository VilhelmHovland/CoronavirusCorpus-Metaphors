IMF in talks to increase its assistance to Ukraine to $9 .
Ukraine and the IMF are in talks that could see assistance given to Ukraine increase from $5 .
to $9 .
By bne IntelliNewsMarch 23 , 2020  The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) may increase its assistance to Ukraine to a total of $9 .
by drawing on a $50bn emergency fund that the multinational lender established to help low-income countries cope with the stop shock of the global coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) pandemic .
Talks are ongoing but made progress over the weekend when governor of the NBU Yakiv Smolii announced that talks with the IMF towards making more cash available had made progress .
Those reports were bolstered on March 21 , according to Ukrainian News sources familiar with the negotiation process .
Two programmes are under discussion .
Under the original Extended Fund Facility ( EFF ) Ukraine is to receive $5 .
in a programme that was agreed in principle in December but which the government in Kyiv has been unable to close due to foot-dragging on reforms -- specifically the government has failed to put in place a law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former owners if that bank has been nationalised .
The law is aimed specifically at oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky , who has been lobbying to have his Privatbank returned , which went bust in 2016 and was nationalised after it became clear Kolomoisky had looted the bank of some $5 .
The second law would create a commercial market for agricultural land that is due to happen in the second half of this year , although analysts are sceptical that the market will appear this year thanks to the economic impact of the coronavirus .
Until these two laws are passed the IMF EFF facility remains in doubt .
Moreover , Rada deputies have ignored Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy 's calls to push the laws through quickly and are about to break up for a three week holiday , citing coronavirus fears as the reason for suspending the activities of Parliament .
Separate to the EFF negotiations Ukraine has applied for funds from the emergency facility established by the IMF , Rapid Coronavirus Financing ( RFI ) , to deal with the stop shock caused by the pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emergency fund .
If granted then the money will come in very handy , as Ukraine has $4 .
of debt to repay to the IMF this year as well as about $1bn worth of other debt obligations .
In addition the government was planning to run a UAH90bn ( $3 .
) deficit this year , but the extra spending the pandemic is likely to trigger means the deficit could be twice that amount , which the government will struggle to finance .
Both programmes can be approved by the IMF at the same time , according to the accelerated procedure , and the total amount of the first tranche may total $3bn , one third of which will be used to finance the state budget deficit , reports Ukraine News .
A second tranche of between $1 .
and $2 .
will follow , according to Ukrainian News .
Ukraine is already running short of funds after the NBU spent circa $2bn in the last week to support the currency as the population began panic-buying dollars .
Ukraine 's reserves fell from $26 .
, which was equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the three months minimum economists believe is necessary to keep the national currency stable .
The hryvnia has lost some 18% of its value since the start of the year .
Part of the IMF disbursement , should it go ahead , will go to replenish foreign exchange reserves as well as to cover budget expenditures .
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy discussed the expansion of the co-operation programme with IMF head Kristalina Georgieva over the weekend , " to support further reforms in Ukraine and overcome the challenges facing the Ukrainian economy in connection with the spread of coronavirus , as well as steps to implement this programme , " according to the President 's office .
" In particular , we are talking about plans to increase the size of Ukraine 's support from the IMF , " Zelenskiy said .
In March , the IMF announced the creation of the RFI , which can provide interest-free assistance to countries that have suffered from coronavirus , up to a total volume of $1tn .
One of the first countries to ask for such assistance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than two generations .
Zelenskiy asked the government to launch negotiations with the IMF for RFI funds on March 16 .
A basic agreement has already been reached between the government and the IMF to allocate funds and currently only technical issues are being discussed , according to Ukrainian News .
At the same time , in parallel talks the Ukraianian side is asking for the size of the EFF programme to be increased from $5 .
to $7bn .
The IMF is not charging interest on the RFI funds , nor is it attaching any string other than the insistence that the EFF deal be done first , which will be approved by a fast-track process ( no adjustments to budget indicators , which will change and contravene the previous agreements ) .
The size of the state budget deficit this year is expected to rise from the anticipated 2% of GDP to 4% .
Getting the EFF across the finish line remains the main challenge , and the IMF has made it clear that the passage of the banking law is a must for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done and approved then the size of the first tranche of the proceeds of finance will be important .
Ukraine expects to receive a total of $3bn , of which $2bn will be from the EFF and $1bn from the RFI .
The RFI money will go to cover the budget deficit , as it is unclear if the money from the EFF can be used to support budget spending , which is not normal practice for the IMF .
