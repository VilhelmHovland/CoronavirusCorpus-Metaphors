RUSADA temporarily halts anti-doping testing due to coronavirus  RUSADA 's deputy director says the suspension of testing would remain in place until 6 April  Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA said it was temporarily halting all testing in response to government measures aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus .
Russia has reported 1,036 cases of the virus and has stepped up measures to prevent it from spreading further , including declaring next week a non-working week and ordering shut all Moscow cafes , restaurants and shops apart from those providing vital services , such as food and medicine .
In a video posted Saturday on its website , RUSADA director Yuri Ganus said the agency was continuing its work during the coronavirus outbreak but was suspending testing to comply with government measures .
" We of course are following the regime that has been established by the leadership of Russia and at this time we have suspended testing , " Ganus said , adding that the agency would announce the resumption of testing at a later date .
Margarita Pakhnotskaya , RUSADA 's deputy director , told Reuters the suspension of testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suspended in 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of mass doping in Russian athletics .
The agency was conditionally reinstated in September 2018 , but was declared non-compliant late last year after WADA found Moscow had provided it with doctored laboratory data .
Russia is in the process of appealing a four-year ban on its athletes competing at major international sporting events under their flag as punishment for that alteration of laboratory data .
