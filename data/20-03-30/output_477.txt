It 's not easy to build a ventilator assembly line from scratch .
Share this story  One of the most crucial things the United States can do to prepare for the surging coronavirus outbreak is to beef up our stockpile of ventilators .
These mechanical breathing machines are crucial for keeping patients with severe cases of COVID-19 alive .
The United States currently has around 170,000 of the devices ; experts say that may not be enough if the number of coronavirus cases continues to grow exponentially .
On Sunday , President Donald Trump tweeted that " Ford , General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products , FAST ! " ( Presumably he meant " medical products .
" )  This is an apparent reference to new guidance from the Food and Drug Administration , published Sunday , that dramatically loosens the agency 's normally strict oversight of ventilator technology .
The new policy not only gives medical professionals broader latitude to modify existing FDA-approved ventilators , it also creates a streamlined process for complete newcomers to the ventilator market to get FDA approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
GM announced a partnership with ventilator manufacturer Ventec last Friday .
On Tuesday morning , Ford announced its own ventilator partnership with GE Healthcare .
But ventilators are complex machines that can cost as much as $50,000 apiece .
Reliability is crucial , since even a brief malfunction or loss of power could cost a patient his or her life .
So it would n't be practical for any company to design and build ventilators from scratch in a few months .
Instead , car companies are looking for ways to help existing vendors expand their output .
" Ventec will leverage GM 's logistics , purchasing and manufacturing expertise to build more of their critically important ventilators , " the two companies wrote in a joint press release .
GM 's main contribution seems to be helping Ventec beef up its supply chain .
Like other automakers , GM sits at the apex of a vast network of suppliers , some of which have sophisticated manufacturing capabilities .
GM is working to connect Ventec with suppliers who can supply scarce parts , allowing Ventec to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Detroit , points to one example where GM has been helping Ventec .
A GM supplier called Meridian is " helping GM procure six different ventilator compressor parts made of magnesium for an estimated 200,000 ventilators , " Walsh wrote .
Meridian 's own machines could n't produce the necessary parts , but Meridian connected GM with two other companies -- competitors of Meridian -- that were able to produce them .
On Tuesday , Ford announced it was also getting into the ventilator business , though the details remain hazy .
" Ford and GE Healthcare are working together to expand production of a simplified version of GE Healthcare 's existing ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by COVID-19 , " Ford said in a press release .
" These ventilators could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location .
"  Ford says that " work on this initiative ties to a request for help from US government officials .
"  Ford is also planning to manufacture other medical equipment , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Other ventilator makers are expanding on their own  Tesla , meanwhile , has talked to leading medical device company Medtronic .
" Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators , " Elon Musk tweeted on Saturday .
" Very impressive team ! "  Medtronic 's own tweet about the meeting was cordial but noncommittal : " We are grateful for the discussion with @ElonMusk and @Tesla as we work across industries to solve problems and get patients and hospitals the tools they need to continue saving lives , " the company wrote .
Further Reading  Medtronic has been working to boost its output without help from Tesla .
Last week , the company announced that it was on track to double its rate of ventilator production and said it intended to double the workforce at its ventilator factory in Ireland .
" Ventilator manufacturing is a complex process that relies on a skilled workforce , a global supply chain and a rigorous regulatory regime to ensure patient safety , " Medtronic said in its press statement .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their output .
GE 's Health Care division announced plans to increase ventilator production -- including having staff work around the clock .
Swedish medical device company Getinge , Swiss company Hamilton , and Dutch electronics giant Philips are also working to boost ventilator production .
The importance of government orders  One of the most important things governments can do to promote ventilator production is to commit to buying ventilators in the future .
Right now , medical device companies are able to sell ventilators as fast as they come off their existing assembly lines .
But big increases in ventilator output will require companies to make expensive investments in new manufacturing capacity .
That 's a risky bet because the investments might become worthless if the coronavirus crisis peters out after a few months .
The world could wind up with a big surplus of ventilators .
Hospitals , too , may be reluctant to spend tens of thousands of dollars on ventilators that they might only need for a few months .
Governments can reduce the risk manufacturers face by placing big orders for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers more willing to make up-front investments to fill those orders .
Of course , that creates a risk that the government will end up with a glut of ventilators it does n't need .
But it seems better to risk having too many ventilators in a few months than to risk having too few .
