Florida football players working remotely to maintain strength and conditioning  Robbie Andreu , Gainesville Sun Published 9:18 a .
ET March 30 , 2020  CLOSE  As flu season comes to an end and allergy season starts to heat up , there may be concerns about symptoms that mimic the new coronavirus COVID-19 .
Wochit  GAINESVILLE -- With the Florida football team shut down , the weight room and practice fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gators and strength and conditioning coordinator Nick Savage are doing what so many others are across the country and around the world .
They are working remotely to get their job done .
In this case , it is to somehow , without much in the way of traditional weight equipment to work with , maintain the considerable gains that were made during the winter offseason strength and conditioning program .
It can be , and is being , done , Savage said Friday .
And he and the players are coming up with creative ways to do it .
" One of the things we have to do is keep things fresh , keep things exciting , " Savage said .
" So , I 'll send them a video with me working with two five-gallon buckets or something .
And just trying to get them to create a spark in their brain about there 's things around the house they can use .
" Guys have done a good job finding things around the house that have some sort of weight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , it 's not the same as truly lifting weights , but we 've got to make the most of what we 've got .
"  So , with very few players having access to traditional weights , what are some of the things they 're lifting at home ?  " Typically , it 's family members or pets , " Savage said .
" It 's been the best .
We 've had everything from buckets and hoses and pots you would put plants in .
Family members , pets , we 've had a whole bunch of things .
It 's been refreshing .
"  Savage and his staff sent the players home a few weeks ago with a " generic " workout plan .
Additions are made to it daily and can vary for each position group and/or determined by what players have access to at home .
Savage has maintained daily contact with the players , mainly via Facetime and text .
" I send out one team text a day , whether it 's motivational or actually goal-oriented where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I call one to two position groups a day , basically , so I hear and see their face .
I 'll call them or I 'll Facetime them .
I want to hear their voice or see their face at least once a week to make sure I 'm not missing something through text message .
" Obviously we text daily and then I will have multiple calls to a percentage of the athletes every single day and by the end of the week I have hit everyone .
"  Per NCAA rules , film review or instruction with teams is not permitted at this time , but coaches and strength coaches are allowed two hours of daily interaction with regard to team activities .
They also have unlimited communication with student-athletes to check on their well-being .

The workouts sent to the players are based on what they have available to work with at home .
With gyms shut down across the nation , many have very limited or no access to weights .
" Obviously , a lot of our guys have limited resources , so there 's a percentage of guys that are strictly doing workouts and exercises and movement patterns all with body weight , " Savage said .
" So it 's challenging , but through communication and different things we had set in place before we left campus we were able to accommodate quite a bit with that .
" Then there 's a small percentage of guys that have some equipment such as a barbell and weights , maybe a couple bands .
There 's also another small percentage of guys that have a full gym at their house .
Everything is individual by individual case .
" Between me and my staff we set up a general take-home workout plan basically that is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then also based on what they have at their house we 've designed individual programs for each one of those people based on what resources they have at the house .
"  The goal , through a variety of methods , tools and approaches , is for the players to maintain the gains they achieved in the winter and be physically ready to go when they eventually are called back to duty .
It 's calling for effort and creativity from all involved .
But it certainly is possible , Savage said .
" You can do enough at home as long as intensity and volume are high enough to at least maintain what you did ( in the winter ) , " he said .
" Now one thing they got to do really a good job of that goes away pretty quickly is obviously their conditioning level .
Things like that .
" If they sit on the couch the whole time and do n't do any exercises and do n't run , that 's not a really good recipe .
Through communication I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" I do n't know how much stronger they can be if they are not lifting weights , but they could maintain what they have as long as the intensity and volume remains at the level needed .
So far , it has been engaging and interactive .
And for the situation we 're in , the guys are making the best with what we 've got .
