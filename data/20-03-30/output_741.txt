Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell announces that after an internal affairs investigation that the department has terminated 5 police officers on Thursday , June 13 , 2019 .
The unnamed officers were witness to an assault in 2018 and neither reacted to prevent it or report it .
( John Autey / Pioneer Press )  An arbitrator upheld the St .
Paul police chief 's decision to fire an officer , saying he and his colleagues laughed when a man assaulted patrons of a bar and mocked people who were injured .
Chief Todd Axtell terminated five officers in June after an internal affairs investigation found they failed to intervene when they saw the assaults outside Checker Board Pizza in the Payne-Phalen neighborhood in June 2018 .
The St .
Paul Police Federation filed a grievance over the firings and Nathan Smith 's is the first to reach a conclusion .
" We are extremely disappointed in the arbitrator 's decision and we 're obviously thinking about Nate Smith and his family , " said Paul Kuntz , federation president .
Police Chief Todd Axtell said he " took decisive action on this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the public and tell the truth , " Axtell said in a statement .
" Failing to live up to these standards negatively affects everyone who wears the badge and erodes community trust .
There is no room for deceit on the St .
Paul Police Department .
Thankfully , our department is made up of dedicated law enforcement professionals who are committed to living up to our high standards .
"  PD : OFFICER WAS DISHONEST ; UNION : HE HAD GOOD RECORD  In summarizing the positions of each side , Befort wrote that the police department described Smith 's " behavior as egregious in taking steps to prevent harm through the use of weapons and in not offering assistance to injured individuals .
The behavior was exacerbated .
by overt acts of dishonesty , such as Smith turning his ( body-worn camera ) away from the action and making false statements " during the internal affairs investigation .
Axtell viewed Smith 's actions " in laughing at and mocking the mostly Hmong bar patrons as wholly inconsistent with the objective of ( providing ) community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union , meanwhile , said Smith should have received a lesser penalty .
He did not " engage in affirmative acts of misconduct such as inflicting harm through the excessive use of force , but instead involved less egregious acts of failing to intervene and assist , " Befort summarized .
Smith testified " he did not use force to stop Tou Cha 's aggressive behavior out of a concern that active intervention could escalate tensions , " according to the document .
The St .
Paul Police Federation also argued that terminating Smith would be inconsistent with treatment given other officers for misconduct and that the officer 's " long and good work record mitigates the need to resort to the ultimately penalty , " Befort wrote .
Smith became a St .
Paul officer in 2012 .
In upholding Smith 's termination , Befort wrote that Smith 's " behavior goes beyond mere acts of misconduct to encompass what appears to be deep-seated attitudes and beliefs .
While inaction and dishonesty are very troublesome behaviors , treating Hmong bar patrons as sub-standard citizens is even more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporter since 2001 , mostly covering public safety .
