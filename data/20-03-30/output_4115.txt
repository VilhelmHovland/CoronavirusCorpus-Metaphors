HOW New York will weather the pandemic that is Covid-19 will be down , in large part , to the work of West Limerick man , Michael Dowling from Knockaderry .
Michael was asked by New York state governor , Andrew Cuomo , to galvanise the hospital sector in readiness for Covid-19 patients .
" New York is the epicentre of the problem right now , and has more cases than anywhere else .
It is growing every single day , " said Michael speaking from his office in Long Island , New York .
" I have known him ( Governor Cuomo ) a long time .
He taps into me every so often to help him out , " Michael said , explaining how he came to be in the frontline of New York 's fight against Covid-19 .
" When all of this happened , he asked me and another guy to co-ordinate the hospitals in New York and to try and figure out how we can increase the number of beds .
We need a lot more beds .
"  It is no small ask .
At the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmed cases , accounting for 5% of cases worldwide .
One in every 1,000 people is being infected , five times higher than in other parts of the US .
But Michael , who heads up Northwell Health , a non-profit health provider employing 70,000 people and the largest health provider in New York state , believes firmly it can be done .
The target , he said , is to get every one of some 150 hospitals in New York to increase capacity by 50% .
" We are making available 15-20,000 beds , " he explained .
They are also , he said , looking at places other than hospitals to put patients If and when the volume increases beyond hospital capacity .
But , Michael pointed out , increasing capacity to meet emergencies is not something new .
" We do this on an ongoinig basis when we have a big spike .
We are able to adapt very quickly .
" Putting beds together is easy , " he continued .
" I know I can make an extra 2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you have the right staff .
"  He is pleased with the response to the call-out for retired medical and healthcare workers or those who have switched to other sectors to come and help .
But he acknowledged there has been a problem with supplies such as masks , ventilators and protective clothing .
" It has been a challenge because a lot of the stuff was made in China and all of that got disrupted .
But we are resolving that .
We are going to other places in the world to find more , " Michael explained , and he is confident they will be able to accommodate everyone .
He is unequivocal that social distancing and closing down businesses - shops , schools , universities , pubs , restaurants , gyms , salons - was the correct decision .
" I think it is one of the best things you can do to prevent the spread of the virus , " he said .
" Having people working from home is important .
"  He is not fazed by rumours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends .
" I know the White Houses gives conflicting messages .
I do n't spend an awful lot of time worrying about it or listening to you know who , " Michael declared .
" I listen to the Public Health People , I focus on the facts .
"  But he admitted the lockdown has had its consequences .
" New York has been pretty much shook .
You do n't see anybody moving much .
It is a whole different place .
"  " Do people like it ? No .
They do n't like it .
People are frustrated with the inconvenience , " Michael continued .
But the overall mood is " pretty positive " , he said , and the attitude is " this is something we have to do if we are to survive " .
" You get pockets of complaints but that is normal .
"  The big question is , will the systems in New York be ready for the big surge ?  " We are ready , " Michael declared .
" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock .
It will put lot a lot of strain , a lot of pressure on the system .
We have a pretty good record .
People adapt .
People are creative .
"  Michael acknowledged too that Covid-19 is having , and will have , a big economic effect .
" Every budget , every hospital budget is going to be affected .
But that is what you have to do , " he continued .
Michael also believes the pandemic will have a profound effect on the future .
" I believe every business will change the way it operates .
I have 40,000 people working from home .
When this is over , I will probably have more people working at home than I ever thought possible .
It changes the way you think about things , " he said .
Michael is in regular contact with his family in Limerick and other parts of the country .
" Ireland is making the right decisions , doing all the things that should be done , " he commented .
" The world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new reality now .
We know now we live in a very interconnected world .
We have had Sars , Ebola , we have had Swine fever .
It would be foolish to think we wo n't be hit again .
" It may not be Covid-19 but he said : " We live in a very interconnected world .
You ca n't disconnect .
"  " You do what you have to do .
Keep calm .
