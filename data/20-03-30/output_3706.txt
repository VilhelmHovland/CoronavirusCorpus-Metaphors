These SAPS officials have got it wrong : After telling citizens to ' get off their yards ' and remain indoors during lockdown , a minister has had to intervene .
A group of SAPS officers have landed themselves in hot water this weekend , after footage of them telling citizens to get off their own yards and back inside their houses went viral on social media .
We may be on day three of the enforced coronavirus lockdown , but it seems there are still some grey areas for law(n) enforcement .
Lockdown latest -- confusion with the new laws  Former DA leader Mmusi Maimane led the charge against the cops , by posting the aforementioned video to his Twitter timeline .
He posed a question to Minister Fikile Mbalula , asking if people were allowed the ' luxury ' of setting foot on their own gardens , either at the front or back of the property .
The officers can be seen shining their flashlights towards a bemused gogo on her porch , insisting that she retreats and goes back inside her home .

Watch police force people off their yards here :  Can we still go on our yards during lockdown ? The answer is yes  On Sunday morning , Fikile Mbalula reacted the accusations of " over-zealous policing " .
He confirmed that citizens are indeed allowed to be on their yards during lockdown .
Mbalula also informed us that he will be communicating with SAPS to ensure that they know the proper procedures going forward .
