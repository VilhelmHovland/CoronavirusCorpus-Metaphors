FPL lowering customers bills during coronavirus pandemic  TAMPA ( WFLA ) -- FPL customers may see some relief when their electric bill comes in .
Florida Power &amp; Light Company announced Monday a plan to issue a one-time decrease of nearly 25% for the typical residential customer bill as a result of lower fuel costs amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic .
The plan would go into place pending approval by the Florida Public Service Commission 's approval and would vary by rate class .
" Everyone at FPL understands how critical it is to continue to provide reliable electricity and to keep as much money as possible in our customers ' pockets , " said FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy .

However , challenging times call for exceptional measures .
