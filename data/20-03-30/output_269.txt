Covid-19 : Government Procurement extends key contracts  New Zealand Government Procurement and Property is planning to extend some all-of-government contracts that were set for expiry or renewal in 2020 .
The extensions will be for a further 12 months at least from expiry or renewal , but with a view to returning to market " once things have returned to normal " .
A return to market may be earlier than the full period of extension , the agency said in a notice yesterday .
The agency has also decided to cancel some current sourcing activity related to accommodation projects for government agencies and has given notice that , while proceeding , the timeframes of an all of government media procurement 's could be affected .
While most of the categories to be extended are not tech related -- covering advertising and design services , electricity and alternative risk financing , the IT hardware contract , due to expire in September , is included .
" We intend to seek an extension to current arrangements for at least 12 months , and allow the option of seeking to appoint additional panel providers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Earlier this month , Procurement warned agencies of the potential impact of Covid-19 on hardware supply chains and asked agencies to limit their demand .
" With this in mind we are asking that you limit work with your supplier to urgent requirements you have , or any planned procurements you have already in progress .
" Please do n't send in large orders as this will only cause more issues .
"  To ease the requirements on suppliers , Procurement has also decided delay the collection of quarterly reports from them for quarter 3 , 2019/20 .
" This means we will also not be collecting the administration fee due under those contracts at this time , " the notice said .
" We expect to collect reporting , and suppliers will be invoiced for the Quarter 3 and 4 administration fee , at the end of Quarter 4 .
