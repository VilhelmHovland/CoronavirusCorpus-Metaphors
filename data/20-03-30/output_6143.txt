The P5,000 to P8,000 worth of social amelioration programs is based on the maximum subsidy per region determined from the region 's minimum wage levels as these are close approximations to the amount needed to buy basic food , medicine , and hygiene essentials .

Likewise , Livelihood Assistance Grants ( LAG ) will be provided to a beneficiary-family of the Department 's Sustainable Livelihood Program ( SLP ) with at least one member who is a worker in the informal sector and is displaced due to the declaration of the community quarantine .
The family must be in the master list endorsed by the LGU to the DSWD Field Office ( FO ) and must still undergo assessment by a DSWD staff .
The LAG will be given after the quarantine period has been lifted to help the families start anew .
