Stop Body Shaming During the Outbreak  A pandemic is not a reason to be unkind to your body or the bodies of others .
With people around the world hunkering down at home in hopes of flattening the curve of this pandemic , COVID-themed memes and jokes have been proliferating .
From hilarious threads about what one 's co-workers ( i .
, kids and pets ) are doing to virus-themed songs , it 's clear we are all looking for a smile during this time of stress .
But in addition to home-schooling fails and jokes about wearing sweatpants 24-hours a day , we 're also seeing a barrage of memes focused on weight gain and binge eating .
Memes referencing " the Covid-19 " as a variant of the " the Freshman 15 " are making the rounds , as are memes suggesting that those with anorexia have been " training for this moment " of food scarcity .
Social media comments about bingeing on comfort food seem to pop up roughly as often as guidance on how to wash one 's hands appropriately .
Here are three very good reasons to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
First , let 's talk about fat-shaming .
When you make comments suggesting that gaining weight is one of the worst things that could happen to you during this outbreak , you 're sending a clear message to everyone whose body is bigger than yours -- and it 's not a nice message .
You 're using the bodies of people heavier than you as a punchline .
People of all body shapes and sizes are suffering right now .
Researchers have generated piles of evidence that weight-related shaming and teasing is linked with increased negative health outcomes .
Although you may not realize it , when you speak negatively about your own body size or about gaining weight , you may be shaming others who see your posts .
If you post about how awful it would be if you gained 20 pounds during a quarantine , what might that communicate to the person who weighs 20 pounds ( or more ) more than you do ?  Here 's a second reason to think twice before posting weight and eating-related jokes and memes .
Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time right now .
Food scarcity ( whether actual or imagined ) can trigger eating disordered thoughts and behaviors .
Extreme stress can also provoke binge eating .
Those living with bulimia or binge eating disorder may be having a very difficult time managing their symptoms right now .
Memes and posts that treat bingeing like a joke do a disservice to those who might be struggling to manage serious eating disordered behavior .
Finally , please remember that disparaging comments about your own body can hurt you -- even if it feels like you 're just poking fun at yourself .
Engaging in negative body talk tends to make people feel worse about their own bodies .
If you 're struggling with body image concerns during this difficult time , try some positive distraction instead of disparaging your body .
Take a moment to write an encouraging text or email to someone you care about .
Look at a picture of a cute animal .
Research how you can support vulnerable members of your community and find one way to help .
Remember that times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others ' .
Be gentle with the people around you , the people on your social media feed , and yourself .
Instead of focusing on weight gain , take this opportunity to show compassion to your body .
In doing so , you may also find it easier to show compassion to others .
Remember that many therapists are offering online sessions during this period .
If you need help , please seek it out .
A virtual therapy session is absolutely better than no session at all .

But as you make those connections , try not to make them at the expense of your own body or the bodies of others .
You are more than the shape of your body and so are the people around you .
Use your social media feeds to spread hope , cheer , or useful information instead of body shaming .
