As well as ordering schools to stay open despite mounting pressure to close them , he also implemented a 14-day self-isolation for every person entering Australia and banned handshakes across the country .
" People are naturally anxious about the issues of schools , " he said , encouraging a policy of " social distancing " amongst children where they stay 1 .
metres apart from each other at school .
He also said the mass closure of schools could make the " coronavirus situation worse , not better " .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions on how Australia will deal with the spread of COVID-19 .
Picture : Richard DobsonSource:News Corp Australia  Understandably , Australians have a lot to say about the outcome of the special national cabinet meeting held earlier today , with the hashtag #LockUsDown quickly gaining momentum on Twitter .
Worried parents took to the social media to message the PM directly about their concerns , begging him to shut the schools .
One mum asked Mr Morrison to " get better advice " after explaining she wants her kids home to protect them from getting sick as others asked if he was " joking " .
Hey @ScottMorrisonMP you think us parents who want our children out of schools would let them roam the shopping centres , movie theatres and streets ? NO , we want them home with US so our families do n't get sick .
Get better advice .
Quick question as someone with 4 kids - including 3 the same age so I kinda have a mini-school in my house - how exactly are kids and teachers going to stay 1 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in practice in a preschool **44;407;TOOLONG  It was n't just the decision to keep schools open and force kids to remain 1 .
apart that had Australians up in arms , with the self-quarantine rule ruffling feathers .
Some pointed out the huge amount of " trust " that goes into relying on people to isolate themselves without any intervention , leading many to ask for Mr Morrison to " close the borders " .
Umm from flights and manifestos info maybe ? They will be ordered to self quarantine ? More a trust thing I 'd say that people will do it , but closing the BORDERS will stop the spread and allow authorities to TRY and contain the virus .
We hope .
