The Other Virus Test : Who 's a True Leader ?  The crisis exposes the lethal venality of Trump and other honchos .
How does Trudeau rate ?  Michael Harris , a Tyee contributing editor , is a highly-awarded journalist and documentary maker .
Author of Party of One , the bestselling expos ? of the Harper government , his investigations have sparked four commissions of inquiry .
Announcements , Events &amp; more from Tyee and select partners  If that happens , as it has to 5,596 Canadians , a lot of things suddenly matter : age , pre-existing health conditions , timely testing , medical equipment , frontline staff , and sadly , a will .
Where you actually are , a fact that is not much talked about , is crucially important .
The pandemic is throwing into high relief the lethal effects of incompetent leadership beyond our borders , and sharpening contrasts with what 's happening in Canada .
A report card is in order .
Justin Trudeau  In Canada , both the federal government and the provinces grasped fairly quickly how serious the current situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the country 's policy compass .
It is still unknown if anyone can collectively stop the virus in its tracks ; but at least no Canadian political leader is minimizing the risks -- or offering hunches and hearsay remedies .
During his daily press conferences on the outbreak , the prime minister has urged Canadians to stay home and practise social-distancing .
He himself has been doing that ever since his wife Sophie tested positive for the virus .
Thankfully , she has now recovered .
With all provinces having now declared an emergency , Trudeau has stopped short of ordering a federal lockdown .
But the PM has stressed that his government is monitoring the situation in the provinces very closely .
If things get dicey , if it looks like any jurisdiction might be overwhelmed , the PM will invoke his emergency powers and ride to the rescue -- or so the script goes .
The weakest part of Canada 's response is the relatively small number of people who have been tested country-wide -- just 184,000 as of Sunday .
By comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea 's current daily test capacity is an astonishing 15,000 .
As is the case in many countries , Canada has a shortage of testing kits .
It also takes days to confirm results .
So provincial governments are trying to preserve their stockpiles by limiting testing .
One of the ways to do that is to advise people who develop symptoms of the virus to self-isolate at home .
The problem with that ? It satisfies only a small part of the best advice of the World Health Organization -- to isolate , test , treat and trace .
Canada did n't do all that quickly enough and now 65 per cent of known cases are the result of community transmission .
On the economic front , the PM has passed a $107-billion aid package to help workers and businesses , including $2,000 per month for the next four months for Canadians who lose their jobs .
Far from perfect , lots of holes , premised on a big dose of trust , and we 're not out of the woods by a long shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a plan .
For empathy and energy in tough times ( the real test is yet to come in the form of performance outcomes ) , Trudeau gets a B+ .
Boris Johnson  The United Kingdom has embarrassed itself and endangered its citizens .
When the house is on fire , it is the wrong time for thumb-sucking indolence .
You either put it out , or you do n't .
Johnson stood pat in the early days of COVID-19 , while more aggressive governments in France , Denmark and Germany took heed after the virus was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11 .
They locked down their countries , and closed their schools and businesses .
Like China , Singapore and South Korea , they began the tough work of " flattening " the curve of the infection by aggressive testing .
While others practised social-distancing , Johnson publicly celebrated Brexit Day .
In a dreadful lapse of judgment , PM Johnson only got around to locking down the U .
this week .
Now he himself has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
One-thousand and nineteen Britons have died .
Having lost faith in their prime minister , ordinary citizens are trying to look after themselves , and set an example to their government -- hoping that the National Health Service does n't collapse under the weight of COVID-19 .
As John Crace put it in the Guardian : These days in the U .
, the regular people are " the lions leading the donkeys .
" The lead donkey is the PM .
For his damaging indecisiveness , Boris the Old Etonian gets an F for fooling around , and a dunce cap .
Jair Bolsonaro  Then there is Brazil .
You do n't want to be in the land of the bossa nova if COVID-19 comes calling .
True , by order of local authorities , hundreds of towns and cities are closed down tighter than an oyster .
But the country is run by Jair Bolsonaro .
This irresponsible blowhard says that as an ex-athlete , the virus would not have much impact on him .
He also says that the real disaster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Never mind the pandemic , it 's the economy stupid -- the same argument he used to give the green light to burning so much of the Amazon rainforest .
There is a reason he is known as " The Trump of the Tropics .
"  Bolsonaro has described COVID-19 as a " fantasy " and " small flu .
" He says mayors and state governors should roll back their lockdown measures .
He believes those measures amount to " scorched earth policies .
" People are " overstating " the power of the virus , maybe for " political reasons .
" His bottom line ? " Some will die .
I 'm sorry .
That 's life .
"  All this with over 600,000 people infected worldwide , 30,000 deaths , and no end in sight .
Brazil has 3,900 of those active cases and 114 of the deaths .
The Mr .
Magoo of this pandemic , Bolsonaro gets an F for having his head in his ass .
Donald Trump  Another place you do n't want to be in this pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington for its response to COVID-19 .
President Donald Trump has been dazzlingly irresponsible .
This is the man who just a few weeks ago , during the Feb .
26 press conference of his Coronavirus Task Force , griped about investing $2 .
billion in the fight against COVID-19 .
A scant 30 days later , the stimulus package he just signed , and is now taking credit for , calls for nearly $2 trillion -- half a trillion of it for corporations .
There is n't room enough in the Guinness Book of Records for the magnitude of his miscalculation , hubris and stupidity .
Two days after Trump offered just $2 .
billion to combat COVID-19 , he revealed what he really thought of the whole thing .
On Feb .
28 , the president told a campaign rally in North Carolina that the pandemic was the " new hoax " of the Democrats .
Or as Fox News reported it , another attempt at impeaching the president .
Trump has constantly minimized , trivialized and brushed off the enormous threat of COVID-19 , reminding Americans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling for a ban on cars .
He has even mis-prescribed medicine to treat the virus , and an elderly Arizona couple followed Dr .
Trump 's advice .
They took a version of the drug , chloroquine phosphate , which they had purchased for cleaning their aquarium .
The 68 year-old husband died , and his wife , speaking by phone from an intensive care unit said this to Vaughn Hilliard of NBC news :  " Trump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure .
"  When 3 .
million Americans , two per cent of the entire workforce , applied for unemployment insurance for the week ending March 21 , the president changed his tune .
Coronavirus was now a hot mess .
And it was all former-president Barack Obama 's fault for the crummy system he left to Trump to deal with situations like a pandemic .
For the record , Trump is the guy who in 2018 dismantled the Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense , the agency set up by then-president Obama in the wake of the Ebola outbreak .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization .
Here is his explanation :  " I do n't like having thousands of people around when you do n't need them .
When we need them , we can get them back very quickly .
"  Trump 's response time to the pandemic is consistent with his preparedness for it .
South Korea tested 66,000 people within a week of the first case of community transmission of the coronavirus .
The U .
dithered for three weeks before reaching that number of tests .
Now the horse is out of the barn .
Containment became mitigation when the federal government fell asleep at the switch of timely and aggressive testing .
At this moment , Trump 's test kits are promissory notes lost in the mail , and the messaging of this self-styled " stable genius " has been incoherence in overdrive .
His much promised personal protective equipment for medical workers is trickling out of federal stockpiles like tree sap creeping down a window pane .
Trump is the Nero of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns .
For putting doctors and nurses to work in homemade masks and plastic garbage bags as protective gowns ; for promoting a return to normalcy by Easter against all the medical and scientific advice ; for deciding the economy is more important than people , Trump gets an F for F-off and booted out of school .
The Texas brain trust  Another place you do n't want to be if you contract COVID-19 is the state of Texas .
For starters , Republican Governor Greg Abbott continues to resist a stay-at-home order for all Texans .
For another , his lieutenant-governor , 69 year-old Dan Patrick , made headlines with his suggestion that the country should be open for business again because " lots of grandparents " are willing to die for the Trump economy .
Elderly people , of course , are the most at-risk demographic in this pandemic .
For its obsession with business-as-usual , and its gross insult to the elderly , Texas , gets an F for failure and an L for the Looney Star state .
Various Christian clerics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this pandemic is church .
Let it be clear : most traditional churches have reacted admirably in this crisis , cancelling services in the name of social-distancing .
Some of them have taken their sermons to Facebook and YouTube , and other social media platforms like pray .
They get it .
But a number of religious leaders , including some conservative Christians , have pushed back hard on the demand by secular authorities to practise social-distancing .
As reported by CNN , Cardinal Raymond Burke recently argued that church attendance should be defined as an " essential " behavior akin to grocery shopping .
Rusty Reno , editor of the religious magazine First Things , wrote that " the mass shutdown of society to fight the spread of COVID-19 creates a perverse , even demonic atmosphere .
" He referred to the " false god " of saving lives , and the " many things " that are more precious than life .
One Louisiana pastor cited in the CNN story recently presided over a service of 1,825 congregants , because he holds his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " politically motivated .
"  With universities from New York to California shuttering to stop the spread of the virus , Pastor Jerry Falwell Jr .
has refused to close Liberty University , his private evangelical school .
The good news is that most of Liberty students take their classes online .
The bad news is that Falwell is welcoming 57 per cent of his students who live on campus back to their dorms .
Why is he going in the opposite direction of Yale , Harvard and Berkeley ? Because he thinks the pandemic has been " overblown " and may be a plot to hurt the president .
At least that 's what he told Fox and Friends .
Finally , there is Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne .
Browne told his large flock that he would only close his church when the Rapture comes .
He even asked all his congregants to shake hands .
" Well I know that they do n't want us to do this , but just turn around and greet two or three people .
Tell them you love them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practising a brand of Christianity Jesus could not recognize , for worrying more about empty churches than full graveyards , elements of the religious right get an F for fundamentalist failure .
( They should , however , be thanked for providing another argument for the wisdom of separating church and state .
)  New York 's governor and NYC 's mayor  New York City and its state are once again ground zero for a catastrophe .
Both Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio are fighting with tenacity , imagination and rationality .
Game Over for Kenney  They are converting convention centres , retrofitting hospitals to increase their capacity , inviting retired health-care workers to come back to the frontline , and aggressively trying to buy the medical necessities Washington is not supplying .
If they are overwhelmed in their heroic last stand , it will not be for lack of trying .
Of the two , Cuomo was earlier to respond to the alarm and has shown the more grace and guts under pressure .
So Cuomo gets and A while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faltering steps , receives a B+ .
Back to you and me and the coronavirus .
It comes down to these factors : What directs the thinking in the jurisdiction where we live and the circles we move in ? Public health concerns ? Stock market impacts ? Political calculations ? Or conservative Christian considerations ?  All things in , this is a particularly good time to be a Canadian in Canada .
