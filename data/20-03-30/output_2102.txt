As coronavirus spreads , Canada turns inward  Politics Insider for March 17 : The PM bans most non-residents outside the U .
from entering Canada , Ontario takes more drastic measures on social distancing -- and Norway 's prime minister speaks directly to the children  This time last year , Canadians were waking up to pay homage to the Irish spirit of whimsy embodied by St .
Patrick 's Day .
This year , Canada is officially closed to Irish visitors -- and anyone else in the world , outside the U .
, who does n't already live in Canada .
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the stunning new border measures outside Rideau Cottage in Ottawa , where his fortnight of self-isolation continues .
The PM made a few exceptions for diplomats , flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said only four airports across the land -- in Vancouver , Calgary , Toronto and Montreal -- will accept most international arrivals .
The only non-domestic flights that can land elsewhere are inbound from the U .
, the Caribbean or the tiny French overseas territory of St .
Pierre et Miquelon , just off Newfoundland 's coast .
What about Canada 's longest border ? Trudeau 's latest measures invited an obvious question : Why did the U .
get an exemption ? The NDP said the feds ' decision to exempt American tourists " does n't make any scientific sense .
" After Trudeau spoke , Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland did n't rule out further measures on the Canada-U .
border , saying only that everyone involved in public health coordination was " constantly reviewing " possible next steps .
Health Minister Patty Hajdu referred to " critical supply chains " that require a " continental approach .

"  Canada 's chief medical officer of health , Theresa Tam , had simple advice for Canadians who are getting used to the idea of social distancing : " Act like you are quietly carrying the virus and do everything you can to stop spreading it to others .
" She described the window to " flatten the curve " of the COVID-19 epidemic in the same terms as last week : " narrow .

Shutting down day-to-day life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask of anyone .
But when public-health officials impose their will on citizens -- not by forcing , but by forcefully asking -- they enter a messy business .
Yesterday , when Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a suite of measures to ratchet up social distancing to save vulnerable peoples ' lives and protect vulnerable workers ' incomes , he stopped short of calling for the closure of bars and restaurants in the province .
But only hours later , Ontario 's medical health officer , David Williams , did ask those businesses to close as soon as possible .
Early yesterday , Toronto mayor John Tory -- who also remains isolated -- batted away rumours , run rampant over the weekend , that he would order shops to shut their doors .
Later in the day , the city 's top doctor , Eileen de Villa , followed in Williams ' footsteps -- not an edict , not yet , but certainly an urgent plea to local bars and restaurants that they close on what would otherwise be the biggest party day of the year .
( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier Doug Ford declared a state of emergency in Ontario , effective immediately .
The measure requires the closure of all indoor recreation programs , libraries , child care centres , bars and restaurants ( except those that can facilitate take out and delivery ) , and cinemas or venues with live music or theatre .

But they are expecting bloody quick action on imperfections .
And that action extends to clear , consistent and constant communication about everything that 's going on , even if it 's unbearably grim , for either the country or the party that 's in charge of government .
