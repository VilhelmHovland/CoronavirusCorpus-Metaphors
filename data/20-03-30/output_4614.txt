Meanwhile , Australians who were on board the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship and placed in compulsory quarantine earlier this week in the Swissotel in Sydney have been critical about the handling of the policy .
" We were totally unaware we would be held here against our will and forced to stay in a hotel , rather than go home to our home , " Cathy Poole , 72 , told SBS News on Saturday - her third day under guard at the hotel .
" The food is not palatable , it is cold .
" There are no fresh towels , no cleaning being done ! "  Australia has 3,873 COVID-19 cases , with the majority in NSW - 1,791 .
That figure includes 207 people with an unidentified source of transmission , indicating local transmission is growing .
Sixteen people have died from the virus .
