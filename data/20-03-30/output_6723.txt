Congress and President Trump just passed the largest government bailout in world history but the over $2 trillion package will exclude millions of residents that do not have Social Security numbers ( SSN ) and even some that do but live in a household with others that do not .
The coronavirus stimulus package , called the CARES Act ( Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act ) includes billions of dollars to provide one-time checks to individuals , with amounts ranging from $1,200 per adult and $500 per child in a household .
But the bill also contains language that requires applicants for the relief checks to have valid SSNs , meaning that the estimated 21 million people that have Individual Tax Identification Number ( ITIN ) used for filing tax returns will not qualify for any relief money .
ITINs are issued to people that do not qualify for Social Security numbers , usually because of their immigration status , but also includes survivors of domestic violence , Cuban and Haitian entrants , student visa -- holders , and certain spouses and children of individuals with employment visas .
The CARES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a " mixed-status " household with someone with an ITIN or with people without a SSN .
A " mixesd-status " family would not qualify for any CARE Act assistance .
There are en estimated 21 million individuals with ITINs , according to the IRS .
In 2015 , ITIN holders paid over $11 .
billion in state and local taxes and $23 .
billion in federal taxes using ITINs .
" Shamefully , several million immigrants and their families across the country who are working and paying taxes will not receive a dollar from this COVID-19 relief package , " the National Immigration Law Center said in a statement released after President Trump signed the bill .
" Immigrants are on the front lines confronting this virus in our health care sector , harvesting food for our tables , and caring for our loved ones .
We had hoped our congressional leaders would have done the right thing and included them in this relief package .
"  It is estimated that 93 .
of tax filers will qualify for a stimulus check .
People who make up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $1,200 .
Couples who file joint taxes and make less than $150,000 are eligible for $2,400 .
Parents can also receive an additional $500 for each child .
For people who earn over $75,000 , check amounts will be reduced by $5 for every $100 of income above $75,000 .
For example , a person that earns $80,000 will receive $100 less than the full check , but checks will be limited to those earning $99,000 a year or more , or couples earning $198,000 or more .
Qualifications are based on the income reported in the last tax return filed , either 2018 or 2019 .
If individuals ' incomes have fallen since their last tax return , they will still have to qualify on their past income levels .
