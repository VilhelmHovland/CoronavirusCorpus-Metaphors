Coronavirus accelerating rapidly , warns WHO  But it is still possible to change its trajectory , the world body added  Web Desk March 24 , 2020 08:27 IST  Railway passengers wear protective masks , in Kolkata Salil Bera  The World Health Organisation on Tuesday warned that the COVID-19 pandemic is clearly " accelerating " , but said it was still possible to " change the trajectory " of the outbreak .
to AFP data , the global deaths have crossed the 15,000 mark , with more than 3,41,000 infected worldwide .
" The pandemic is accelerating , " WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said , according to reports .
" It took 67 days from the beginning of the outbreak in China in late December for the virus to infect the first 100,000 people worldwide .
comparison , it took 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases , " he said .
The number of cases is believed to represent only a fraction of the true number of infections , with many countries only testing the most severe cases in need of hospitalisation .
" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this pandemic , " Tedros said .
called for a mixed approach , which he likened to a football match , after he and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino jointly launched a campaign aimed at spreading the message of how to protect against infection " to kick out coronavirus .
" " You ca n't win a football game only by defending .
You have to attack as well , " he said .
" Asking people to stay at home and other physical distancing measures are an important way of slowing down the spread of the virus and buying time , but they are defensive measures that will not help us to win , " he warned .
" To win , we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics , " he said , reiterating a call for " testing every suspected case , isolating and caring for every confirmed case and tracing and quarantining every close contact .
"  Tedros praised the great energy being put into research and development to find a vaccine and of drugs to treat COVID-19 .
But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been proven to be effective against COVID-19 , " and warned against the use of drugs not proven to work against the disease .
" Using untested medicines without the right evidence could raise false hope and even do more harm than good , and cause a shortage of essential medicines that are needed to treat other diseases , " he said .
Among other things , countries are looking at using antimalarial drugs as a treatment against the new coronavirus .
India is currently facing a surge of cases , with infections in excess of 450 now .
Almost all states are under a partial or complete lockdown , Maharashtra and Punjab being the first ones to invoke whole-state curfews .
, however , have allayed fears of a community transmission .
" So far there 's no confirmation of any community transmission , " Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said .
The Union health ministry maintains that there was no evidence of community spead and that these specific cases was still being looked into .
The Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus pandemic that has hit over 100 countries , hinting there is no community transmission of the virus .
In stage 2 , the disease is transmitted locally from infected persons who are in close contact or from those who travelled abroad .
The source of the virus can be traced easily , as opposed to community transmission stage 3 -- the phase in which people are unable to identify how they got the virus .
If community transmission begins , it would be extremely difficult for governments to contain the rapid spread of the disease .
At Stage 4 , the situation is similar to that of Wuhan , where the disease spread like wildfire .
