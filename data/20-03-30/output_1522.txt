COMMENT It was recently reported that the Ministry of Health is preparing for a " third wave " of Covid-19 cases .
Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah has described this potential third wave as a " tsunami " .
According to him , he received information that a particular ministry had approved 8,000 of its staff to go on leave overseas for the school holidays , which began on March 14 , 2020 .
This would mean that throughout the movement control order ( MCO ) that started on March 18 , 2020 , there is the possibility that a significant number of Malaysians would be overseas and they would be returning to Malaysia .
I asked this very same question on Twitter a few days ago .
And while many who responded were similarly concerned , there were a few who berated me for purportedly " politicising " the issue .
" Do not politicise this crisis ! What has happened , give solutions , do not blame anyone .
"  The phrase " stop politicising the crisis " has been bandied about ever since the MCO was announced .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for partisan politics , the phrase " stop politicising " has become a mantra to silence those who question the actions of the government in dealing with this crisis .
In the case of the 8,000 ministry staff , it would be fair to ask why their leave was not revoked before the school holidays .
The leave would have been approved earlier but it could still be revoked , especially since the World Health Organisation declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 12 , 2020 .
We could also argue that the government could have decided to impose the MCO earlier than March 16 , 2020 , when it was clear that the number of positive cases was on the rise since March 13 and 14 , 2020 .
These questions are valid in light of the fact that significant resources would need to be channelled if there is indeed a third wave " tsunami " , not to mention the possibility that the MCO would be extended further .
Similarly , the government has recently announced that NGOs would not be allowed to provide aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nearest Welfare Department office .
Many have again questioned this and asked the government to reconsider , since there is every possibility that the Welfare Department offices would not be able to cope with the influx of aid , among other issues .
In times of crisis , there is certainly more leeway given to the government .
But that does not mean that it is allowed to do as it pleases , without scrutiny or criticism .
The government is not perfect .
Scrutiny and criticisms , if done the right way , can improve how it operates .
As responsible citizens , we must continue to voice out to ensure that whatever measures and decisions made by the government would be truly beneficial to the people .
This is not to score political points or to oppose for the sake of opposing , but to ensure that the country can pull through in these trying times .
