Buybacks in the time of coronavirus  Published : March 18 , 2020 6:45:24 AM  Being denied the legitimate tool of OMOs for buyback of shares due to double-taxation caused by administrative realities is a cross that India Inc ca n't bear , certainly not at a time of crisis like this .

By Siddarth Pai and TV Mohandas Pai  Due apologies to Gabriel Garc ? a M ? rquez , but the markets ' tryst with the novel coronavirus mirrors the fate of Urbino from the novel ; a life cut short by an incident entirely out of the left field .
The coronavirus 's effect on humanity is truly ubiquitous as no aspect of life is left untouched by this .
The immediate effects are palpable in the rising death count and falling stock market .
As one trader wryly put it , during Holi , the festival of colours , the only colour that investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives is the litres of ink spilt by journalists and pundits about the crash .
At times like these , sound policy becomes paramount .
The US Fed cut its rates to zero ; other central banks worldwide followed suit to pump in liquidity , but RBI , after the conference on March 16 , is yet to do so .
Sebi , in a bid to arrest the downslide , is mooting the suspension of short-selling as well .
All the regulators worldwide are looking to bring back confidence and prevent a rout from destroying value .
At such critical stages , companies announce buybacks through market purchases to stem the decline in stock prices and stabilise them .
Flexibility in the management of capital created by the boards of companies also plays a crucial role in such situations .
Price stabilisation in the form of buybacks sends a strong signal to the market , boosts sentiment and allays fears .
But India 's tax policy penalises the ability of firms to buy back their stocks at times of grave crisis through open market operations ( OMOs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wrongful capitalisation and the contrivances available to achieve optimal capital .
Buybacks emerge as a powerful tool to help normalise the stock price when it does n't reflect the inherent value of the shares , due to market forces of firm-specific issues .
Buybacks can happen through two channels : a tender offer from existing shareholders on a proportionate basis , or OMOs , where the company acts as a buyer of their shares at a certain price .
India 's history of buyback taxation has also evolved .
During force majeure events such as the coronavirus sell-off , buybacks via open-market are a show of confidence by the board to stabilise the stock price and help return cash and liquidity to the market .
But our adverse tax policies prevent this .
Governments the world over have realised the need for this , and created systems to allow for such operations , with shareholder and regulatory approvals .
In India , Sebi has also created frameworks for the same .
But here , as it is with many policies in India , tax plays an inordinate role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eternal tussle between the taxman and businesses , where capital marker decisions like buybacks or dividends are increasingly looked at with suspicion , it is important to analyse the provenance of India 's Buy Back Tax ( BBT ) and Dividend Distribution Tax ( DDT ) framework .
Before April 1 , 2013 , DDT was at 16 .
, whereas BBT did n't exist for companies ; the Long-Term Capital Gains ( LTCG ) rate for listed shares was also 0 , with buybacks being taxed in the hands of the shareholders .
Due to the divergence between the two frameworks , buybacks via proportionate tender offers began to be used as a means of returning capital to shareholders instead of dividends .
Slowly , the tax administration began to change the tax structures by taxing long-term capital gains in listed shares and dividends above certain thresholds .
This led to the absurdity of triple taxation of dividends , which was previously written about by the authors -- wherein dividends paid out of post-tax profits ( Tax #1 ) , had DDT levied on them ( Tax #2 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakh ( Tax #3 ) .
Similar to how constant tinkering led to the absurdity of dividend taxation , buybacks are now burdened owing to restructuring .
Before July 5 , 2019 , there was no BBT on listed companies and shareholders had to pay tax ( LTCG ) the same way they did on any regular transfers .
But since the fateful July 5 , 2019 budget , a buyback tax of effectively 23 .
( with surcharge and cess ) has been introduced .
Buybacks , in theory , were supposed to be exempt in the hands of shareholders ( under section 10(34A) of the Income Tax Act , 1961 ) ( see graphic ) .
But as the famous Yogi Berra once remarked , " In theory , there is no difference between theory and practice ; in practice , there is .
"  The BBT makes sense when it comes to proportionate tender offers to shareholders since the shareholder details and number of shares is determined and , thus , the tax-exempt status afforded to the shareholder , to prevent double taxation , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the traceability of the buyer ca n't be made , leading to a distortion wherein the company pays a BBT of 23 .
, and the shareholder pays LTCG of 10% on the same share .
Although Sebi 's Buyback Regulations , 2018 , state that the company 's name should appear as a purchaser for OMO , the systems to administer this remain wanting .
In the interim , to exacerbate matters , the company pays tax on the difference between its historic issue price and the buyback price , whereas shareholder pay tax on the difference between the sale and purchase price .
Thus , the taxman collects tax from the shareholders on every single transfer since the initial issue , and from the company as well on the final difference between the issue and buyback price .
The spectre of double taxation returns ( see graphic ) .
This also penalises buybacks to stabilise stock prices at times of stock market crashes !  The government and tax officials often speak about rewarding and respecting the honest taxpayer and improving ease of doing business , but such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide .
The buyback tax announced on July 5 , 2019 , was defended by the then finance secretary at a CII event where he said that the stated purpose of the tax was to disincentivise buybacks and encourage investments .
But , finance practitioners will attest that buybacks and dividends are a means of returning money to investors and shareholders when the company ca n't locate any viable investments for the money so accumulated and in times of such precipitous falls .
This will prevent investment adventurisms with shareholder funds or forays into ventures wherein the company does n't have any expertise .
Investments ca n't be forced ; they need to be nurtured and using tax-disincentives as a tool to spur investments is value- and sentiment-destructive .
As for the tax terpsichorean trysts between DDT and BBT , the arbitrage still exists due to the selective application of the " super-rich surcharge " amongst investors .
The taxation of dividends at the slab rates for individuals leads to an absurd 42 .
tax for individuals and family trusts whereas the BBT remains at 23 .
, inclusive of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is waived on incomes including dividends , have protection under their DTAAs and enjoy a lower rate on dividends as compared to buybacks .
Indian taxpayers deserve well-thought-out and well-articulated tax policies which do n't require a litany of clarifications and circulars and amendments to rectify the unintended but inevitable consequences of badly-drafted policies .
Being denied the legitimate tool of OMOs for buybacks due to double-taxation caused by administrative realities is a cross that India Inc ca n't bear , not at a time of crisis like this .
Sebi , in its wisdom , also barred promoters from participating in OMOs .
Thus , it can not be claimed that such operations are a means of tax avoidance by promoters .
Such operations will instil confidence into the company and serve as a vote of confidence from the board .
At this critical time , with huge fall in stock prices and increased volatility , taxing buybacks from OMO , which can stabilise stock prices , is deeply detrimental to the financial markets .
such volatile times , reason should prevail and well-thought-out policy , to quote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the ocean , but it was heard at great depth and great distance " .
The call to afford listed companies a way out through OMO buybacks must not fall on deaf ears .
