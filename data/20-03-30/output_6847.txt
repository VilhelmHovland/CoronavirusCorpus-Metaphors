The Navajo Nation has issued an order and curfew .
And now , Arizona is following suit .
Confirmed COVID-19 cases have surpassed 1,000 , with cases in all 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 2% to 6% -- higher than state health officials would like .

And if enforcement is necessary , the order says people should be given a chance to comply first .
