Alberta heavyweight Tanner Boser waits for UFC to call again after COVID-19  His latest fight postponed because of the UFC 's inability to find a place to stage it due to COVID-19 , Alberta heavyweight Tanner ( The Bulldozer ) Boser is chilling in his condo with a couple of 40-pound dumbbells , a medicine ball and skipping rope .
" I make do , " says Boser , who normally trains twice a day at the gym .
The 28-year-old from Bonnyville , Alta .
, who now calls Edmonton home , landed on a March 28 UFC card originally scheduled for Columbus , Ohio , when Brazilian Carlos Felipe dropped out due to visa issues , according to the UFC .
Boser was to face American Jeff ( Lights Out ) Hughes .
The Nationwide Arena show was one of several the UFC had hoped to switch to Las Vegas -- behind closed doors -- but eventually had to postpone due to local restrictions on public gatherings .
So now Boser ( 17-6-1 ) is biding his time at home , offering up the occasional dry social media post .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocking chair literally all day and stare at the wall and my phone while listening to music and eating intermittently and be perfectly content , " he tweeted March 25 .
" I have n't even turned on Netflix yet .
I 'm a ( expletive deleted ) animal .
A sloth apparently , but an animal .
"  The good news is Boser was in fight shape when the COVID-19 lockdown came .
And the six-foot-two 246-pounder has a sponsorship deal with MealKraft , a local meal preparation service that drops off food once a week for him .
" As long as I do n't start eating like a complete dumpster , I 'm going to be all right here for a little while , " he said of his fitness level .
Like the rest of us , Boser is social-distancing with the exception of his girlfriend .
" I get in the odd home workout but I do n't have tons to work with here , " he said , referencing both space and equipment .
His part-time job as nightclub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist , he 's not sure whether he qualifies for any of the financial help the government has promised .
" I believe contractors are eligible for it .
I guess it 's something to look into because technically that 's what I am -- I 'm a contractor who was n't able to work due to the coronavirus .
I should be able to meet the criteria .
We 'll play by ear .
"  Pokemon Go , a mobile video game , is keeping him busy in the meantime .
" Even though I 'm stuck in my condo , I happen to live right by a PokeStop .
Anybody who 's a nerd in that way knows what that means .
"  Boser hopes that once the UFC gets rolling again , his fight will be near the top of the list .
But he also knows that he is early in his UFC career , with other more prominent names ahead of him .
Boser 's UFC career has been a case of hurry up and wait .
He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 last July in Edmonton , only to learn two days before the fight that opponent Giacomo Lemos had failed a drug test ( the Brazilian was eventually suspended for two years ) .
He finally got to fight last October , opening a televised UFC card in Boston with a unanimous decision over six-foot-seven Daniel ( Daddy Long Legs ) Spitz .
In December , Boser lost a decision to French kickboxer Ciryl ( Bon Gamin ) Gane on a UFC card in Busan as he added South Korea to a fight resume that already includes Australia , England , Kazakhstan , Russia and the United Arab Emirates .
The Hughes matchup would have been his third bout in some five months .
Instead it 's back to the waiting game .
" There 's lots of unpredictable scenarios that can and often do go down , " he said of the fight game .
" This obviously is a complete black swan event nobody could have foreseen .
"  Boser has shown he belongs in the UFC and , despite losing to Gane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " I needed to do more of them but I was n't able to find more of them , " he said .
" I know if I could establish more leg-kicks and kind of get the rhythm going that way in my favour , that I can beat anybody .
But he knew that I needed to do that and I wanted to do that and I was only able to get off a handful of good leg-kicks on him -- not enough to start to bring the momentum of the fight in my favour .
"  Gane , a skilled striker adept at controlling the range , landed some hard blows midway through the second round .
" They did n't rock me or anything but then it kind of snowballs , " said Boser .
" He gets ahead and I have to try and catch up .
I 'm trying to get my leg-kicks going but it 's not working .
And then by Round 3 , he landed some big shots on me .
That 's just the way she went .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noting how respectful and engaged the fans were .
" That part was for sure enjoyable .
Trying to finding food that I wanted to eat there was the part I did n't like , " he added with a chuckle .
