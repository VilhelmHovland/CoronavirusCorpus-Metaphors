None of that mattered to most anybody who stepped inside the landmark of North American roller hockey , though , and after 25 years , the sudden shutting of its doors leaves many yearning for that blended stench of hot air , sweaty hockey pads and fresh popcorn just one more time .
" It was a heartbreaking feeling , " said Grand Rapids Griffins forward and Clinton Township native Tyler Spezia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment facility for 14 years .
" Joe Dumars is where I learned to play hockey .
It 's where I took my first strides as a hockey player .
It 's where I scored my first goal .
"  The fieldhouse is another victim in the nationwide effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic .
After Michigan Gov .
Whitmer 's mandated shutdown of all entertainment facilities , bars and restaurants went into effect last week , rumors began to spread on social media that the fieldhouse might be closing its doors for good .
That turned out to be the case , as employees have been told that the fieldhouse will not reopen .
This was posted on the fieldhouse 's Facebook page last week : " Because it is hard for us to say whether we will be able to open again after this mandated and extended closure , we wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you to each and every one of you for your continuous support over all of these years .
"  That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a financial situation that was never great to begin with , even before complications caused by the novel coronavirus arose .

In addition to two inline hockey rinks , the Shelby Township fieldhouse was home to 13 basketball courts , six indoor volleyball courts and three outdoor volleyball sand courts .
There was a full bar and restaurant , a mini bowling alley and a bayou-themed arcade center complete with whirlyball , high-ropes courses , arcade games , putt-putt , fowling and a rock-climbing wall .
In other words , it was a lot to lose .
But when the stay-home order is lifted , people will still have places to play basketball .
There are other arcades to visit .
A volleyball game can be started up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to eat at restaurants again .
The hockey , though ? There will be no replacing what Joe Dumars Fieldhouse meant to that community .
At its peak , it was somewhat of a mecca of roller hockey , fielding an estimated 13,000 teams through its doors between leagues and the tournaments during its lifespan .
Detroit Red Wings forwards Dylan Larkin and Sam Gagner were just a couple of the future NHL players to play on the sport-court tiles of Rinks A and B .
" A few people have said to me , roller hockey will never be the same in Detroit without the fieldhouse , " Koleski said .
" You lost a leader in the industry , you know ? After Detroit , I would say California is probably the only place that 's thriving with roller hockey right now .
"  Tyler Spezia ( Photo : Robin Buckson , Detroit News )  And yet , the number of games played , or the tournaments that will need a new venue , seem minimal in counting the overall impact of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless families over the years .
" I grew up there .
I was a ' rink rat , ' as you call it .
I knew everybody , I watched a lot of games , I knew all the refs , I knew all the people in the arcade , " Spezia said .
" It was like a kid 's playground in there for me .
"  There are hundreds that could relay a sentiment identical to Spezia 's .
Not all of them went on to play pro hockey , but this place , while fielding some very competitive roller hockey contests , was always more about the lighter sides of the game .
" People meet lifelong best friends through that place .
Every person that 's going to stand up in my wedding some day , I 've met at the fieldhouse , " said Tyler True , another Dumars staple who spent " seven days a week " playing and officiating games for much of his teens and early 20s .
" The coaches , the mentors , the trainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them is a huge thing , " True said .
" It was a huge thing for me .
My dad passed away at a young age , and Matt Koleski filled that spot in my life .
"  On any given Saturday , you 'd be hard pressed to come through the front door and walk 30 feet to Rink A without having to dodge a stinky 9-year-old in roller skates .
There 's not a table in the restaurant that was n't bumped into during a game of high-speed tag on wheels .
Complaining to the boss was never much help .
" Those will be my best memories , watching kids just tool around the lobby , 100 miles per hour , running into parents and stuff like that , " Koleski said .
" It 's fun to see those friendships , those relationships .
That 's what I 'm going to miss the most , is just seeing the friendly faces .
"  After returning to the area and joining the fieldhouse as a referee in 2000 , Koleski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller hockey operation , Kevin and Ken Houle , and countless others , helped the fieldhouse grow into a juggernaut within the industry .
They were intent on letting the kids be kids .
Koleski often opened up the rinks for free when there were n't games being played , and did whatever he could to make sure that there was always a team for someone to play on , no matter the circumstances .
" I think that 's what I 'm proud of , is that we were able to , no matter how many teams there were , how successful things were at that given time , that everyone was comfortable that walked through those doors , " Koleski said .
