UK hospitals trial new version of a breathing aid  LONDON , March 30 ( Reuters ) - A new version of a breathing aid that can help coronavirus patients has been developed in less a week by a team involving Mercedes Formula One , and is being trialled at London hospitals .
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) devices have been used in China and Italy to deliver air and oxygen under pressure to patients ' lungs to help them breathe without the need for them to go on a ventilator , a more invasive process .
The new CPAP has already been approved by the relevant regulator and now 100 of the machines will be delivered to University College London Hospital for trials , before being rolled out to other hospitals .

" These devices will help to save lives by ensuring that ventilators , a limited resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " UCLH critical care consultant Professor Mervyn Singer said in a statement on Monday .
" We hope they will make a real difference to hospitals across the UK by reducing demand on intensive care staff and beds , as well as helping patients recover without the need for more invasive ventilation .
"  The new breathing aid was developed by engineers and clinicians at UCLH teaming up with Mercedes-AMG High Performance Powertrains who worked at UCL 's MechSpace hub to reverse engineer a device that can be produced quickly .
Development of the new device took fewer than 100 hours from initial meeting to production of the first one .
The team working on it also includes Oxford Optronix , a small company that will manufacture the oxygen monitors for the CPAP devices .
Britain is shortly due to announce it has placed an order for 10,000 ventilators to be made by a consortium of companies including Ford , Airbus and Rolls-Royce as part of efforts to fight the coronavirus , an industry source told Reuters .
