Employees of British online retail store ASOS reportedly staged a walkout on Monday in Barnsley , England , to protest poor working conditions amid the coronavirus pandemic .
In a Facebook post , trade worker group GMB Union claimed that three ambulances were called Friday to an ASOS warehouse in Barnsley .
The group also said workers can not maintain social distancing and " are still not allowed to wear face masks .
"  The union demanded that the workplace be made safe for the workers or that warehouses be closed .
This is horrific .
ASOS workers have told us the company 's warehouse in Barnsley was visited by three ambulances .

No one has anywhere to go to wear their new looks anyway  On Sunday , ASOS defended its decision to remain open and insisted warehouse operations have " appropriate safety measures in place .
"  To protect jobs and the economy as much as possible , UK Government has advised online retail to stay open .
As the largest private employer in Barnsley , and with the support of Barnsley Council , we 're still operating with all appropriate safety measures in place .

" We totally refute these allegations .
They are false and do nothing more than serve to create panic and hysteria in an already uncertain time , " the spokesperson said in an emailed statement .
" In line with Government guidance , and with support from the Community Union and Barnsley Borough Council , we are striking the right balance between keeping our warehouse operational , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maintaining the health and safety of staff , which is always our number one priority .
Since the lockdown , we have introduced a range of additional health and safety measures and the Environmental Health Officer , who visited the site on Friday , confirmed he was happy with the protocols we have in place .
