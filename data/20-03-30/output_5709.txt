Last Updated : Monday 30 March 2020  The traditional interdependence of big farmers , land owners , workers and mill managements is presenting an interesting scenario in the sugar belt of south Gujarat , even as the novel coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) has rendered millions jobless across India .
The south Gujarat region covers the districts of Bharuch , Narmada , Surat , Tapi , Navsari , Valsad and the Dangs .
" South Gujarat is among the major sugar-producing belts of India .
We produce around 90 lakh quintals of sugar annually , " Sandeep Mangrola , the chairman of a co-operative mill , said .
There was an exodus from the region , mainly of migrant labourers , when the 21-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the night of March 24 , 2020 .
Most of them are adivasis ( from Scheduled Tribes ) , and hail from the Dangs as well as adjoining districts of Maharashtra .
" The labourers left in large numbers , walking towards the Dangs on roads and also towards Maharashtra , taking the railway route .
Their concerns were socio-economic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working very closely with the workers employed in sugarcane fields and sugar mills , said .
" They were concerned that they should be closer to the families .
With their ration cards and other government registrations that might get them some reprieve from the emerging dismal scenario at their native place , they did not want to be away .
The spread of various rumours added to their apprehensions , " he added .
Workers in both , sugar fields as well as mills , get their wages only at the end of the sugarcane harvest and sugar production season that extends up to April-end or even May in some cases .
" It is a sort of ' bonded ' labour model .
During their working days at the fields and the mills , the labourers are given jowar ( sorghum ) and some pittance as pocket money which they normally spend on bare essentials for survival , " Gamit underlined .
The lockdown , in such a scenario , was bound to multiply their apprehensions .
For the adivasis of Gujarat 's tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are luxuries .
They mainly consume coarse grains like jowar and ragi ( finger millet ) locally known as nagli .
A movement has been building in the region , seeking better wages and facilities for those employed in the sugar sector .
According to reports , sugarcane workers have been seeking higher wages , improved working and living conditions along with other social security benefits for the last five years .
There was a strike on February 28 that was ' crushed ' .
" Recalcitrant workers were asked to pack up and go home without settlement of their accounts .
Supervisors threatened workers , who had stopped work , that they would not be allotted farms for cutting sugarcane , " one report said .
On the other hand , mill and farm owners said they were helping their employees .
Mill managements as well as sugarcane farmers were taking care of their employees , ensuring that they got proper food and other necessities , Mangrola said .
" It is a two-way thing .
It is the peak of the harvest season and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Similarly , the mills need a consistent supply of sugarcane that can be processed for making sugar and extracting other by-products , " he said .
At present , only eight of the 15 sugar mills in the region were functional , according to Mangrola .
The paucity of sugarcane supply , which in turn , had been impacted by the slowing down of harvesting operations in the fields , was having an impact .
Around 150,000-200,000 workers were carrying out sugar production in the mills in the region currently , according to Gamit .
Harvesting sugarcane is a highly labour-intensive job in which harvesters have to stoop , slash and stack the individual stalks in a hot and humid surrounding .
Cane harvesting in the past was carried out mostly by slave labour since it was it was very demanding physically , according to experts .
Taking care of workers in the fields and mills had long been a tradition in Gujarat and was being followed currently , Ishvarsinh Patel , Gujarat 's minister of state for co-operatives , said .
" Community kitchens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in harvesting across the sugarcane belt of South Gujarat .
Similarly , dry rations are being provided to those working in the mills which they cook in the homes allotted to them in the labour colonies .
Their medical and other needs will also be taken care of , " he said .
