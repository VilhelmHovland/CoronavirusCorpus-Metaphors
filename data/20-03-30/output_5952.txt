A Kerala MP moved the Supreme Court on Monday following the death of a 70-year-old woman turned away from the Kerala-Karnataka border by the Karnataka police on Sunday despite repeated requests .
This was the second such incident in two days .
The border has been closed at 21 places , with 17 roads that connect Dakshin Kannada to Kerala blocked with barricades and piles of mud , The NewsMinute reported , amid a 21-day national lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus outbreak .
Kasaragod MP Rajmohan Unnithan moved court seeking direction to the Karnataka government to open its border for smooth movement of ambulances and other emergency vehicles during the lockdown .
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had twice written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the importance of the state highway and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Sunday , he also brought to the PM 's attention the death of the critically ill , elderly woman .
Vijayan called the Thalassery-Coorg State Highway 30 , connecting Kerala with Coorg in Karnataka via Veerajapetta , " a lifeline for the flow of essential commodities to Kerala .
"  " People of Kasaragod depend heavily on hospitals in Karnataka .
Hundreds of patients visit Mangaluru for dialysis and for emergency medical care .
Karnataka 's decision to blocking the borders has put the lives of these patients in trouble , " he wrote .
The woman , who suffered from a kidney disease , was being taken to a hospital in Mangaluru for treatment after she developed health complications , according to Malayala Manorama .
A day earlier , police had stopped a vehicle that was taking a 60-year-old Manjeshwaram to a hospital in Mangaluru .
The man later died because of breathing difficulties , the report said .
Dakshina Kannada District Collector Sindhu Roopesh told TNM that the decision to block people 's movement through Thalappady in Kasargode was made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service through Thalappady .
But people 's movements are restricted and everywhere , it 's the same , " she told TNM .
The movement of trucks and lorries carrying essential commodities between Karala and Karnataka is allowed only through Thalapady check post on NH 66 .
Minister-in-charge of Dakshina Kannada , Kota Sreenivas Poojary , and Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar both told Manorama that the restrictions could not be relaxed because of the Covid-19 outbreak .
In his plea to the Supreme Court , the Kasargod MP has called the blockade is a clear violation of Articles 21 and 19(d) of the Constitution at a time when supply of commodities is hit hard and the entire country is fighting a medical emergency .
He has sought a direction to Karnataka to register an FIR and constitute a Special Investigation Team ( SIT ) under the supervision of the court to enquire against the authorities concerned including the police officials whose action led to the death of two citizens .
Pinarayi 's letters to Modi  Pinarayi Vijayan sought Modi 's intervention on Sunday -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying essential commodities to the state were not blocked at the borders by Karnataka during the national lockdown .
In his letter to Modi , Pinarayi said it was " incorrect " to portray certain districts in the state as " highly affected " by the coronavirus .
Karnataka had justified blocking roads pointing that majority of the positive cases were from the bordering districts in Kerala and opening of the inter-state routes would lead to possibilities of the infection reaching the other side , Vijayan said .
However , this was " totally contrary " to the facts and ground realities , he said adding the incident of the virus spread in Kerala and border districts has been mainly noticed among people returning from abroad .
While pointing that the state had 165 COVID-19 cases as of Saturday and 1,34,370 were under observation as a precautionary measure , he said not all of them were positive for the virus .
The blockade by Karantaka police in the border areas on Thalassery-Coorg state highway goes against facilitating movement of essential commodities across the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lifted forthwith , he said .
At a time when the country faced an unprecedented crisis , " local and partisan vested interests " should not prevail over national interest , Vijayan said in his letter .
The Kerala government has no dispute on the fact that movement of people in a routine manner across the border during the lockdown should be prevented , but transportation of essential commodities should be ensured without any obstruction , he added .
