The Malay Mail reported that the number of hotspots designated as red zones has continued to grow in tandem with the increase in the total cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases every day .
For example , on March 21 , there were only six COVID-19 red zones nationwide ( including Johor Baru , Seremban , Titiwangsa ) and 12 orange zones nationwide ( including three in Sabah and Sarawak ) , but this then increased on March 24 to 10 red zones ( with the additions of Gombak , Kota Bahru , Tawau , Kuching ) while there were 10 orange zones nationwide ( as Gombak , Tawau , and Kuching were recategorised as red zones while Kota Kinabalu was added on ) .
As of March 25 , the number of red zones nationwide further increased to 13 ( with the additions of Kluang , Hilir Perak , Kinta that were originally orange zones ) and there were nine orange zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Based on the March 26 figures released yesterday , there are now 15 red zones throughout Malaysia , while there are eight orange zones ( with the addition of Kota Setar ) throughout the country .
This is due to Kepong in Kuala Lumpur and Klang in Selangor joining the list of red zones as of March 26 , with Kepong at 45 cases up from 38 cases on March 25 , while Klang is at 44 cases up from 35 cases on March 25 .
In the March 25 figures , there were a total of 39 districts spread out over seven states in Malaysia that still had not recorded any COVID-19 cases , with the bulk of these districts being in Sabah ( 11 districts ) and Sarawak ( 19 districts ) .
