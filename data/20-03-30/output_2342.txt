The CFL has postponed the start of training camps indefinitely in response to the spreading COVID-19 pandemic .
Full training camps had been scheduled to start May 17 .
THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods  TORONTO - Henoc Muamba 's two-year-old daughter , Thea , will remain a part of the Montreal Alouettes linebacker 's off-season workouts for a little while longer .
CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie postponed the start of training camps indefinitely Monday due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
It was hardly a surprise given the NHL , NBA , MLS , and Major League Baseball have all had to either suspend or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing global pandemic and the resulting directives issued by various governments make it unsafe to proceed with plans to gather our athletes and coaches together as scheduled , " Ambrosie said in a statement .
Rookie camps were scheduled to open May 13 with training camps starting four days later .
The CFL had already cancelled two regional combines and national combine while postponing its April 16 global draft .
The Canadian draft remains set for April 30 .
The novel coronavirus outbreak has forced CFL clubs to limit their facilities to only those players rehabbing injuries , and even then only one at a time .
Gyms across North America have also closed their doors , forcing many players to be innovative in their workouts .
So last week , Muamba and teammate James Wilder Jr .
both tweeted good-natured videos of them hoisting their young children above their heads as part of their new lifting regiments .
" You have to find a way , " Muamba said with a chuckle .
" As much as I know the league wants to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't do that until we know it 's going to be completely safe for players , coaches and fans alike .
"  As Montreal 's player rep , Muamba was n't surprised by the move .
The CFL and CFLPA have been discussing contingency plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
" Obviously it 's more challenging but at the end of the day it 's part of being a professional , " Muamba said .
" You have to find a way to stay prepared and ready for when the time comes that we 're all called in to training camp .
"  Brian Ramsay , the CFLPA 's executive director , said the league 's decision best serves all involved .
" The health , safety and well-being of all players is our priority during these extraordinarily uncertain times , " he said in a statement .
" And while it was n't an easy decision to postpone training camps , it 's in the best interest of our players , their families , fans and all those close to the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom suggests the CFL will have to also reschedule the start of its regular season , which is slated for June 11 .
And if that happened , the traditional 18-game campaign would have to be reduced in order get a season in and still have it culminate with the Grey Cup game Nov .
22 in Regina .
" As for our future plans , we are in the hands of our public health officials , " Ambrosie said .
" We acknowledge their timetable will be dictated by the virus itself .
" We will make further decisions when we can and share them with our fans and the public as soon as possible .
"  For veteran linebacker Marcus Ball , a CFL free agent , the later start to camp means more time to prepare and spend with his wife and two young children in Atlanta .
As a personal trainer in the off-season , Ball has been able to get in solid home workouts after suffering a season-ending knee injury in 2019 with Calgary .
" I think everyone kind of expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a very unfortunate situation .
but the CFL is a very strong , smart and aware league that 's always taken care of the players ' interests so this is no surprise for them to push back training camp .
" It will be a good thing because this ( COVID-19 ) is n't just in a particular region , it 's a world-wide pandemic and everyone is suffering from it .
This will give more time to plan and prepare , not to say I wanted or wished for more time , it 's having to play the cards you 're dealt .
"  And that could also mean more viewings for Ball of the Disney film Frozen 2 with his kids .
" Frozen 2 has been a crowd favourite right now , " Ball said .
" I 'm trying to get away from it but the kids love it .
" But it 's a dope movie , it 's pretty cool .
"  Running back Charlie Power of the Calgary Stampeders was expecting Monday 's announcement .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change their off-season workouts , it 's also creating potential financial concerns .
" The biggest impact has just been from everything closing down .
so you have to modify how you 're training , " he said .
" On the other side of things , it 's stretching the funds from last season to make sure you can make it until a season gets going .
" Everyone realizes this is bigger than football but at the same time players in the CFL are n't making the typical pro athletes ' salary where we can survive for a long time .
It 's about figuring out how to stretch those funds while at the same time staying motivated and realize there 's going to be a time when the season gets going again and you have to remain ready .
"  Receiver DeVier Posey , who signed with Hamilton this off-season as a free agent , saw the CFL 's decision coming .
" It makes total sense , " said Posey , the ' 17 Grey Cup MVP .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wakeup call and I hope everyone else understands what other skills they 're good and open their minds to the different platforms they can perform on .
" People in the medical world or who work other jobs like in grocery stores or garbage disposal , those people are true heroes .
We ( pro athletes ) are n't the true heroes of the country , we only provide the true heroes their entertainment and I am appreciating that perspective .
"  Muamba added times like this allow players to think more about life after football .
" I think it 's important for every player to analyse where they 're at in their life and career , " Muamba said .
" Just to kind of self reflect and see if you were to transition from the game , where exactly are you .
" The extra time gives us a chance to also dive into different things " .
