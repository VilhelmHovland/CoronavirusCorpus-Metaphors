A Global Shutdown and Continued Spread of the Coronavirus to Overshadow any Stats  Contributor  Bob Mason  Published  Mar 22 , 2020 8:23PM EDT  Earlier in the Day :  It was a quiet start to the week on the Asian economic calendar this morning .
There were no material stats to provide direction through the session , leaving the coronavirus as the main area of focus .
Updates from Europe and the U .
, in particular , were negatives for the broader market going into the week .
Containment measures were strengthened in a bid to slow down the spread .
Over the weekend , the number of cases in the U .
surpassed Iran , South Korea , and France , Germany , and Spain .
At the time of writing , the total number of U .
cases stood at 32,356 .
Figures from Europe were more alarming , however .
Italy saw the total number of cases surge to 59,138 , with the total number of deaths jumping to 5,476 , which was giving a mortality rate of almost 10% .
Cases in Spain and Germany rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing to 16,018 .
For the markets , the major concern will be the fact that Italy has been in shutdown mode for a month and continues to see large increases in new cases .
This will suggest that other EU member states and the U .
will experience a similar trend .
It certainly contributed to the shutdown of nonessentials across Europe and even major U .
economic hubs such as NY .
The Majors  At the time of writing , the Japanese Yen was up by 0 .
to ? 110 .
against the U .
Dollar .
The Aussie Dollar was down by 0 .
to $0 .
, with the Kiwi Dollar down by 1 .
to $0 .
In the equity markets , the ASX200 was down by 5 .
in early trading , with the HK and China markets yet to open .
The Day Ahead :  For the EUR  It 's a quiet start to the week on the economic calendar .
The Eurozone 's flash consumer confidence figures for March are due out late in the day .
With the EU going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths in Italy surpassing China , it 's not going to be good .
Any hopes of a consumer consumption-driven economic rebound have gone as non-essential businesses close in a bid to contain the virus .
For the EUR , there may be some upside , however , as the number of cases in the U .
surpasses the likes of Spain , Germany , and France .
The reality is , however , that the Dollar will likely continue to hold onto its safe-haven status .
At least for now .
Things could change should Asia and Europe manage to contain the virus sooner .
For the Pound  It 's a particularly quiet day ahead on the economic calendar , with no material stats due out of the UK to provide the Pound with direction .
With the government enforcing greater containment measures , the Pound may find some much-needed support .
While the number of cases has risen , they are still well below its neighbors .
The government is optimistically expecting a short period of economic woe .
With non-essential businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fiscal measures to be rolled out .
This should provide further support to the Pound in the week .
Across the Pond  It 's also a quiet day ahead on the U .
economic calendar , with no material stats to provide direction .
Updates on the coronavirus and the government measures to contain the spread and support the economy will remain the key driver .
Coronavirus numbers alone from the weekend support increased demand for safe havens at the start of the week .
The jump in U .
cases , however , will test the Dollar .
The markets will certainly need to get a sense of how widely the virus can spread before being able to assess the economic fallout .
For now , the market 's comfort blanket is that the U .
government and FED are willing to do anything .
That is about the only good news , however , as the spread of the virus continues to gather pace .
A Bipartisan vote is needed swiftly now to get funds to those that need it .
