( Abbie Sophia Photography/Maggie Hellman via AP ) Credit : AP  Scenarios like these are playing out in urban high-rises , suburban homes and tiny rural communities across America as couples try to navigate what has abruptly become the " new normal " during the coronavirus outbreak .
Described by therapists , lawyers or the couples themselves , they reveal how even the most subtle differences in temperament or coping strategy can be painfully exacerbated under the incredible stress and anxiety that the outbreak is causing .
It 's a time when every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Catherine Lewis , therapist and faculty member at Ackerman Institute for the Family in New York , from the seemingly small -- whether to go grocery shopping -- to the fraught calculus of which family members should isolate together .
" This pandemic is making us all think about our relationships , because you really can not do one thing without it impacting somebody else , , " says Lewis , who 's been conducting therapy sessions remotely .
" It 's such a powerful example of how interconnected we all are .
"  Added to that , Lewis notes , is the utter helplessness of having no idea how long the situation will last .
She does see some couples finding " that they have a wild capacity to be resilient , to just find a way to move through the day .
" On the negative side , it 's clear that people are generally not at their best when under deep stress .

In cases where there was already domestic abuse , advocates fear a dangerous escalation .
She 's been receiving calls from clients who had already been unhappy in their marriages or in the process of splitting , and are now feeling increasingly desperate .
They feel helpless , too , because along with the enforced confinement , the legal process is mostly on hold .
Courts are generally closed .
In many cases , there may be no ramifications for bad behavior .
One parent , for example , has refused to turn over a child to the other in accordance with their agreement , citing the virus crisis , even though the other parent is taking every precaution .

In another case Kouzi is aware of involving a separated couple , one parent is allowing their kids to go see friends , " to be the fun parent , so the kids will want to stay there full-time instead of with the parent actually following recommendations and guidelines .
"  It 's not all grim .
" Some parents have actually risen to the occasion and are communicating better than normal , rearranging schedules and increasing FaceTime access and doing what makes sense " for their kids , she says .
Kouzi , who practices in both New York and in Westchester County , one of its suburbs , is telling her clients to try to use the time productively or to consider mediation .
" There will be such a backlog when courts open up again , " she says .
Some couples are experiencing only minor ripples , if any .
Stephanie Pfeiffer , a business systems analyst in Boston , found herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , and each time she put something into the cart -- two pounds of butter , cans of tuna or tomato soup , a box of crackers -- he questioned why .
" We 're arguing over groceries , " said Pfeiffer .
" He accuses me of panicking and hoarding , but the reality is we NEED more groceries .
" After all , the couple is now working at home together .
In a minor adjustment , Pfeiffer recently moved her makeshift work station away from the kitchen table , where her husband works , into a corner of the dining room .
" Now we can not see each other , " she quips .
" As time stretches out , I 'm optimistic we will get into a routine and settle in .
"  Some stay-at-home mothers say their husbands , now homebound , are finally seeing how much domestic work their spouses do .
In New Jersey , Caren Tolleth , mother of a 5-year-old and a 9-month-old , finds that her workload has only increased with the addition of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like most days , " she reported last week , " except that my husband is leaving dirty dishes and I get to clean up after him , too .
" She joked that her spouse had made the mistake of coming down at one point to chat , " and I handed him a baby to put down for a nap .
He has n't come down since ! "  Adrienne Pattison , who lives in a rural area of Washington state , joined a Facebook group called " Parenting Under Quarantine " a week ago and wrote : " Is it just me or is anyone else totally frustrated with the husband/partner or whatever ? ? I 'm about to go postal ! " Her good-natured venting elicited more than 160 comments and anecdotes .
Maggie Hellman , the Bergenfield , New Jersey , mother who created the Facebook group for her friends to blow off their own steam -- she never thought it would balloon to over 20,000 -- notes that some couples are , of course , dealing with gravely serious challenges .
Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home through a side door to discard dirty clothing and wash his hands to avoid infecting the family .
His wife , a nurse , must be extremely careful as well .
Hellman , a social worker and stay-at-home mom , says it 's natural that couples with children are feeling intense stress .
" Children create stress in a marriage , period , " she says .
" The relationship changes dramatically .
" Under current conditions , she says , " you 're stuck at home all day with each other when perhaps there already were issues .
" She imagines that single parents have it even worse , especially if they have only one child .
" They get no break , they have no one else to be with , " she says .
Lewis , the family therapist , says it 's still early days .
She hopes the couples she treats will find a way to deal with the anxiety and uncertainty in a useful way .
Some of her best advice to couples : " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , " she says .
" If today 's your bad day , mine is tomorrow .
Let 's not blow at the same time .
