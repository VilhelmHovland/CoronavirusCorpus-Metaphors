Having such ICU capacity available has been a prime concern as health officials also reported that the state had 1,786 confirmed COVID-19 cases in a seven-fold increase from a week earlier .
Indiana 's 35 virus deaths are five times greater in that time .
HOSPITAL CAPACITY  Indiana hospitals have added about 500 critical care beds to give the state 1,940 as of Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Family and Social Services Administration .
While officials said about 60% of those ICU beds were in use , Sullivan said hospitals continued working to create more ICU capacity by steps such as converting operating and recovery rooms space .
The state 's goal is to double the pre-virus intensive care capacity and Indiana 's count of 1,177 ventilators to meet an anticipated COVID-19 case surge in the coming weeks , she said .
Those hospital capacity statistics were the first ones released by Indiana officials after they declined to provide them last week , even as Illinois and other states were doing so .
Indiana University Health , which has 17 hospitals around the state , is taking steps such as retraining staffers who have n't worked in critical care positions recently to have enough personnel available , said Dr .
Chris Weaver , an emergency physician and a senior vice president for the system .
" That 's a major constraint and a big challenge for us to meet this wave that 's coming our way , " Weaver said .
CASES GROW  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indiana from COVID-19 , increasing the state 's virus death toll to 35 .
Two of the new deaths involved Indianapolis residents , while the other person who died was from southeastern Indiana 's Franklin County .
The state 's number of confirmed cases grew by 273 to 1,786 , the Indiana State Department of Health said .
Those do n't reflect all cases in the state because testing has been largely limited to those who are hospitalized and health care workers .
Indianapolis had the most new cases at 135 , while Hamilton County in suburban Indianapolis had 20 and northwestern Indiana 's Lake County had 12 .
For most people , the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia , or death .
Nearly 86% of Indiana COVID-19 deaths through Sunday have been among people 60 or older , according to the state health department .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health commissioner , said Indiana 's illness peak is still expected in mid- to late-April , but some prediction models show that lasting long .
" It could be as late as mid-May .
We do n't know , " Box said .
" That surge could be more of a flattened-type surge and that would be over a longer period of time .
"  SURGEON GENERAL COMMENT  Gov .
Eric Holcomb said he communicated Monday with U .
Surgeon General Jerome Adams , a day after the former Indiana health commissioner included Indianapolis on a list of emerging COVID-19 hotspots he posted on Twitter .
Indianapolis and its seven surrounding counties had 63% of the state 's confirmed cases and about half its deaths as of Monday .
Holcomb said he appreciated the attention that federal officials are paying to all states and encouraged all residents to obey the state-at-home order he issued last week .
