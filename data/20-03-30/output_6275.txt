Coronavirus and your two-wheeler : How to cope  By Insights Desk - March 31 , 2020  Yesterday we covered the important parts of your car that you must disinfect before going on a drive .
Today , we will share some of the precautions that you must take , if it gets necessary for you to go somewhere on the motorcycle .
As we know that the coronavirus is spreading through the droplets that are released in the environment when a person sneezes or coughs .
These droplets can even land on your vehicle as the vehicles remain parked outside .
What are the precautions that you can take if you have to use your two-wheeler ?  Disinfect the touchpoints  Before you get on your two-wheeler , you must disinfect the handlebar , switchgear , grab rail and the fuel tank as these are the parts that you will be touching and using the most .
Use a full-face helmet and a mask  You should use a full-face helmet instead of the open face helmets .
Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open face helmets only cover the upper half of the face and your mouth and nose is still contact with the external environment .
Also , you should use a mask that will prevent the dust and the germs from getting in your nostrils or your mouth .
If you are uncomfortable with the mask then you can tie your hanky around your face and that will stop the dust and other particles to some extent .
Note that the hanky will not be as effective as the mask .
Wear gloves  Before riding your two-wheeler make sure that you disinfect your gloves , then wear them and once your ride is over clean your gloves again to make sure that any pathogen is not able to transfer in your home through the gloves .

Park under the hot sun  It is not confirmed but parking in the sun may kill the virus as it does other bacteria .

These are some of the ways to deal with the coronavirus if you need to use your two-wheeler .
However , we highly recommend that you do not get outside of your house as it is not safe and you frequently wash your hands and take care of your personal hygiene .
