President Trump signed the coronavirus economic-relief package into law Friday in the Oval Office .
Many Americans can expect some financial help from the federal government as part of the economic relief package President Trump signed into law Friday in response to the coronavirus pandemic .
It is a little more complicated for one group of taxpayers : immigrants .
Here is a brief explanation of who is and is n't eligible for different forms of assistance .
Q : Will immigrants living in the U .
legally get a check from the government ?  A : Immigrants with Social Security numbers are eligible for direct payments so long as , like everyone else , they fall below certain income thresholds .
Payments start phasing out for those with income above $75,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals , $112,500 for heads of households and $150,000 for married couples .
That group ranges from permanent residents to foreigners working in the U .
on temporary visas , as well as people protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals -- the program President Obama created to provide a legal status to young immigrants brought to the U .
illegally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 million immigrants who came to the U .
illegally ?  A : Immigrants who are n't authorized to work in the U .
are n't eligible to receive payments .
This also applies to unauthorized immigrants who pay federal taxes using what is known as an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number , which about 4 .
million people had registered for in 2015 , according to the Internal Revenue Service .
The IRS generates these numbers for immigrants who are n't eligible for Social Security numbers but who still want to pay taxes .
In many instances , having a history of paying taxes is helpful for their immigration cases later on .
By law , these numbers ca n't be used for immigration enforcement .
Q : What about immigrants who live in mixed-status households with some unauthorized family members ?  A : Under the plan signed into law , a family wo n't be eligible for cash assistance if one parent is unauthorized -- meaning he or she has an ITIN .
For example , a family in which the parents are unauthorized but their children are U .

According to the Pew Research Center , about five million American children have parents who are undocumented .
A DACA recipient who files taxes as a dependent of unauthorized parents -- say , a college student -- also wo n't get any money .
The only exception Congress wrote into the law is for military families .
Q : Who can apply for unemployment assistance ?  A : Generally , the same rules apply .
Anyone who is authorized to work in the U .
can also receive unemployment payments .
But it gets tricky for people in the U .
on temporary visas , like H-1Bs for highly skilled workers , who could lose their legal status if they are n't employed .
Right now , an H-1B visa holder has 60 days to find a new job if he or she is out of work and can receive unemployment benefits for that amount of time .
The government 's public-charge test , which makes it tougher for immigrants to become permanent residents if they have used public benefits , does n't consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : Can most immigrants receive free coronavirus testing ?  A : Congress expanded coronavirus testing for Americans without health insurance through Medicaid .
But most immigrants , regardless of their legal status , are n't eligible for Medicaid ; permanent residents become eligible only after five years .
Immigrants are able to be tested at public-health clinics , which are funded by the federal government , but resources at these centers are even more limited than the nation 's wider health-care system , which is already past its tipping point in epicenters for the pandemic .
