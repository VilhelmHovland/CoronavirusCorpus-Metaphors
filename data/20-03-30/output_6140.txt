A ' test ' of a lifetime  It all started when he attended a journalism seminar in Quezon City on March 6 , 2020 .
At that time , more than 100 countries , including the Philippines , have recorded at least one case of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 .
Reymar during his last visit in Manila .
Since COVID-19 cases rapidly increases while the death toll rises worldwide , checking the latest statistics and total case trends has become part of his daily routine .
From time to time , he checks the official Facebook Page of the local health department particularly the HEPU CV-CHD account to monitor if there are changes in the almost static number of Persons Under Investigation ( PUIs ) and Persons Under Monitoring ( PUMs ) regionwide .
What he did not know that six days after his attendance in that seminar , he would soon face an ordeal and become part of the region 's cold figure under PUIs .
For Reymar Olibas , a college student in one of the universities in Cagayan province , who already began to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cough and body pain , wasted no time in doing the right .
" Naiimagine ko tuloy na parang nasa Wuhan ako kasi all of them sa place ay naka-Personal Protective Equipment .
Kinunan ako ng swab at pinauwi rin , " he relayed , as he was trying to picture out everything during that night .
Ideally , swab results from the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine ( RITM ) are expected to arrive to the health facility 48 hours after .
But for Reymar 's case , it exceeded the expected time of arrival which made him more worried .
He was left with no choice but to adhere to the strict home quarantine as advised by the medical staff .
By that time , based on the algorithm of the Department of Health ( DOH ) , Reymar showed mild symptoms of COVID-19 , hence , home quarantine was recommended instead of being admitted at the health facility .
Days before he was considered PUI  After his seminar in Quezon City , Reymar went to the big malls in Makati City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
That day , he was already not feeling well .
This pushed him to travel back to Cagayan earlier than scheduled .
By that time , no pronouncement of enhanced community quarantine over Luzon was made by President Rodrigo Duterte .
Upon his arrival in Tuguegarao City on March 7 , he immediately went home to his relatives in Pe ? ablanca town , stayed there for three days but still not feeling well .
He was then worried .
The next day , he called his churchmate who happened to be working at the CVMC to consult his situation .
After he was tested , Reymar was immediately advised to observe strict home quarantine .
Glad that Cagayan Governor Manuel Mamba has suspended classes in all levels indefinitely which for him was a big relief .
Not to mention that he was the only one left in their boarding house , an assurance that he will be completely isolated from other people .
At this point , perhaps for Reymar , there is no agony worse than waiting for something that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remote social interaction during the home quarantine , he still finds good things in the situation .
He devised a scheme so that he will not get bored .
He watched movies , listened to music , read books , joined online worship activities and participated in their online classes .

( Photo courtesy from Dr .
Baggao 's FB account )  Reymar has a high regard and respect for all the staff of the Department of Health ( DOH ) Cagayan Valley Center for Health and Development ( CV-CHD ) and the Cagayan Valley Medical Center ( CVMC ) because they never failed to monitor his health regularly during those times .
" From time to time , i-te-text nila ako at kukumustahin .
Kung may concern or tanong ako , napaka-hands on nilang sumagot , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said .
" They advised me to observe healthy eating habits , drink 8 glasses of water per day , have an enough sleep everyday and take multivitamins , " he added .
He revealed that even his screen time was being monitored just to make sure that he will have enough rest especially at night .
The last time CVMC messaged him  Reymar will never forget that Monday night ( March 23 ) , at exactly 10:26 , when he received a message from an unknown number .
" We would like to inform you that you tested negative for COVID-19 , " the text reads .
The message may be plain and simple , but for Reymar , this would be the most assuring message , of the many messages , he got in the past .
Still speechless , he got down on his knees , prayed and thanked the Lord for making all things new and clear for him .
For Reymar , the battle for COVID-19 is everyone 's battle .
" To our frontliners , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To sir Jan Paul Yu and Sir Aldrin Pantaleon , your job is not easy at all especially in this pandemic time but I salute you for giving your time to me kahit na busy kayo .
To Kuya MJ Sicad of CVMC , thank you for the prayers .
To my VCF and EN Campus family , thank you for the support system , " he said .
Reymar said he could not surpass this challenge if not with the help of the frontliners especially those from DOH CV-CHD and CVMC whom he considered our modern day heroes .
" Ngarag na ngarag na sila pero bilib ako na hindi sila napapagod para sa bayan , " he added .
Admittedly , Reymar said that complying with the strict home quarantine was an ' insensitive move ' but he later realized that this was , indeed , the best option to do .
" Pero masaya ako sa kinahinatnatan ng home quarantine ko , " he said .
With the government 's strict implementation of home quarantine today , he advised the public to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public 's own good .
" To all PUIs and PUMs , do not worry , know that we have our greatest healer by our side , Jesus .
Continue to pray .
Strengthen your faith that your tests turned out negative .
God has healed you already , " he said .
In these trying times , we should not let panic and fear hamper our beliefs thay this pandemic will all come to pass .
All we need to do is to play our part by simply heeding the call of the government---to cooperate , keep calm and stay home .
Reymar 's story is , indeed , a realization that there are no negatives in life , only challenges to overcome that will make us stronger .
Needless to say that the tests we face in life 's journey , whatever it may be , are not to reveal our weaknesses but to help us discover our inner strengths .
We can only know how strong we are when we strive and thrive beyond the challenges we face .
( MDCT/PIA-2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal his identity to assure those people he had personal interactions with him before he was considered PUI that he is negative for the disease .
For Reymar , this story would not only inspire other people but one way to express his gratitude to all frontliners in the country for their unparalled service to the nation .
