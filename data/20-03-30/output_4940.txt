My Thoughts in Quarantine -- A Poem  Share this :  I should write a poem about this But I will have to follow the rhyming scheme I have hardly read anything in a while The poem will be rubbish But I have to do something Maybe read a book But the book I have is a fiction Oh , I wanted to be a writer at 14 That was 2014 , it was so different I was a kid , BJP was newly in power My family was rejoicing Why were they rejoicing they knew what it stands for ? They wanted a change but they support tyranny They also are responsible for killing people Oh god ! There might be people without homes in this pandemic And it must be so painful to lose your loved ones to this virus You ca n't hug their bodies , hold them one last time .
An article said pandemics will be common in coming times Government should really do something It did .
They asked people to bang utensils Sharma uncle was banging the plate on Sunday Like it was some celebration His 30-year-old useless son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was less about the pandemic more about religion I wish was able to convince Sharma uncle about How supporting the BJP is n't right But I am not able to convince Ma and Pa How do I convince others ?  Maybe its not my fault that they are filled with hate But they are my parents and they were n't like this May they were like this and I was too careless to notice I am not alone , I see others ranting on twitter about this too But why does it feel like burden , The burden of not being enough The burden of being too much at times The burden of fighting uselessly The burden of not standing up I think I am stressing a bit much but I have n't seen my friends in a while I did n't hug them properly the last time I will write a poem about them , But I will have to follow the rhyming scheme .
