An Inglorious Opportunity : Coronavirus and Emergency Powers  " the central government the possibility to intervene directly in the affairs of the sub-state administrations ( regions , provinces , metropolitan cities and communes ) .
The necessity of coordinated response to the crisis bypasses the principles of subsidiarity and division of competences applicable in normal times .
"  There has been a hurried spate of cancellations and suspensions of elections across the globe because of the risk posed by COVID-19 .
The trend is unsurprising .
In the age of post-democratic process , suspending the procedure should only induce a cough of recognition .
But it is troubling for those who take the ceremonial aspect of these things seriously .
Such tendencies have worried Jon Meacham , who went to the history books to remind New York Times readers that President Abraham Lincoln , even during a murderous civil war , would still insist on having an election he could lose .
A state of emergency , in other words , need not be inconsistent with democratic practice , though Meacham conveniently sidesteps Lincoln 's tyrannical streak in suspending the writ of habeas corpus by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could " in an emergency do things on military grounds which can not be done constitutionally by Congress .
"  The short of it is that states of emergency are dangerous times for rights and liberties .
To speak about the liberty of the subject during crisis is considered individualistic and indulgent .
Put the collective and polity first and your silly notions of freedom a distant second .
States of emergency can be varied creatures .
Declaring a state of emergency , writes Th ? o Fournier on the Italian example in responding to COVID-19 , entails giving " the central government the possibility to intervene directly in the affairs of the sub-state administrations ( regions , provinces , metropolitan cities and communes ) .
The necessity of coordinated response to the crisis bypasses the principles of subsidiarity and division of competences applicable in normal times .
"  Some infringements and containment of liberty may well be warranted , though the jurists warn about the need for time limits and proportionality .
" Despite their severity , " comes Fournier 's assessment , " the Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Italian Constitution contemplates limitations on the freedom of movement , and the measures undertaken were , for the most part , proportionate .
Pressing emergencies can furnish political opportunists with the means to fortify their positions .
They seek the archive of executive justifications in times of crisis for assistance , claiming that the threat can only be extinguished with authoritarian measures .
The use of the term " war " in combating infection , an erroneous formulation at best , has provided the convenient covering of an iron glove .
The German authoritarian jurist Carl Schmitt went so far as to suggest that states of emergency undercut the very idea of legal norms , repelling them as they take hold .
States of abnormality demand certainty and focused responses , not vague measures heavily qualified by restraint .
The only certainty that can be provided is by the unchallenged sovereign who defines what Schmitt famously called " the state of the exception " .
( This leads to a classic form of circular reasoning : to be sovereign , you need to be able to define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to be sovereign .
)  In France , President Emmanuel Macron 's heavy measures do have a duration of some two months .
What has tended to be drowned out is the element of opportunity that has little to do with the virus , the sovereign exploiting the situation to make hay .
Being an enemy of the 35-hour workweek and unfair dismissal provisions in the workplace , Macron 's COVID-19 measures give employers full rein to dictate working conditions .
As Edward Lee-Six and V ? ronique Samson put rather tartly in Jacobin , France was witnessing what " seems closer to an opportunistic instrumentalization of the health crisis to intensify police impunity and the deregulation of labour .
"  The authors also point out the most bitter of ironies regarding Macron 's measures : the weakening of the underfunded health sector which has left a shortage of qualified staff , beds and medical equipment .
Hungarian strongman , Viktor Orb ? n , is also aware of the golden chances .
Coronavirus has presented him a stunning opportunity to shore up what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formidable party machinery of Fidesz , the wily politician has been sounding the gong of patriotism and attacking institutions he deems disruptive to the Magyar project .
Timothy Garton Ash , that veteran student of central European affairs , has gone so far as to label Orb ? n the foremost iconoclast of European liberal democracy , having spent a decade or so demolishing it .
The independence of the judiciary has been compromised ; electoral laws have been amended to keep Fidesz cosily in power ; activists have been harassed .
For Orb ? n , the problem is less the virus itself than other familiar bugbears .
" The government wants a strong Europe , " he said during a radio interview on Friday , " but the EU has its weaknesses .
" Having failed to arrive at a unified plan to cope with the economic and financial impact of COVID-19 , the Hungarian PM seemed filled with that I-told-you-so confidence .
" In terms of coronavirus aid , for example , Hungary has received support from China and the Turkish Council .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the prime minister near dictatorial standing .
It vests the executive with unaccountable decree powers , which include extending the state of emergency declared on March 11 indefinitely .
The bill enables the executive to overrule lawmakers .
It suspends elections and keeps information on government actions in short supply , to be delivered via the speaker of the parliament and party leaders .
Journalists face hefty prison terms for reporting on information that might disturb the populace .
The Council of Europe , another one of those bodies Orb ? n tends to rile , has acknowledged that " drastic measure to protect public health " were warranted in responding to COVID-19 .
The letter by Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric addressed to the Hungarian leader is filled with legal reminders , though the field of states observing them is diminishing .
Anti-pandemic measures still had to comply with " national constitutions and international standards " .
Democratic principles had to be observed .
" An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency can not guarantee that the basic principles of democracy will be observed and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threat which they are supposed to counter .
" Orb ? n 's snooty response was dismissive , urging the Council to " read the exact text of the law " .
The law in question also goes to show that the authoritarian can , when needed , adjust his position .
Pro-government media outlets had , for instance , insisted earlier this month that the coronavirus pandemic was only deemed such by journalists engaged in " a worldwide experiment " of panic sowing .
Whatever his previous views , Orb ? n is now gratified enough to accept the chances presented by this " invisible enemy " as , for that matter , are many others .
