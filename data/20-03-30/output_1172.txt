Halo 2 for PC will go into testing later this month  Following the surprise launch of Halo : Combat Evolved earlier this month , 343 Industries is primed to start testing the next major instalment in the series .
Both Halo 2 and its Halo 2 : Anniversary remake will likely go into testing by the end of the month , alongside Forge and Theater for Halo : Reach .
The studio made the announcement in a blogpost , lightly warning that the timeline may not hold ( Halo : Combat Evolved 's testing was moved from January to February , remember ) .
" As a reminder , flighting the studio 's term for " testing " is a way for us to get early access builds out to our Halo Insiders before they reach the public , " the post reads .
" Often things are rough around the edges and truly represent a work-in-progress .
Building these games is a process and things can change .
All of the content listed above may change and so may the timing , but if all goes well , we are targeting our next public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights are available to members of the Halo Insider Program , though as the blogpost also warns , membership of that program does n't guarantee access to the flight , but it 's your best chance to try the next Master Chief Collection instalments before anyone else .
