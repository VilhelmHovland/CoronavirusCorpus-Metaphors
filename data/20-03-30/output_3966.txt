COLCHIS : Why is Georgia succeeding with the coronavirus where many Western countries are failing ?  Georgia leads the Caucasus region in successfully responding to the coronavirus  By Alexander Scrivener of the the Eurasia Democratic Security NetworkMarch 22 , 2020  When the biggest health crisis in a century hits , where would you prefer to be : the Netherlands or Georgia ?  Until very recently , almost no one would name the South Caucasus country as their choice .
Even the most patriotic Kartveli would admit that having the money , facilities and expertise of a very high income west-European nation would put the Dutch in a much better position to prevent and mitigate the spread of a pandemic .
Indeed , the Netherlands came 3rd in the latest Global Health Security Index which measures preparedness for disease outbreak .
In that index , Georgia comes a creditable but not earth-shattering 42nd .
The reality of the two countries ' response to the novel coronavirus , however , shows that being rich does n't guarantee effective policy in a time of crisis .
If anything , the early signs are that wealthier European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - at least initially .
Georgia and the Netherlands are a good comparison as both confirmed their first cases at roughly the same time - Georgia 's first case was a day earlier .
At the time of writing , the death toll in Georgia stands at zero , with just 43 confirmed cases , all imported or directly related to imported cases .
In the Netherlands , 106 have died and , despite very narrow access to testing , there are 2994 confirmed cases .
The Dutch government now considers the outbreak to be unstoppable and has essentially given up on fully supressing the virus .
Of course , the Netherlands is a far more connected economy and as such a faster increase in imported cases would be expected .
But the fact that both countries saw the virus arrive at the same time suggests that this does not account for the huge gap in outcomes .
Nor are differential test-rates a possible explanation , as the Netherlands conducted extremely limited testing until relatively late .
In fact , the death statistics ( which are far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the tens of thousands , while Georgia is likely still in double figures .
A look at the way the two countries responded to the outbreak gives us a clue about why there has been such a difference in outcome .
Early in the crisis , Georgia took strong measures to prevent and detect imported cases .
They not only checked the temperatures of all arrivals but gave out clear information and contact details in case they started experiencing symptoms .
These were sufficiently effective that the first Georgian case was identified at the border .
They moved fast to limit travel from known hotspots at huge cost to Georgia 's booming tourist industry and generally took proactive measures such as improving hygiene in public areas much earlier than in many Western countries .
The government also set up a dedicated website and gave regular and clear briefings to the public which reflected international scientific opinion and World Health Organisation recommendations .
For a culture as famously feast-loving and touchy-feely as Georgia 's , social distancing does not come naturally .
But fear of the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escalated in the rest of Europe , Georgia closed its borders and implemented strong social distancing measures , closing all restaurants , bars and shops apart from grocery stores , banks , petrol stations , pharmacies and post offices .
Today , all international air traffic was halted with the exception of a few official government flights .
All this has happened in a country which ( at the time of writing ) has not seen a single coronavirus death .
A thousand doctoral theses will inevitably be defended on the subject of explaining differential responses to the coronavirus crisis .
And there are inevitably a multiplicity of institutional , cultural and political factors in play .
But there is a pattern emerging that transcends continents , wealth levels or political context that is worth highlighting .
Societies with recent memory of major societal crisis and upheaval are responding much more proactively than those that lack such collective memory .
What links the Asian countries that have so effectively contained the virus , post-Communist states like Georgia and austerity-battered southern European countries like Greece is recent memory of crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , the specific memory of SARS obviously looms large .
But Georgia , Lebanon and Greece alike were all among the more proactive responders in their respective regions .
Conversely , countries that have enjoyed relative calm and prosperity , even in the wake of the 2008 crash , like the Netherlands , UK and USA , were notably slow to even recognise the threat .
In these countries , acute societal crisis has long been something that happens to other people .
Much of the discourse in these places has been about the potential damage to the economy that would result from taking drastic measures .
In the pubs of London and along the canals of Amsterdam , the idea that the virus could cause something worse than lost economic growth seemed , until recently , unthinkable .
So is it completely outlandish therefore to ask whether the societal immune system of collective historical experience is as important as the biological immune system of the individual in effectively combating this pandemic ? Can we partly explain the lackadaisical reaction of countries like the Netherlands with their lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil strife and severe shortages that afflicted Georgia in the 1990s help create a political culture that was better equipped to take decisive action even at huge economic cost ? Huge economic costs , it should be highlighted , that the country 's largely poor population can ill afford compared to the well-heeled burghers of Amsterdam or Utrecht .
Opinion  Thanks to a dictator who jokes about keeping coronavirus at bay with vodka , the Minsk derby became the big game for football punters around the world as the Belarus Premier League got permission to carry on .
Infectious enthusiasm , fatal for some ?  Hard currency reserves back in focus .
Net portfolio outflows since December 20 stacked up to $6bn .
Recession is no surprise now , but uncertainty makes investors nervous .
The situation has aggravated uncertainty about the duration and the depth of the economic downturn .
Most assets have already priced in the recession , its fallout is still unclear .
Restricting social interaction is a vital part of the efforts to delay the spread of the coronavirus pandemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity for their own ends .
In the spirit of openness and transparency , the Uzbek government , represented by State Asset Management Agency ( SAMA ) , has called on a large meeting of stakeholders such as development financial institutions ( DFIs ) , news agencies including popular bloggers and Big Four consulting and audit firms and other interested parties to discuss the large privatization efforts it is undertaking .
