)  To ease the pressure , construction of a 68-bed field hospital began on Sunday in Central Park , and the white tents being set up evoked a wartime feel in an island of green typically used by New Yorkers to exercise , picnic and enjoy the first signs of spring .
The makeshift facility , provided by Mount Sinai Health System and non-profit organization Samaritan 's Purse , is expected to be ready to accept patients on Tuesday but will not take walk-ins , and admissions and transfers will be managed by Mount Sinai , de Blasio said .
De Blasio , among a growing chorus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling of the crisis , said the death toll in his city would rise soon if Washington did not provide more medical supplies and assistance .
" Sunday is D-Day , we need help by Sunday , " he told CNN .

" If we do things together well - almost perfectly - we could get in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 fatalities , " Dr .
Deborah Birx , coordinator of the White House 's coronavirus task force , told NBC 's " Today " show .
Anthony Fauci , a top U .
health official , cited those figures on Sunday as a possible outcome , but Birx 's assessment appeared to suggest the figures could be a floor rather than a ceiling .
The New York Times reported earlier this month that models from the U .
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected that 200,000 to 1 .
million people could die and between 160 million and 214 million people could be infected .
" We allowed the seeds to be planted .

President Donald Trump , who initially played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his administration was seeking to secure hazard pay for healthcare providers in direct contact with the virus .
" We are looking at that and we are looking at that either as an amendment or something , " Trump , who is up for re-election in November , told Fox News a day after he abandoned a hotly criticized plan to get the economy up and running by mid-April .
Trump on Friday signed a $2 trillion package of emergency measures that authorizes direct payments to households , loans to small and large companies , and funding that the Federal Reserve may leverage into as much as $4 trillion more in credit .
That legislation has helped to soothe rattled nerves on Wall Street , where stocks had fallen sharply as the coronavirus outbreak worsened before rebounding last week .
Major U .

Trump also has extended his original 15-day nationwide stay-at-home order for another 30 days , a step that many Americans accepted with resignation .
