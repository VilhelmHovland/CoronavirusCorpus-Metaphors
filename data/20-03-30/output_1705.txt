The COVID-19 response has been at a national , not European , level .
With countries often turning to populist and nationalist solutions , what is needed is a wider community response .

The outbreak and spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes across Europe has revealed a previous illness that had been incubating in the European Union for years .
In their book , The Existential Crisis of Europe , C ? sar Molinas and Fernando Ram ? rez Mazarredo argue :  " The last major financial crisis came close to breaking down the European Union , plunged its citizens into deep pessimism and encouraged populism .
"  The authors finish their book advocating the need to develop a true sense of belonging to Europe .
Today , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 .
The European Union has for years been in search of a way to surpass an old institution , the nation state .
But the fight against COVID-19 is being waged at national , not European level .
No coordinated actions to tackle problems  The European Commission has limited its involvement , and member states have approached the outbreak individually .
The Schengen agreement , which allows freedom of movement around much of the continent , has effectively been suspended .
There has been a moratorium on the enforcement of the macroeconomic stability and balance of public accounts commitments .
Brussels has merely let go , but done little else .

It is no coincidence that the virus has concentrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory of the world to the West , where it continued on its deadly path .
This virus confronts an ageing and suffering Europe , but also a European Union that is losing the race for technological leadership in a world suddenly fast-tracked to digital and remote solutions .
If the Asian management of the pandemic has taught us something , it is the importance of new technologies .
The digital revolution is not only a source of progress and competitiveness led by China and the United States .
It has proved to be fundamental when it comes to controlling the virus and giving instructions to the population .
The mobile phone has been almost more useful than masks .
But the EU has been found wanting in both cases .
Can we do better ?  We have learned from other crises .
Austerity measures have been relaxed and the European Central Bank has announced unprecedented measures .
But monetary policy is not enough .
The forecasts of the Purchasing Management Index ( PMI ) , an index of the prevailing direction of economic trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , shows three things :  COVID-19 has brought the largest drop in this index since records began ; much greater than that experienced with the 2008 crisis .
It projects performance in the future worsening , indicating that the contraction may last longer than the initial shock if economic agents do not see adequate economic policy responses .
There is a strongly asymmetric impact between various European countries , in a very clear core-periphery pattern .
The usual question  Given these results , the usual question arises : how is monetary union going to handle such an intense shock ? So far there has been no agreement on European fiscal policy , but it is absolutely necessary to start this conversation .
Jos ? M Gonz ? lez-P ? ramo , a former member of the executive board of the European Central Bank , and Mar ? a Jos ? ? lvarez Gil , have written in depth on macroeconomic stability , integration and debt in the eurozone .
Much like Dani Rodrick in The Globalization Paradox : Democracy and the Future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little room to carry out independent economic policies in a globalised world .
There is , they indicate , an incompatibility of maintaining national financial regulation and supervision policies with the monetary union and financial stability rules of the eurozone .
National regulation framework entails a strong connection between the worsening of a country 's debt capacity and the situation of its own financial system .
Politically , national budgetary and fiscal policies can not be maintained if a genuine monetary and banking union aspires to have democratic legitimacy .
This is where we are now .
On the one hand , economic agents ( the markets ) expect clear and forceful responses from the authorities ( including from those of the European Union ) .
And they expect that the EU will anticipate events and prepare responses .
However , when governments meet at EU summits , they speak and plan .
But taking joint actions in fast moving situations often appears beyond them .
Questions that Europe does not want to answer  When future data of countries ' fiscal imbalances driven from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public or when the fall in productive activity deteriorates public accounts , what will be the response of the European Union ? Will the markets be calm when the financing needs of already heavily indebted countries increase and they try to place more debt ? Will the risk premium return to startle our markets ?  Today , there are only national responses to a global problem .
And what Europe needs are community responses in all areas , including macroeconomics .
The European Union has relaxed the macroeconomic supervision mechanisms but still delays on making a decision on the " risk sharing " scheme : joint debt issuance , European coverage mechanisms .
and it is necessary to know how and who paid the pandemics bills .
European citizens deserve a European Union that protects them , not an absent zombie .
Populism and Eurosceptic nationalisms lurk , and today , more than ever , a stronger and reliable EU is needed -- one that can react to crises more rapidly .
Become a Supporter  The New European is proud of its journalism and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our voice is important - both in representing the pro-EU perspective and also to help rebalance the right wing extremes of much of the UK national press .
