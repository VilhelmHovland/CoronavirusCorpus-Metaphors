STAUNTON -- Three members of Faith Baptist Church in Staunton tested positive for COVID-19 after a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Faith Baptist Church Pastor Eric Brown .
The three positive cases are the same Staunton and Augusta County cases that the Central Shenandoah Health District confirmed Sunday , according to Brown .
A group of church members went to North Carolina for a faith-based event that Kenny Baldwin , a Northern Virginia based pastor who later tested positive for COVID-19 , also attended , according to media reports .
The trip was not organized by Faith Baptist Church , but Brown said he was aware of the trip .
At the time , the virus spread seemed less active to some and there were not state-mandated restrictions on gatherings .
Those who traveled to North Carolina attended one church service on March 15 in Staunton before they learned that Baldwin tested positive .
After they learned of Baldwin 's diagnosis on March 19 , all six attendees started self-quarantining , he said .
There have not been any services in the church since March 15 .
" I know there 's some pastors out there , they get on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to tell us what to do .
We 're going to do our own thing , ' " Brown said .
" We 've not done that .
"  Brown said the church did not take this situation lightly .
They immediately stopped in-person services when Gov .
Ralph Northam issued an ordinance on March 17 that banned gatherings of more than 10 people .
The church started a private messaging group for the church community using Marco Polo and started streaming church services on Facebook .

The woman in her 50s had hugged Baldwin when they saw each other , Brown said .
The other four people on the trip have not exhibited symptoms but are still quarantined as a precaution .
The third church member who became infected is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
She had not attended any recent services -- the two women live in the same household .
According to Brown , all three women are doing well at this time and have not required hospitalization .
He also noted that some of the women reported respiratory symptoms , while others had more gastrointestinal symptoms .
For some in the community , the recovery path of these three women has been a sign of hope .
" So I do n't mind , the encouragement of , ' Yes , you can recover , ' " Brown said .
" Because you 're not hearing a lot of that in the news .
"  Some members of the church have shared social media posts about the confirmed cases because they wanted to highlight stories of recovery .
They also wanted people to pray .
" And they have been , " Brown said .
" We 've heard from hundreds of individuals .
"  Brown also said they wanted to make sure the church community was aware of the cases because the health department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know so they can isolate if necessary .
Over the past month , the church has also been working to make sure everyone is taken care of .
For example , they have checked in on senior citizen members to make sure they have groceries and yard work taken care of .
Brown also said that some business owners in the church have reached out and offered to find positions or work for those who have lost their income .
Some of the normal avenues of support within the church are more challenging because of social-distancing measures , but the community has still found ways to stay connected online , including message groups and live-streamed services .
" We 're trying everything we can , " Brown said .
" We 're having to figure it out on the fly .
"  One thing the church knows for sure : There wo n't be taking any risks when it comes to the virus .
The church had planned a drive-in service where people could park 6 feet apart and listen to a service in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep social distancing , " Brown said .
" So that 's why we did n't have the service yesterday .
I do n't care how far apart people are .
I was n't going to risk it .
