Nine braces for April in an ' uncertain ' advertising market  Nine Entertainment 's revenue held up in the March quarter but the media group sees a negative April ahead as the fallout from the coronavirus takes hold .
The company , assuming that the COVID-19 crisis continues for the rest of the calendar year , plans to cut $266 million in costs including broadcast programming and capital expenditure .
In a presentation to the JP Morgan Virtual Conference today , Nine says group revenues for the three months to March were in line with previous guidance .
However , an increasingly uncertain advertising market will likely have a " material negative impact " from April , the company says .
" This is a very difficult time for all Australians , on many levels , " says Nine 's CEO Hugh Marks .
" Notwithstanding an expected significant impact on our business as conditions continue to evolve , we are confident that with our enhanced audience position , our mix of assets and the commitment of the Nine team , we will emerge from this period a stronger and more competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and long-term cost initiatives totalling $266 million to the end of December , including $28 million in programming .
The cuts :  " Any earlier ( or later ) recovery will change the magnitude and/or timing of these metrics , with a prolonged economic impact likely to result in further initiatives , " says Nine .
The company earlier this month withdrew its profit guidance because the rapid progression of COVID-19 was starting to have an impact on Nine 's markets .
Nine has moved the majority of its employees to working from home with minimal interruption , the company says .
Audiences across all of Nine 's platforms are showing strong growth , including linear TV audience growth on core News and Current Affairs content : Nine News ( +30% ) , A Current Affair ( +13% ) and the Today Show ( +26% ) compared to late February-early March .
