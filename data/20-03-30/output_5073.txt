More  The cruise of the Zaandam-ed  The Seattle-based president of Holland America Line , Orlando Ashford , has attempted to calm distraught passengers left aboard the Zaandam -- which last week recorded four deaths -- after only guests deemed to be healthy were transferred to sister ship Rotterdam on Monday ( Australian time ) .
Some on board claimed they were unfairly discriminated against .
It had not been a case of creating " a sick ship " and " a healthy ship " , Mr Ashford said in a five-minute video address uploaded to Facebook after passengers used social media to claim the Zaandam had become " MS Alcatraz " and " the death ship " .

Australian couple Peter and Carole Burke ( aged 72 and 67 respectively ) , from Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast , were not permitted to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advertisement  " Mum is in tears , she 's distraught , " their daughter , Fiona Pattison , told The Australian Financial Review .
" She says they are both well and that people are calling it the ' death ship ' and very few of them are left on board now .
"  Over the past seven days , the Burkes have been allowed to leave their cabin just once for 30 minutes .
No one has been on land ship since March 13 .
The Zaandam and Rotterdam are sailing in convoy and both ships expect to be through the Panama Canal by early Tuesday morning ( Australian time ) .
They are sailing for Florida , though it 's not certain yet if they will be allowed to dock .
Up until about 24 hours ago , there were a total of 1243 guests ( including 131 Australians ) and 586 crew members on the Zaandam ; 138 people had reported " flu like " symptoms .
There are now 797 guests and 645 crew on the Rotterdam , and 446 guests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Rotterdam completed a health screening prior to transferring via sanitised tender , with all other necessary precautions in place , including wearing masks , social distancing and direct transfer to their new staterooms , " Holland America Line says in a statement .
" No guests who had any respiratory symptoms in the last ten days were transferred , and no Zaandam crew were transferred to Rotterdam .
"  The Burkes when they first embarked on the cruise - weeks ago now .
Supplied  Mr Ashford went into damage control : " There were some questions about the process " through which some passengers were selected for transfer and others were denied .

" So for some of you that were initially denied , it was out of an overabundance of caution .
Anyone that was denied and was frustrated by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  It was about creating " safe isolation " for those who were sick , while the cruise company figured out " where it is we want to take you " , Mr Ashford said .
" I want to dispel the myth that there is the intention to create a healthy ship and a sick ship throughout this process .
The intention is the two ships will stay together .
"  Meanwhile , a flurry of concerned family members took to social media to express their distress .
One Dutch father posted that his daughter , Anne Weggeman , was a front office employee on the Zaandam .
" Now 14 more days in isolation in her cabin of 8 metres square , without a window , " he wrote .
" As a father I 'm powerless on the sidelines , want to help , want to pick her up , but ca n't .
"  Yade Gza from Mexico , who is on her honeymoon , posted that neither she nor her husband were permitted to transfer to the Rotterdam : " We asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have n't had any respiratory issues , " she posted .
" Again , we are being misdiagnosed and discriminated while being put on a list where we do n't belong .
"  Meanwhile , Western Australia is grappling with how to manage 41 COVID-19 infected passengers and crew from the Artania cruise ship after a row with the Australian Medical Association .
The sick passengers and crew were transferred by bus and under police escort from Fremantle Port to Joondalup Hospital in Perth 's northern suburbs on Monday .
