Meng has introduced a resolution that would formally condemn " anti-Asian sentiment " caused by rhetoric labeling the coronavirus as the " Chinese virus , " " Wuhan virus " or " Kung-flu .
"  " As we 've seen today , as what people are saying and doing against fellow Americans , there is a lot of fear in our communities .
I just heard a story about someone 's mother , elderly mother , who is terrified to even go grocery shopping because she does n't want to yet again be the victim of someone whispering or saying something to her .
And she 's literally scared to go buy groceries , " Meng told reporters during a press briefing .
ADVERTISEMENT  The anti-Asian sentiment has led to people being harassed and attacked in public spaces , such as being spat on , physically assaulted and verbally harassed with racial epithets .
Trump has defended using the term as a way to indicate where the coronavirus began spreading in Wuhan , China , comparing it to Ebola , which is named after a river in Africa , or Lyme disease , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health experts and the World Health Organization have advised against using geographic locations to name infectious diseases as a way to help reduce any stigma .
" I talk about the Chinese virus and -- and I mean it .
That 's where it came from .
You know , if you look at Ebola , if you look at all -- Lyme .
Right ? Lyme , Conn .
You look at all these different , horrible diseases , they seem to come with a name with the location .
And this was a Chinese virus .
But I do n't have to say it if they feel so strongly about it .
We 'll see , " Trump said at a press briefing last week .
ADVERTISEMENT  Asian American lawmakers said Trump should go further than suggesting he might stop invoking the term .
" At this point , every Asian American and Pacific Islander knows somebody or have themselves been subject to this xenophobia , " Chu said .
Meng 's resolution currently has 131 co-sponsors , all of whom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Asian American to represent New York in Congress .
Last week , Rep .
Jim Banks ( R-Ind .
) introduced a resolution to condemn the Chinese government 's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and affirm that it made " multiple , serious mistakes " downplaying and censoring information about the novel virus that as of Monday has infected more than 775,000 people worldwide .
But Chu last week urged Democrats not to support it and said that she spoke with Banks to warn that it could stoke " xenophobia .
" Banks still proceeded with his resolution , which now has 39 other GOP co-sponsors .
Moulton has since withdrawn his support for the Banks resolution .
Moulton said he originally signed on to the resolution " because it is important to recognize and condemn the Chinese Communist Party 's authoritarian tactics .
"  But he explained in a statement last week that he was withdrawing from the resolution after hearing from members of the Asian American community who he said " were hurt at a time when their community is under assault by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize for that , and I am withdrawing my support for the resolution , " Moulton said .
