Founders , fear and hibernation : Seven reasons startups should not make employees redundant  A crucial , common feature of startups is that they burn cash .
The best of them grow hyper-fast and rely on raising capital to fuel their growth .
The COVID-19 pandemic is thus an existential threat to most startups , including the good ones .
It hits them with a triple whammy .
Raising capital in the short to medium term has become near impossible .
They are generally unable to borrow due to weak balance sheets and the absence of personal guarantors .
Across the world and across Australia , startups are scrambling to survive by cutting costs steeply to extend their cash runway .
The sad thing is that since staff costs typically represent &gt;80% of the fixed costs of a startup , ' extending runway ' has become a euphemism for firing staff .
Often having great people and a great business model does not mean you can make payroll if the impact of the pandemic either worsens ( as it is ) or continues for several more months .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff busy with activities which are cash-generating in the short term , what choices does it have ?  Given crisis conditions , it is folly to be paying staff who can not contribute to short-term revenues , irrespective of whether they are critical to the longer-term success of the business .
( Development teams are likely to be particularly hard hit by this situation .
)  The result ? There is already a swell of redundancies which could become a tidal wave among startups unless founders and CEOs do a mental switch from cutting staff to hibernating them .
The crisis we are currently facing is only temporary , but redundancies do permanent organisational damage .
' Hibernating ' staff who are not contributing to short-term cashflow provides much better outcomes for both the employer and employee than the knee-jerk alternative of making staff redundant .
Hibernating staff simply means temporarily reducing paid work hours per week or implementing leave purchase plans or ( in extreme cases ) asking some staff to take unpaid leave .
Leave purchase plans are often the fairest and useful tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public service .
They involve staff ' buying ' additional annual leave with the ' cost ' of the extra leave days ' paid ' for as a salary reduction .
By agreement , the extra leave days may be taken while there is little work for the employee to do .
The result is that employees can effectively be on unpaid leave when not needed but their income continues ( at a reduced rate ) throughout the year .
Hibernation offers large advantages both for the startup and its staff .
There are numerous reasons why hibernation is a vastly superior crisis response compared to redundancies .
Here are seven .
Humanitarian  Having a job with reduced hours and income , or even enforced leave , is massively better ( both financially and psychologically ) than simply being made redundant .
Why ?  1 .
It preserves an ability to pay bills .
It preserves self-esteem and engagement with the world ( as compared to sitting at home permanently ' unemployed ' ) .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being on leave ( which will automatically reverse as the crisis subsides ) is different and much less stressful than not knowing whether/when you will get another job .
A small percentage of people may actually prefer/enjoy reduced working hours or taking leave for a while .
At a time when public morale is low and jobs are rare , firing people should be the last resort .
Cashflow  Making people redundant incurs an immediate cash payout of employee entitlements .
Shifting them temporarily to reduced hours or unpaid leave until things get better does not .
Granular responsiveness  A hibernation strategy enables a very granular and adjustable response to dealing with rapidly changing circumstances .
The working hours of different categories of staff , or even individuals , can theoretically be flexibly ramped up and down as needed .
In practice , this requires a deep understanding not just of business needs , but also the financial and emotional needs of individual employees .
The fact that startups tend to be smaller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigating these issues .
Workloads can be job shared , paid leave taken and ' leave purchase ' plans implemented .
Culture  Counterintuitively , shifting teams to reduced working hours ( if correctly handled ) can actually provide a boost to staff engagement .
It can end uncertainty and demonstrates in a practical way that the business is doing everything it can to avoid firing people .
Empowering staff to choose to ' share the pain ' in order to save jobs can build good team morale and employer loyalty .
Evidence from past recessions is that teams may be motivated to actually work harder than before ( despite reduced paid hours ) in order to help their employer pull through .
There is evidence that some categories of worker respond to reduced hours ( especially if work from home is possible ) with increases in productivity and reductions in churn .
Resilience to rebound  The true total costs associated with recruiting , training and ramping employees are generally much underestimated .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to scale up its workforce again much more cheaply than if it had fired trained people .
When things start improving you can flexibly scale up the work hours of your trained staff to meet demand instead of being distracted into the time-sucking tasks of recruiting , interviewing and training .
Goodwill  Employees who have been made redundant are rarely positively inclined towards their past employer .
In past downturns , employers who have tried hard to keep employees through hibernation have emerged with much better reputations than their peers both as employers of choice and as good corporate citizens .
Societal  In a crisis , founders and CEOs are rightly focused on cashflow and survival .
But from the broader societal perspective , the economic bounce back from the crisis is significantly lessened by the widespread adoption of job hibernation .
Instead of mass unemployment , we would have more underemployed workers who can ramp back to full-time work as the economy strengthens .
The vast difference this makes in all aspects of our culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overstated .
A faster bounce back benefits all .
Founders , fear and hibernation  Australian industrial law does not contain clear mechanisms permitting employers to enforce the hibernation of employees .
In the spirit of the recent change to insolvency law ( those designed to enable directors to be bolder to continue trading during the pandemic ) , industrial law might be amended to make it easier for employers to hibernate staff .
The risk is that to the extent that founders can not secure the support of some employees those employees could , theoretically , argue they remain entitled to full pay or were wrongfully dismissed .
However , three factors are likely to make this risk more theoretical than practical in the case of startups .
The impact of the coronavirus is such that it will often be possible ( and necessary ) to make employees redundant unless there is widespread co-operation with the implementation of a hibernation strategy .
Startup culture is such that , with proper leadership , employees are more likely to support short-term measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their jobs for the longer term .
The vast majority of startup employees have a short tenure of employment limiting the potential damages in the event any of them pursue wrongful dismissal claims .
Additionally , industrial tribunals are likely to be sympathetic to employers who have acted in good faith to stay afloat and preserve jobs .
The Australian government has announced a series of coronavirus stimulus measures targeted at small businesses .
So what do the changes to the instant asset write-off scheme , and the $25,000 cash payments , mean in practice ? .
