Ambegaon soc using tech to enforce social distance in residents  Unique code given to each resident , software monitors how many times they move outside premises ; deliveries arranged for inside  As entire housing societies become collectively invested in maintaining the lockdown among their residents , a complex in Ambegaon has come up with a rather futuristic technological solution to keep track of violations of the social distancing rule , to prevent spread of the highly infectious coronavirus .
Astonia Royale has developed a piece of software with data of all residents staying in the society at present , and given them all a unique code number .
Whenever an inhabitant has to step out of or get back into the society , s/he needs to provide this number at the gates .
With 12 buildings inside the premises and approximately 1,400 people living in them , social niceties had continued within the campus even after the lockdown was announced , with people instinctively gathering for small get-togethers and meals to tide over the crisis .
Residents have to submit their number to security at the gate of Astonia Royale ( above ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system ; ( below , L ) those moving out too often are shamed with a COV-IDIOT award ; ( below , R ) vegetables are delivered inside , as are groceries and medical supplies , but with careful sanitisation and tracking  However , the Astonia Royale Federation stepped up to nip this trend in the bud , to err on the side of caution .
Member and resident Santosh Patil , an advocate by profession , came up with the idea .
He shared , " When the initial limit of the curfew was March 31 , we saw many residents defeating the purpose of social distancing with small gatherings .
So , we first made a database of all residents from children to senior citizens with their flat numbers and photos , and gave them a unique code number .
"  At the gates each time , this code is given to security personnel , who verify it within the database before they allow the person to leave or enter .
This way , the number of times each and every resident leaves the premises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised by Federation member Vinayak Kumbhar , an IT professional , He said , " The software has a filter to track how many times a person has moved out the complex premises .
Further , the system has also helped us gather a database of residents , in case it is required by the government in future .
It will be available for the authorities , just a click away .
"  With the Federation asking its residents to limit movements to the outside , it is also ensuring that most daily needs are taken care of .
The society has arranged for vegetable vendors to usually come twice a week .
To avoid crowding , timings for vegetable buying are distributed for each wing over the day , and each wing 's residents get an hour to finish this shopping .
Further , the society has also tied up with grocery and medical stores to deliver wares over an hour a day , and has formed a committee in each building to take care of its denizen 's needs .
If a resident informs of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available at the gate .
Other than this , the society is also spraying disinfectant on all essential services vehicles allowed inside that are exempt from the software .
Patil added , " We have planned everything systematically to reduce chances of residents leaving their house .
Once a day or five times a week is reasonable according to us , but if they go around more often , the resident will be certified as irresponsible and given the COV-IDIOT award , which is then put up across our society 's social media platforms .
"  The complex has also deemed that if any guests are to visit residents , the person hosting them needs to notify security to let them enter after consulting the Federation -- but only two or three people are allowed .
If the group is of more than four , the Federation denies permission to enter .
Sujeet Pimprale , a resident here , appreciated the effort and shared , " The Federation has taken all required measures to ensure that residents follow the lockdown seriously .
It is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be working .
Everything needed on a daily basis is made available .
We just need to follow safety norms .
