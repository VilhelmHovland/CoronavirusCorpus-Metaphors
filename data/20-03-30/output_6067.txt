How TikTok became the pastime of a country on quarantine  TikTok has become the preferred platform for Generation Z 's knee-jerk response to the simple fact of existing : content creation .
Illustration by JL JAVIER  Manila ( CNN Philippines Life ) -- If you 've been on social media these past two weeks , you 've likely noticed a surge of TikTok videos on your feed .
On your Instagram stories or Twitter timeline , there are people doing very literal dance interpretations of Young Thug , boys in head towels impersonating their mothers , and musicians singing 20-second song snippets , because that 's how long you need to be washing your hands in the time of coronavirus .
The pandemic has registered strongly on the social media app of the moment .
Hashtags like #loveinthetimeofcorona and #handwashtunes have amassed tens of millions of views , and since the implementation of enhanced community quarantine in Luzon , engagement only seems to have skyrocketed .
Since its launch in 2016 , TikTok has become the preferred platform for Generation Z 's knee-jerk response to the simple fact of existing : content creation .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downloaded 738 million times in 2019 alone .
The original Chinese version of the app , Douyin , is blocked off from the rest of the world due to the Chinese government 's firewall restrictions .
No matter what country it 's used in , however , the content on TikTok is generally uniform : short videos , lasting from a few seconds to a minute , of people dancing , lip syncing , and actingverypabebe , a word that has no English equivalent but is the perfect adjective for several of the TikToks I 've seen , no matter where they 're from .
It 's the logical successor to older apps like Vine and Dubsmash , having located the middle-ground between the former 's snappy , time-bound humor and the latter 's savvy usage of audio .
Many of the recent TikToks on my feed have dealt directly with quarantine in the Philippines .
One imagines what graduation might look like for the class of 2020 : school administrators going from house to house to hand out diplomas .
In another , comedian Long Mejia tries to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , that he 's wearing a face mask .
In this one , a woman gazes at the camera as she does her household chores in a cocktail dress and full make-up , because she just really misses making an impression .
Here , a group of friends have their temperatures taken by a guard at a 7-Eleven , reacting to their results like beauty queens advancing to the final round .
In one of my favorites , a girl clasps her hands placidly as an excerpt of Rodrigo Duterte 's quarantine speech urges her to discover the unknown corners of her home .
Other TikToks foreground the ubiquity of the app itself .
A security guard with nothing to do maneuvers a small rock like it 's a toy car .
A bored jeepney driver is spotted filming a dance video .
Nurses self-consciously TikTok during downtime .
An inmate TikToks behind bars .
A community official on patrol yells safety reminders through a megaphone : " TikTok TikTok muna kayo sa bahay ninyo ! Maligo ! Matulog ! " Unlike the TikToks previously mentioned -- staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more organic scenes from a region on lockdown .
" The Philippines currently presented by TikTok has been simplified and sanitized for your viewing pleasure .
It is here to boost collective morale , not to offer sobering , bite-sized accounts of life during a pandemic .
"  A TikTok , however , does n't necessarily need to be about anything .
It 's possible that the app 's appeal lies in how little it demands of its users .
Great editing skills and creative vision are n't requisites to going viral .
Most TikTok trends can be easily replicated -- hand dances , reenactment of iconic movie moments , or lip syncs .
And while there are several fresh , genuinely hilarious videos on the app , the quintessential TikTok is largely devoid of content .
This is also what makes it the ideal channel for escapism .
Filipinos may have flocked to the app to alleviate their boredom or because it 's a quick and easy way to get famous , but it 's equally possible to frame TikTok 's predictable , lighthearted nature as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and remakes , scored to the same five songs repeating over and over , imparts a sense of familiarity and reassurance .
And when the algorithm elects a TikTok that jolts with its originality , it only reinforces the impulse to keep scrolling in search of the next one .
In a moment of such national urgency , TikTok is an engrossing , desensitizing distraction .
Of course , the reality of COVID-19 is very much a constant presence on the app .
On the search tab , there 's a banner that reads " COVID 19 , " with the subhead " Stay informed so you can stay safe .
" When you tap on it , official statistics from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) tell you how many confirmed cases and deaths there have been in the country .
Scroll down and you 'll see information on how to protect yourself , frequently asked questions , and debunked myths about the virus .
Posts tagged #covid19 bear a reminder to listen to your local health authorities for crucial updates .
Many of the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the virus beneath a glossy fa ? ade .
The Philippines currently presented by TikTok has been simplified and sanitized for your viewing pleasure .
It is here to boost collective morale , not to offer sobering , bite-sized accounts of life during a pandemic .
To consider the quarantine videos on TikTok as unfiltered representations of modern life would be delusional .
In the past two weeks , the national mood has been a lethal cocktail of panic , rage , ennui , vague absurdity , and frustration .
While society 's more privileged members have tucked themselves away in the safety of their homes , many laborers are left with no option but to keep working , lest their families starve .
Some were automatically arrested by the police for attempting to work .
In one barangay in Para ? aque , curfew violators were forced to sit under the sun as punishment .
Several major hospitals have stopped accepting new COVID-19 patients after reaching maximum capacity .
Senator Koko Pimentel , who tested positive for the virus , broke protocol and visited one of those hospitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ventured outside the Golden Mosque Compound in Quiapo .
A man in Bulacan was killed by the police after dodging a checkpoint ( officials claimed the man had shot at them first ) .
The news cycle is charged with an unsettling frisson of uncertainty .
And on top of all that lies the singular anxiety of monitoring yourself for symptoms that tend to overlap with the common flu .
In Duterte 's Philippines , the threat of death has been a daily burden for a majority of the underprivileged .
Now , this cloud looms over the rest of the class spectrum , though it 's been significantly mitigated by the comforts of money and status .
For the first time in their lives , many middle- and upper-class Filipinos are reckoning with the possibility that they could die sooner than expected .
The poor , meanwhile , remain at the frontlines , where they 've always been .
As of March 30 , the WHO page on TikTok notes that there are now 1,347 confirmed cases and 82 deaths in the country .
You would n't guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's infinite " For You " feed .
Instead , you 'd see scores of bored , untroubled people , inventing new forms of recreation , captive in their homes and on our screens .
