Cottage ER Doctors Plead with Public to Take COVID-19 Seriously  The below letter was written by two Emergency Room Physicians at Cottage Hospital  Dear Friends and Neighbors ,  We are Emergency Physicians at Cottage Health .
We live and work in this community , so we are also your neighbors , friends , and the local doctors who may diagnose your child 's ear infection at 3 a .
, or fix your broken wrist .
These are trying times and nowhere is the anxiety and stress felt more than in the Emergency Room .
We are the frontlines of this fight .
Every day we are seeing increasing numbers of sick patients with COVID-19 .
Some are walking and talking and go home safely to recover .
Others are very ill and need to be admitted to the hospital for care , some in the intensive care unit .
Every day we are seeing more and more of these cases .
We are inundated with news , updates , emails and social media posts regarding the virus .
People are talking about the availability of tests , debating about how serious our situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This virus is spreading .
And the situation will likely get worse before it gets better .
This is not a political issue , not a liberal or conservative issue .
This is a human issue .
Regardless of your income or immigration status , every one of us is affected by this pandemic .
For the sake of our community , we implore each of you to do your part to heed the warnings of our public health physicians .
Stay home , wash your hands often , sanitize the surfaces you touch , and practices social distancing .
It is up to each and every one of us to do our part to limit the spread of COVID-19 .
If you are young , healthy and fearless , do n't do it for you , do it fo your mother or father or grandparent .
They are the ones who will suffer and potentially die as the virus spreads .
If you are experiencing symptoms , assume that you have COVID-19 .
Isolate at home , rest , hydrate , and if necessary contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
If you have trouble breathing , chest pain , weakness or have significant co-existing medical conditions , some to the Emergency Room .
If you are well and fearful that you may have been exposed - stay home and quarantine yourself .
You are nt going to be tested .
There are nt enough supplies to test everyone .
Although N95 masks and personal protective equipment are in limited supply , rest assured that the physicians and nurses of our community are committed to serving the needs of our patients .
If supplies run out , we will find ways to keep going .
We will still be here .
We will continue to care .
To us this is more than a job in our community , it is a duty we chose to care for and serve our friends , families , and neighbors .
Together , we will get through this crisis .
It is times like this that bring out the best in use .
Please make a phone call to check in with your family , friends , and neighbors .
Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the day when we can share a handshake or a hug again .
Until then , let us all do our part to combat COVID-19 .

So why no alerts now ? Would n't this be an event which would benefit from widespread messaging ?  If Deltopia were to be happening , then it would be a great opportunity for the police to spread awareness .
I was just wondering why they were talking about it because I had n't heard anything lately .
If some student are still planning to do this , there should be a heavy presence there to inform and warn against this type of activity .
I think what PUGs is saying is that people want Deltopia to happen , as much as everyone wants the **25;763;TOOLONG to be open , people back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( per the president 's wish list ) .
I do n't think PUGs is saying that Deltopia is actually going to happen or that it 's in the works .
So no one should get in a huff-huff ( maybe a puff-puff as the lines of not-so-socially distancing patients are doing outside the Farmacy on Mission/DLV .
as the patients walk away with their goodies in tiny Gucci-gooch paper bags complete with looped handles .
Deltopia ? What are you talking about ? NO ONE wants it to happen except the kids who love to party there .
This would actually be a great opportunity for the cops to go out and spread the word and warning about citations for social distancing .
Key point - this is NOT political .
I see so many arguments across social media about this and it sickens me .
There are still many , many people out there who believe that this is being blown out of proportion for political gains by one side or the other .
Regardless of any exploitation of the virus by politicians , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put politics aside and do what the pros are asking us to do .
