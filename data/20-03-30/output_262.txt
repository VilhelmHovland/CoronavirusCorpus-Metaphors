Shot man died because hospital staff put oxygen tube into his oesophagus instead of his airway  A man died in Hawke 's Bay Hospital after staff put oxygen into his stomach instead of his lungs , partly due to " confusion " within the team treating him .
Nevara Raheke died in the hospital on December 1 , 2017 , two weeks after being admitted for two gunshot wounds to his back .
A recently released coroner 's report found that Raheke died because a breathing tube had been incorrectly placed into his oesophagus instead of his trachea , or airway , meaning he was not receiving oxygen .

? Raheke , 47 , was shot by a man who found him and two accomplices robbing and beating a man at a property in Central Hawke 's Bay on November 17 , 2017 .
Raheke received two shots from a .
firearm to the back .
His accomplices drove him to hospital in Hastings .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority patient by the hospital .
He was initially awake and sitting upright but was not speaking and was taking very shallow breaths .
He was also highly agitated .
Staff decided to sedate Raheke and to intubate him , meaning a tube was to be inserted into his trachea to provide oxygen .
Initial checks by staff appeared to confirm the tube was in the correct place , although no carbon dioxide was being detected .
The tube was adjusted and a second monitor used , but this also did n't detect carbon dioxide .
So staff put a fibre-optic scope down the tube .
That revealed the tube had not gone down Raheke 's trachea , but down his oesophagus ( which leads to the stomach ) .
The tube was removed and correctly positioned , but by that time he had gone 23 minutes without oxygen .
He was expected to have a severe brain injury as a result of the oxygen deprivation .
His condition did not improve and , after 15 days in ICU , the tube was removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannabis , methamphetamine and amphetamine in Raheke 's blood , and while those may have caused his agitated state , it was the lack of oxygen that caused his death .
The gunshot wounds did not cause his death , she said , though the coroner added " it is important not to lose sight of the fact that if Nevara had not been shot then he would not have been placed in the life-threatening position he was in " .
STUFF  A charge against the man accused of shooting Raheke was discharged due to new evidence coming to light at his trial in Napier District Court last year .
Following his death , Hawke 's Bay DHB conducted an Adverse Event Review that established intubation was difficult and it had appeared the tube had been correctly placed .
It found that the medical team had put Raheke 's deterioration down to other causes related to the gunshot injuries .
It said a video laryngoscopy viewed by the attending anaesthetist and emergency physician appeared to show the tube was in the correct place .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found to be in Raheke 's oesophagus .
The review found that if the incorrect placement had been discovered sooner it could have been placed in the trachea sooner .
It also found there was confusion in the team treating Raheke over who was in charge of his airway .
The team itself noted that there was a lack of communication to the whole team .
It was also noted that had Raheke arrived at hospital via ambulance the emergency department would have been forewarned about his condition and could have properly prepared for his arrival .
A number of recommendations were made following the DHB 's review .
Ryan endorsed those and did not make any further comment or recommendation .
Hawke 's Bay DHB chief medical and dental officer Robin Whyman said Raheke 's presentation was " complex " , and the staff involved had been " deeply affected " by the case .
" A number of reviews and investigations into this case has seen the DHB implement changes including : undertaking more staff training with regular simulation of difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raheke 's whanau had been closely involved in the case , had been fully informed , and had had the opportunity to talk to the clinicians involved .
" Our deepest sympathies are with the Raheke whanau and their tragic loss and we have apologised to them in person , " Whyman said .
The man who shot Raheke stood trial last year for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm .
The charge was discharged after new evidence came to light in the trial that meant the Crown could not rule out the shooter had acted in self-defence .
