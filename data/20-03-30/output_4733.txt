Stuck in a hotel room , no fresh air , no chance of going outside , and security guards at the door .
That 's life for Fiona and Barry Clark over the next 14 days as they spend their mandatory self-isolation in Sydney 's Swissotel .
The Woonona couple had spent more than 19 days on the Norwegian Jewel , before finally being able to get off the ship at Hawaii and being flown home .
Thinking they were going to be able to self-isolate at home it was n't until they landed in the early hours of Thursday that they were told they 'd been spending the next two weeks in a hotel room where the windows do n't open and there are security guards in the hallways .
" We 're not allowed to go outside our door , " Ms Clark said .
" We can only open our door if someone knocks to deliver a meal or if it 's the nurse .

It is believed that same family has two teenaged daughters staying in a separate room on their own - one of whom just celebrated their 18th birthday .
There 's also no delivery of outside food and drink - either from a business or from family - as it is deemed a health risk .
Ms Clark said the hotel can purchase items on their behalf - but with a 25 per cent surcharge .
Also , there are restrictions on alcohol - no more than one bottle of wine or two beers can be purchased each day .

Mr Huntley , who could face another two weeks in isolation when he returns home to South Australia , said the passengers on the ship had been concerned about where they would end up .
