Chris Larson vs .
David Crowley : New Milwaukee County Exec will oversee response to the coronavirus that shut down campaigns  Running for Milwaukee County executive is usually about putting together electoral coalitions , outlining budget priorities , and talking about the emerald chain of parks and the range of services that must be saved .
Whoever wins the April 7 spring election will take office in May , and immediately have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  No one knows what course the virus will have taken by then .
But as voters sit in judgment , they 'll have to determine which candidate is up for the challenge .
And they 'll have to make their choice without having seen the usual array of debates and personal appearances since politicking has been shut down for weeks by the public health crisis .
Do they go with Larson , 39 , a state senator who lost four years ago in the county executive race to the incumbent , Chris Abele ?  Or do they go with Crowley , 33 , a former legislative aide who is serving his second term in the state Assembly ?  They may both be Democrats , but they are n't running in lockstep .
" This difference is leadership , the difference is experience , " Larson said .
" I 've served in office , I 've learned along the way .
"  " The senator has been there , and he 's been fighting , " Crowley said .
" I 've only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doing .
You need fighters in the Legislature , but you need a doer in the executive office .

Chris Larson , left , and state Rep .
David Crowley are running for Milwaukee County executive .
( Photo : Rick Wood , Mike Sears/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel )  Personal , political paths  Their roots run deep in Milwaukee .
So does their yearning for public service .
Larson was raised in Greenfield and lives in Bay View with his wife and two children .
Crowley is a lifelong Milwaukee resident .
He and his wife have three children .
Larson and Crowley both attended University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee .
Larson received his degree but Crowley did not .
Larson won his first political race for the Milwaukee County Board in 2008 , ousted an incumbent to move on to the state Senate in 2010 , and in 2013 began a two-year stint as minority leader .
" It 's a heck of a lot harder to have policies than it is to just have post-it notes for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Larson is n't just running against Crowley .
He is also running against Abele 's money .
The soon-to-be-former county executive , backing Crowley , has pumped in nearly $500,000 into the race through his political group called Leadership MKE .
Abele has spent big in the past on other local races , too .
" What does he want ? " Larson asked of Abele .
" Why is he spending this much money ? What does he expect ? I do n't know , and frankly , I do n't think the public knows , but I know they are very skeptical when somebody is dropping millions of dollars behind trying to buy candidates for office .
"  Crowley said that he is own man in this race .
He said he brings to politics the perspective of being raised in the 53206 ZIP code , one of the city 's most troubled neighborhoods .
Issues of health and drug addiction plagued some members of his family .
During a three-year span in his childhood , he said his family went through three evictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county .
" I believe it helped prepare me for what I 'm doing right now , " he said .
He got on to a political path at the age of 16 , when he joined Urban Underground , a leadership organization that , he said , " literally saved my life .
" The group organized around such issues as domestic violence among teens and community policing .
He later joined Public Allies and then ventured fully into the political world , heading up African-American statewide organizing for Russ Feingold 's U .
Senate campaign in 2010 .
He also worked as a legislative aide on the County Board and in the Legislature .
In 2016 , he ran for a Milwaukee Common Council seat and lost .
That fall , he won a race for state assembly .
Running for county executive this year was n't on his radar .
But when Abele unexpectedly dropped out , Crowley jumped in .
He wants to tackle the budget , deliver services and strengthen relations with the county 's immediate neighbors and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is how do we also encourage and inspire this community , " he said " When I look across Milwaukee County and I think about African-American people who look like me , how many executives do we have ? So this is an opportunity for us to change the narrative , to change the trajectory .
"  Pandemic response  There will be no political honeymoon for the winner .
With the pandemic and its cascade of health and economic crises crowding out all other issues , the candidates were asked what steps they 'll take after being sworn in .
Larson said the community will be challenged for some time .
" Immediately after the election , I 'll work diligently to ensure seamless leadership over the coming months , " he said in a written statement .
" I will seek an extension for many of the workers currently working hard for our county to redouble their efforts to get us through this time of crisis .
Some departments will need immediate attention due to their service to vulnerable populations : mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll have all hands on deck to protect our seniors , those with mental illness , and other neighbors who might otherwise be left behind .
If there are still shortages of necessary medical supplies like tests and masks , we 'll help coordinate that with our healthcare leaders .
We will lobby and fight for adequate state and federal aid to ensure Milwaukee County does n't continue to get left behind .
Most importantly , we 'll make sure no one who gets sick from this virus will go broke as a result of it .
"  As for how the county will handle upcoming elections in August and November , Larson said decisions " will clearly be collaborative ones made with the governor and local mayors .
If things are anything like they are for this election , I 'll continue to urge those elections to be all mail-in ballots .
"  Crowley said in a statement that he has good working relationships with many members of the current administration and that he will be " ready on day one to provide leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when Milwaukee County needs a bridge-builder , " he said .
" There is a time to fight and there is a time to get things done .
We do n't have the luxury of just fighting in a time of crisis .
"  Crowley said when the election is certified , he plans to assess the situation , strategies and leadership that are already in place , identify and understand the gaps and work with the County Board and the state 's congressional delegation .
He also plans " to convince critical personnel to stay , at least for the duration of the crisis .
"  He said he 'll work with state and federal lawmakers so that the county gets the financial resources it needs to provide vital services in areas like mental health care , meals and transportation .
As for upcoming elections , he said the April 15 signature period to get on the August ballot -- the primary election for fall partisan races -- " is obviously going to have to change , but that has to come from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state Legislature will be on the fall ballot .
" What we have seen in this election is that our election laws were not ready for this type of crisis , " Crowley said , adding he 'll work with others to push for changes .
