Cannabis operators face challenges but may be better off than other small businesses during the .
+ COVID-19 crisis , two experts argued this week .
MediaNews Group via Getty Images  Cannabis may be " uniquely positioned to weather the storm " of COVID-19 , tax and data experts declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The businesspeople , primarily owner/operators , investors and ancillary service providers , also heard the experts label the cannabis industry " recession proof " during the event , which focused on cannabis-business planning and strategies during this era of coronavirus -- the " giant elephant in the room , " as one host called it .
Certainly the cannabis industry faces ongoing challenges , from the added complexities of ra cash-based business to the denial of deductions under tax code Section 280E .
And the coronavirus crisis seems to be one more .
But a recurring theme during the webinar , sponsored by New Frontier Data and the professional services firm CohnReznick , was cannabis 's built-in defenses against the crisis 's disruptions -- from the closure of nonessential businesses , to the stock market 's plunge , to even sanitation and social-distancing requirements  The hosts were John Kagia , chief knowledge officer at New Frontier Data , and Michael Harlow , a CPA and partner at Cohn Reznick , whose respective practices focus on cannabis market intelligence and tax implications .
At the webinar , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults .
The webinar coincided with their release of a report on cannabis accounting and finance management , 2019-2020 , and promoted a larger , more internationally focused , virtual Global Cannabis Town Hall scheduled for April 2 .
" The virus has led to slowdowns and shutdowns across key sectors of the global economy , and cannabis has been no exception , " said Kagia at the webinar 's start .
Yet , despite the problems for the $30 billion U .
cannabis business , Kagia and Harlow launched into a long list of cannabis 's actual advantages -- over other small business categories -- in weathering the problems of the COVID-19 storm :  Destabilization of the medical system : Cannabis is seeing growing recognition as a therapeutic alternative to traditional medications -- and therefore it 's receiving more investment .
In fact , cannabis use -- whether CBD or THC -- has been touted for combatting anxiety , sleeplessness , physical pain , even PTSD .
Closure of nonessential businesses : Turns out that that 's not happening to most dispensaries .
" We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of states that have already declared cannabis businesses as essential , and we think that moving forward , that actually strengthens the argument for legalization .
"  A dramatic loss of small business spending : Certainly , cannabis suffered in the past year , with an average 46 percent drop in market cap , from March 2019 to March 2020 .
But this month cannabis spending grew 10 to 20 percent across all categories ( flower , edibles , topicals , etc .
) as consumers stockpiled .
Sales for the flower category were up 21 percent ; pre-rolls , 14 percent ; and edibles 14 percent , as examples .
" Consumers are shopping with the expectation that they wo n't be able to shop -- to leave their homes , " Kagia explained .
Those spikes might not continue throughout the crisis , but Kagia expected some consumer habits to change , such as in the categories of cannabis preferred : He expected , for instance , to see parents who are housebound with their kids choosing edibles over cannabis because of smoke contamination .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heightened levels of anxiety and sleeplessness caused by the crisis .
" There 's going to be a lot of people turning to cannabis to alleviate those symptoms , " Kagia predicted .
Stock market declines : Investors may actually view cannabis as a stable market during these rocky financial times , Kagia said , noting that he 's seeing " a lot more sobriety with which investors are looking at this market .
"  Supply-chain disruption : A bright note , Kagia said , is , " We 're seeing China moving very quickly to restart its market .
" At the local level , meanwhile , dispensaries are now incorporating curbside pickup and delivery .
" These will likely endure after the crisis , " Kagia predicted .
Job losses : Cannabis is a fixed expenditure for most users , Kagia said .
The New Frontier poll found that even if people 's financial conditions change , " they 're going to be very reticent to change dramatically on cannabis , " Kagia said .
" So that 's the recession proof status of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be disrupted , " he acknowledged .
" Cannabis demand will remain stable .
"  Global travel bans : Travel is not a big factor for cannabis , whose demand tends to be " hyper-local , " Kagia said .
Cash flow via small business loans : Cannabis was n't mentioned even once in the Senate draft bill Harlow was viewing during the webinar So , he acknowledged , the small business loans promised by the SBA might not be available to cannabis operators .
Instead , he advised that cannabis operators secure loans through state and local grants .
This would be especially smart in states which this past week deemed cannabis operators as " essential .
" " It would be a very hard argument to make that in the face of a pandemic , you 're ' essential ' and can remain open but you do n't qualify for a state-based loan program , " Harlow said .
Cash flow issues : The " single biggest benefit " of the stimulus legislation , Harlow said , is the deferral payments ( for state sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax filings .
Almost everything tax related has been postponed to July 15 , Harlow pointed out .
" You really have a three-month interest-free loan from the government that might be one of your best financing sources in the short term , " he pointed out .
