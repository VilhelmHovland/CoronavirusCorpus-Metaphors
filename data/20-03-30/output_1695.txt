We take an early look at the next expansion for The Elder Scrolls Online , as the MMO returns to a familiar locale .
Feature by Mike Williams , Reviews Editor  30 March 2020  Every long-running franchise has its " break glass in case of an emergency " title .
For Assassin 's Creed , it 's what fans have been wanting for ages : a game set in medieval Japan .
Zenimax Online has already revisited one of Bethesda 's fan-favorites with 2017 's The Elder Scrolls Online : Morrowind , a loving homage to The Elder Scrolls 3 : Morrowind .
But the studio has held back since then , with subsequent chapters heading to Summerset and Elsweyr , largely unexplored places in Elder Scrolls canon .
Elder Scrolls Online is n't struggling though .
In fact , it 's riding high with 15 million copies sold and around 2 .
million active players .
There 's no reason to break the glass .
And yet , the next chapter of Elder Scrolls Online is Greymoor , a region that was the focus of the best-selling ( and most-ported ) Elder Scrolls game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just in time for the 10th anniversary of Bethesda 's classic RPG .
Players have already embarked on this year 's storyline , the Dark Heart of Skyrim , in the recently released Harrowstorm dungeon DLC .
Greymoor continues the dungeon 's adventure of Nords and the undead in the snowy , desolate peaks of Western Skyrim .
This side of Skyrim never joined the Ebonheart Pact , and its Nords live a rougher life than their Eastern counterparts .
Over the past few days , I 've tasted Greymoor 's tale of faux-Norsemen and vampire lords , and some of the new features heading to ESO 's next chapter .
Yessir , that is totally some Skyrim .
Bethesda Softworks  Return to Skyrim  The peaks of Skyrim are back , even if it is a thousand years in the past and a Dragonborn short .
I admit , revisiting Skyrim is n't as amazing as I expected .
Seeing the city of Solitude at the height of its strength is interesting , as the version in The Elder Scrolls 5 was a worn-out shell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is visually one of the more boring locations in Elder Scrolls lore .
It 's snow and mountains , rocks and rivers .
I 've played Skyrim so much that it 's almost generic by now , especially when compared to the colorful locales of Summerset and Elsweyr .
For Zenimax Online , it was key that Skyrim was more of a " harsh , believable environment , " with the team playing around more with the underground Blackreach .
" There 's a huge amount of unexplored space down in Blackreach .
That 's where we really kind of forged ahead and did our own thing .
There are little bits and pieces in the overland , but we tried to make that more of an homage to Skyrim , " ESO creative director Richard Lambert tells USgamer .
I was n't able to get to Blackreach during my time with the Greymoor preview , but images from Zenimax Online show that it 's clearly the visual showcase for this chapter .
They show the purple hues from living crystal formations or the blue glows of underground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground camps warm .
So while I was a little disappointed , I 'm glad that there 's some hope on the horizon in that regard .
The depths of Blackreach is where Greymoor flexes it stuff .
Bethesda Softworks  You 'll spend a great deal of time exploring all of Skyrim above and below , because there 's a brand-new Antiquities skill line .
You 'll learn to become a hunter of ancient relics from the Antiquarian Circle , a group of adventurous scholars .
" The original idea was , ' What would Indiana Jones in Tamriel be like ? ' A lot of times what Indiana Jones was doing in the movies , even before he went on his adventures , was researching clues and reading books .
Going through all these obscure clues to try to figure out where he could go and look for this thing , " says Lambert .
But you 're not in the real-world , so Zenimax had to put a magical spin on everyone 's favorite film archeologist .
( Unless you 're a Lara Croft or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eye , a " weird ancient alien technology " that can track down lost relics , you 'll start with leads on artifacts , and eventually head out into the world to dig them up .
You 'll also find leads on these relics from your normal questing , and then you 'll be able to Scry those leads with the Antiquarian 's Eye .
What 's interesting is that instead of the normal crafting windows , Antiquities has two new mini-games .
When you 're Scrying , you 're attempting to match glyphs in order to build toward glowing hexes on the board , which are clues as to the location of the relic .
Collecting all of the clues narrows down the location to a single section on your map .
Once there , you 'll dig , which is another game similar to Minesweeper , where you 're looking for the right location of the item .
Both mini-games are limited by time and available turns , but better leads have bigger boards .
Do n't worry though , you also have a number of skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The new premium housing has the right amount " vampire gothic " to it .
Mike Williams/USG , Bethesda Softworks  Alternatively , you can brute force the process by simply taking the lead and going to every highlighted region on your map .
Eventually , you 'll find the right one , the puzzles just shorten that journey .
" We wanted to make sure that anybody , regardless of skill or type of player , could participate in the system , " says Lambert .
" Some players will absolutely just get a clue as quickly as they can , then go around to all the locations , try to brute force their way through it .
Others will go through the entire process of leveling up the skill line and getting all the clues .
We wanted to satisfy both sides of the player base .
"  The relics available include mounts , motifs , furnishings , and the all-new Mythic Items .
The latter are powerful new pieces of equipment , but you can only wear one at a time and they also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots that prevent the wearer from being snared or rooted , but you also ca n't sprint .
He calls the balance of these items a " kiss curse .
" " Ultimately , we do n't want one particular item to be the best thing in the game to use in all situations .
We want them to be situational , " Lambert explains .
The Antiquities system is a new way to explore the world of the Elder Scrolls Online , something that 's probably useful when visiting a place that 's so familiar to many .
And while the mini-games are conceptually odd , they 're an interesting diversion from the combat-focused Harrowstorms , delves , and dungeons .
Skyrim may still look like a rolling set of snowy mountains , but the treasure in those hills gives you more of a reason to take in those vistas .
Vampires and Vikings  Greymoor 's tale kicks off with a hurried , dying man who charges you with finishing his mission .
Ancient artifacts are being smuggled into Solitude , the home of High King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plot sees you moving from low-level skullduggery to a plot to murder those closest to the High King and plunge Skyrim into war .
Your hero has to navigate the High King 's forces , Jorunn the Skald-King , the rising vampires , and the witches of the Icereach Coven .
Not a great place to find yourself .
At your side for this in the Dark Heart of Skyrim is Lyris Titanborn , a half-Nord , half-Giant warrior who players met long ago in Elder Scrolls Online 's initial release .
Lyris is one of the Five Companions , a group of legendary heroes led by the Dragonborn Empire Varen Aquilarios .
For Zenimax Online , adventuring in the land of the Nords was a perfect reason to bring Titanborn back to the forefront .
" She kind of epitomizes what a true Nord is .
She generally speaks with her fist or acts first and then answers questions later .
That 's kind of the feel we wanted to get across , " says Lambert .
Lyris will not be your only companion on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fennorian , a vampire of House Ravenwatch .
This group was established by Count Verandis Ravenwatch , who charged his followers with using their vampiric powers for good , not evil .
Fennorian was sent to Skyrim to look into the advent of the Harrowstorms , unnatural events that corrupt those caught in their wake , turning them into mindless , feral vampires .
With the focus on vampires , Zenimax Online decided to take another look at the existing vampire skill tree .
Old abilities have been replaced or improved to feed into the fantasy of being a vampire .
Take the new ability Mesmerize , which stuns all enemies in front of you , or Eviscerate , an attack that deals more damage based on how much health you 're missing .
The old Ultimate , Bat Swarm , has been replaced with Blood Scion , a powerful ability that vastly increases your health , magicka , and stamina , heals you for 33% of your damage done , and lets you see through walls .
Many of these abilities are now tied to the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal act .
People do n't really like vampires running around their towns .
Like the Blade of Woe improvements , you finally feed on humans like a true vampire .
Mike Williams/USG , Bethesda Softworks  One change to vampires is something players have been asking for : instead of the old animation for Feed , which sucked the blood from your target from a distance , you now feed directly , biting necks like a proper vampire .
The change is based on work Zenimax Online did for the Blade of Woe skill in the Dark Brotherhood tree .
" We wanted vampires to feel like more of an experience , " says Lambert .
" So when we were looking at the Dark Brotherhood , and specifically the Blade of Woe , when you were doing that it felt like you were part of the Dark Brotherhood and you were ritualistically and systematically murdering people .
That 's what the Dark Brotherhood was all about .
We wanted that feel to be a part of the Vampire skill line as well .
We looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's not very good .
So now there 's a bunch of different ways that you can bite people and feed on people , that makes it feel like you are a vampire and doing vampire-like things .
"  And there will be a vast underground gothic manor called Bastion Sanguinaris for sale , if you want to dive fully into that vampire roleplay .
The vampire theme runs deep in Greymoor , from the vampires and feral undead above , to the darker things hiding in the depths of Blackreach .
" When you start digging into a lot of the history in Skyrim , there is a vampire influence in that area , " says Lambert , referencing the Dawnguard expansion for The Elder Scrolls 5 : Skyrim .
" So we started going in and thinking , ' Well if there 's an influence there , there has to be some kind of story behind how the vampires came to Skyrim ? ' So we started digging in on what Blackreach was and what could be down there in addition to what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter of Elder Scrolls Online has had a singular focus : fleshing out the races of Tamriel .
Of the nine races available to players , Dark Elves were the focus of Morrowind , High Elves took center stage in Summerset , and Elsweyr took place in the home of the cat-like Khajiit .
This time around , Lambert says that the team generally just focused on filling out the map of Tamriel , not on any specific races .
That potentially dashes my hopes for a Redguard-focused chapter in Hammerfell .
" Usually it starts with ESO director Matt Firor and I looking at the map and going , ' What have we done ? Where have n't we been yet ? ' Then we start looking at biomes and the types of stories we want to tell , " says Lambert .
" When you compare and contrast each of the chapters , we had Morrowind , Summerset , and Elsweyr , and now Greymoor ; each of the biomes is very , very different .
The biomes also help influence the storylines that we 're telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But generally it starts with looking at the map and figuring out where we could go next .
"  What 's ahead is finishing the year-long Dark Heart of Skyrim storyline .
There 's a figure shrouded in shadow who is driving the Harrowstorms , and Lambert confirms to me that our primary antagonist is vampire-related .
" There 's more of a twist in the storyline , " he teases .
" There will be a really big moment at the end of the chapter that will get players going , ' Wow , I was n't expecting that , ' and then that leads into the second half of the storyline , which really starts digging into who this vampire lord is and why he 's doing the things he 's doing .
"  Right now , the rest of Elder Scrolls Online 's year is set .
Greymoor is scheduled to release in June for PC , Mac , PlayStation 4 , and Xbox One .
It 'll be followed with a dungeon-focused DLC in August , and another narrative DLC finishing off the storyline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus , Zenimax Online has transitioned into a work-from-home studio .
Lambert is n't expecting any delays in the current schedule , but he does n't rule them out either .
" At this point , it 's still kind of too early to tell .
We literally just transitioned the entire team last week to work from home , " says Lambert .
" It has gone a lot smoother than I thought it was going to .
Our IT team killed themselves to get us transitioned over to working from home , so we 're still kind of feeling things out .
I think it 's probably safe to assume that there will be some delays , because obviously we 're still learning the ropes and uncovering holes in how VPN or remote desktop work .
But overall , I 'm pretty pleased with how we 've been moving and making progress .
"  In the meantime , the team is working on bringing Greymoor closer to its planned June launch .
My preview this week was an interesting peek behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word " TEMP " stamped on them and Alexa-like " robo voice over " in the place of voice acted dialogue .
It 's a testament to the amount of work that goes into ESO 's great narrative presentation .
Are you ready to return to Skyrim ? Bethesda Softworks  Players can take their first step in Greymoor today , with a free prologue quest entitled " The Coven Conspiracy .
" Zenimax is also throwing the doors wide with a free play event from April 1 at 10 a .
ET until April 13 , allowing anyone to download and enjoy the base game and the Greymoor prologue quest .
It 's a tease for the next chapter in Elder Scrolls Online as it enters its sixth year , on its merry way towards that ten-year milestone .
Skyrim being the next move towards that milestone is a chance for Elder Scrolls Online to look back to the franchise 's past .
At the same time , Skyrim is a good foundation for ESO to evolve a bit , while still delivering the stories and characters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links to online retail stores .
