The Congress leader said the consequences of a complete economic shutdown will amplify the toll arising from coronavirus .
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , expressing concern over the three-week countrywide lockdown imposed to mitigate the coronavirus crisis , and said the suddenness of the announcement has resulted in immense panic and confusion , PTI reported .
In a letter to the prime minister , Gandhi called for a " nuanced approach " that takes the " complex realities " of our people into consideration , instead of a complete lockdown which , he said , is better suited in the context of developed countries .
" The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from Covid-19 , " he said .
" It is critical for us to understand that India 's conditions are unique .
We will be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy .
"  Gandhi said the number of people in India who are dependent on a daily income is too large to unilaterally shut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Factories , small industries and construction sites have closed , and tens of thousands of migrant labourers are undertaking arduous journey to reach their home states , " he added .
" It is important that we help such sections find shelter and provide them with money directly into their bank accounts to help them tide over the next few months .
"  As the 21-day nationwide lockdown entered its fifth day on Sunday , a mass exodus of migrant labourers has become a major cause of concern , as workers are trying to return home from large cities where they have lost sources of income and livelihood .
Gandhi said the complete lockdown will lead to millions of unemployed youth rushing back to their villages and with that increasing the risk of infecting others around them , especially the elderly population .
" This will result in a catastrophic loss of life , " he said .
" Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus , and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Narendra Modi-led government on Sunday told states and Union Territories to seal their borders , as migrant labourers attempted to return home on foot .
The Centre said adequate arrangements should be made for shelter and food for the migrants in their places of work itself .
Meanwhile , the number of Covid-19 patients who have died in India rose to 25 on Sunday morning -- an increase of six since the previous government update .
Sixty-one new patients were confirmed across the country , taking the number of cases to 979 .
Of these , 86 have now recovered .
