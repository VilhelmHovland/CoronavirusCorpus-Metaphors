Can Bosch 's thermal detectors be used to read body temperature ?  The COVID-19 virus is a big enough threat on its own .
Combined with the spread of fake news and mass hysteria , though ? It becomes an even bigger danger .
That said , it 's important to be wary of any social media posts or memes you or people you know ( most especially your elderly relatives on Viber chat groups ) come across online .
One viral post currently making the rounds is an image of someone -- perhaps a healthcare worker or local government unit ( LGU ) staffer -- using what is supposedly a Bosch thermal scanner to detect someone 's temperature .
Attached to this image is a statement from the engineering firm explicitly saying its thermal scanners can not be used to detect human body temperature .
Look :  Continue reading below ?  So , it this post legitimate ? While we 've yet to determine when the image of the person being scanned was taken or what brand of scanner is being used , the statement by Bosch is real ( albeit released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines ) .
Look :  Continue reading below ?  " Because of the current outbreak of novel coronavirus ( NCOV ) , we are receiving multiple inquiries about the application of our thermal detector tools ( GTC 400C , GIS 1000C ) for human body temperature , " the statement reads .
" Please be informed that our tools are designed only for industrial usage , not for human or animal application .
This is also stated in the manual : ' The measuring tool must not be used for temperature measurement on persons and animals or for other medical purposes .
' "  The company goes on to say it will not be held accountable for any use of its product outside its intended purpose .
We certainly hope no LGUs went out and bought a handful of Bosch thermals scanners without consulting someone who knows about the products .
The Bosch GIS 1000C costs around P26,000 per unit , while the GTC 400C carries a whopping P71,000 price tag .
Lesson ? It 's important to read the product manual .
