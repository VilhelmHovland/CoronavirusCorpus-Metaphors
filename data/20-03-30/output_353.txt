Most Western democracies fumbled in their response to the coronavirus outbreak despite having two months to prepare .
A number of Asian countries have shown that it was possible to nip an outbreak in the bud and/or contain one when a serious one materialized .
Investors are suddenly faced with a whole new landscape to navigate .
A huge demand shock , an economy in self-induced coma , unheard-of public spending and monetary bazookas are some of the more immediate challenges .
After that , the epic failure is likely to change the post-virus world and capitalism 's institutional make-up is likely to be seriously questioned .
Investors are suddenly confronted with a rapidly changing investment landscape as a result of the coronavirus pandemic .
The more immediate of these is an economy which is placed in a self-induced coma in order to create the social distancing necessary to mitigate the pandemic .
But the pandemic is not easing , it 's accelerating , and this despite the example of successful containment in parts of Asia and having months to prepare .
This failure has made much bigger measures necessary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , possible credit crunches , much-reduced earnings visibility , demand falling off a cliff , unheard-of public spending and multiple monetary bazookas .
That is difficult enough , but even when the pandemic will finally come under control , the failure to deal more effectively with it will likely produce a host of other possible changes which could alter the institutional makeup of capitalism .
First we briefly show why certain Asian countries have dealt with the pandemic much better than most Western countries , then we 'll survey some of these short-term and longer-term consequences .
Not rocket science  Controlling the coronavirus outbreak is n't rocket science , a number of countries in Asia , most notably China , South Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , Hong Kong and Japan have shown us that a combination of fast and decisive action can limit or even control an outbreak .
Despite being warned early January and thus having had months to prepare and having examples of successful measures in these Asian countries .
, few if any Western democracies have achieved this .
This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to be felt everywhere years after the virus outbreak has petered out .
It looks like a combination of complacency and/or a misplaced preoccupation with the economy and/or civil liberties has kept Western countries from the decisive action that has helped a number of Asian countries .
What worked in Asia  Here are the components of what worked in Asia :  Speed  Mobilization of the population for social distancing  Mass testing and mass surveillance , tracking and isolation  Rigorous lockdown when outbreaks could n't be prevented  This is n't rocket science , when you are dealing with something that is growing at an exponential rate , speed is the most important component .
Nipping outbreaks in the bud is simply much cheaper in terms of lost lives and cost to the economy .
We give you one example , from an article by Tomas Pueyo that really is required reading ( Medium , our emphasis ) :  In this theoretical model that resembles loosely Hubei , waiting one more day creates 40% more cases ! So , maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of 1/23 , they might have reduced the number of cases by a staggering 20k .
And remember , these are just cases .
Mortality would be much higher , because not only would there be directly 40% more deaths .
There would also be a much higher collapse of the healthcare system , leading to a mortality rate up to 10x higher as we saw before .
So a one-day difference in social distancing measures can end exploding the number of deaths in your community by multiplying more cases and higher fatality rate .
But this refers to a situation when there already is an outbreak and a rigorous lock-down is necessary .
Some countries , by acting fast , have managed to basically prevent an outbreak to get sufficiently large that such a rigorous lock-down becomes necessary .
By acting fast , testing as many people as possible , isolating positive cases , tracking all their contracts , and keeping all of them isolated have been successful in places like Singapore , Taiwan and Hong Kong , despite having ample contacts with China .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super spreaders in the form of members of a religious sect who initially were n't too willing to supply authorities with membership lists .
Mobilizing the population is also essential , inculcating the need for self-isolation in case of symptoms , social distancing , and cooperation with public measures .
China , as the first country to suffer an outbreak , was caught flat-footed and made some terrible mistakes on a local level when doctors signaled the first signs of an outbreak , there is no doubt about that .
So they had a big outbreak in Wuhan and had to resort to more stringent measures than just testing , identifying and isolating , they brought in the lock-down .
But that lock-down was rigorous and combined with electronic and mass surveillance measures ( giving people QR codes which they have to present when they move about , tracking movements and contacts , and the like ) .
And the Chinese example shows that , while it is much preferred to nip any outbreak in the bud , it is possible to get on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western countries had months to prepare and learn from these experiences .
There is , as of yet , little if any sign they did .
The Western reaction  Contrast this with the Western reaction , which is basically a disaster that is now unfolding before our eyes .
There was widespread complacency , which lost valuable time .
This is all the more inexcusable because we had more time to prepare than the successful countries in Asia .
We are not aware of any Western country that has been successful at the rapid testing , identification and isolation approach that can keep an outbreak , warranting more serious measures , from happening in the first place .
In most Western countries , there are now such serious outbreaks , most notably Italy , but also Spain , France , Germany , Switzerland , the UK , Netherlands , the US , etc .
There are outbreaks in each of these countries that warrant a China-style rigorous lock-down , but most countries have taken half-measures .
We single out the failure in the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it has been so public .
For instance , they were weeks , even months late with measures that are in the guidelines set out in a 2016 National Security Council ( NSC ) memo , according to Politico .
We wo n't go into all of the budget and agency cuts and unheeded warnings , most of these are listed in this depressing article from Foreign Policy .
We 're sure other Western countries also had failures , although we 're not aware of any having dismantled a significant part of their institutional defenses .
What has been a unique feature of the US ( only shared by Brazil , as far as we can tell ) is more than two months of belittlement of the crisis from the top , despite having been given the early warnings by intelligence reports from early January onward and this lasted until a week ago .
As time is the critical element in the response , this has simply been inexcusable and many people will pay with their lives for that .
From the FT :  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is at least in part a result of increased availability of testing making a dent in the backlog of cases .
The Western neglect seems to be a combination of dangerous complacency , political calculation , misguided attempts to save the economy or one of its expressions , the stock market , a concern for civil liberties or simply authorities dithering before the unprecedented stringent measures that were necessary , with different emphasis in different countries .
Consequences  Despite having two months to prepare and with the help of examples of successful limitation of outbreaks or containment of existing ones from a number of Asian countries , Western governments have failed miserably .
When time was of the essence , they dithered , only belatedly prodded into escalating half measures by rapidly unfolding events on the ground .
In some countries , action was even hampered by cutbacks and false optimism .
This lack of sense of urgency , decisive action , dithering , preparedness and the false optimism will have huge economic and political costs and consequences .
Virus becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an even larger demand shock  Wave of credit downgrades and financial stress  Mass experiment in MMT  Institutional make-up of capitalism  First , without mass testing , isolating and tracing contacts or mass lock-down , it 's difficult to imagine the virus wo n't become a more permanent fixture .
This was always more likely as there are a host of countries that are less endowed to contain the virus , and on a world scale the system to contain it is only as strong as the weakest link .
A more permanent virus will basically function as a supply shock as it will increase the cost of business .
Companies will be forced into a raft of precautionary , testing and cleaning measures ( the latter alone will be nearly a billion a year ) , temporary shut-downs of facilities in case of infections ( these are already happening , for instance at no less than 13 Amazon facilities ) , international supply-chains will be disrupted , conferences and trade shows will be cancelled , etc .
Some sectors of the economy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent headwind until a vaccine is developed .
Economically , we 'll experience a huge demand shock causing a very steep fall in production and employment .
The massive $2T stimulus is n't really a stimulus , it 's a necessary relief .
Unless the pandemic is largely gone , most people will not go out and spend , the economy is basically in a self-induced coma .
Given the amount of credit and leverage in the financial system , central banks will be required to backstop basically everything , or at least try to , which is what they are doing .
As we argued in a previous article , it remains to be seen how successful the Fed will be .
But we 've already seen the likes of Ford ( F ) , Occidental Petroleum ( OXY ) , Kraft Heinz ( KHC ) Renault ( OTC:RNSDF ) Macy 's ( M ) bonds downgraded to junk , and there will be many more to follow .
With employment , spending , GDP and tax receipt plunging off a cliff , public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Denmark and the UK seem to have grasped this , basically unleashing bazookas of unheard-of proportions .
Denmark is going to pay 75% of salaries for companies to keep workers on that would otherwise be laid off , a bill which could amount to 13% of GDP in three months .
The UK is doing something similar , the US looks like passing a $2T stimulus bill .
This will be a mass experiment in MMT , the modern monetary theory that argues that the limits on monetary financing public expenditures are much larger than what conventional theory assumes .
We 'll find out pretty soon .
Voters may arrive at the conclusion that the present economic arrangements did n't really serve them very well , and this could lead to a rise in demand for a much bigger safety net , including stuff like universal healthcare coverage and addressing some of the more blatant dysfunctionalities in the US healthcare system .
Demand could be rising to make some of the emergency measures that are now being made ( sick pay , parental care , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bailout of industry is likely to come with strings attached on CEO pay and share buybacks or even equity stakes , which could be a prelude to eliminate some of the more excessive characteristics of shareholder capitalism .
On the other hand , voters might at some point realize the epic failure in the West and demand a stronger state , which could move more countries towards authoritarianism .
These changes are by no means mutually exclusive ; what seems certain is that the landscape investors have to navigate post-coronavirus crisis will experience more enduring changes and will be more complex .
Conclusion  The health and economic crisis is unfolding at unprecedented speed in front of our eyes .
Experience in Asia has shown that much of this was preventable , but few Western democracies were up to the task .
While the immediate concentration is on stemming the outbreak and trying to salvage as much of the economy as possible , this crisis is likely to reverberate and produce more fundamental changes to our economic and political institutions .
What seems fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role for the state , either in its capacity to act , or in the role it plays in the economy as a basic protector , or perhaps both .
We think it 's also likely that shareholder capitalism comes under increasing scrutiny .
When the dust finally settles , investors might have to navigate quite a different landscape , with many of the main institutional characteristics of shareholder capitalism in flux .
