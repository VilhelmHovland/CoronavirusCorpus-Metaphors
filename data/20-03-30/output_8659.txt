Do n't Be Too Hard on New York 's Hospitals  New York 's Medicaid program is indeed mismanaged in many ways , but blaming it for a shortage of hospital beds during the coronavirus pandemic is going too far .

This presupposes that New York has unusually low hospital capacity , when the opposite is true .
The number of beds per capita has fallen in recent years , but it remains 13% higher than the national average .
It 's also disorienting to hear the word " miserly " applied to a $75 billion Medicaid program that covers a third of the population and spends more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment rates for physicians may be paltry compared to Medicare , but not its rates for hospitals .
A 2018 study co-authored by Chris Pope of the Manhattan Institute and myself estimated that New York Medicaid reimburses hospitals at about 95% of the Medicare level for patient care , or 130% when supplemental payments are factored in .
Overall , the state 's hospital spending per Medicaid enrollee is 37% higher than the national average .
The reason that hospitals have been downsizing and closing in recent years across the nation is declining demand for inpatient care , a generally positive trend .
If anything , Medicaid has spent too much money trying to prop up certain hospitals that , in the absence of a rare and virulent outbreak , sit largely empty .
New York obviously needs a better plan for coping with pandemics .
The state 's money would be better invested in practical solutions , and not in maintaining thousands of fully equipped hospital rooms that would sit empty most of the time .
Bill Hammond  Empire Center for Public Policy  Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York state plans to do under its Medicaid program will only eliminate the few doctors who can afford to accept their patients .
We need more primary-care doctors not fewer .
Pay them and they will come .
Starving them out of existence is n't a solution .

Among the reasons mentioned in your editorial you should have included the ideological requirements for New York hospitals ' funding .
Some religious-based hospitals were forced to close in New York City because funding was denied if abortions were n't performed at those hospitals .
If New York Democrats , including Gov .
Andrew Cuomo , continue to follow the dictates of Planned Parenthood and Naral Pro-Choice America , religious-based hospitals will never reopen .
They should be held to account .
The losers are the working poor in New York City , where hospital beds are severely diminished .
