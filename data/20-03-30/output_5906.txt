Michael Levitt sees " signs of recovery " as number of new cases drops everyday  Web Desk March 24 , 2020 18:34 IST  Michael Levitt Reuters  The worst might be already over for the world as it deals with the coronavirus pandemic , says Michael Levitt , a Nobel laureate and Stanford biophysicist .
" The real situation is not nearly as terrible as they make it out to be , " he told the Los Angeles Times .
Levitt 's statement assumes significance as he correctly predicted the trajectory that the coronavirus would take in China .
After analysing the numbers in China from January , the biophysicist calculated that China would get through the worst of its coronavirus outbreak long before many health experts had predicted .
Taking note that the number of new cases being reported each day have fallen , Levitt wrote in early February : " This suggests that the rate of increase in the number of deaths will slow down even more over the next week .
" As predicted , the number of deaths began decreasing every day .
Subsequently , long before the world expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the most affected Hubei province all set to open up after more than two months of lockdown .
In fact , he predicted a ballpark figure of around 80,000 , with about 3,250 deaths , when others were calculating deaths in the range of millions .
As of Tuesday , China has reported 3,277 deaths with 81,171 positive cases .
Now he foresees a similar , tapering trend in the rest of the world .
After analysing data from 78 countries that report more than 50 new cases everyday , he says there are " signs of recovery " in many of them .
His calculation does not focus on the total number of cases being reported in a country , but the total number of new cases identified every day .
Levitt notes that the number of new cases in countries like China and South Korea were consistently on a decline .
" Numbers are still noisy , but there are clear signs of slowed growth , " he says .
At the same time , the scientist acknowledges that his figures are messy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low because testing is spotty .
But even with incomplete data , " a consistent decline means there 's some factor at work that is not just noise in the numbers , " he notes .
While his observation brings hope for millions of people across the world , Levitt emphasises on the significance of the ongoing mitigation efforts by countries .
The social-distancing mandates are critical -- particularly the ban on large gatherings -- because the virus is so new that the population has no immunity to it , and a vaccine is still many months away .
" This is not the time to go out drinking with your buddies , " he warns .
The goal needs to be better early detection -- not just through testing but perhaps with body-temperature surveillance , which China is implementing -- and immediate social isolation .
In addition , he says that the anti-vaccination mentality of Italy was perhaps one of the strong reasons why the virus spread so rapidly in Italy .
Getting vaccinated against the flu is important , too , because a coronavirus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more likely to overwhelm hospitals and increases the odds that the coronavirus goes undetected .
Levitt 's observations are a cool breeze in such troubled times .
The key , he says , is to control panic .
" In the grand scheme , we 're going to be fine , " he says .
The recipient of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2013 defies the doomsday predictions by various epidemiologists saying the data simply do n't support such a dire scenario -- especially in areas where reasonable social distancing measures are in place .
For him , the more pressing issue is the slowing economic activities caused by the coronavirus infections .
Countries across the globe have halted economic activities , including production , with many instructed to work from home .
The unorganised sector , including labourers and those dependent on daily wages , will stand to be the most affected as the world stares at a COVID-19 induced economic recession .
