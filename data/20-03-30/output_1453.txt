What is email protected ? email protected is a distributed computing program launch by Stanford University since the year 2000 , aimed to study the folding of protein to find causes and cure for multiple diseases .
The simulation of protein folding is a very computational heavy task .
Instead of getting gigantic cost supercomputer , they distributed this program to the volunteers around the world to donate their PC resources to help .
In return , donor will receive points for ranking purpose .
email protected Homepage  A word of warning though : if you choose ' Express Install ' the program will install in a manner that will automatically start it whenever your PC is running .
If you are happy to donate a bit of power and your computer 's reserves to solving this problem , go ahead and select that option .
If you want more control over your power usage , be sure to select the custom install option and tick the boxes appropriate to your preferences .

Passkey is a unique key that identified it 's you when two or more person use the exactly same name .
In addition , using a Passkey granted you bonus point .
All you need to do is fold 10 work unit with your Name &amp; Passkey .
After that , you will start to receive bonus point on your following work unit .
Passkey FAQ  You can get your Passkey here : Get email protected PasskeyNote : The passkey request form is case sensitive .
You will need an email for it , do n't lost your email .
Notes for your knowledge:1 .
) This is a beta program , you might encounter bugs , hang , restart , or even BSOD while folding .
Do n't panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , just stop it .
) Since it uses your idle CPU , or GPU , or both CPU &amp; GPU resources , it can heat up your PC , and raise your electricity bill a little bit .
) It might not necessary to get a work unit related to COVID-19 for you , but other diseases .
In other word , you were still contributing your effort towards other diseases .
It 's all about volunteering .

a passkey on sunday , still havent gotten them .
looks like the servers are overloaded , since the same issue is reported in their forums .
cant get my QRB for nowEdit : just requested the passkey using my yahoo mail , and got the passkey already .
something is wrong with gmail , it did nt even got into the spam folderseems like a lot of people are jumping in to help for COVID-19 these past few weeks , and the server ran out of WU ( Work Units ) /tasks to assign  So it 's deleted .

It 's also in the FAQ  QUOTE ( Current Events guy @ Mar 23 2020 , 03:41 PM )  How much impact would this have on your electricity bill ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run folding .
Let 's take a GTX 1060 rated at 120W for example .
When you fire up GPU folding on it at full load , additional 120W is drew from PSU .
( Assumed it really draw 120W power at full load .
In real scenario , power draw can be different .
) And let 's assumed your PSU is rated at 80% efficiency , when it supply the additional 120W into the PC component , additional 150W is drew from the wall electric socket .
Let 's assumed you run folding 6 hours everyday , a total of 180 hours in one month .
150W x 180 hours = 27kWh , so additional 27kWh of electricity on folding .
Let 's assumed the 27kWh hit the 201-300kWh range which cost 33 .
sen/kWh , 27 x RM0 .
= RM9 .
, so this figure is the rough estimation that impact your electricity bill .

Thanks for breaking it down .
I 'll look at the power rating for my GPU and calculate it from there .
My bad , the earlier estimations were incorrect .
The 70w is inclusive of the GPU idle ( which may be about 5-10w ) , and the increase in cpu usage does not draw as 30w of power .
Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power consumption in the calculation .
Anyway , just did measurements using a smart plug .
These are for GPU only folding , without any programs/games running .
My gaming pc 4790k+gtx1070 at stock does uses 70w on idle .
On GPU folding load , it jumps to 220w , for 650kppd ( 2954ppd/w ) .
Lowering the gpu powerlimit to 50% with +100core oc gets the power consumption down to 180w , for 600kppd ( 3333ppd/w ) .
My bad , the earlier estimations were incorrect .

Nonetheless , the point was to also include the other components power consumption in the calculation .

Kinda stopped folding when ca n't solve the issue with the client , only managed to utilize the CPU and i rather fold with GPU alone .
Hope to get back folding soon , currently working somewhere with limited internet .

If people want to know what its like to contribute to email protected , here 's a screenshotWork unit situation is almost like in email protected , you may or may not receive Covid19 WU depending on availability  Hi guys ! I 've just read about email protected and found that LYN has a group .
I just started yesterday as DieCorona19 .
How can I tell if my CPU is working fast enough .
I noticed some of you was talking about PPD ?  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not really explaining tho  Oh yeah , thanks for the head up .

Welcome to the family .
Make sure you get a passkey if you are interested on the bonus point .
What CPU do you have there ? A 1 .
PPD GPU , is that a RTX 2070 ?  Definitely a great spec for folding .
I believe the work unit outage still on going .
Do share the i7-9700K PPD when you got a work unit for it .
I got a few WU since yesterday but it seems to be completed in a very short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to see the PPD for CPU .
For GPU it takes less than 2 hours to complete so I have some time to check .
It 's quietly running in the background so sometimes I do n't know it is running WU until I hear my fan running a bit louder .

QUOTE ( muffdiver @ Mar 25 2020 , 04:39 PM )  My CPU just received another WU .
The PPD is 103,287  A very good PPD for CPU .
A few more work units , then you will be qualified for bonus point .
QUOTE ( keretapir @ Mar 25 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another piece of software called FahMon displays PPD data better .
to install it on the Win10 PC of mine , does n't work .
Tried Compatibility Mode , also does n't work .
finally , got a hold of CPU-based WU .
and it 's 14328 , one of those that relate to COVID-19 .
current TPF is about 27 seconds .
which is damn fast .
got ta say , Ryzen 3rd gen , the power usage is much lower than i 'm expecting .
( about 90 watts ) absolutely slaying them WU .
but PPD wise , it 's lesser than what my GPU ( a RX 580 ) can generate .
so , from my self-monitoring thus far:CPU folding , average PPD at 110k .
folding , average PPD at 430k .
Exactly .
Ryzen 3rd gen is very efficient .
But my Ryzen 3000 has to be limited to 50% usage only for the Folding as if I let it fold at full load , my PC will automatically reboot itself .
Not sure why .
I also notice GPU especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1 million ) PPD compared to CPU .
Maybe someone with Ryzen 3990X can try let us know what is the PPD with 64 cores .
had been folding for some years .
lately i 've noticed client ( windows ) did not receive any WU .
also had n't had the chance to work on any Covids .
any tips on getting it ? R5 2600+RX470  Glad to hear from you bro kucing , currently there is overwhelming response from worldwide , lead to folding server busy and frequently out of work unit .
I think we have minimum control on what kind of work unit that we can get , since the folding assignment server are the one who decides which machine to get assigment of work unit .
For now , what we can do is set folding preference to " any disease " .
COVID-19 projects are high priority project for now .
When you get assigned a work unit , there is good chance it is from the COVID-19 projects .
You may refer to the first post for COVID-19 projects range .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passkey in order to qualify for bonus point , you will see massive increase in terms of PPD .

I would like to know the Ryzen 3990X PPD as well .
But back to your rig , is it instantly reboot once the CPU is running at 100% load ? Any overclocking/boost performed ? Manage to check CPU temperature ? What are the other hardware especially graphic card and power supply ?  Our big boss has speak up .
I 'm not sure how was the client interpret " idle " , you might want to leave it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running .
We usually open advanced control interface for more control .
left from subforum .
Advanced setting does n't really have that much extra settings from the web ui for a pc with 1 gpu .
Maybe my pc does n't really goes idle .
yeah , I left it to run manually when I 'm not using .

Not sure what happened here , let 's fold a few more work units and see how is the point goes .
Is there another way to confirm that my passkey is working as it should ? It 's there on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did receive the passkey email when I signed up a couple days ago .
Is there another way to confirm that my passkey is working as it should ? It 's there on the configure page of the advanced control window and I did receive the passkey email when I signed up a couple days ago .
For now : 1 .
) Just make sure every information entered is correct , included case sensitive , a valid passkey that bind to the exact username from email protected email .
) Make sure folding results are sent before the corresponding work unit 's Preferred Deadline in order to receive bonus point .
) Probably fold 10 work units with your passkey , and see whether the 11th work unit and onwards will receive bonus point or not .
yeah , I manually restart the client to scan for workload .
if you leave the client to do its job , the waiting time to scan for next workload will get longer and longer .
so , just manually restart the client to reset the waiting time .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely get cpu one .

most of the workload i get is gpu based .
rarely get cpu one .
This is the best method for now .
Restart client is faster than continuously auto waiting .
