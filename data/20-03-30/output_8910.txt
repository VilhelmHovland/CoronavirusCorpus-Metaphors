US pending home sales trended higher before virus outbreak  BALTIMORE ( AP ) -- Americans signed more contracts in February to buy homes , but the gains are likely relics of a moment before the coronavirus outbreak sent the U .
economy spiraling into a likely recession .
The National Association of Realtors said Monday that its pending home sales index , which measures the numbers of purchase contracts signed , rose 2 .
in February from the prior month to 111 .
Lower mortgage rates were enticing more people to buy homes , such that pending sales had climbed 9 .
over the past 12 months .
But the outlook has deteriorated rapidly over the past month , as millions of Americans are losing their jobs and monthly rental and mortgage payments are becoming difficult to manage .
The Mortgage Bankers Association said that applications last week for home purchase loans had fallen 11% from a year ago .
