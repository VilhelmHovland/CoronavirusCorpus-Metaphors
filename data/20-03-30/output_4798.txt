The government is looking to make telehealth universally available from Monday , Mr Hunt told reporters in Canberra .
We are moving to whole-of-population telehealth so every Australian will have access to that , ' ' Mr Hunt said .
Doctors have been lobbying for more telehealth items to be added to the Medicare Benefits Schedule to help protect health workers and the general public from the coronavirus .
Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said expanded access to telehealth is vital for limiting the spread of COVID-19 .
The government is working with doctors and has committed to supporting a comprehensive telehealth model of care , Dr Bartone said .
" This commitment will see the government co-design the best practice expansion of telehealth items for all patients , with or without COVID-19 , to see any GP or other medical specialist during the COVID-19 health emergency , " Dr Bartone said .
Telehealth services are currently restricted to patients and doctors that are vulnerable to COVID-19 .
