The Texas football coach knows it 's not normal , just a step forward into something he called " different and new .
" In the old normal , the one that seems a lifetime ago , Texas should be a week into spring practice by now .
Now the school is back from an extended spring break because of the coronavirus with online classes thanks to Zoom .
Herman and his staff can now hold virtual meetings with players as a team or in groups for up to two hours a week as part of new Big 12 rules that will extend to May 31 .
" Tomorrow Tuesday will be the first time I 've gotten my face in front of the entire team , " Herman said on a media teleconference Monday .
Coming off an 8-5 finish and entering a potential make-or-break fourth season with new offensive and defensive coordinators , Herman did n't seem particularly bothered -- at least yet -- about the absence of spring practice .
" For anybody that 's complaining about no practice or they want more meeting time , I do n't get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak that has paralyzed college sports and large parts of the country .
Nearly all the normal down-and-distance offense and defense has been installed during walkthroughs in winter workouts , Herman said , although " physical reps " are still lacking .
With the shelter-in-the-place order in Austin , even throwing a football around outdoors is out of the question , he noted .
Of course , quarterback Sam Ehlinger is nursing a lingering rib injury that sidelined him for the final couple of weeks of winter workouts .
" We 'll figure the football part out .
We 'll figure all that stuff out , " Herman said .
" Let 's take care of our kids .
From a nutrition standpoint , let 's make sure they 've got a safe place to stay .
And then let 's figure out how we keep them in shape .
And let 's figure out how we 're going to get them the academic support that they need .
"  Herman 's biggest concern is about getting food to players at their homes , where resources maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ player 's scholarship checks could quickly be allocated to pressing family needs .
For now , Texas is limited to sending protein bars and powders .
While the Big 12 relaxed rules on virtual meetings and sending equipment to players , Herman had concerns when asked about an even playing field .
" The one thing that has me and other coaches in the Big 12 a little upset and a little confused is the ability to send your players workout equipment and tracking devices , " Herman said .
" They 've really restricted that moving forward , but yet other conferences have had two weeks of shipping this stuff out to their players .
Are they going to make those players send it back ? We 've got to figure out how to level the playing field as far as that 's concerned .
"  Linebacker Cort Jaquess took matters into his own hands , tweeting out a MacGyvered home workout thanks to supplies and cement from Home Depot .
Herman and his wife , Michelle , have been visible during the outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the Central Texas Food Bank .
At the same time , he 's done what countless others have done during an enforced down time -- things such as family game night and binge-watching .
His guilty pleasure , like just about everyone one else , is the wheels-off Netflix series Tiger King .
