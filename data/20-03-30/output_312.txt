What 's Your TV Comfort Food While You 're Stuck Inside ?  If you can stay home during the coronavirus crisis , you should .
But what should you watch while you 're stuck inside ? If you 're looking for a distraction from the world -- or just something to put on in the background while you keep checking the news -- we 've got plenty of suggestions for TV comfort food .
Here are 17 great shows that we 're watching ourselves right now , from classic sitcoms to cheerful reality series .
A show that almost exclusively takes place in a small basement bar might not be everyone 's idea of the ideal binge while trapped at home , but what I need right now is n't dragons , vast lands , or trying to trick myself with TV escapism .
It 's just really solid jokes .
I started binge-watching Cheers in early February before the coronavirus news went into overdrive , and it 's turned out to be the perfect way to pass the time now that I 'm home even more than before .
( I 'm currently about halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not every episode is perfect , but it 's deliciously casual viewing that hits much more than it misses .
Plus , a lot of people have already watched Cheers , so if you want to argue about whether Diane got the shaft in season five or why the hell the bar suddenly goes matte in season seven , there 's a world of fans ready to guide you through your binge .
But back to the most important thing : It 's really , really funny , and it 'll make you smile a lot .
What else could you ask for during a pandemic ? I ca n't recommend it enough .
NORM ! ! ! -- Megh Wright  In the midst of the stress and isolation surrounding a pandemic , do n't count out the technicolor comforts of Bryan Fuller 's pie-making slash crime-solving procedural .
It has everything : Lee Pace as a tall , awkward baker who can bring people back to life ( but only for one minute , or then someone else dies ) , morbidly hilarious causes of death , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out , Pushing Daisies doubles as an essential guide to love in times of self-isolation , with a central romance that ca n't ever be consummated , since Chuck and his revived paramour Ned ca n't touch each other or she 'll die .
Instead , they resort to kissing through cellophane , holding their own hands while standing near each other , and dancing in full-body bee suits .
Social distancing ca n't stop a love story .
-- Jackson McHenry  Anything that takes us back a few decades , well before this COVID-19 outbreak , can serve as nostalgic comfort food right now .
The Wonder Years , a comedy with a very high-sentimentality quotient , is set in the ' 60s and originally aired in the ' 80s , so it takes viewers back in time on two fronts .
Given its focus on Kevin Arnold 's struggle with adolescence , it 's also something you can watch with kids who are stuck at home during a school shutdown .
Personally , I relish the opportunity to spend a few minutes worrying solely about whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
-- Jen Chaney  Much of the Peak TV revolution passed me by , so I have a massive backlog of great TV that I should be watching , like The Sopranos , The Shield , Game of Thrones , or those final seasons of The Americans and Mad Men that I never got around to .
But two years ago , when one of my cats was slowly dying and I had to spend many long hours on the couch keeping him company , I found myself getting completely sucked into .
The League .
This unassuming bro-y comedy about a group of Chicago friends in an absolutely brutal fantasy football league is most certainly not Peak TV .
I 'm not even sure if it 's actually good TV .
I did n't have to pay too much attention to it -- and I was n't going to , because I was already distracted by all sorts of other real-life concerns -- but I did n't feel much shame because it was often absurdly funny .
And so , now that I 'm spending a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything , I have rediscovered the joys of The League .
The characters are simply drawn and likable , the plot dynamics easy to follow , and the laughs are just what I need to take my mind off things .
Once I 'm done , I can go back and finish off those remaining seasons of Breaking Bad .
Or maybe I 'll just watch The League again .
-- Bilge Ebiri  Some of the most comforting TV for dark times is TV that was made years ago .
For one thing , there 's often just more of it : The Golden Girls is seven seasons long , and each season is a monster 26 episodes , so you can get into a long , sustaining relationship with the show .
Older TV also tends to be rhythmic in a way that can be harder to find in recent shows .
There 's a repeating structure to the jokes , to the act breaks , to the episode arcs .
It 's verysoothing , and it works equally well as background noise or as a distraction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the right tone and emotion for anxious minds .
It 's full of goofy , gloriously eye-roll worthy one liners and gags .
But it 's also unfailingly warm and sincere , a show about women who love one another and who face serious crises by being supportive and empathetic .
Trust me when I say this is what you need in your life .
-- Kathryn VanArendonk  It 's admittedly a stretch to call The Sopranos " comfort viewing , " nor is it precisely a show I 've been meaning to catch up with , as I watched the series during its initial broadcast run .
But it is a show that 's been at the top of my rewatch list since the advent of HBO 's streaming platform .
However , having a job that necessitates staying on top of current television ( lol , like that 's even possible ) makes the very idea of rewatching old series feel like an indulgence , one I usually reserve for shows I know so well they 're basically in my bloodstream , like The Simpsons or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 hours of my full attention and engagement , something I 've only recently been able to give it .
Full disclosure , I started my current Sopranos rewatch a little before " social distancing " became the phrase of the moment ; a running gag in Hulu 's High Fidelity remake about Rob never having seen The Sopranos inspired my fianc ? , who 's never seen the show , to finally jump in , and I happily came along for the ride .
Now that we 've hit the series ' third ( and arguably best ) season , it 's accelerating into a full-on binge -- which is itself a new experience , given that I 'd only seen the show in week-to-week , year-to-year real time .
That instant gratification , combined with the 15 years ' worth of TV-watching and critical thinking skills I 've developed since I first watched , has made it feel in many ways like I 'm watching The Sopranos for the first time .
It 's not so much that the show is easy to watch as it 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deeper level than I have before , and that is its own kind of comfort .
-- Genevieve Koski  The most comforting TV show for me right now is also The Sopranos , because the Jersey mafia enforces structure and rules amidst chaos , even if those rules are " murder that guy with a golf club or I will throw you off a boat .
" But if you have n't seenit yet , I would strongly recommend watching The OA .
It was already a balm for what ails modern society -- capitalist greed , reckless individualism , toxic masculinity , et .
-- but its message of social unity , vulnerability , community , and absolute bonkers-ness is especially resonant now .
It 's also a deeply felt , propulsive , singular story that will shuttle you outside of your own panic-polluted brain ( ideally to another dimension where the Trump administration does n't exist ) .
How did Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij predict that we 'd need to be reminded , in the most literal of ways , that the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ? They probably had help from their psychic octopus .
-- Rachel Handler  Either one of these classic ' 70s comedies is worth a watch by themselves , but together they 're like the grilled cheese and tomato soup of comfort TV .
There 's a reason CBS paired them up on Saturday nights back in the day : Both feature some of the sharpest comedy writers of the era ( Mary Tyler Moore was co-created by the legendary James L .
Brooks ) , two comedy icons as leads , and amazing ensemble casts , all of whom were operating in peak form .
And for students of pop culture history , both shows now also serve as perfect time capsules for the Me Decade , showcasing the fashion and home designs of the years just before disco .
If you can resist the urge to binge , do what I do : Watch one episode of each show , back to back , just one night a week ( or , if that 's too slow , one episode of each every day ) .
It 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait to get past this pandemic .
-- Josef Adalian  If Friends is your go-to relaxation show , let me be the first to welcome you to 2020 .
Here , we have a little reality show called Terrace House , where six young Japanese professionals move in together and , you know , hang out and stuff .
Same concept .
Unlike other reality shows , drama is instigated with omelettes instead of drink-throwing , everything is styled like a Muji ( famously the most relaxing retail store ) , and reading the subtitles rather than getting distracted by coronavirus tweets gives my anxious brain something else to focus on .
-- Zo ? Haylock  Growing up , my family moved to new states multiple times , but wherever we 'd end up , one thing could be counted on : A local TV station would syndicate at least one ( and sometimes two ! ) episodes of The Simpsons at some convenient point in the late afternoon .
I watched does some math on an envelope all of them .
Since the launch of Disney+ , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a number of annoying circumstances -- work , friends , Love Is Blind -- have gotten in the way of that plan .
But now that I 'm trapped at home all day , I 've been ripping through them again and it 's been amazing , missing sight gags be damned .
-- Ray Rahman  Even though I was alive for the entirety of Frasier 's 11-season run , I completely missed it .
Sure , it was on my family 's TV occasionally when I was a kid , but unless Eddy was doing something goofy to get on Frasier 's nerves , I was n't interested .
But now , as an adult , I can tell you this : Frasier is good , guys ! It 's got everything .
Broad slapstick ! Witty , high brow references ! The dog ! Meanwhile , the extreme theatricality that Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce bring to every scene comforts me at this time when all the actual theaters are closed .
I 've been stuck at home for days now and time has slowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crane family 's wormhole .
My only regret is not buying any top-shelf sherry before this pandemic came to New York .
-- Tolly Wright  CW 's longest-running show ends after 15 seasons this May , but I 'm only on season five .
As someone with a predilection for spooky , witchy comedy-dramas -- someone who has long since finished all 11 seasons of The X-Files and all seven seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer -- I 've found solace in the fact that I have nine more seasons of Supernatural in my Netflix queue .
That 's more than 200 episodes of Jensen Ackles 's rough yet comforting baritone to make this damsel feel safe .
-- Trupti Rami  Apple &amp; Onion is the cutest , sweetest , cutie sweetie of a show .
It 's about exactly what it sounds like : An apple named Apple ( voiced by creator George Gendi ) and a scallion named Onion ( voiced by Richard Aayode ) are roommates in a big city in a world populated by other anthropomorphic foods ( Eugene Merman is a burger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cotton candy ) .
It shares a deadpan sense of humor and fish-out-of-water sensibility with Flight of the Conchords , and has the same sort of sunny , chill vibes and visual gags as Tuca and Bertie .
Plus , it 's a certified all-ages watch , if you have kids home from school during these corona times .
Double-plus , every episode has catchy songs .
Triple-double-plus , the show has such an infectiously positive attitude without being manic or cloying that it makes you grateful for the small things that you do have : friends , video games , your cat , your bed , diner food , leftover cake in the fridge , a roof to sneak onto , a sunset to watch .
-- Rebecca Alter  A cult classic that never quite got the attention it deserved outside of comedy nerd circles , all nine seasons of Peep Show are waiting to brighten your days in isolation .
This show brings you directly inside the heads of two male roommates living in London : Mark , the fastidious history nerd who has terrible luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the largely unemployed musician who .
also has terrible luck in love .
Being able to hear their inner monologues means it takes no time at all to feel fully drawn into their world of schemes , squabbles , and humiliations .
Not to mention it 's shot entirely from the actual POV of the characters , so in a way it can feel as though you 're walking around outside in London , too ! But what really puts it over the top is Oscar winner Olivia Coleman in one of her first major roles .
If you thought her on-command tear in The Crown was impressive , wait til you see her drunk in a ball pit .
-- Anne Victoria Clark  Pretty Little Liars is simply put , a perfect show for being confined to quarters , and best consumed as a binge .
Over the course of its seven seasons and 160 episodes , PLL reinvented jumping the shark and turned it into performance art .
The plot twists become labyrinthine .
The number of characters introduced , discarded , and then brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innumerable , and yet its self aware sense of humor and the perfect chemistry between its key four characters stay charming and reward long-term viewing .
What 's the show about ? Oh yeah .
A group of high school friends in a small , posh Pennsylvania set out to solve the murder of their former best friend and in the process land in a vast criminal conspiracy network .
( And I do mean vast .
) These are trying times , so treat yourself to a vacation in lovely Rosewood .
-- Jordan Crucchiola  Whether it 's from this season or from the archives , SNL is my comfort TV .
I will rewatch full episodes , or just bundles of sketches from the Lonely Island , Stefon clips , the Schweddy series , Celebrity Jeopardy , and Bronx Beat for hours on end , either as background noise or to feel less down .
Watching SNL on Sunday mornings is already part of my routine , but now that coronavirus has us all pent up at home -- lonely , horny , hungry , and questioning the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actors making absolute fools of themselves is an easy way to give myself some much-needed joy .
