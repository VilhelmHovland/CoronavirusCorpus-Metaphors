A Few Thoughts on Watching Cats Alone  We are all now the cats of Cats , prowling in the shadows of our tattered culture , reliving memories in the ruined theaters of our minds .
Photo : Universal Pictures  As the spread of the coronavirus continues to halt the release of new movies in theaters , Vulture 's film critics will be sporadically reconsidering the movies available to stream from home instead .
This month , the Golden Raspberry awards ( the Razzies ) were nearly swept by the movie version of Cats , a predictable and -- at least for this viewer -- disheartening final mauling of a creature long dead .
But there are misconceived movies and movies that are so misconceived that they 're haunting , evoking complex emotions ( despair , futility , the impossibility of transcendence ) in ways that conventionally " good " films -- Oscar winners , even -- do n't come near .
Two months after watching it -- in a near-empty theater in a suburban multiplex , my family defiantly not with me -- I continue to brood onits failings , which seem even more resonant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all now the cats of Cats , prowling in the shadows of our tattered culture , reliving memories in the ruined theaters of our minds , longing for a way out .
Few films have been as insistently misdirected from first frame to last , but it 's worth asking if Cats -- even without its auteur , Tom Hooper -- could have been a mainstream hit on the big screen .
My answer is a firm maybe .
The backbone is solid : Years before the musical , I participated in a high school " readers theater " performance of T .
Eliot 's Old Possum 's Book of Practical Cats , and the poems sounded delightful .
Depicting the aristocrats ( or should I say aristocats ? ) of Eliot 's time , they were arch but droll , the feline aspect providing the perfect satirical distance .
Eliot 's verses come through even set to Andrew Lloyd Weber 's mostly banal tunes , but what sold the musical ( originally directed by longtime Royal Shakespeare Company head Trevor Nunn ) was its live-wire ensemble vibe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constant and eye-catching : Cats watched cats , and we watched cats watching cats -- watching us .
Sharing the space was all .
The ' 70s phenomenon of A Chorus Line was still very much in the air , and Cats was its sillier , more surreal cousin , albeit with a happier -- quasi-religious -- ending .
A director who shot the dances straight-on with no fancy cutting might have replicated some of the show 's magic , while one with an Edward Gorey- or Ronald Searle-like visual sense ( Tim Burton , say ) might have made its universe all of a piece .
Although I am here to celebrate the existing film of Cats and not to autopsy it , it must be analyzed pitilessly to understand why it 's such a model of disunity -- that disunity being central to its artistic power .
One of Hooper 's first and most lunkheaded decisions was to film the action with a shaky , hand-held camera , presumably to add a bit of that theatrical live-wire-ness .
But the effect is to overhype every image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wo n't let you focus .
Hooper did the same in his smash-hit Les Mis ? rables ( in my review of that film , I imagined the cameraman to be " small , fleet , and extremely high strung , like Gollum " ) but Cats is frenetically edited , the bombardment intensified .
The movie is shaky and jumpy -- overcaffeinated .
The editing chops the dances into pieces so small that you ca n't appreciate ( or depreciate , for that matter ) the work of Broadway choreographer Andy Blankenbueler .
In the musical 's latest Broadway iteration , Blankenbueler individualized the dancers ' movements so they 'd coalesce and diverge , coalesce and diverge , but the randomness of Hooper 's cutting makes it difficult to discern any pattern .
It 's as if you 've walked into a dance studio before rehearsal and found each performer working on his or her own routine .
You say , " Hello ? Is there going to be a show ? "  Which raises the question of storytelling .
Les Mis ? rables survived its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets you past the what the fuck am I even watching ? stage .
A bagged cat -- Victoria , played by prima ballerina Francesca Hayward -- is dumped in a London alley by a presumably rich woman and then descended upon by numerous " Jellicle " felines , who tell her " Victoria " is n't much of a name for a cat but somehow fail ( after performing a big number about naming cats ) to give her a new one .
Somewhat oriented ( more than the audience , anyway ) , Victoria meets Old Deuteronomy ( Judi Dench ) , who will judge an annual talent competition in an empty theater to determine which cat will get to ascend to the " Heaviside Layer " and then be reborn -- someplace better , one hopes .
A villain called Macavity ( Idris Elba ) attempts to win the contest by beaming every other contestant across town , whereupon .
Are you still reading ? I do n't know why I 'm even attempting a synopsis , except to say I relate to the cats ' desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , its unpleasantness exacerbated by Hooper 's decision to stab our eyes with backlighting .
The computer-generated fur seems to me the least of the movie 's infelicities .
It is , from start to finish , the bleakest movie musical ever made , effectively reimagining the world as a cavernous void .
Just as the recent film version of Annie managed to make a hash of the surefire number " Tomorrow , " Cats comes a cropper with the song everyone knows , " Memories .
" In the role of a fallen feline -- the unsavory implication is that she was used up by the pimplike Macavity -- Jennifer Hudson makes the mistake of leading with her character 's despair , acting " Memories " instead of letting the words and music do the work .
Her histrionics overwhelm the melody .
She reminded me of an amateur actress I once knew who told me her death scene would make everyone in the theater weep , whereas what happened was that she did all weeping and the audience sat stone-faced .
As for Judi Dench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song while having no talent as a singer .
It 's as if an actress playing Mother Superior sang " Climb Every Mountain " and lost her breath midway through , suggesting the likelihood of falling into a crevice .
It is the stupendousness of its failure that makes Cats so arresting , so vivid , so heartbreaking .
It is , from start to finish , the bleakest movie musical ever made , effectively reimagining the world as a cavernous void filled with decaying piles of garbage and creatures neither human nor animal but gruesome , H .
Wellesian hybrids .
Is this how we will look when we de-evolve , having been ravaged by pandemics and global warming ? Perhaps it is only as beings half-human and half-cat will we be able to survive at all , feeding on mice and cockroaches and clawing at those who would invade our private spaces .
But as these creatures are denuded of procreative organs , the very perpetuation of the species remains in doubt .
From this perspective , the inability of the dancers to merge into an organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not its weakness , the cats ' very name a mockery : Jellicles do n't jell .
Separateness is the human/feline condition , dispersal the principle that underlines all motion .
There are fleeting moments of exhilaration when a dance is executed fluidly or a pleasing melody wafts up from the mushy recitative .
They are signs that the gods yet live -- but barely , as a faint warmth at the center of a compost heap .
Imagine Beckett 's Endgame with mange and you have something close to the artistic purity of Cats .
The movie 's best imaginable audience would be people in shelters slowly succumbing to radiation poisoning -- or waiting for the next coronavirus .
In the meantime , here we are , looking for movies to stream , and what could be more apropos ? It 's ironic but fitting that you ca n't watch it at this moment with a large group of friends , from whom you must " social-distance .
" ( Yes , it 's a compound verb now -- and forever .
) Watching it alone will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once that the existence of a " Heaviside Layer " is a sham -- what Eugene O'Neill called a life lie to keep us all from committing suicide .
