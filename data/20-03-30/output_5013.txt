The markets will remain volatile for some time given the unprecedented impact from the Coronavirus on global economies , business supply chains and consumer spending patterns .
However , as the landscape is rapidly evolving , it remains to be seen whether the direct impacts will prove to be transient or longer lasting .
We are now experiencing unprecedented times , with balance sheets across the world being tested .
It will be the survival of the fittest , or strongest balance sheet .
Side effects on the real estate market  We expect this period of uncertainty and volatility to impact liquidity , with debt providers being more selective and conservative in an environment where real estate valuations prove difficult .
This is likely to lead to lower transaction activity , with vendors and buyers alike delaying decisions until the depth and duration of this period is clearer .
Despite the uncertainty , the real estate market in general terms is well-placed .
Average leverage is at a relatively comfortable level , in an historic context , due to the prudential controls on lending that commenced roughly four years ago .
That said , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable asset owners , although if the current crisis abates in the timeframes predicted by the government , we would n't expect any significant distress .

Morgan  Assessing short-term pressures  At Freehold , capital preservation and delivering sustainable returns for investors from tangible assets always drives our thinking .
So , our conservative approach to risk and leverage will not change in these times .
However , the biggest challenge in an environment where there are fewer willing sellers and buyers , is determining the market value of assets .
Whilst we believe our defensive positioning generally protects the Freehold portfolio , we are conscious that as the impact of the Coronavirus and related health and economic crisis unfolds , it is prudent to assume there may be various issues or liquidity pressures and technical defaults across our portfolio .
Any such occurrence may have some impact on short to medium-term returns and cash flows .
Risk and leverage are front of mind  As at 28 February 2020 , the weighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the portfolio was secured by first ranking senior mortgages .
All facilities within the portfolio remain fully compliant .
In the current environment it is possible that there may be short term defaults .
However , the conservative LVRs and the quality of the underlying property should ensure recovery of capital and returns when the market ultimately reverts to normality .
At this stage , we 're not seeing signs of widespread defaults , but we have seen some signs of increased funding costs for borrowers .
Positioning for the weeks ahead  Our current portfolio is diversified across 34 individual projects comprising land finance 69% , construction 27% and two material investments to go into residual stock in March and April 2020 .
All our projects are sufficiently funded to complete construction and reach point of maximum value .
Looking across the projects , those in construction remain on track .
Despite some initial concerns around the potential delay of materials from China , the Chinese economy has started opening again with factories shipping over the last few weeks .
There has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the last couple of weeks of March .
However , we are mindful that it is a rapidly changing environment and , at this point , it is unclear what will happen in the weeks ahead .
This week both NSW and Victoria have further restricted non-essential activities .
Additionally , as both Federal and State Governments have indicated , it is likely there will be further restrictions on movement in the near term .
These restrictions will have a significant impact on all commercial activity across the economy , not just real estate .
We expect projects that are in the construction phase to continue , but obviously be subject to rapidly changing conditions where work may be stopped .
Projects that are currently in design or DA phase have the ability to progress through work from home arrangements .
Transaction activity will drop , and this is already evident .
In the near term , developers are likely to pause or delay investment activity , and those with balance sheet capacity may choose to pay down debt .
At Freehold , capital preservation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives our thinking .
So , our conservative approach to risk and leverage will not change in these times .
However , the biggest challenge in an environment where there are fewer willing sellers and buyers , is determining the market value of assets .
