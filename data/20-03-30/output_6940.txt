Opinion : While the coronavirus threatens us all , including law enforcement officers , they continue to protect us from other , more common , but just as deadly threats .
Phoenix police Cmdr .
Greg Carnicle and the officers who answered a disturbance call Sunday night did not have the option of sheltering in place .
Because while the coronavirus threatens us all , including first responders , some among us also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crime , and to fight that epidemic , to flatten that curve , we have men and women like Commander Carnicle and all of the other law enforcement professionals .
Police say it began as an argument between roommates , and that the officers were speaking with one of the residents when they were shot .
Even after the loss of an individual our police department and our city and our state and our country could not afford to lose , those other professionals continue to serve .
How petty our concerns can seem  The department tweeted :  Critical Incident : With heavy hearts we announce the passing of a Phx PD Commander .
Greg Carnicle was shot at the scene of a domestic violence call .
Two other officers also shot at 40th Drive and Pinnacle Peak .
The two officers are expected to recover .
RIP Cmdr Carnicle .

**26;132;TOOLONG  An incident like this wakes us from our self-centered routines and for a time everything we were worried about or were arguing about seems petty and unimportant .
It reminds us , in the worst way possible , about how good we have it because of them , even during these dark days of the pandemic .
It reminds us of how petty our concerns can seem compared to what the men and women of the police department are willing to do for us .
To sacrifice for us .
Officers are the same as us , only better  Phoenix Police Department Commander Greg Carnicle died after being shot at the scene of a domestic violence call at 40th Drive and Pinnacle Peak Road in Phoenix on March 29 , 2020 .
( Photo : Phoenix Police Department )  These officers have the same concerns that you and I have .
They have bills to pay and children to educate and cars to keep in running condition and garbage to take out .
They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same issues and concerns in your family .
Money trouble .
Illness .
Relationship problems .
They worry , as we worry , about the virus .
About the possibility that their job might expose them to the illness , as it might expose them to other dangers .
They 're the same as us , only better .
They go to work each day knowing they might have to give up their lives on our behalf .
