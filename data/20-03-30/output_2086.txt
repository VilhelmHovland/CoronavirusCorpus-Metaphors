Edmonton Eskimos president experiences gravity of COVID-19 pandemic  A lone hand is raised during a team huddle at the Edmonton Eskimos training camp held at Commonwealth Stadium on May 20 , 2019 .
The CFL has announced the postponement of 2020 training camps amid COVID-19 measures .
Training camps across the CFL were postponed indefinitely Monday as part of COVID-19 measures , but the realization of just how big an effect the coronavirus is having hit Chris Presson well before the announcement .
The Edmonton Eskimos president and CEO gained an entirely new perspective from 40,000 feet in the air on his flight back home last week to be with his family in Arizona during the shutdown .
" My flight from Calgary to Mesa ( Arizona ) , I was the only one on a 737 , " Presson said on a phone call from Phoenix , where it is scheduled to hit 30C on Wednesday and Thursday .
" The only one on the entire plane .
Flight 1518 from Calgary to Mesa Gateway , I was the only passenger .
"  And from the picture he painted , he might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Initially , he had booked a flight for later in the week , before deciding to call ahead and check on its status .
" Clearly the airlines are overwhelmed and I did n't get through , so I drove to the airport and found out that my flight had been cancelled .
And I was told that if I wanted to make it to the United States anytime relatively soon that I needed to do so by midnight last Sunday , " he said .
" So I was able to get on a plane .
"  Beforehand , they still went through the practice of calling for priority passengers first .
" I walk up there because I can see there 's hardly anybody in the waiting area , so I know they 're not going to care if I 'm in Zone 3 and I get on the plane now , " he said .
" The lady laughed and said , ' We had to say that , you 're the only one on the airplane .
' " I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of a handful on the first leg of the flight from Edmonton to Calgary .
" Just that in and of itself tells you it 's clearly a global crisis , as we all know , "  Presson said .
" You can just tell when I got to Calgary and there was nobody in the airport , and then when I got to Mesa and got off the airplane as the sole passenger , the flight going back to Edmonton was completely sold out .
" So , just an odd time in the world right now .
"  And as of Monday , it the effects spilled all over the Canadian gridiron , which previously had cancellations to the CFL 's global draft and scouting combines scheduled earlier this month .
The regular season is still scheduled to kick off June 11 , with the B .
Lions visiting Edmonton .
And at this point , there is a very real possibility the postponement will carry on past the preseason .
" We 're still planning on having a season and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our schedule today , " Presson said .
" We 're still planning on having a season and we 're still hopeful that we can .
" Right now , we 're kind of at the mercy of the public health officials , to be honest .
"  In the meantime , Commonwealth Stadium will remain all but empty , which goes for the football operations side of things as much as the business side .
" They can not be in the building either unless there is treatment needed , " Presson said of the 106 players currently listed on the team 's website , many of whom are also back home in the U .
" That treatment plan has to be arranged and the appointment has to be arranged through the league office in a small segment ( of the facility ) and then we have to go through a cleaning protocol once that 's complete .
" So in the last couple weeks , we have n't had anyone in the facility , business or football , other than to pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallways .
Empty plane .
It all feels like a plot that belongs on a Hollywood set suddenly sprang to life .
" You 've got three or four people in the office grabbing items and we had that discussion , that it truly does feel like something from a movie , " Presson said .
" A bad movie .
" And it seems to continue to progress and I think we 're all hoping the same thing : That we finally get that peak so that we can turn down into a valley and this can all go away , because it 's not going to last forever , we will get through it , we will eventually prosper .
" It 's just the waiting period and the horrific stories you hear of those that are sick , and beyond that , those that have lost their lives and those in the healthcare industry that are working every day to handle as best they can what 's in front of them .
