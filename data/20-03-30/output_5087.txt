Testing rate fall leaves thousands at risk of hep C  Australia will fail to meet World Health Organization ( WHO ) targets for the elimination of hepatitis C unless a hidden population of up to 170,000 people , many unaware of their infection , is urgently identified , tested and treated , according to new Burnet Institute research .
In summary :  The rate of hepatitis C testing in Australia has collapsed to 2012 levels  Tens of thousands of Australians unaware of their infection are missing out on life-saving treatments  Stigma is preventing many who are aware of their infection from getting tested  These people are at serious risk of cancer or liver disease caused by hepatitis C  A 50 percent increase in testing is needed for Australia at achieve its WHO elimination targets  Around 70,000 Australians have been cured of hepatitis C since 2016 when new highly effective medications became available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme .
But it 's estimated up to 170,000 other Australians remain at serious risk from the deadly blood-borne virus , which can cause liver damage , cirrhosis and cancer over a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late .
A new study led by Burnet Institute econometrician , Dr Nick Scott , found that despite a cure becoming available , the national rate of hepatitis C testing has plunged to 2012 levels .
The study also used mathematical modelling to project that a 50 percent increase in testing will be needed for Australia to meet WHO 's goal of eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat by 2030 .
" We 've been effective at treating people who are already engaged in care or who are easy to reach , but they only account for about a third of people with hepatitis C , " Dr Scott said .
" What we have n't been good at is finding and diagnosing new people , which is why we 're seeing treatment numbers start to decline and why the models are projecting that we are not on track to reach the targets .
" Many of the remaining people with hepatitis C may have never been diagnosed , or may have been diagnosed a long time ago and either forgotten or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are about finding or re-engaging them and getting them treated .
"  Dr Scott said campaigns targeting high-risk groups such as people who inject drugs had been effective in boosting treatment numbers , but there are also many people with hepatitis C who may not identify as high-risk .
" There 's a lot of people who may have injected drugs 20 or 30 years ago , and because that activity has long since stopped they 're not connected to services for people who inject drugs and we 're not reaching them with our program , " Dr Scott said .
" I do n't think we really know how to reach them -- it 's going to be a major challenge .
" This study also challenges the idea that just because we have a cure , elimination is going to happen .
It 's not happening , and the fact that we 're testing today at 2012 levels is actually quite alarming .
"  Study senior author , Burnet Deputy Director , Professor Margaret Hellard AM , said the EC ( Eliminate Hepatitis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that treatment numbers are maintained to stop new hepatitis C infections and hepatitis C related deaths .
" This paper highlights that one of the major challenges for Australia in eliminating hepatitis C is finding people who are infected with hepatitis C and engaging them in testing and care .
The EC Australia Partnership is now focusing on this issue , " Professor Hellard said .
" Many people do n't know their status , many are discouraged from seeking treatment because of stigma , and it 's a tragedy that they are missing out on life-saving therapies which are so readily available .
"  Co-ordinated by Burnet and funded by the Paul Ramsay Foundation , EC Australia is a multi-million dollar targeted national response to the serious decline in the uptake of the new medications to cure hepatitis C among Australians living with the deadly virus .

( Media ownership in Australia is one of the most concentrated in the world ( more on this ! ) .
Since the trend of consolidation is and has historically been upward , fewer and fewer individuals or organizations control increasing shares of the mass media in our country .
