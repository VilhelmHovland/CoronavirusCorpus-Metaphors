The situation arising out of this outbreak and its rapid spread across the world is unprecedented and is extremely dynamic .
The economic impact is visible with varying degrees of intensity across multiple countries where we operate .
HCL has had a well-defined and structured pandemic policy in place which is resilient , pragmatic and accords paramount importance to employee safety &amp; health and client commitments .

Our exposure to the more impacted verticals are not significant .
Booking during this quarter has largely been on track as significant part of closures happened in January .
Our business model is a healthy mix of recurring product revenues , managed services and discretionary spend led professional services .
From a vertical perspective , our exposure to verticals like Oil &amp; Gas , Travel &amp; Hospitality , High-End Retail is in single digits .
We recognize our investments in risk management systems and processes over the last several years are helping us to minimize the short-term impact and to be adequately prepared for the medium term , if it gets worse .
We are also confident our business model will help us to emerge stronger in the longer term as it has been built for resilience during tough times .
Our wishes of safety and best of health to everyone out there and we hope and pray for the earliest end to the crisis .
Keep a safe distance .
