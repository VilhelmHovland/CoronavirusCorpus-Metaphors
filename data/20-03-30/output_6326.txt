Aguinaldo  Multimedia Reporter  StartupBlink has launched the Coronavirus Innovation Map , a global digital map pinpointing innovations and solutions that help people cope with and adapt to the changes brought about by the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic .
Simply typing in a location ( such as a city or country ) , users are greeted with a list of innovations developed out of that locale .
The search can be further narrowed by choosing through five categories :  Prevention -- tracking and preventing the spread of the virus  Diagnosis -- diagnosing and identifying the infected  Treatment -- precautionary treatments such as medicine ; accessing medication without having to leave home  Information -- spreading timely and accurate information about the pandemic and ongoing innovations  Life and business adaptation -- adjusting daily lives to the current situation through virtual applications  According to StartupBlink , the map was created not only to stay informed but also to honor humankind 's innovative spirit .
" One of the things we need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of not only the bad but the good that is happening in the world .
It is also important to know that public institutions , corporations , and startups around the globe have been working tirelessly since the emergence of the coronavirus in hopes to find a solution or contain this virus .
"  StartupBlink also hopes to connect more innovators and integrate more solutions into their map .
" We know that curating all relevant data in a short amount of time is not achievable by a single person or company .
This is why we will need everyone 's help .
Through crowdsourcing and the help of the community , we will be able to cover the gaps and have as much information as possible .
"  Those who would like to have their innovation or solution integrated into the map may apply through this form .
