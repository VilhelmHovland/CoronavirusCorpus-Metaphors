From better hygiene that has reduced other infectious diseases to people reaching out as they self-isolate , here are some slivers of silver linings during a bleak moment .
-- Wash your hands ! --  The message from health professionals has been clear from the start of the outbreak : wash your hands .
Everyone from celebrities to politicians has had a go at demonstrating correct technique -- including singing " Happy Birthday " twice through to make sure you scrub long enough , and hand sanitiser has flown off the shelves .
All that extra hygiene appears to be paying off , at least in some countries , including Japan , where the number of flu cases appears to be sharply down .
Japan recorded 7 .
million cases by early March -- usually around the peak of the flu season that runs until May .
That was far below figures for previous years , including the 21 .

In Colombia , where a nearly three-week period of self-isolation is now in place , 43-year-old Andrea Uribe has organised everything from group exercise classes to family talent shows using video messaging programmes including Zoom .
" I have called my parents more often , I have talked to friends that I usually do n't talk to .
I have organised Zoom meetings with friends in multiple countries , " Uribe , who works in development , told AFP .
" It is wonderful to be forced to be there for one another .
It has made me more creative .
