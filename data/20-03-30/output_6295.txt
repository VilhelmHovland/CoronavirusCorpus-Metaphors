As of 30 March , Covid-19 has claimed over 33,000 lives across the world , with more than 1000 cases testing positive in India .
As health experts , scientists and innovators work round the clock to develop a cure to end the deadly outbreak , IIT alumnus , Debayan Saha and Dr Shashi Ranjan have come up with a device that could possibly restrict the spread of COVID-19 .
Called the ' Airlens Minus Corona ' , the human-shaped robot can sterilise streets and public places like hospitals , bus stops , railway stations , shopping malls .
The machine discharges charged/ionised water droplets to sterilise surfaces that can potentially cause the spread of coronavirus .
' Airlens Minus Corona '  This technology , however , is not new and is currently being used in Vietnam .
" The charged or ionised water droplets can kill the virus by deactivating viruses by denaturing their protein coat .
In other words , the droplets help in the oxidation ( one of the most potent antimicrobial tool ) of viral proteins into non-harmful molecules , " explains Saha who along with Dr Ranjan , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM Minus 2 .
that curbs vehicle pollution and Airlens , a car sanitiser .
Dr Ranjan learnt about the power of oxidation during his scientific research at NUS in Singapore , " I realised that oxidation is one of the most potent antimicrobial tools which can sterilise the entire city .
Our technology uses an optimal combination of electric energy and water atomisation techniques to induce a charge on water droplets while creating Hydroxyl radicals that can oxidise and kill the coronavirus .
"  From Left to Right Dr Shashi Ranjan , Debayan Saha and a team member  Saha believes that the electrifying water method works like the bigger version of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser , " The sanitisers are useful in lessening the threat of catching the coronavirus just like our machine .
Through this machine , we can arrest the virus and may flatten the curve .
"  The human-shaped robot that sterilises public spaces  Working Continuously During Lockdown  Saha is currently stuck in Kolkata due to the lockdown and Dr Shashi is in Delhi .
But , the duo did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision , instead it propelled them to move ahead as planned .
They created prototypes of the machine at their respective places with the resources they could procure .
They have submitted a proposal to the Technology Development Board ( TDB ) , a statutory body under the Department of Science &amp; Technology , to test their device and are currently awaiting a response from them .
" We are not selling the device as it is for the betterment of society .
We want more engineers across India developing similar machines that can help fight Covid-19 , " says Saha .
With the help of team members , Saha and Ranjan are currently working on manufacturing ten more devices by next week .
However , they are running out of raw materials and space due to the lockdown and need help from various stakeholders like manufacturing companies of materials and authorities to source the same .
