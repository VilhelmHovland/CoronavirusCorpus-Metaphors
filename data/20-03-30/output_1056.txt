CALLS have been made for more stringent and urgent action to be taken against people blatantly flouting lockdown measures after scores of people flocked to Strathclyde Country Park yesterday .
Images of piled up traffic and people exploring the North Lanarkshire park flooded online yesterday , with the park eventually trending on Twitter due to the resulting anger from many social media users .
Official government advice is to " stay local and use open spaces near to your home where possible -- do not travel unnecessarily " .
Twitter user Jennifer Findlay tagged Police Scotland in her post showing a picture of the busy car park , saying : " So we decided to walk to Strathclyde park as it 's 2 minutes from home with the kids for exercise &amp; I 'm speechless I thought it was said people would be fined for travelling by car to walk yet the place is mobbed with cars I 'm actually shocked .
"  Lisa Ross also tweeted : " I 'm an NHS Team Leader in Health &amp; Homeless .
we are working every day doing what we can whilst putting our own health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing this and increasing risk for everyone .
Appalling .
"  Other social media users responded by suggesting those flouting the lockdown should receive ? 250 fines on ther car windows , doubling to ? 500 if not paid within five days , while another tweeted that we should " start charging them with attempted murder instead of a ? 60 fine as it 's obviously not getting through " .
And Tracey Muir tagged Nicola Sturgeon , saying : " Honestly what is the point of businesses shutting schools if this is still allowed .
"  It comes after Scots were reminded of the need to stay home , regardless of the fine weather .
National Clinical Director for the Scottish Government , Jason Leitch , recorded a video on Friday saying that following the first week of lockdown , he was aware that the weekend would offer its usual temptations to go out and see friends and socialise , but he said : " The rules stay the same , even for the weekend .
