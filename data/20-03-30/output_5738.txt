This relief to employees and small and midsize businesses is provided under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act , signed by President Donald Trump on March 18 , 2020 .
The act will help the United States combat and defeat COVID-19 by giving all American businesses with fewer than 500 employees funds to provide employees with paid leave , either for the employee 's own health needs or to care for family members .
The legislation will enable employers to keep their workers on their payrolls , while at the same time ensuring that workers are not forced to choose between their paychecks and the public health measures needed to combat the virus .

* Health insurance costs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll tax liability .
* Self-employed individuals receive an equivalent credit .
* Fast Funds : Reimbursement will be quick and easy to obtain .
* An immediate dollar-for-dollar tax offset against payroll taxes will be provided * Where a refund is owed , the IRS will send the refund as quickly as possible .
* Small business protection : Employers with fewer than 50 employees are eligible for an exemption from the requirements to provide leave to care for a child whose school is closed or child care is unavailable in cases where the viability of the business is threatened .
* Easing compliance : Requirements subject to 30-day non-enforcement period for good faith compliance efforts .
To take immediate advantage of the paid leave credits , businesses can retain and access funds that they would otherwise pay to the IRS in payroll taxes .
