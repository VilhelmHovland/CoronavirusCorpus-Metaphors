LA County sheriff abandons effort to close gun stores  Updated : March 31 , 2020 01:21 AM Created : March 31 , 2020 12:21 AM  LOS ANGELES ( AP ) - Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva , who was sued by gun-rights groups after trying to shut down firearms dealers in the wake of coronavirus concerns , said Monday that he is abandoning the effort .
The sheriff said he 's heeding a federal Department of Homeland Security advisory issued on Saturday that listed gun and ammunition dealers as " essential critical infrastructure workers .
"  Advertisement  Villanueva called the non-binding memo " persuasive " and announced that his department wo n't order or recommend closing businesses that sell or repair firearms or sell ammunition in the nation 's most populous county .
California Gov .
Gavin Newsom has said that each of the state 's 58 counties can decide for themselves whether to list firearms dealers as nonessential businesses that should be subject to closure while the state seeks to limit the spread of COVID-19 .
The disease causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .
Villanueva ordered a shutdown of gun shops last week , saying panic-buying that produced long lines at the shops was worrisome from a public safety standpoint .
Days later , he issued a second order closing them to the public , despite a county legal counsel 's finding that the stores are essential businesses that should remain open .
However , Villanueva 's second order said the stores may still supply security guard companies , and anyone who already has purchased a gun and possesses a valid safety certificate can pick up their firearms .
On Friday , four groups , including the National Rifle Association of America , filed a federal lawsuit , contending that the sheriff 's actions violate the constitutionally guaranteed right to bear arms .
