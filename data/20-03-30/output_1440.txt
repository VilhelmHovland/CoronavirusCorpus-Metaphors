On March 26 , a stay-at-home order was issued in the Navajo Nation , where there are 70 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus .
Now , as in many places around the world , police are patrolling the streets , telling people to stay inside for at least two weeks .
President Jonathan Nez is urging the 356,000 Navajo people to wash their hands and avoid physical interaction .
The virus could hit reservations hard .
The Navajo-Hopi Observer reported that there are just 170 hospital beds , 13 ICU beds , 52 isolation rooms , and 28 ventilators in the 17 million-acre community , the largest land area retained by an indigenous people in the US .
What 's more , Native Americans have a higher prevalence towards diabetes , heart disease , and obesity .
But a stay-at-home order is not as simple for people on reservations as it might be in , say , New York City or Los Angeles .
" Folks on the nation do n't have significant disposable income readily available to do the things that they would need to prepare for the two-week lockdown , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insider .
When Branch was at the grocery store , stocking up on soup , dry goods , and non-perishable meat to prepare for the lockdown , it occurred to her that for most people on the reservation , it would be difficult to do the same .
Many would likely drive two or three hours to the grocery store in town , only to face empty shelves .
" I saw how difficult it was to buy high demand items , like toilet paper and protective equipment , " she said .
Branch decided to start a GoFundMe on March 15 .
In 15 days , she 's raised $214,000 .
" I felt like the government would n't be able to respond quickly , and definitely not at the individual family level .
So I decided to fill a gap , " Branch said .
" I was thinking I would raise $500 .
Maybe $1,000 .
I was definitely not thinking I 'd be raising over $150,000 .
"  caption  Some of the volunteers with a trailer full of supplies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  source  Vanessa Tullie  The money is going to be used to buy cough syrup , Tylenol , protective gear , and non-perishable food items , since at least 10% of people on the reservation do n't have electricity .
There will also be fresh fruits , vegetables and mutton , the meat of choice in Navajo Nation .
When the fundraiser took off , Branch realized she needed help and enlisted other Navajo women in organizing the fundraiser .
Everything will be delivered via volunteers in trailers headed up to the reservations .
" We had no idea this was going to generate such a positive response , " Branch said .
" We are so incredibly , incredibly grateful .
"  A third of Navajo Nation has no access to running water , so many people ca n't wash their hands all the time  As COVID-19 spreads across America , experts say any communities that are under-resourced or underserved are going to be hit the hardest .
Some of those communities are Native American ones , like the Navajo Nation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep cleaning their hands as much as everyone is being told to .
One 2019 poll found that 25% of Native Americans had trouble with the safety of their drinking water .
The CDC recommends people wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with clean running water in order to avoid getting infected with COVID-19 , which does not have a vaccine in America .
" It 's a particularly vulnerable community , with a third of the nation not having running water , " said Branch .
" The ability for people to wash their hands all the time is limited .
"  Overcrowding is a big problem  The CDC also recommends that anyone who is sick self-isolate from everyone in their household , using a separate bedroom and bathroom .
In Native American areas , estimates say overcrowding , which the World Health Organization defines as having more than 1 .
people per habitable room , affects 16% of the community .
That 's eight times the amount of overcrowded homes in the rest of America .
In a 2018 field hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives warned about the health risks of overcrowding .
" A human sneeze carries water droplets up to 15 feet from the source , " they said .
" In crowded homes , coughing and sneezing quickly spreads respiratory infections to an entire home with nowhere to hide .
"  With the coronavirus , which appears to be at least 10 times more deadly than the flu , overcrowding , lack of funding , and access to medical equipment could devastate the Navajo community .
Diabetes and heart disease -- common conditions in Navajo Nation -- raise the risk of death from COVID-19  " When you 're talking about vulnerable populations , yes , it 's our elders , it 's also people with diabetes , it 's also people with cardiovascular disease , immunocompromised systems .
If you put that profile up , that 's Indian country , " Stacy Bohlen , CEO of the National Indian Health Board , said in a webinar organized by Indigenous Rising Media on March 20 .
Then there are all the uranium mines on the reservation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and the lack of facilities and medical equipment .
The Indian hospital system is not prepared  " Our hospitals are 40 years old in the Indian health system .
The equipment is two times older than it is any other place , " Bohlen said .
" We 're not prepared .
"  Over 100 years ago , when tribal nations signed treaties giving away their land , what was to become the United States made a " promise of all proper care and protection " in exchange .
Ultimately , that amounted to The Indian Health Service , which was created by the government to provide healthcare for Indian people .
It has beenunderfunded since its inception .
In 1914 , a commissioner for the Bureau of Indian Affairs , said that " it is incomprehensible to me that appropriations for combating disease are so meager .
" Over 100 years later , Bohlen is repeating the sentiment .
Congress agreed to allocate $40 million to tribes -- but they still have n't got the funds , and they do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2 trillion dollar stimulus package , meant to offset the economic effects of social distancing , Native leaders fought to make sure they were n't left out .
Congress agreed to allocate $40 million to tribes , but Bohlen says the money is mired in a maze of bureaucratic complications .
" The 40 million original funds ? Not out the door yet , " Bohlen said .
" And we ca n't get a straight answer on how to get it .
"  Hospitality , land use , and tourism are many native communities ' main source of income .
But with most tribal casinos closed and swarms of people headed to the national parks near the reservations , tribal elders and health experts are afraid COVID-19 could deal a crippling blow to the Indian community .
For now , Branch hopes the GoFundMe will provide something of a safety net .
" I felt like the government would n't be able to respond quickly , and definitely not at the individual family level , " Branch said .
" So hopefully we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking at the scale that it ended up being ! " .
