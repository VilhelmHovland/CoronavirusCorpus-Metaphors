Coronavirus : Australia and the world can expect an economic shock  Topics  WA and the world economy is set for some short-term pain as a result of the coronavirus according to international economist Jonathan Pain .
Speaking at the UDIA industry lunch : Perth in a global context , the author of The Pain Report said he was not going to sugar coat the reality and ramifications of the event .
" I have seen estimates that 69 per cent of the Chinese economy has effectively been shut down , " Mr Pain said .
" I 've seen estimates that up to 400 million people in China are in some form of coercive quarantine .
" With China comprising 17 per cent of the global economy , effects are to be expected .
"  Mr Pain said the effects were already being felt with some international car manufacturers suspending operations as they were running out of components supplied by China .
" The Japanese car manufacturers are all curtailing production and we know that many German manufacturers are saying they 've only got one more week of inventory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also will start shutting down production , " he said .
" This is a global cardiac arrest and we need to face the economic reality of it .
"  Mr Pain said China would see a contraction in first quarter GDP this year and it was going to be big one .
As China was Australia 's largest trading partner , Australia too would see a first quarter contraction that may trickle into the second .
" Which may then begin to challenge one economic record that we are most proud of , being a nation that has gone 21 years or so without experiencing a recession , " he said .
" That is the economic reality of the next few weeks and months and perhaps quarters ahead .
"  Mr Pain said state and local governments need to open the fiscal stimulus pipeline to cope with the economic shock .
" I guarantee when in a couple of months time we see confirmation of the shock that I 'm describing , I do n't want anyone in Canberra to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , get ready and act , " he said .
" Unfortunately it arrives at a time that our nation has been decimated by bush fires and before that drought and now extraordinary flooding .
" The good news is the Reserve Bank has responded with lowering rates and we are seeing a housing recovery on the eastern seaboard .
"  WA still faced challenges with weakness in business investment , extremely soft housing consumption as wages had remained stagnant and weak population growth , with interstate migration in the negative .
" We are beginning to see an improvement in those numbers and some improvement also in overseas migration , " Mr Pain said .
" At the end of the day it 's a numbers game .
" If you really want growth you 've got to have population growth , it 's an essential part of that arithmetic equation .
"  Overseas migration offered some opportunities , but Mr Pain said most people chose to live in Sydney and Melbourne when moving to Australia and WA needed to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the future Mr Pain suggested Australia and WA needed to reduce its reliance on China , in terms of both supply and demand , and look to other " extraordinary nations " like Vietnam , Indonesia , Taiwan and India .
There was also a need to showcase enviable assets .
" You 've got a world-class education and tourism related experience , I think those are the assets you really need to leverage , " he said .
" I think for many people in the world Australia is still seen and perceived as a safe haven , we have a history of economic and political stability , we 're the envy of the world .
"  He said an event such as the coronavirus served as a sharp reminder to people that places like Australia were very attractive destinations .
When asked about investment opportunities in Australia , Mr Pain singled out Darwin .
" I think you 're going to see greater US troop deployments over the years ahead in the NT and this region of world , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , " he said .
" Maybe buy an apartment in Darwin .
"  Baby boomers selling up over east offered another opportunity for WA .
People were looking at the quality of life in Sydney and Melbourne with congestion and property prices through the roof .
" People are retiring , downsizing and moving away from the congestion , " Mr Pain said .
" Most of them are going up the central coast of NSW or up to the Gold Coast and places like that .
" WA could capture a big share of that type of shift in population , but the biggest problem is airfares ; they 're too expensive , I 'm not sure how you 'd resolve that , but they 're a major challenge .
