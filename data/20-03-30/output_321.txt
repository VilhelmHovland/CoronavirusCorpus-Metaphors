As the entire world heads into social distancing , even the few bright spots in the airline world are being extinguished .
With entire countries in lockdown and other nations facing individual states closing boundaries within the country , even large , profitable airlines such as the US ' Big Three ' , Qantas , and Indigo ( of India ) are seeing their fleets grounded and their balance sheets awash in red ink  As I write this column the street outside my window is eerily quiet for a weekday morning .
We too are in ' lockdown ' , and the only noise heard is a gentle sighing sound as the economy collapses .
COVID-19 is proving to be a seminal event in modern history .
One that will change the world in ways that we have n't computed yet -- many ' Unknown Unknowns ' , as pointed out in an earlier column .
As the entire world heads into social distancing , even the few bright spots in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that airlines with strong domestic route structures would weather this storm .
But with entire countries ( such as India ) in lockdown and other nations facing individual states closing boundaries within the country ( Australia and probably the USA ) , even large , profitable airlines such as the US ' Big Three ' , Qantas and Indigo ( of India ) are seeing their fleets grounded and their balance sheets awash in red ink .
Looking back in time  Many years ago , in December 1944 to be exact , a group of men was meeting in Chicago , USA in the depths of winter -- while a World War was raging not far away .
Think of what was going on at that time .
For five years the entire world had been engaged in a titanic struggle .
By 1944 the tide had turned .
The Nazi Reich , pummelled by the Russian steamroller in the East and the Allied invasion in the West , was being slowly strangled .
American and British forces were gradually pushing the Japanese Empire back , island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heavy bombers , of a size and speed hardly imaginable a few years ago , were reducing German and Japanese cities to rubble .
In a few months they would unleash a weapon so awesome that it would bring the war to an abrupt end .
Laying the foundation for civil aviation  Sequestered in a Chicago hotel , those bureaucrats representing 55 countries went on to draft a document that laid the foundation for the world 's civil aviation infrastructure .
Known as the ' Chicago Convention ' the intent of the conference was to allow for the development of international civil aviation " .
in a safe and orderly manner " , and such that air transport services would be established " on the basis of equality of opportunity and operated soundly and economically .
"  The convention went on to establish an agency called ICAO ( International Civil Aviation Organization ) , which would be made a part of the United Nations , and remains the governing body of all matters pertaining to civil aviation to this day .
Vision into reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Convention were transformed into reality and a globe-spanning airline business was long and torturous .
Most international delegates travelled to Chicago by ship and train , with perhaps a short flight in something like a DC-3 .
The ' mandarins ' could not have been expected to envision the jet transport airplane ( there were none in 1944 ) , much less the supersonic Concorde or the gigantic , double-deck Airbus A380 .
The Convention established what is known as the ' Five Freedoms of the Air ' , that set out to regulate air commerce between nations .
This laid the foundation for ' bilateral ' agreements between nations that were envisaged to ensure a fair share of the traffic flows between points .
However , an implied ( but never stated ) ' sixth freedom ' , allowed some geographically well placed airports to become ' super connectors ' .
They were able to use their bases as a transit point ( ' hub and spoke ' in airline-speak ) between places that the other five freedoms did not allow them to carry traffic .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined has been replaced by this new reality .
One where large , well-capitalized airlines dominate the market , the ' super connectors ' with their sprawling airports or the Low-Cost Carriers ( LCCs ) at the other end of the scale .
The plight of today 's many ' flag carriers ' hobbled by restrictive government , saddled in debt and unable to compete with their more successful privately-owned rivals , would have appalled the people who drew up the concept .
An opportunity for change  The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic will mean , among other things , that the world of civil aviation will have undergone a paradigm shift .
Most authoritative sources give it between 12-24 months before the pandemic is fully contained and normal travel patters could be re-established .
Many airlines will have ceased to exist by then .
Even those with the resources to have survived , will face a very different world .
One where the people may not have the means ( or the inclination ) to travel with anywhere near the frequency of the pre-COVID era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cause extreme hardship to the entire travel industry .
But it does allow an excellent opportunity for the world community to meet and formulate a plan for success that will ensure that the airline system emerges from this debacle in a positive manner .
Change is frightening , and humans are reluctant to embrace it .
In this case it has been forced upon us .
To miss this opportunity to lay the foundations for a system that will be stronger , fairer and more environmentally conscious , would be a terrible mistake .
