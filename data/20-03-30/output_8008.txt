A New Jersey man sent Facebook messages to Gov .
Phil Murphy and others threatening harm Orthodox Jews for violating state coronavirus restrictions .
Anthony Lodespoto , 43 , of Howell , was charged Friday with making terroristic threats during a state of emergency , law enforcement officials said in a statement .
Lodespoto allegedly used Facebook 's direct messaging feature to threaten the Jewish community of Lakewood , a New Jersey township with a large Orthodox population that has reported a higher number of coronavirus cases than surrounding areas .
" The threats largely consisted of Lodespoto threatening to travel to Lakewood with the purpose of assaulting members of the Jewish community with a baseball bat , " the statement said .
As of Thursday , Lakewood had 198 confirmed COVID-19 cases , by far the most in Ocean County , according to the county Health Department , the Asbury Park Press news site reported .
