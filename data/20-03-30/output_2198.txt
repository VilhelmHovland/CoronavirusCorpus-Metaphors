TORONTO -- Ontario has introduced steep fines for price gouging and reduced the maximum size of gatherings as it works to curb the economic impact of COVID-19 while stemming its spread .
Premier Doug Ford announced Saturday that he was slashing the number of people allowed to gather at a time from 50 to five , and introduced major fines for companies involved in price gouging .
" There 's very few bad apples in companies , but they 're out there .
And I think it 's disgusting , " Ford said .
" How can you take advantage of people in this time ? Times that we 've never seen in our province or around the world .
And there 's actually opportunists out there , trying to gouge the people ? I 'm coming after them with a vengeance .
"  Ontario reported another 211 cases of COVID-19 on Sunday , bringing the total number of cases to 1,355 .
It 's the largest single-day spike in cases so far .
The province says two more people died from the virus , bringing the death toll to 21 .
Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be from COVID-19 .
Ford said his efforts to prevent the artificial inflation of prices for products such as hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes include fines for company heads as high as $500,000 and a year in jail .
Corporations involved in gouging could face fines as high as $10 million , Ford said .
He urged Ontarians to report any cases of price gouging to a provincial hotline , saying each report would be looked at on a case-by-case basis , and that the focus would be on products sold at five or six times the normal price , rather than a few dollars more .
The measures come days after Ford took specific aim at specialty foods store Pusateri 's , which had been charging $30 for Lysol disinfecting wipes .
The product had been in short supply elsewhere .
Pusateri 's apologized , saying it was a mistake and that anyone who bought those wipes can get a full refund .
As for the smaller sizes of gatherings , Ford said there would be some exceptions .
Up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and child-care centres looking after the kids of front-line workers can have up to 50 people on site .
There 's also an exception for households with more than five people .
Meanwhile , the province 's top public health official said they 're making steady progress in the number of tests they 're able to complete per day .
David Williams , chief medical officer of health , said the province was able to complete about 4,100 tests per day , just shy of a goal for 5,000 tests which was set for the end of last week .
" We 're getting close to that number , " Williams said .
Barbara Yaffe , deputy medical officer of health , said they 're aiming to have the capacity for close to 19,000 tests per day by mid-April as new testing centres open .
" As we add new labs , they have to go through testing to ensure that their tests are valid , " said Yaffe .
" So the first 500 tests that each lab does has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said .
The province has also been making headway on a backlog of people waiting to be tested .
Early last week , there were over 10,000 cases that remained under investigation .
There were about 7,100 tests under investigation as of Sunday morning , compared to 8,700 on Saturday evening .
Medical officials are set to update the province on the fight against COVID-19 later Sunday afternoon .
