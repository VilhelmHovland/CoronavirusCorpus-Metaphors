Lags On Testing , Despite Trump 's Claims  President Trump listens as Dr .

Patrick Semansky / AP  President Trump is repeating his claim that the United States is doing more testing for the coronavirus than any other country .
" We have more cases because we 're doing far more testing than anybody in the world , " the president said in a White House briefing on Sunday .
The U .
has ramped up testing , but still lags other countries like Italy and South Korea , when it comes to testing on a per capita basis .
The U .
has performed 894,000 tests as of Saturday , according to Adm .
Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services , who is leading the testing effort .

population is around 327 million , which means about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Italy has a population of about 60 million and has done approximately 454,000 tests , meaning 1 in 133 people are being tested there -- about three times more , per capita , than in the U .
A new test that could speed things up was just granted " emergency-use authorization " by the Food and Drug Administration on Friday and will be rolled out this week .
Abbott , the company that makes the test , says they can do about 50,000 tests per day .
Some clinicians say this will be a game-changer , as it can provide results in under 15 minutes , instead of days .
With the new test , patients will be able to swab themselves , reducing the risk of infection for health care workers .
Right now , the U .
is still prioritizing sick people , symptomatic first responders and people in nursing homes for testing , according to Dr .
Deborah Birx , who serves as the White House 's coronavirus response coordinator .
The hope is that the new test will allow more widespread testing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infected and where .
