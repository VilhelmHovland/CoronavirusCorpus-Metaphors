Dear RainbowMan ,  I am feeling terribly anxious .
I am alone in Mumbai where my partner is in Pune at his parent 's place .
I feel the urge for sex and I feel terribly frustrated and anxious .
I masturbate 5 times in a day but it does n't help .
He is happy with his family .
I want this corona bullshit to end .
What should I do ?  Sex Starved Man  Dear Sex Starved Man ,  Thank you for writing in .
Let 's begin by acknowledging that this is a difficult time for all of us .
I can only imagine that this time may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being with you too .
It is important that you do n't start a blame game with " O you are enjoying with your family , I am all alone " .
It is not his fault that he is in a ( presumably ) happier state .
He does n't need to feel everything that you are feeling to ascertain that he loves you .
He just needs to feel for you .
About you longing for his touch .
I feel you .
Many of us who are away from our partners are going through the same phase .
When we can not control the situation around us , we should rather make best of the situation we are in .
Do experience the power of video chatting .
( It may not be the real thing , but it is the closest to reality you could get now ) .
Try doing things you like .
Play an online video game .
Watch your favourite film on Amazon or Netflix or Zee5 or Voot or any of the OTT platforms .
Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chat up with a random friend you have never connected since ages .
Say thank you to someone , say sorry to someone .
Step out with all protective gear alone to feed the stray dogs and cats in your area .
Make yourself useful to them .
And masturbate only when you feel the need to , not as an obsessive habit .
I think you have the potential to do many things and discover several hidden features that you may have .
This is your time .
Sex , well , that will happen too .

I agree when they say , sabr ka phal meetha hota hai .
Dear RainbowMan ,  This lockdown has given me the time to reflect on something that I never did before .
I am thankful and sorry too .
I realised that I have been a homophobe to someone who wrote me a love letter .
I did n't want to acknowledge then that I am lesbian too , so I played the role of a homophobe with her and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she got targeted badly in school .
I feel very bad now .
I do n't know if it is right to tell her .
I have seen her recently and have her number .
I feel like apologising and moving on .
How should I do this .
Troubled Woman  Dear Troubled Woman , Thank you for writing in .
It is not uncommon that queer people are homophobic just to hide their queerness from the other person .
This pretention is toxic to the self .
However , over time , we gain courage to face our truths and not merely fight them .
I am glad that you realise your mistakes and are genuinely apologetic .
It is not necessary that you should fall in love with her if she proposes to you , but there are kinder ways to tell that you do n't feel the same way .
It is never too late to say sorry .
It is never too early to apologise .
Go right in .
Tell her that you apologise for your behaviour .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept your apology or tell you off .
Be prepared for different reactions that could come from her .
She is the master of her destiny .
She may feel better if you let her know that you have realised your folly .
She may also get angry when she is reminded of the mistakes you made .
Give her the chance to react the way she wants to react .
Do not judge her for her reactions .
If she has suffered and nursed a feeling of hurt for too long , she would find it difficult to let go of her hurt too .
Give her the time to recoup .
If she gets chatty with you and if the conversation comes to a point where you discuss coping mechanisms and stuff it may be a good idea to see a good psychologist who can help navigate through this .
Love  RainbowMan  P .
It gets better .
Yes , it does .
Dear RainbowMan ,  I am a 28 year old man and I am stuck in what can only be described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sexually abused by my uncle when I was just 8 years of age .
It began as groping at 8 , and when I was 11 he had full fledged intercourse with me .
I did not resist it then .
He was close to the family .
He told me it was a secret .
He asked me " do you like it " and at that moment , it felt more like a massage , I guess , I liked it .
I hate myself for that .
Today I am a straight man , but I have had gay feelings for this man .
We kept doing things till I was 16 .
We lost contact after that .
I also tried forgetting .
And actually thought I had forgotten .
We had a death in the family and he was here .
Now he is stuck and so am I with him .
Today , I am with this man .
In the same house .
How do I deal with this ? All memories come flashing .
How do I deal with this .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret .
Lonely Me  Dear Lonely You ,  First , let me acknowledge your strength , honesty and your trust .
Thank you for writing to me .
Thank you for trusting me .
Let me also acknowledge that we are going through a particularly difficult time at the moment .
I can not claim to understand all the complex emotions running in your mind , but I am glad that you are able to articulate this to me .
Let me tell you , that every child deserves the right to a happy childhood .
The fact that he first groped you , you were too young to understand what was happening to you .
When you were 11 , you were still young to understand .
What he did with you between 8 and 11 is a thing called " grooming " .
He made you feel good , he made it look like a game , he groomed your young impressionable mind to believe that whatever was happening was with your consent .
Do n't hate yourself for that .
No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you thought it was a massage .
Not even when you thought it was nice and wanted more .
It is not the child 's fault .
It is a difficult task to decipher a whole range of emotions that a child survivor of abuse could feel right from curiosity to fear to disgust .
Do n't blame yourself for that .
No child is responsible for their abuse .
I am a survivor of child sexual abuse too .
We all have our unique ways of coping with the train of thoughts .
When memories come flashing to me , I do n't try to fast forward them or erase them from my memory .
I sit still and let them all pass .
I do n't fight them .
I face them .
And that makes a hell a lot of difference .
I know that it is challenging perhaps to be in the same house as your abuser .
I can only imagine that one could be feeling anger , hopelessness and also a lot of resentment .
It is first important to acknowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty for it .
Acknowledge it .
I understand that you may feel the need to come out about your abuse to your family members .
I would urge you to do so too , however , understand that we can not govern other people 's reaction to our words .
Often in families where the abuser is trusted , it takes some time for the family to come around and accept the truth that the survivor is speaking .
It may appear that this is the most natural thing to do , but it may in reality not be that easy .
It may take some time for your family to deal with this shock .
While they should distance themselves from the abuser , it is also possible that they take time to do so .
Many families also would ask the question " why did n't you tell me then " .
I want to remind you , again and again and again -- IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT .
Do not blame yourself and but also understand that people 's reactions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown time , but there are many psychologists who are offering services over the phone .
I would strongly urge you to speak to a mental health professional and seek their therapy .
Do write back if you need anything .
I will share my mobile number with you for easy communication .
With you .

Please do see a counsellor .
