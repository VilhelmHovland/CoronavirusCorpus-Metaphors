A widespread sell-off in the equity markets amidst the coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) outbreak is likely to deplete the cover available to investors in loan against shares ( LAS ) transactions .
This could require borrowers to pledge additional shares to replenish the share cover , resulting in a rise in the proportion of pledged promoter holdings , says India Ratings and Research ( Ind-Ra ) .
In a report , the ratings agency says , " The decline in equity market prices comes against the backdrop of rising uncertainty surrounding the extent of disruption emanating from the COVID-19 outbreak .
Equity prices bear a strong correlation with the earnings quality of an entity .
Thus , the weakening share price in this case is accompanied by a similar erosion of the liquidity buffers of the underlying borrower .
This could affect the entity 's ability to meet any unprecedented cash outflows emanating from an untimely recall of LAS or even pledge additional liquid collateral .
"  In assessing LAS transactions , Ind-Ra evaluated two parameters -- the probability of liquidation and the quantum of loss on liquidation .
The agency says it believes that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of liquidation increased , due an increase in encumbrances , but also the loss on liquidation is expected to be higher than what would have been initially factored in by lenders , owing to the sharp correction in equity prices .
According to the ratings agency , 21 out of the BSE 500 companies are likely to face early redemption .
Ind-Ra says its analysis indicates that 21 BSE 500 companies will be required to pledge more than 100% of the promoter holding as on 19 March 2020 to maintain a minimum 2 .
times share cover , assuming the quantum of LAS transactions outstanding as on 31 December 2019 .
" In other words , these entities could be required to pledge additional collateral or deposit cash to maintain the original security cover .
For these companies , more than 75% of the promoters ' holding was already pledged as on 31 December 2019 .
Consequently , investors in these LAS transactions could either be required to restructure these exposures , liquidate the collateral or in some cases also recall the loans , " it added .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corporates to be constrained .
Even in cases where the promoters have additional unpledged shares available , the rise in the proportion of shares pledged is likely to impede the financial flexibility of these entities in these challenging times , it says , adding , the proportion of unencumbered promoter shareholding determines the maximum share price correction a LAS transaction can sustain and , hence , is directly related to the probability of liquidationc and by extension probability of default .
Given that Ind-Ra 's adjusted base case assumes a gradual recovery from the COVID-19 outbreak , the recovery in the equity prices could also be protracted .
In case there is a further build-up of risk aversion in the capital markets , equity prices could fall further -- thereby necessitating additional share pledges to maintain the security cover , it added .
Ind-Ra says its analysis indicates that the companies already classified as elevated risk of refinancing as per its asset funding and refinancing risk study are likely to be most affected .
A large number of these companies already have a significant proportion of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratings agency 's analysis , of the 58 companies likely to have more than 50% of their promoter holdings pledged , 19 are already in default while another 19 are classified as elevated risk of refinancing .
According to Ind-Ra , there is a strong correlation between operating cash flows and share price movement .
As on 31 March 2019 , the total debt outstanding with the aforementioned 58 companies stood at Rs5 .
trillion , while Ind-Ra estimates LAS transactions to account for Rs343 billion ( at 3 times share cover ) to Rs411 billion ( at 2 .
times share cover ) .
" It is imperative to note that the entire quantum of LAS transactions may not be outstanding on the books of these companies ; rather promoters often pledge the shares of operating entities to meet the liquidity requirements of other group companies , " it added .
Ind-Ra 's analysis also indicates that sectors such as power , construction and metals -- which have historically been most exposed to cyclical risks and have recently been under stress are likely to see a high proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk in these LAS transactions -- i .
, the high degree of correlation between the earnings , liquidity and share price .
Historically , the ratings agency says , players in these sectors have been accessing the LAS market to fund cash flows mismatches .
" Incidentally , the fixed asset coverages for these sectors have been low and therefore , the ability of these entities to raise additional funds organically using operating assets has been restricted .
This leaves investors in LAS transactions extremely vulnerable as the share covers deplete in tandem with the liquidity of these borrowers , " it added .
In an event of defaults , Ind-Ra sees coercive debt exchange taking place .
In the past , there have been cases where the promoter had asked the investor to delay the margin call even in the event of breach of covenant .
" The investor or lender had to comply with the borrower as the liquidation of shares may result in a loss on the investment ; which they can avoid if they believe that the promoter should be able to make payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  Ind-Ra says it perceives these exchanges as coercive in nature however , given the present situation and the dispensations being provided by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) and it will evaluate the implications and reflect it appropriately in the rating .
