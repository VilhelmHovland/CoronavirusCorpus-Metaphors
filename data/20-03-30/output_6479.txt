We look at the crisis of homelessness during the coronavirus pandemic in California , where the number of cases has passed 6,000 with 132 deaths .
The entire state has been ordered to shelter in place , leaving the state 's massive unhoused population extremely vulnerable .
As the state braces for a surge in cases , tens of thousands of people are living on the streets .
A recent study estimates that nearly 2,600 unhoused people will need to be hospitalized for the virus in Los Angeles alone -- and nearly 1,000 will need intensive care .
We speak with Martha Escudero , a member of a group of unhoused mothers , elders and families who have moved into vacant houses called Reclaiming Homes , and Carroll Fife ( @carrollfife ) , director of the Oakland office for Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment ( ACCE ) .
