Sick Worker Says UPS ' Puts Profits Over People '  Update : In an email to Intelligencer , a spokesperson for UPS disputed what he called " an arguably fictional account , " and said that the company is in the process of distributing hand sanitizers to workers .
He also claimed that trucks are regularly sanitized .
" Our workforce has been provided information and supplies to manage health risks , and UPS facilities are operating at high standards for cleanliness and professionalism .
The safety and health of our employees is extremely important as we care about each other , our families and the communities where we live and work , " he said .
Warehouse workers and delivery drivers are carrying the American economy on their backs .
Not only has the outbreak of novel coronavirus , or COVID-19 , increased their workload , it creates dangerous working conditions that corporations have done little to mitigate .
Temporary raises , the addition of hand sanitizer or the occasional canister of Lysol wipes , the hiring of new staff ; the measures introduced by companies like Amazon and Wegman 's and others are piecemeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to COVID-19 in order to keep their jobs .
Many still lack basic paid leave .
Some also worry that they may be helping spread COVID-19 to others .
John , who loads UPS trucks at a facility in Philadelphia and is a member of the Teamsters , is symptomatic for the virus .
He told Intelligencer by phone that he believes conditions at his workplace may threaten public health .
The Centers for Disease Control estimates that the virus does not live long on cardboard surfaces ; it seems to disintegrate on packages after about 24 hours .
But dirty facilities and inadequate sick leave create hazards at work , and in turn , may prevent communities from containing the pandemic .
This interview has been condensed for length and edited for clarity .
John 's name has been changed to protect his identity .
How are you feeling ? Illness-wise , not that bad at all .
In terms of stress and anxiety and stuff over the past two weeks , it 's been just unbearable .
I have n't been sleeping at all .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Shortly after that , I started getting chest pain and a sore throat and coughing .
And I just keep thinking , like , I 'm killing all these people .
So that 's how I feel about it .
I 've tried to read as much as I can about the virus and what the CDC says , and they say it can stay on cardboard for 24 hours and plastic for 72 .
In a given day , I might touch packages that go to a thousand people , maybe more than that .
Maybe 1,500 people every single day .
I could have just been spreading it for the last two weeks .
I did n't sign up to kill people , and that 's what it feels like I 'm doing .
Tell me a little bit more about your job .
What do you do for UPS ? So I worked for UPS for about five years , and I 've actually worked in a few different positions there .
I 've gone out in the trucks before .
But right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see driving around every night .
They 're pretty much full , like floor to ceiling , wall to wall in the back , when they first go out .
Most of us who load trucks handle about four times as many packages as a driver .
Has the volume of packages increased since the outbreak began ? ? Yes , it 's pretty much just increasing every day .
I 've worked Christmas seasons that were n't this busy .
And that 's always our busiest time of year , a few weeks before Christmas .
But it 's just crazy .
Then the other thing is , simultaneously , you have people calling out sick .
I overheard our building manager yesterday say we had about 20 call outs with COVID symptoms .
So that 's 5 to 10 percent of our total workforce at the building I work at , calling out .
And that 's just going up and going up .
Last night when I was at work there were new hires .
There are literally just people there from the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they need incomes .
And UPS , while they 're infecting their workforce , is just throwing these people into that situation .
Those people are desperate for income , but they 're gon na get no benefits .
They do n't get any paid sick leave .
They do n't get health care through the company because to get it you have to work here for nine months , even if you 're in the union .
And you 're working overtime ? ? Yeah .
So technically , because we 're doing a really physically intensive manual-labor job , any time we work over five hours that 's considered overtime and they pay us time and a half .
Because I 'm just moving like 50 pound boxes nonstop , like walking in circles .
But I 've been working probably 20 to 25 percent more .
Probably even more than that , because it 's supposed to be the slow season .
This is usually the slowest time of year .
Instead , it 's the busiest time of year .
But yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now they are talking about having us come in at 11:30 .
So that would be the night before .
They also want us to start working mandatory Saturdays .
That 's supposed to start in a week or two .
They 're trying to increase everybody 's hours , and have more staffing , but at the same time , their workforce is just dropping .
And it just seems delusional .
Are they letting you take any safety precautions due to the virus ? ? It 's very much business as usual .
As of this Monday , they did give us rubber gloves .
But they tear .
I 'll use six or seven pairs of them in a shift if I wear them .
They 're just cheap latex gloves and that 's all UPS has given us .
One day last week , we had no soap in our bathroom .
We have a bathroom with three sinks .
One of the sinks works .
And they say they 're sanitizing the bathroom , but it has not been cleaned in months .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has , like , a 50 percent chance of having soap .
They have n't given us hand sanitizer whatsoever .
I thought they said they were going to give his hand sanitizer , I 'm not sure if that was official , but I was told that by a manager .
It never happened .
So they 're basically doing nothing .
And I can tell you for a fact , they do n't wipe down our equipment or clean our equipment ever .
They were n't cleaning the equipment before the virus , either ? ? No .
We have these belts that we wear with a device on it , a little bigger than a cell phone , and then a little finger thing that we scan packages with .
But the belts are fabric and they 've never washed them since they were introduced like a few years ago .
And the scanners are never wiped down at all .
The trucks are n't wiped down .
And I would guess that it 's difficult to practice social distancing at work ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will come to work even if you 're not feeling well ? ? I do n't think there was an expectation there .
But there 's definitely some kind of pressure .
Above board , they 'll tell you , you know , if you have any symptoms , even if it 's not symptoms of COVID-19 , just call out .
But people need the income .
It 's uncertain times and people do n't have any savings .
If they have like a light sore throat or a cough or something , they 're going to keep coming in .
And I can tell you firsthand , I 've seen people coughing on boxes .
The other day when I was leaving the last shift I did work , I saw a driver walking in just cough very deeply and directly onto his bare hands on his way into the building .
People are worried about their families and just having enough .
Does no hand sanitizer work also mean no masks ? ? Some of the drivers I 've noticed have masks , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they 're providing them themselves .
They 're bringing their own masks .
Is UPS in regular communication with workers about the virus ? ? None whatsoever .
The Monday before last was the first time they mentioned there even was a virus .
They gave out sheets of paper , but it just says if you 're feeling sick , stay home and wash your hands a lot .
And that 's all it says .
I mean , I 'm paraphrasing .
But should n't we be doing those things ordinarily ? So it 's really just business as usual .
Has the union been helpful to you as you navigate this situation ? ? I believe they are on my side firmly .
But the union is n't as powerful as they used to be , I do n't think .
They were negotiating with UPS to try and get us some sort of relief , and I know they got us ten days of paid sick leave .
But for anyone who was part-time , which is just under 40 hours a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position -- our sick days are paid at three and a half hours a day .
So they 're giving us ten sick days , but it 's three and a half hours of pay .
Do you feel that UPS is putting the public at risk ? ? It 's literally murder .
It goes beyond risk .
I might have been contagious for the past two weeks and I might have delivered packages to 20,000 people , touched 20,000 people 's packages .
And I 'm one person .
Each of those people could infect , you know , two to three people .
And we 're doing a lot of nonessential work .
I do understand that we are essential and we need to be open because I am shipping coronavirus test kits , I 'm shipping heat lamps , tents , scrubs , masks .
But more than half of what I 'm shipping is junk .
I shipped a sofa last week .
I ship someone a tuxedo rental .
Beanie hats , frisbees , a volleyball net , other furniture .
It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were literally doing business as usual and all of that could be contagious to people .
So you think UPS should just be shipping essentials right now ?  It 's incredibly irresponsible .
I think at the end of this whole pandemic in the U .
, however many deaths there are , the people with the most blood on their hands will probably be our CEO , David Abney , or Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos .
Maybe President Trump .
Back to you for a minute .
Do you think you 're going to be able to get COVID-19 testing ? ? UPS put up information about testing and they said that in the future , we will be able to get tested for coronavirus through Quest Diagnostics .
But they have n't given us a timeline for that and it has n't happened .
So you do n't know how you 're getting tested .
? I do n't expect that I will get tested .
They 've told me at some indefinite point in the future , UPS workers will be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at my center has been tested for coronavirus at all .
CNN Health : According to CNN Health 's tally of US cases that are detected and tested in the United States through US public health systems , there are at least 151,680 cases of coronavirus in the U .
; 2,781 people have died in the US from coronavirus .
