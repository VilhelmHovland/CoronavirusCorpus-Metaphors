Erin Bormett / Argus Leader  Interested in this topic ? You may also want to view these photo galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation Monday in response to a global pandemic that has disrupted daily life and is expected to impair state tax revenues .
Besides revamping the state budget to include money from the federal government to assist the unemployed , lawmakers looked to waive a state law mandating a minimum number of instructional hours for public schools , grant emergency powers to the governor and allow local governments to delay their elections , many of which were scheduled for the second Tuesday in April .
This historic meeting , occurring on the legislative session 's final day , saw the majority of lawmakers participating remotely by Internet or phone , and they were discouraged from gathering at the Capitol .
The day did n't go flawlessly , with some lawmakers having communications issues , but in the end lawmakers were able to vote on legislation that they said would allow the state to deal with the pandemic .
Some bills passed without much debate in the Senate , but a fight erupted over SB 191 , a bill that would have given states and counties broader powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and Minnehaha County Commissioner Cindy Heiberger .
Legislators meet online for veto day at the Pierre capitol building on Monday .
( Photo : South Dakota Newspapers Association )  TenHaken said that cities need a " nuclear option " to exercise greater control , but he said he would n't want to close businesses .
" I think there 's a lot of other strategies we can utilize before we get to that point , " he said .
But the broad powers also included allowing local governments to eliminate a law that requires an ordinance to be passed with both a first and second reading , with five days between them .
Matt McCauley , who represented Gov .
Kristi Noem , said the governor objected to eliminating the wait time because it 's a due process measure that protects the public .
As of 5 p .
Friday , none of the legislation had been passed by both chambers , and debates continued .

Abigail Dollins / Argus Leader  Here 's a look at what the House considered :  HB 1295 : Would add coronavirus to a list of diseases such as SARS , tuberculosis and smallpox that , if someone is reasonably suspected of having them , they are required by law to accept " necessary diagnosis and treatment .
" The state Department of Health could then seek a court order if they believe the person is a health threat to others .
The bill passed 46-21 after being amended to remove the emergency clause , meaning that the bill will not go into effect until July 1 , with possible discussion happening at a special session during June .
The bill would only take effect under a public health emergency , leading several , including Rep .
Jon Hansen , to ask why Noem had n't already declared such an emergency .
Melissa Klemann , a senior policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action she felt was appropriate at the current time .
HB 1296 : Would allow the governor to suspend the provisions of any regulatory statute in the state prescribing the conduct of state business or the business of a local subdivision if follow those rules would prevent action to address a pandemic .
The bill passed 62-4 , after two amendments that adjusted some of the language regarding what rules were affected , along with adding a passage clarifying that 2nd Amendment rights would not be affected by the bill .
HB 1297 : Would give the secretary of health the ability to order the closure of , or place reasonable restrictions on , a business , park , school or other location that promotes public gathering , if needed to slow or prevent the spread of disease during an emergency .
Several legislators had concerns regarding this bill , including whether it could potentially violate the constitutional right to assemble .

"  Tonchi Weaver with South Dakota Citizens for Liberty , along with other legislators , expressed confusion as to why the secretary of health , an appointed position , was being given the power , instead of Noem , an elected position .
Klemann said the two would make the decision in concert , and so " they view it as one and the same .
"  When Rep .
Steven Haugaard pointed out that the bill does n't say that , Klemann said she had nothing further to add .
The bill failed 17-50 .
HB 1298 : Would postpone all elections in the state from April 14 to May 26 .
Elections would be rescheduled to a Tuesday in June , and could be set on June 2 to coincide with the state 's primary election .
