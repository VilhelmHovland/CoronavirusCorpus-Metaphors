As we all know by now , the Coronavirus pandemic has forced an unfortunate amount of delays and postponements across the whole of the entertainment industry .
The pandemic has not only forced a variety of theatrical release delays , but it 's actually inhibited production on a variety of upcoming projects that have been prepping to shoot during the beginning of this year .
Now several new delays have been announced from Sony due to the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic .
The release date delays , include Morbius which was removed from its original July 31 release date to March 19 , 2021 .
Meanwhile the incredibly anticipated sequel Ghostbusters : Afterlife was moved from July 10 of this year to March 5 , 2021 .
You may recall that March 5 was actually the release date for the upcoming Uncharted film adaptation , so now that 's been moved all the way to October 8 , 2021 .
And if that 's not confusing enough , that October date originally belonged to another untitled Sony/Marvel movie which has been removed from the release schedule altogether .
On top of those release date changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been delayed from its original October 23 release date until January 15 , 2021 .
It 's definitely going to be a hectic time for movies for the time being .
A vast amount of releases have been impacted by the Coronavirus , and unfortunately we have no other choice but to wait until things clear up and hope the time goes by fast .
But how exactly all these different films will balance out across the release schedule with every other competing studio and movie that 's fighting for a spot on the calendar is yet to be seen .
The release date delays from Sony follow after a variety of theaters and theater chains were forced to temporarily close down while many US and international locations have been undergoing self-quarantine strategies to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus .
It 's difficult to determine when exactly things will go back to normal and when the movie theaters will be allowed to open up once more , but hopefully things will work out for the better soon .
Until then , we 'll likely just continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other unfortunate news that 's been following the spread of the Coronavirus .
