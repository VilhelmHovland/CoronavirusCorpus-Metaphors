" Before agreeing to see you , dental practices might need to speak with you on the telephone .
This is to check whether you are in good health and do not have any symptoms relating to the coronavirus .
"  Pittville Lawn Dental &amp; Implant Clinic , in Cheltenham , is one of the practices to have closed completely .
In an email to its patients today , it said : " In the best interests of our patients , colleagues and clinicians we have now closed the practice to all appointments during the current phase of the Coronavirus outbreak .
This means we will be stopping all appointments , including emergency treatment of all patients for the coming weeks , as instructed by the Chief Dental Officer , England .
" We hope this change is short-lived but as always , our commitment to the health and safety of our patients and our people is paramount to us and means we are obliged to take this unprecedented step .
" Whilst our physical building is closed , our practice is not .
we are committed to offering a continued service of care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the phone , should you need us .
If you need emergency care , contact the practice and one of our clinicians will be able to provide appropriate advice .
"  Thanks a million NHS heroes  It is something that has , at some point , touched all our lives .
From cradle to grave , the National Health Service , and the incredible professionals within it who care for us , is a part of British life .
Today , more than ever , we should cherish those who dedicate themselves to our care , heedless of own health as they work tirelessly to care for people in the face of the Coronavirus pandemic .
Nurses and others - employed by the NHS and any other part of health and care - we have never needed them more .
So let 's show them some love , and create a living map of gratitude from every corner of Britain .
By dropping a heart on the map , you 're saying you appreciate the efforts undertaken daily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-employed dentists will struggle to cope during the crisis , despite the government 's offer of financial help to those people who work for themselves .
Christy Rush , a patient care coordinator at Affinity Dental Care &amp; Implant Centre in Gloucester , said it was a worrying time for businesses like hers and she said there was uncertainty about how people would get emergency care .
She said : " Dentistry in England have been left with conflicting guidelines .
I am a patient care coordinator and it breaks my heart to tell patients we can not treat them , leaving them in pain with nowhere to go .
"  She added : " When this is all over , the private dentist who you developed a good relationship with may not be either .
