The world today needs all of us to cultivate the collective responsibility to reduce Covid-19 transmissions and to flatten the curve of the outbreak , stressed Khoo Ying Hooi .
As the world struggles with the rapid spread of Covid-19 , some choose to be ignorant .
We all react differently to stressful situations .
How we respond to the Covid-19 outbreak can depend on many reasons , for instance , our backgrounds and the community we live in .
A YouTube video that a friend shared in Facebook , on a spring break party in Miami prompted me to pen down my thoughts .
A young man in the video is quoted of saying , " If I get corona , I get corona .
At the end of the day , I 'm not going to let it stop me from partying .
We 've been waiting for Miami spring break for a while .
"  The video caused public outrage since it was put online .
This shows the struggle that some cities have to face in efforts to get their people to take the pandemic seriously .
Many of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong religious gathering in Sri Petaling mosque complex led our country to a movement control order for two weeks starting from 18 March now extended to 14 April .
Support the struggle to build a New Malaysia based on Justice , Freedom , Solidarity :  The struggle to contain infections linked to religious practices underscores the conflict of some who wish to uphold their religious rights in fighting a pandemic .
Neighbouring countries such as Singapore , Cambodia , Thailand and Brunei have reported cases that could be traced back to this gathering .
It was also reported that some of the worshippers who attended the event have refused to be tested , preferring to rely on God to protect them .
The partygoers and the religious followers defend their individual rights to continue to do what they think they should be allowed to do .
Around the world , many of us also have expressed our anger and frustration with such actions .
In one of my recent tweets related to the initial decision by the Selangor Islamic Religious Department ( Jais ) not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- the decision has since been retracted -- one netizen responded that I should be more understanding because in times of uncertainty , people lean on their faith and that it is not ignorance as I had referred to it in my tweet .
Amidst a global pandemic where everyone is calling for social distancing as a key tool in the fight against its spread , some partygoers and religious followers find this an irrational call , as they claim it is a form of " violation " of their freedom .
But the issue here is , we are facing a public health crisis , and so , when the rights of individuals and communities clash , whose should prevail ?  Around the world , while restrictions have continued to tighten , we continued to see public gatherings being carried out in countries with reported cases .
For instance , recently , some 1,500 Catholics attended an ordination mass for a new bishop in Indonesia 's Manggarai regency , despite restrictions on mass gatherings over the fear of the outbreak , as reported in the Jakarta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trudeau 's announcement of the extraordinary measures against the outbreak , people continued to gather in big numbers at Kitsilano Beach .
Similar ignorance could be found in the UK , where it came under fire after several large concerts and sporting events went ahead amidst the pandemic and the country 's escalating cases .
Many were shocked to see pictures of concerts of Welsh band Stereophonics recently .
Facing worldwide criticism , the band 's spokesman defended their decision .
As individuals , we all have the freedom of expression and of assembly .
But as part of the communities , like individuals , we also have rights .
Collectively , we are entitled to protection from threats to our health and safety .
This is when these two categories of rights clash -- and we need to balance the two -- between the questions of liberty versus security .
Is there an inherent conflict between individual and collective rights as popularly raised ? It is not necessary to view it in a way that someone must lose in relation to this global pandemic .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused notions about the meaning of collective rights .
In the midst of the chaos over Covid-19 , there needs to be wise accommodation between liberty and security for the common good .
We see some countries appear to be having more success in controlling ithe pandemic , such as Hong Kong and Taiwan .
While calls have intensified for social distancing measures , we should always remember that , as we do physical distancing , we do not lose social solidarity .
A community is a group of people with common interests and values .
As time goes by , with new cases of infection rising around the world , we all need to realise the community responsibilities that we have , ie our obligations to the community that encompass of cooperation , respect and participation .
Every right has a corresponding duty , and it is the responsibility of the individual to watch over a community to make sure that standards are objective and beneficial to the human race .
To the partygoers and religious followers who insist that it is their right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what happens when your wishes conflict with what is in your best interest ?  Here , we are facing issues that can arise when the rights of individuals conflict with the benefits to the population in relation to infectious diseases like Covid-19 , which has turned the whole world upside down .
Within the ideas of rights and fundamental freedoms is also the idea of responsibilities .
The world today needs all of us to cultivate collective responsibility to reduce Covid-19 transmissions and to flatten the curve of the outbreak .
