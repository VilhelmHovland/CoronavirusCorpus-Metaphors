Covid-19 highlights need for more spectrum to lower data cost  Mar 30 , 2020  While the Competition Commission ( CompCom ) demands much cheaper or even free services from mobile network operators ( MNOs ) , government is not coming to the party by releasing spectrum .
This is according to the Free Market Foundation ( FMF ) , which says government 's role in keeping data costs high , through its failure to allocate more radio frequency spectrum ( airwaves ) , is not widely understood .
Data usage has sky-rocketed since the Covid-19 crisis , and now the lockdown , began .
It has reignited misinformed howls of rage that data in South Africa is too expensive , the foundation notes .
It adds that MNOs are struggling to cope with the massive surge in demand yet -- unlike in nearly all other competitive sectors -- they have not increased data prices .
FMF CEO Leon Louw comments : " There is a loony notion , a kind of ' madness of crowds ' , in which almost everyone believes whatever nonsense is regurgitated about South Africa supposedly having abnormally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not stand up to objective scrutiny .
Pricing of data in South Africa has unique aspects , but nevertheless prices here , on average , fall into the middle range globally .
Industry insiders say that the Competition Commission got its sums wrong .
They should release the basis of their analysis , then we can assess the accuracy of their evidence and assessment .
"  The FMF believes the solution to supposedly high data prices is for the government to release more spectrum , something it has failed to do .
" Without more spectrum , MNOs must add billions to the cost of squeezing more data into needlessly throttled bandwidth , " the FMF states .
" Insufficient spectrum prevents prices from falling .
The cost of ' free ' data must be imposed on someone .
The ultimate victims are consumers , especially the poor .
