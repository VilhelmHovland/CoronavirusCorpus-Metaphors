Despite a worker at the site testing positive for coronavirus , construction at the Raiders new stadium is being allowed to continue .
: Getty  While most people in Nevada have been sheltering in place for weeks at this point , either by choice or by the mandate of Governor Steve Sisolak , somehow the building of a football stadium is still continuing .
I live down the street from the building site , and being close to a potential coronavirus hotspot is pretty creepy .
When you think about the numbers and what is at risk , it seems counterintuitive for the NFL , the city and state to do this .
There are now more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus in Nevada , 753 of those in Clark County , home of Sin City .
All of Las Vegas has been ordered to be shut down ASAP ! But , yeah , let 's keep building .
Allegiant Stadium is n't going to be a 2,000-square foot house , it 'll be a state-of-the-art facility that seats 65,000 .
There are more than 2,000 people working on the site .
The public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been nicknamed the Death Star .
That 's not exactly a positive moniker given the ongoing pandemic , plus the plight of the airline industry in general , and Allegiant Travel specifically .
Will that crappy airline survive this recession ? Its stock ( ALGT ) is down 35 percent over the past month .
Advertisement  Billionaire Mark Davis is gouging fans with seat-licensing fees at Allegiant that run as high as $75,000 per , with season tickets ranging from $650 to $4,500 .
Vegas is a city of working-class people and most residents of Nevada will never in their lives be able to afford to see a game in that stadium .
In absolutely no way is the construction of this stadium benefitting Las Vegas .
How is it essential ? So why is it still being built ?  Advertisement  It 's no secret the NFL does n't care about workers ' health , but for the city of Las Vegas , Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Governor Sisolak , turning a blind eye is treacherous .
Why are they betraying the health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can continue if social distancing is maintained .
This seems like an idiotic loophole .
How can these workers hear one another on a loud construction site from more than six feet away ?  It 's no longer , " Hey , buddy , hand me that hammer , " but , " Hey , buddy , throw me that hammer and sanitize it before you do .
"  Advertisement  Another big project down the street , new casino Resorts World , was immediately shut down with the construction crew quarantined for two weeks after a positive case on their work site .
So , yes , Nevada , let 's -- rightfully -- shut down construction for a building that will employ people 24 hours a day for the entire year , yet push through dangerous pandemic conditions on a venue that will host a handful of four-hour events throughout the year .
Our country is asking healthcare professionals to fight a war for us , while we sit on our couches .
I have no complaints about following the rules .
But the NFL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
And our government officials are letting them endanger us all for the obscene profit of a few .
