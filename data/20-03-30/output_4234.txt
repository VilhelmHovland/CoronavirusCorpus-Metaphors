" I know a good , tough fight when I see one and we have one on our hands " - Conor McGregor  Maybe this is exactly what many Irish people need - a rallying cry that applies to our fighting spirit .
On Tuesday afternoon , just over an hour before An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar addressed the Irish nation to announce new measures to help tackle the Coronavirus spread , Conor McGregor delivered an address of his own .
Clearly razzed up and with a lot on his mind , ' The Notorious ' delivered a speech of just over two and a half minutes that called on Irish authorities to immediately bring us into a full lockdown .
" While we are all currently debating a full lockdown , I feel that we must , " he proclaimed .
" Any time that we spend debating is needless time from the clock .
"  The premise was simple - Ireland has seen the catastrophic impact the Covid-19 disease is having on other country 's and , in effect , has a head-start to get out ahead of the outbreak with stringent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man frustrated by the scenes he is witnessing the world over and doing something to battle against that awful feeling of helplessness .
He is not the only one to experience that sensation , but at least he has a huge platform .
His speech was not perfect but it struck a chord that will resonate with many on this isle .
" I know a good , tough fight when I see one and we have one on our hands , now .
And I would call upon my people , the great people of Ireland , this fight needs us all .
We are all in the red corner together and awaiting the bell .
So let 's ring the bell ourselves .
"  " True lockdown must begin , and it must begin now .
A lockdown together , a lockdown united .
"  " Powers that be , I am calling on you .
The fate of our great island depends on it .
"  " We have the advantage here in that we can see this coming .
We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our advantage , then we can not expect different results .
"  " Ireland , WE HAVE GOT THIS ! "  The time is now ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Closing of Airports as well as all non essential business , along with stricter adherence to social distancing , must be put in place now ! God speed ! We can do this ? ?  The thrust of McGregor 's comments is exactly the way we should be tackling our role in this global pandemic .
We 're in a fight .
We 're in something nasty , but we 're in it together .
I do n't know about you , but it got my blood pumping from my new base-camp at home .
Those that may scoff at a Mixed Martial Arts star making demands of the country 's leaders and experts are the ones that probably scoffed at McGregor before .
Each to their own , but it can not be denied that McGregor has sway with a younger demographic than many of those figures .
If McGregor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that take it on-board and stay at home , next time , rather than venturing out , then it has been a worthwhile exercise .
Many are complaining about teenagers and those in their early 20s congregating together when grown men and women were out drinking in pubs up until garda ? had to come and shut them down or until they were shamed into staying home themselves .
Not that many teenagers were over in Cheltenham as the rest of Ireland started getting in gear and entering the first phases of this lockdown .
Ryan Reynolds - from his house in Canada - delivered an excellent piece on how we can all play our part in stopping the spread of Coronavirus .
" I think , in times of crisis , " the actor said , " we all know that it 's the celebrities that we count on most .
They 're the ones that are going to get us through this .
right after health care workers , of course .
And first responders , people who work in essential services , ping-pong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 other types of people .
"  Reynolds and McGregor are big names in their spheres of influence but they 're using the platforms they have to get their message out .
If I had several million followers on social media , I 'd try and use it for some good right about now .
Stay at home .
Pull together and hang on tight .
