A coalition of community groups have issued a joint statement calling for additional government funding to provide financial support for homes and small businesses under financial stress to deal with energy costs .
The statement has been issued by a group of more than a dozen consumer advocacy and support organisations , which said that more needs to be done to ensure those impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak will not face the loss of energy supplies .
The groups have called on both State and Federal governments to commit funding that can be distributed directly to customers to help reduce the additional financial pressures of energy costs .
" Millions of people have just lost work and incomes .
At the same time , people are having to spend their time at home , pushing up energy costs when they are least able to pay , " PIAC 's head of energy policy Craig Memery said .
" Without better support , this winter many families face a choice between heating their homes and having enough money for food and rent .
"  The joint statement has been issued by a coalition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national and state-based Centres for Social Services , the Consumer Action Law Centre and the St Vincent de Paul Society .
The groups called for additional funding to be provided to allow for an expansion of energy retailer payment assistance and hardship support .
Additionally , the group said that governments should consider increasing funding allocations for energy efficiency schemes , that would help reduce energy costs , as well as to improve the quality of housing as the next winter approaches .
" The groups call on the Government to work with energy retailers and community organisations to ensure the relief is delivered quickly and simply to where it is needed most , with a package of Government funding and energy industry commitments , including targeted energy debt relief and new jobs in Australian call centres , " the statement says .
While the community groups welcomed a call issued on Friday from the Australian Energy Regulator to all electricity retailers to provide greater flexibility to customers during a period of financial certainty , they said that more needs to be done to proactively support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are welcome and necessary first steps in reassuring and supporting communities during this difficult period .
But temporarily suspending disconnections and debt collection wo n't stop winter energy bills for many households jumping by $200 a month as a result of COVID-19 related circumstances , " Memery added .
" In times of crisis it is incumbent on companies who are providing essential services to put people first , to provide relief and a level of comfort during this uncertain and unprecedented period .
It 's the right thing to do , " CEO of ACOSS Cassandra Goldie added .
The call mirrors those from the clean energy sector , which has called on stimulus measures to include support for the installation of rooftop solar and storage systems , that would provide economic stimulus while also helping homes reduce their energy costs in the long term .
The call from community groups follows a statement from the Australian Energy Regulator that laid out a set of expectations for electricity retailers on how to handle customers experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid-19 outbreak .
In its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity retailers to make offers of payment plans or hardship arrangements for household and small business customers suffering financial stress .
" We understand the significant impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on the Australian community and our stakeholders , " the AER chair Clare Savage said .
" Many people are or will be affected by dramatic changes to their lives , businesses , income and working arrangements , and those of their friends , families and communities .
As a result their energy use and ability to pay their bills could be affected .
"  These measures would include a cessation in electricity disconnections and referrals of customers to debt collection agencies until at least the end of July .
" People enter into a contract when they sign up with an energy retailer .
But businesses also have a deal , a social contract , with the community in which they operate .
At a time like this , it is vital they remember their broader social obligations , " Savage added .
" The AER is not calling for an amnesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay their bills on time to continue to do so .
"  " This is vital to ensuring the ongoing viability of energy businesses .
However , we also recognise that the circumstances arising from this pandemic mean more customers may find it difficult , or impossible , to pay their bills at the moment , " Savage added .
Following the AER 's statement of expectations , several electricity retailers openly endorsed the calls , with the Australian Energy Council saying that its members , which includes most electricity providers , would adhere to the expectations .
" Energy retailers are focused on providing support through measures like payment plans and ensuring there are no barriers to entering hardship programs .
They will also ensure long term assistance is readily available on request , " AEC 's Chief Executive , Sarah McNamara , said  " There will be no disconnections for affected customers receiving hardship assistance if they are unable to afford their energy bills .
"  " For customers in the hardship program , AEC members have committed to pausing any external debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late fees if these customers can not pay on time , " McNamara added .
