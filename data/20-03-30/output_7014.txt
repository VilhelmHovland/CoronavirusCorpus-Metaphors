ALBANY -- In a world without a pandemic , volunteers for local political campaigns would be knocking on doors , organizing fundraising dinners , visiting senior centers and talking up their candidates to friends over coffee or beer .
Welcome to the world of political campaigns during a pandemic .
Under the rules of social distancing and pandemic precautions , they 're left to working the phones , setting up virtual town halls , sending Facebook messages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political campaign when you ca n't meet with voters in person .
As two progressive campaigns wages primary efforts to try to upset Democratic incumbents in the Albany County District Attorney 's office and the 108th Assembly seat , they 're battling more than just a lack of name recognition .
They 're fighting to get their name and message out there when nearly all of the world 's attention is focused on the novel coronavirus outbreak .
Campaigns face two tasks -- finding ways to reach voters and then get their attention , said Michael Malbin , a professor of political science at Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy at the University of Albany .
In general , local campaigns against an incumbent can only succeed if the challenger can stand out or find another way to get to voters , Malbin said .
" Once you 're on the ballot , you need to figure out a way to generate news , " he said .
One solution local campaigns have struck upon is combining efforts to slow the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door-to-door campaigning , Matt Toporowski , an attorney challenging District Attorney David Soares , has asked his staff and volunteers to deliver meals and other supplies to families in need or in quarantine .
The campaign has also been making and distributing homemade hand sanitizer with aloe vera , glycerine and rubbing alcohol .
" We have the organizational structure so we 're going to use that to help address the coronavirus outbreak , " he said .
" In my opinion , the district attorney 's office should be vocal on these issues .
If we can go back to grassroots campaigning we will but right now that 's not possible .
"  Albany County Legislator Samuel Fein is trying to oust Assemblyman John McDonald .
Fein , whose campaign staffers have also been handing out homemade hand sanitizer , said his campaign is still been reaching out to as many voters as possible .
Part of that effort includes more virtual town halls , which he has held previously on his campaign 's Facebook page .
The next one is scheduled for March 31 .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said .
" They do n't know how they 're going to cover their losses while they ca n't work .
I think people want action and an appropriate government response to this crisis .
"  To that end , Fein has called for expansion to unemployment insurance , a rent freeze , mortgage forbearance and other measures to help .
Local races in general tend to not draw as much as attention as high profile races , making it more difficult for a challenger to stand out .
But incumbents certainly are n't safe , Malbin said .
" If you have a network of support who can be reached to elect you , you can mount a serious challenge , " he said .
" I would n't dismiss people who are outside challengers .
"  The McDonald and Soares campaigns have taken slightly different approaches than their opponents as they all head toward primary day on June 23 .
McDonald , a four-term incumbent from Cohoes , said last month he would n't do any campaigning until the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion deficit before the coronavirus outbreak .
He also canceled a May 7 fundraiser due to uncertainty over when the state would allow public gatherings again .
" My focus is primarily on doing my job as a legislator , " he said .
" People are hurting .
They do n't want to listen to someone bloviating about how great they are .
"  Before the virus outbreak , Soares had planned a series of town halls to discuss the effects of state 's criminal justice reforms .
The coronavirus outbreak and subsequent shutdown of public gatherings put those plans on hold and deprived him of a valuable opportunity to push his message of a being a tough-on-crime district attorney who balances " smart reform " .
Instead his campaign has focused on calling people at home .
Soares has been posting short videos on Facebook , urging people to follow the guidelines around the coronavirus outbreak and to stay healthy .
And though the state 's courts have nearly ground to a halt during the pandemic , he 's relying on the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed onto a letter from a group of prosecutors from 17 states calling on states to adopt mitigation strategies during the COVID-19 outbreak , including releasing elderly prisoners early .
He and Ulster County District Attorney David Clegg also announced their support for a bill that would reform the state 's parole system to reduce the imprisonment of some parole violators .
" We 're still going about the business of protecting the community , " he said .
