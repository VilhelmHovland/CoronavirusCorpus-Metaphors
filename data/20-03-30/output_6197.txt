The rapid spread of Covid-19 throughout Indonesia is a serious challenge that could have strategic implications for Australia .
But , unlike in previous disasters , there 's little Australia can do to assist Indonesia in the short term .
Instead , it will be China that comes to Indonesia 's rescue .
After weeks of denying that it had any Covid-19 cases and claiming that adequate screening measures were in place , Indonesia now faces a health disaster .
Although the first infections were reported only a month ago , current numbers indicate that more people in Indonesia are now dying from the virus than have recovered , giving it the highest death rate in Southeast Asia .
It 's also ranked among the lowest countries in the world in terms of its testing rate , which suggests that numbers could be worse than reported .
The virus has already been detected in 29 of the country 's 34 provinces , and the densely populated areas of Jakarta , Banten , West Java , Central Java and East Java have over 80% of the more than 1,000 confirmed cases .
Videos posted on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jakarta have sent most of the middle class into self-isolation , forced some ethnic Chinese to seek refuge in Singapore , and driven the elite inside the walls of military compounds and gated communities to wait out the crisis .
The central government has tried to follow other countries by implementing work-from-home and social-distancing measures , but they 're proving difficult to enforce .
Millions of Indonesians depend on the income from the informal sector built around the movement of people for their day-to-day living .
Ironically , the closure of offices , markets and factories across Java is increasing the risk of local transmission .
Many Indonesians ca n't work from home and the decline in economic incentives has forced thousands to return early to their villages ahead of the post-Ramadan Idul Fitri holiday period , likely spreading the virus further .
It will be some time before Indonesia and its people understand the true extent of the crisis they face .
The government is now considering a local travel ban to prevent millions from returning to their villages , but it may be too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the safest place for many may now be their villages .
Leaving the city could give the urban poor a better chance of isolating for an extended period .
The Indonesian military is already building makeshift regional hospitals and commandeering non-vital government property in preparation for what will likely be thousands of patients in the coming weeks .
Indonesia 's health system is struggling to cope with the few cases that it has detected .
The country has one of the worst deficits in hospital beds per capita in the region , with about 310,000 for its 260 million population , which roughly equates to 1 .
beds per 1,000 people .
The ratio is even worse for intensive care beds , at about 2 beds per 100,000 people .
Many of Indonesia 's hospitals also lack stored oxygen , ventilators and other equipment that can save patients with severe infections .
Even if Indonesia can increase its number of beds and acquire enough medical equipment to keep up with demand , it still lacks skilled respiratory and intensive care practitioners .
This makes healthcare workers the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to prioritise the supply of personal protective equipment to frontline workers .
At least seven doctors have already died from Covid-19 infections and hospitals have resorted to stop-gap solutions such as plastic raincoats in a last-ditch effort to protect staff .
If the infection rate among frontline healthcare workers continues to rise , the government will face a serious morale problem that could exacerbate the crisis .
The government is putting healthcare workers into hotels , ostensibly to keep them closer to hospitals , which will make them easier to monitor .
The downside of that move is that it increases the risk of an outbreak among health workers .
Providing medical aid to Indonesia is something Australia would normally do , but it has its own shortages to contend with right now .
Instead , Indonesia has been forced to accept offers from China and even to use its own military to pick up medical equipment .
That 's a sign that Indonesia is already desperate for medical equipment , and suggests that the success of its response could depend on how much assistance it gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are limited .
If lockdowns are implemented to reduce local transmission , enforcing them would be more than a question of manpower .
The central government would be responsible for providing food to millions of Indonesians unable to provide for themselves .
Food shortages could easily result in a breakdown of law and order and the scale would likely overwhelm security forces and weaken the government 's hold on power .
Like most countries , Indonesia 's priority has been to avert another economic crisis .
The government has already injected around US$18 billion of liquidity into financial markets .
Indonesia 's economy is consumer-driven , which has helped it weather previous financial crises .
But a prolonged Covid-19 crisis will require substantial government spending and policy responses that bring the domestic economy to a standstill .
Indonesia will need financial assistance and there will be few options apart from China .
Socioeconomic instability in Indonesia in the past has often been followed by political instability and change .
Australia must therefore watch critical indicators closely -- some of which Indonesia has already met -- and provide medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely dependent on China to avert this crisis .
Australia will have a limited capacity to provide the financial aid that Indonesia might require .
But it can offset Indonesia 's dependence on poor-quality equipment from China , which has occurred in countries such as Spain and may actually prolong the crisis .
As soon as Australia has a handle on its own Covid-19 situation , it should start planning to assist Indonesia with expertise in workplace health and safety , diagnosis and treatment , all of which can be done at a distance .
Otherwise , China will have a monopoly on influence and potentially take strategic advantage of Indonesia 's dire circumstances -- an outcome that would have an adverse impact on Australia 's interests in the region .
