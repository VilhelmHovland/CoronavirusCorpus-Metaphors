Viral Diaries : " I seriously miss my usual morning rush .
"  Chandrahas Panigrahi , CMO and consumer business head , Acer India , tells us how he makes an example out of himself as he leads his teams .
If there was just ONE piece of advice you could give people in the media/marketing business right now , what would that be ?  For most brands , the Coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a difficult time to run ads , no matter the platform .
Finding the right messaging can be tricky , and marketers have pulled , or postponed , campaigns that could appear insensitive during this difficult time .
As a leader , I would like to give only one piece of advice , that brands must find prospects that will help them build personalised and lasting relationships with their audiences from a safe distance .
At the same time , look for innovative , cost-effective and sensitive ways to communicate .
Which app/tool are you using to video conference with your team/clients ? And what 's your go-to option for file sharing ?  As COVID-19 spreads , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swiftly shift in-office work to virtual work spaces .
Hence , it 's important to consider the challenges of getting tasks done from the comfort of your own home , as well as any consequences this might have on the rest of your personal life .
Communication and collaboration are an obvious barrier when you and your teammates are working in different locations , but this is one area where we have plenty of apps at our disposal .
Tools such as Zoom and Skype work best for us .
In fact , Zoom has quickly become a popular option to keep in touch with our colleagues in the midst of social distancing and shelter-in-place protocols .
For example , we have a standing 30-minute Zoom meeting in the morning just to chat and check in with one another .
The other teams also organise Zoom meetings at the end of the day to chat and recap their days .
We 're working hard to preserve our company culture and replicate an environment that fosters relationships , embrace technology to encourage collaboration , and make sure all new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer Google Docs as it makes sharing larger files quite easy .
It also allows you to save files to the folder , add new folders , and drag and drop files as if they were all local .
How are you dividing up your work day ? Give us a sense of how you 're managing your time and what your work-from-home routine is like .
I have always believed that time management is one of the most important skills , both personally and professionally , and is a crucial aspect of life .
This practice of mine has really helped me , especially during this time when we are working from the comforts of our home , as we all know that anyone can easily get distracted from work .
So , right now my work-from-home routine starts with waking up early and dedicating some time to workouts and meditation so that I can stay focused and fit throughout the day .
Then I set some important tasks for the day and ensure I discuss the same with my team regularly over conference calls .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I ensure I take some small breaks to refresh and rejuvenate .
Apart from all this , it 's also important to spend some quality time with your family , or pursue some hobbies .
As for me , I take some time out and also listen to some interesting TEDx videos .
What do you miss most about office ?  I seriously miss my usual morning rush of getting to work , dressing up , saying good morning to everyone at office , and getting my strong coffee to start the day .
While we all accept this new normal lifestyle of being in the house for at least the next three weeks , I really miss all of that ! On the other hand , I must admit that this extended work-from-home situation feels different from a one-off thing .
Having said that , with the threat of COVID-19 being essentially everywhere , there 's really no outlet for socialising in person .
And we know that as soon as it 's safe for things to get back to normal , all the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too .
Ideally , how frequently should a team leader/manager check in on her/his team ? Any long-distance people management tips ?  Being a leader is never easy .
In this current scenario , leaders across the nation , and the world , are facing a new reality - leading their teams from afar .
It also means you must adjust your own leadership style as well as how you manage your team in the upcoming weeks , or months .
But the good news is that your understanding , combined with your hard effort , perfectly positions you to be a shining example through crisis .
Now more than ever , your team needs you to step up and provide much-needed direction , and support .
You can be the leader they need , all without stressing yourself out in the process .
Lastly , what 's the one thing you see yourself doing differently once the work-from-home phase ends ? To rephrase , what 's the biggest lesson here , for you ?  As the fight against COVID-19 has increased , the current situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , from scheduling meetings , to the ways we manage our teams , and I have heard from many customers doing the same .
During difficult situations , we often are so focused on alleviating the crisis that we overlook the important lessons we 've learned along the way that are , likely , relevant in the long-term , too .
I wanted to share with you two important things we have discovered so far as a completely remote team .
Practice management skills : Employees rely on their managers , we need to show inquisitiveness to help them solve the problem .
Every day is a learning day , and we are constantly learning about managing remotely .
Every employee confronts unique challenges right now , and every employee approaches this situation differently .
As managers , it 's so important to try to understand and react to their individual needs as much as possible .
Continue driving team culture : For as long as the concept of work has existed , culture has been created as a result of an ongoing , often indirect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to co-exist .
At Acer , since the beginning , we have emphasised on creating a culture we love , and enjoy working in .
Now , as we are working remotely , this same ethos has continued as we 've moved our entire team online .
I believe culture must go beyond the physical workplace .
Most importantly , we have flexible and agile teams that are comfortable with ambiguity .
This is proving to be an amazing asset .
