I keep waiting every year , ' This is n't going to be the year that creator Jed Mercurio does n't deliver ' , but again , they just seem better than ever .
We will be back at some point again to get them finished and I hope they 'll be back bigger and better and longer ! "  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the UK , so I think within 12 hours I was on a flight .
So , I just made it back by the skin of my teeth .
It was bit of a hairy journey over .
but eventually they got us home , " he said .
" I 've spent probably 14 of the last 16 months on the road and you realise how important it is to have a support network around you .
It was important that my wife had a family around her - and the weather 's not bad either ! "  It was announced on March 16 that production on the sixth season of Line of Duty had been suspended .
" In light of the spread of Covid-19 , after much consideration , @worldprods are suspending filming of #LineofDuty S6 with the support of the BBC , " it said .
