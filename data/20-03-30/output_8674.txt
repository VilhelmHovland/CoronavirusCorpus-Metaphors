WEST PALM BEACH , Fla .
-- One crime seems to be going up in Palm Beach County amid social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic , according to state attorney Dave Aronberg .
" We have seen an uptick in the number of burglaries because , unfortunately , some people are trying to take advantage of others during this time of crisis , " Aronberg told Contact 5 investigator Merris Badcock .
Aronberg said now is not the time to take advantage of others .
" They should know that if you commit a burglary during a state of emergency like this , there is an enhancer penalty applied to it , " Aronberg said .
" The third-degree felony becomes a second-degree felony , and a second-degree felony becomes a first-degree felony .
That 's a big difference .
"  Aronberg is also working with law enforcement agencies to investigate any price-gouging complaints .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coronavirus , whether it is a case of looting or a violation of a quarantine order , will get an expedited review , " Aronberg said .
Anyone with price-gouging tips can report it to the Florida Attorney General hotline at 866-9-NO-SCAM .
