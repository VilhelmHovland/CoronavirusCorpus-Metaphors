The world looked like a much happier place on the 6th of February and the dividend was rightfully paid to all shareholders ' .

Airports and airlines struggling for survival as a result of coronavirus have accused ministers of U-turning on a promise of special support .
This month Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was preparing a support package to help the aviation industry deal with the biggest challenge in its history .
He was rumoured to be finalising a multi-billion rescue deal for the industry , which could have seen the Government purchase stakes in the hardest-hit airlines .
However , the Chancellor has now told industry leaders that the Treasury will only provide support ' as a last resort ' - and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  The Airport Operators Association ( AOA ) , which represents UK airports , last night accused the Government of abandoning the sector amid fears some airlines could collapse within weeks .
Chief executive Karen Dee said : ' After having publicly announced a support package for airports and airlines , we 're surprised by where we find ourselves today .
Our industry will now have to fight on its own to protect its workforce and its future .
' With passenger numbers approaching close to zero , UK airports have seen a major drop in revenue .
They are taking unprecedented steps to safeguard airport staff and operations through this crisis , which could include in some cases considering shutting down for a period of time .
This could have major impacts for UK communities and businesses .
'  The AOA has demanded a support package that included measures such as relaxing regulations relating to mandatory training requirements , extending business rate relief to airports and deferring all aviation taxes for the duration of global flight restrictions .

Many first-aid trained cabin crew across the world have been grounded as countries have closed borders and cancelled flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic .
EasyJet has already written to its 9,000 UK-based staff including 4,000 cabin crew trained in CPR to invite them to give their time to the NHS .

Plummeting passenger numbers have forced airlines such as EasyJet and Ryanair to ground their entire fleet , while bigger carriers such as BA and Virgin Atlantic have cut schedules by up to 90 per cent .
Airports have warned they could close within weeks due to flatlining footfall .
Many of the country 's smaller regional airports were already struggling before the pandemic following the collapse of Flybe earlier this month .
In his letter to the industry , the Chancellor says : ' Given the significant importance of the aviation sector to our economy and economic recovery , the Government is prepared to enter negotiations with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort , having exhausted other options .
' However further taxpayer support would only be possible if all commercial avenues have been fully explored , including raising further capital from existing investors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands the decision not to provide a single package of support was taken after it became clear that each aviation company had very different needs .
