Contributed Commentaries  Gold Foiled in its Fourth Foray for 1700  Featuring views and opinions written by market professionals , not staff journalists .
Commentaries &amp; Views  Share this article :  If one were told that Gold :  recorded its " largest-ever " points up-change for a single trading day , ( +109 on 24 March ) , and further that it .
recorded its " largest-ever " points up-change from low-to-high across two consecutive trading days ( +214 , 23-24 March ) , but that .
one was not actually cognizant of Gold 's price , one would have doubtless thought that Gold had embarked on a significant upside price breakout .
To be sure , those two combined runs were impressive , the one-day net change by percentage ( +7 .
) ranking tenth best and the two-day low-to-high change by percentage ( +14 .
) ranking seventh best as both measured since at least 1975 , ( Nixon having nixed the Dollar 's Gold Standard in 1971 , and the government come 1976 ditching any Dollar-defined references to Gold ) .
' Course -- ( and you regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again we 've the quintessential case of change as the illusion versus price as the truth .
Here in context is what really happened :  For the fourth substantive occurrence in the past five weeks , Gold made material changes ( illusions ) --indeed both up and down -- only to fail as it has time and again in nearing the same price ( truth ) round number of 1700 .
In fact , after achieving the above Gold Scoreboard 's forecast high of 1675 on 24 February , price in the ensuing 24 trading sessions has only been above that level on six days , and has only closed above it once ( 1681 , 09 March ) , which is the same day price breached 1700 to just briefly see 1704 .
That 's it .
Moreover , throughout all of Gold 's machinations year-to-date -- up as much as +12 .
and down as much as -4 .
-- such thrashing about and settling out the week yesterday ( Friday ) at 1631 finds Gold today +7 .
net so far in 2020 .
That ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( +16 .
) as , with but two trading days left in the month as well as in Q1 , we present our BEGOS Markets standings .
Clearly they are safe-haven dominated per the gainers , and economically obliterated per the losers .
Oil obviously is the big " slaughteree " , however query : given the 60 trading days thus far this year , has there ever been a like period wherein Oil has sported a net loss of -64 .
? Oh yes : ' t was within the carnage of the prior Black Swan when twice ( in overlapping 60-day stints ) the price of Oil fell respectively -65 .
and -64 .
; so been there , done that .
Still , nothing like a little Russo/Saudi Oil price spat , StateSide energy independence , and a dastardly global cold bug called COVID to make it all economically go wrong there .
But specific to Gold , and especially so given all the enormous monetary and fiscal stimuli being thrown sky-high , one ought feel quite justified in expecting price to have leapt far above its present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Scoreboard 's valuation for 3049 has n't even yet ( with a tip of the cap to the St .
Louis Fed ) received the data effect of the pending money supply boost .
Regardless , Gold keeps getting stuck at 1700 , above which as we 've herein documented across so many recent missives there is all that repelling , overhead structural pricing resistance .
' T is just there , it ai n't going away , and to defeat the Gold trading algorithms which right up through the 1700s are programmed to " Sell , Sell , Sell ! " is gon na take the sovereigns and the bankers and the hedgies to " Buy Like Hell ! "  Either way , in turning to Gold 's weekly bars , we find price of late having gone in all ways : up , down , forward , backward , all within the context that from left-to-right , the dashed linear regression trendline in the below graphic continues to rise .
But the young parabolic Short trend ( to coin a NASCAR expression ) " done blowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent movement in both directions such as to see the flip price pipped at 1694 this past Tuesday , in turn starting a new parabolic Long trend as evidenced by the new rightmost encircled blue dot .
Nothing like flipping to Long when right up against resistance :  " But this time , mmb , you 've got all that money printing to make it go .
"  And that , Squire , is the daunting point .
Arguably in this electronic age of instantaneous market revaluation , Gold 's price ought already have gone .
and way up at that .
This stimulus stuff has been on the boil for weeks -- and Gold has responded -- but not overly to the upside upon which so many have expounded .
The ebbing tide of the Black Swan has lowered all boats , just as it did in 2008/2009 .
Still , it reminds us of a stirring moment from the ' 67 film " In Like Flint " when Andrew Duggan turns to Lee J .
Cobb and exasperatingly asks him : " Lloyd ! Lloyd ! Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1631 ? Because ' t is to where the entirety of all trading entities ' bids and offers have put it .
Note as well in the above graphic the four foiling arrows for failure at 1700 .
May they themselves be foiled ! And so they shall in time : fundamentally sooner than later ? Or technically later than sooner ? Game on , what ?  Also , it being nearly both month 's and quarter 's end , let 's next go year-over-year with the percentage tracks of Gold accompanied by six of the venerable precious metals equities .
And quite the ride ' t is been , Pan American Silver ( PAAS ) having practically doubled along the way before being fumbled away .
From first to worst by net change vis- ? -vis this time a year ago we 've Newmont ( NEM ) +40% , Franco-Nevada ( FNV ) +33% , Gold itself +26% , the aforementioned PAAS +19% , the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange-traded fund ( GDX ) +11% , the Global X Silver Miners exchange-traded fund ( SIL ) -8% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the whole gang :  On to the Economic Barometer we go , material inputs affected by so many business slowings or shutdowns StateSide as yet to work their way into the data .
' Course , we did get the massive Jobless Claims number for the week ending 21 March of some 3 .
million , the Baro itself not lurching off the bottom of its chart as such an untoward number was expected ( consensus thereto being a key component of how the Baro is calculated ) ; and such large number shall continue to be the case over the ensuing weeks .
Data received in April and May ought have the Baro looking fairly terrible , notwithstanding stimulus efforts by the Federal Reserve Bank and policymakers .
' T is interesting also to note that banks are sidling up to the oft ignored " discount window " in recently borrowing some $51 billion .
Meanwhile , how 's that negative return on your three-month dough working out for ya ? The yield on the U .
Treasury Bill ( 13-week ) settled Friday at -0 .
Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Baro :  As for the stock market per our favoured measure of the S&amp;P 500 ( red line in the above graphic ) , at right is as pleasing a " vee " as one may ever see ; ' course , ' t is too early to really have a handle on the ultimate COVID-driven fallout for earnings and economics .
But perhaps the S&amp;P 's Moneyflow has already given us a clue that the worst for the market within the context of COVID has already occurred , the S&amp;P 's lowest close of late being on 23 March at 2237 ; ( Friday 's settle being 2541 ) .
Here , at least within the Moneyflow vacuum , is why .
Follows from the website is our two-panel chart of the cumulative points change in the S&amp;P 500 from three months-ago-to-date along with the Index 's Moneyflow as regressed into S&amp;P points .
At first glance , the two measures are fairly in sync with each other .
But then look at the graphic 's lower panel which is the Moneyflow 's change relative to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  And there are those bold enough to already be dipping their investing toes into wake of the Black Swan .
To wit , with a foot out the door in running in one of Norway 's sovereign wealth funds , CEO Yngve Slyngstad said at a presser this past Thursday that they 're increasing their equities exposure from 65 .
up to 70 .
As well over at Blackrock , ' t is said they 're " rebalancing into risk assets " given the perception that significant value is now there for long-term investors .
So that 's what some Big Guys are doing .
As for the little guys , your humble author heard independently from no less than three very close non-financial , family-oriented friends , each one specifically stating they sha n't be opening their incoming investment statements .
And as history time and again has shown , ' t is the Big Guys moving first that bring in the most benefit .
Our take is that even with the S&amp;P 's sell-off , the " live " price/earnings ratio of 31 .
is historically still far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t is been typically shown to not matter .
What does matter from the precious metals perspective is Silver 's being cast aside as a commodity rather than being sought as money .
In going to the following two-panel chart of daily bars from three months ago-to-date for Gold on the left and Silver on the right , the latter 's comparative under-performance is glaring , as portrayed above the Gold/Silver ratio at present 111 .
Gold has to deal with its oft-mentioned overhead structural blockage ; but Silver -- especially given her " Baby Blues " of trend consistency having curled higher after being below their -80% level -- has open ground ( should she so be desired ) to make a run from Friday 's settle at 14 .
up to the 16 .
area per the arrow , in turn retracting some of that excessive ratio :  As for their 10-day Market Profiles , prices for both Gold ( below left ) and Silver ( below right ) scrambled back up their respective stacks .
Note : for Gold , its profile 's bars/labels are for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for April on Friday .
Indeed there are some 24 points of added premium in Gold 's June price :  Finally , here is our broad-based chart of Gold 's monthly bars and defined strata essentially since the All-Time High of 1923 on 06 September 2011 .
Again you can see how price has traipsed above our 1675 forecast only to have been beaten back in both February and March .
Why the struggle ? One only has to ( again ) look at the left-hand portion of the chart to see all that substantive structural congestion from 2011 into 2013 :  Peering into the new week , we 're to encounter everything from 16 incoming Econ Baro blurs to purported " off-label " COVID cures .
An important page to mind at the website is Market Ranges : that 's the clue for volatility readings across the BEGOS Markets .
We 've definitely sensed a slight slowing in markets ' ranginess these past few sessions , and ' t is already being reflected in some of the Market Ranges ' graphics as peaking out .
