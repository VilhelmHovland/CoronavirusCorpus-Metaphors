As the COVID-19 pandemic has temporarily shut down sports across the world , the Visalia Times-Delta/Tulare Advance-Register asked local coaches what athletics means to them .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mission Oak girls basketball coach  Why sports matter : " It teaches kids to stay actively involved .
It keeps people doing things that are fun .
It keeps them engaged , especially with school sports or even weekend sports .
Club teams .
It basically keeps everybody involved .
It 's kind of interesting , you do n't realize how much sports play into your life until something like this comes .
I think with the whole COVID-19 thing , it 's going to make people appreciate a lot more things after all of this is over because so much has been taken away .
Sports are such a huge part of our society .
When something like this creates this kind of impact , you really have a greater appreciation for the level of involvement that sports have in your life .
"  Joe D'Agostino , College of the Sequoias football coach  Why sports matter : " I think athletics has always been an outlet for people .
An outlet for the player .
An outlet for the fan .
An outlet for the coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society .
It 's kind of woven into everything that we do .

Mark Hatton , Tulare Union boys basketball coach  Why sports matter : " When I think back to my playing days and coaching days , it is the intrapersonal relationships with the team , that bonding , that sense of team spirit on the court .
That social connection is what I miss with my kids in this thing right now .
Just missing that connection with those kids is extremely difficult .
"  Bob Rooney , Redwood softball coach  Why sports matter : " I think most of the players will tell you is the interactions among the teammates and the coaches , that 's probably more important than just playing the sport .
It 's that interaction that makes it all good .
I miss that a lot .
The most .
"  Jon Zaino , Mt .
Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , it 's kind of a good escape .
A good escape from what the high school player has to deal with , testing , everything that they go through in their daily life with their classes , relationships with friends and family .
We find that when they 're at practices or at a game , they can come out of their shell a little bit .
I think that 's probably the biggest thing I see why sports matters .
You 'll see a difference in a kid .
They get to escape from some of the things that may not be so positive .
