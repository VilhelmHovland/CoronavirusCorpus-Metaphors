Sanwo-Olu , a hero of COVID-19 war , says Rep  A member of the House of Representatives , Mr Rotimi Agunsoye , has hailed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State for being heroic in the fight against coronavirus pandemic .
Agunsoye , who represents Kosofe Federal Constituency in Lagos State , also commended the Federal Government for the good leadership provided .
The lawmaker , however , said , " If any man should be adjudged the hero of the war against this plague , he is no other than Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State .
But for the proactive and anticipated moves of His Excellency and his team , Lagos , being the most populated state and second home to all Nigerians , would have ranked as one of the worst hit cities in the globe .
"  Agunsoye also lauded efforts by the chairmen of the three area councils in the constituency .
He said in part , " Dear constituents , the pathetic situation we presently find ourselves could have been avoided if the first cases had been patriotic enough in reporting early symptoms to the appropriate authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it may , the onus lies on us to report further suspects to the nearest health authority in our locality .
" Beyond that , it is important we disregard the mischief-makers spreading panic with the exaggerations and outright falsehoods flying around on the streets and social media .
I urge you instead to rely only on the accurate and timely information from relevant government agencies .
" In my capacity as your elected representative in the National Assembly , I have been working round the clock to complement government 's efforts at various levels and only a few days ago donated hand sanitisers , nose masks and other materials to curb the spread of this highly-contagious disease .
All these measures are being put in place for your use and it is expedient you avail yourselves of these opportunities .
" More importantly , it is in everybody 's interest that you comply with the government 's directives and public health guidelines by the federal and state health authorities bordering on personal hygiene and social distancing .
