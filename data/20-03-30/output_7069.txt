Mike Leach shares funny coronavirus ' Tiger King ' meme  Mike Leach continues to run the No .

Leach , who is now the head coach at Mississippi State , shared a funny meme photo on Twitter Monday .
The picture showed a couple with their backs to each other in bed .
The woman thought the guy had his back to her for social distancing purposes .

Yes , as those who watched " Tiger King " on Netflix know , you could purchase a tiger for a few thousand dollars in the underground market from people like Joe Exotic ( who is now in prison ) .
Of course , the purchase price of the tiger is nothing ; the real expense is keeping the gorgeous beast fed .
