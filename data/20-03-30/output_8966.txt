Feeling overwhelmed ? Approach coronavirus as a challenge to be met , not a threat to be feared  Bethany Teachman , University of Virginia  Published 6:02 am PDT , Monday , March 30 , 2020  ( The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news , analysis and commentary from academic experts .
)  Bethany Teachman , University of Virginia  ( THE CONVERSATION ) You have a choice to make when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic .
Do you treat this time as an insurmountable threat that pits you against everyone else ? This option entails making decisions based solely on protecting yourself and your loved ones : stockpiling supplies regardless of what that leaves for others ; continuing to host small gatherings because you 're personally at lower risk ; or taking no precautions because the effort seems futile .
Or do you treat the coronavirus as a collective challenge that will require shared sacrifices to achieve a difficult but not impossible goal ? That option would mean taking recommended precautions : practicing social distancing , hand-washing and restricting travel .
These actions might not be your most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to the broader social good , reducing the spread of COVID-19 .
As a professor of psychology and licensed clinical psychologist who studies how people think differently when they 're anxious , I recognize this global pandemic has all the ingredients to fuel a threat-oriented mindset .
The trajectory of the coronavirus is uncertain and unpredictable , the very features that fuel anxiety and threat-processing in the brain .
The way people process threatening events matters a lot for how well they 'll manage this period of uncertainty .
Some identification of threat is useful and will mobilize you to action , but a rigid overestimation of threat makes you panic or immobilizes you .
Letting the threat dictate your response  When you perceive a situation as a dire threat , it changes how you process information .
No longer do you consider the pros and cons of your choices evenhandedly , looking at the situation from multiple perspectives .
Instead , your attention narrows , selectively focusing on cues that reinforce your sense of danger and vulnerability .
Your interpretations become biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ambiguous -- as almost all situations are .
And you preferentially remember information that confirms a prior belief that the world is a dangerous place and you do n't measure up .
Why is this a problem ? After all , the world really is in the grip of an objectively dangerous pandemic .
Paying attention to this threat seems vital for staying safe .
The issue occurs when you believe that your personal resources are insufficient to meet the demands of the situation .
If you feel the threat is insurmountable , then you give up .
Why try if you 're doomed to fail ? And if you feel that your resources -- be it food , money , time , energy -- are inadequate or threatened , then you have nothing to share with others , and hoard what you can for yourself .
Feeling threatened can make you hyperfocused on monitoring for signs of danger , which can in turn mean consuming terrifying stories about COVID-19 almost nonstop .
It 's important to stay informed , but prior research makes clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder , if they do n't limit media exposure .
In turn , reading about COVID-19 all the time increases the perception of threat , further fueling the need to monitor for danger signs in a vicious cycle that makes the world seem ever scarier .
Better to conceive a threat as a challenge  It 's better for your mental health to see this time as a collective challenge -- one that is extremely difficult but which can be met if everyone works together .
When you size something up as a challenge , it 's easier to rise to the occasion .
Instead of withdrawing from the problem , you shift to problem-solving .
People with this mindset draw on others to help , and they offer their own support to those in need .
Research has shown that working collaboratively and helping others has great mental health benefits for the helper .
Research on cognitive behavior therapy shows that shifting one 's outlook to perceive something as a motivating challenge rather than an insurmountable threat can be a successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioning your thoughts instead of assuming the first one that pops into your mind is the most helpful .
An individual becomes a scientist , weighing the evidence for and against ideas to reach more balanced conclusions .
You become an explorer , thinking flexibly to consider new approaches to solving problems .
If you sniffle once , you do n't immediately assume you have COVID-19 -- you maintain precautions , but also consider whether this month is when your allergies usually act up and see if allergy medicine works .
It would be ludicrous not to acknowledge the real threats the world faces right now , and the disproportionate impact this difficult time has on already marginalized communities .
But you need not define this threat as insurmountable and get stuck there .
Choose instead to work together -- albeit remotely -- and accept the coronavirus challenge .
The shift from threat to challenge might just make it a little easier to stay home , to close the browser and stop reading about COVID-19 24/7 , to wash your hands for a full 20 seconds and to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the same .
You need to understand the coronavirus pandemic , and we can help .
