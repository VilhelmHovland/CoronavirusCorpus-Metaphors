Engineer Maher H Mousa , Director of Product Management , Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency Policy , Al Salem Johnson Controls , said : " When we think about pollutants , we often think about those found outside , whether in the air , on the ground , or in the water , even though indoor air quality ( IAQ ) is just as vital to our everyday lives and health , and the pollutants found inside building and public closed areas should concern us just as much , if not more , especially these days when the world is faced with the challenge of fighting the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that the Al Salem Johnson Controls ' Covid-19 pandemic has gripped the world , with focus now turned to the control and prevention of the spread of the coronavirus .
People around the world have been urged to avoid crowded areas , and stay home to control and minimize the spread of the disease .
" While many people believe that the prevention of infection with the coronavirus is requiring them to take health and hygiene precautions only when they are outside their homes ; it is essential to point out that there are other factors -- apart from health and hygiene - that are unknown to some in commercial and residential buildings , as well as other public crowded closed areas , which may cause infection transmission , " he stated .
Thus , precautionary measures are keen to close such areas , prevent crowds , and urge individuals to avoid any kind of gatherings , and safe inside their homes , added Mousa .
He pointed out that the design and operation of HVAC systems could hinder disease transmission in several ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as in crowded and closed spaces , thereby helping in reducing the possibility of disease transmission , he explained .
According to Mousa , Al Salem Johnson Controls offers a complete range of advanced solutions and technologies covering filtration , proper humidification and ultraviolet air purifiers that reduce airborne contaminants to achieve an optimum room temperature and humidity , and a cleaner and healthier IAQ .
York 's Air Handling Units show how HVAC units can play an important role in reaching the required levels of IAQ and beyond , he stated .
These HVAC units supply 100% fresh air by containing contaminated air and exhausting it to the outdoors , and then replacing it with well-treated fresh air , which re-enters the space after a rigorous filtration process ; this process cleans the air within the space/room , he added .
