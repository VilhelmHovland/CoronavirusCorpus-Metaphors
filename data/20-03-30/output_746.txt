Coronavirus lockdown leaves migrant workers stranded in Thailand  According to the International Organization for Migration , Thailand was home to as many as five million migrant workers from neighbouring countries like Cambodia , Myanmar and others before the recent lockdown Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP  Bangkok , Thailand - When Thailand 's government started shutting down the country 's capital last week , tens of thousands of migrant labourers , who were suddenly out of work , scrambled to return home to Myanmar .
But now that the government has tightened up its borders , some migrants left behind have been forced to accept the consequences of their decision to remain in the capital , Bangkok .
For Ma Moe Moe , a migrant worker from Myanmar , returning home is not an option .
The 44-year-labourer has lived in Thailand for years and has been working in factories for most of the time she has been in the country .
More :  Last week , Ma Moe Moe and dozens of her coworkers were suddenly fired .
The silk-garment factory , where they worked , shut down as most of its exports to China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the coronavirus pandemic .
Feeling disheartened , Ma Moe Moe told Al Jazeera that her former employer had little sympathy for their situation .
And now , unable to go home and out of a job - she is stuck in limbo .
" Because of getting fired from the factory , I am worried about bills because there is only one income source from my husband , " she told Al Jazeera .
" Now that I have no job I feel depressed , " she said , explaining that her husband 's pay has also dropped because he can no longer work night shifts as a result of the Bangkok 's shutdown .
According to the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , between four and five million migrant workers from neighbouring countries including Myanmar and Cambodia were living in Thailand when the lockdown was announced .
Many others are undocumented .
Migrant workers are vulnerable during the migration process , says IOM , and even more so those who migrate irregularly , as they are at risk of exploitation because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to say '  Speaking to Al Jazeera from her studio apartment , Ma Moe Moe said she feared she might not be able to return to Thailand if she left and with a family to support , she and her husband are hunkering down .
And then there is the question of what would happen in Myanmar itself , which is also closing borders and imposing strict quarantines .
" No migrant workers from Myanmar I know are going back to Myanmar , " said Ye Htut , Ma Moe Moe 's husband .
" They will quarantine us for 14 days in Myanmar with poor facilities in either a school , hospital or temples .
Only after that , will we be able to meet our families .
"  " Many of them come from rural communities in Myanmar , Cambodia and the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , which are relatively unprepared for monitoring , testing or treating COVID-19 cases , " he said .
Myanmar has so far reported only five confirmed cases of COVID-19 , while Cambodia has listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these nations and many believe the numbers are likely to be much higher .
Cross-border infections  Across the border in Myanmar , officials have voiced their concern about the virus , but insist the situation is under control .
It is unclear what measures Myanmar is taking to repatriate its citizens but the authorities have set up quarantine zones and are reportedly instructing those arriving to self-quarantine for 14 days .
" We can not confirm how many people we have prepared for , because the number keeps changing as we receive offers of help from different stakeholders for quarantine facilities , " Daw Khin Khin Gyi , director of Myanmar 's Central Contagious Disease Prevention and Eradication Sub-Department in the Ministry of Health and Sports ( MOHS ) , told The Irrawaddy , a news website .
For its part , Cambodia has encouraged its migrant workers not to return , but the appeal did little to prevent thousands from heading to the border as Bangkok was closed down .
Temperatures were being taken at the border monitored of those entering Cambodia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , only 35 were tested for the virus , according to officials .
Highly vulnerable population  Those who decided to stay behind in Thailand , face a different set of challenges as they grapple with the economic uncertainty brought about by pandemic .
Suthasinee Kaewleklai , a Project Coordinator of Migrant Workers Rights Network ( MWRN ) , a Thailand-based organisation supporting migrant workers from Myanmar , said migrants are even more vulnerable .
" Migrant workers are now unable to work as they planned , " Suthasinee said .
" Their lives are made more difficult now and are living in fear .
"  While Bangkok is reliant on migrant workers - from construction to hospitality , factories and housekeeping , the Thai government has offered little support .
Myanmar workers wait at the Mae Sot Immigration office in Thailand along the border with Myanmar Chiravuth Rungjamratratsami/AP  Suthasinee said the Thai government is only offering limited assistance , including temporary visa extensions , and migrants can apply for welfare through a " jobless policy .
" But she said it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweeping state of emergency are expected to continue until April 30 .
Among the measures , Thailand 's government included a ban on public assembly and a call to discourage inter-provincial travel .
Some are concerned a curfew will be imposed  Ye Htut , the labourer and husband of Ma Moe Moe said many migrants are now worried that the new state of emergency could make things even more difficult .
" Because of the state of emergency we do n't get to work overtime , which brought good income for us before .
Some factories are shut down , some downsized and fired employees like what happened to my wife , " he explained .
For Mo Mae Mae , the only thing on her mind is how she is going to support her two children .
She says she can not just apply for other jobs , as her work permit only allows her to be employed in a factory .
She is now filing for compensation along with the other workers who were let go from the garment factory .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring everything .
He 's not willing to pay compensation , " she said .
" We told him that we have nothing now .
