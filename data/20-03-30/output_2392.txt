As the non-profit organization receives little funding and relies heavily on donations and park admissions -- and with people being urged to stay home -- the decision to temporarily close was made  The BC Wildlife Park has temporary closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic .
The decision to close came after park staff had already closed its indoor galleries , reduced its caf ? to take-out-only options and eliminated many services that gathered people , including feed talks and animal encounters .
However , as the non-profit organization receives little funding and relies heavily on donations and park admissions -- and with people being urged to stay home -- the decision to temporarily close was made .
The park 's animal-care team will continue looking after the animals and its health centre remains open to accepting wildlife .
Those wishing to bring wildlife to the park in Dallas must first call 250-573-3242 ext 230 ( 250-319-1129 in an emergency ) to arrange a time .
