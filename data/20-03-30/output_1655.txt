Your dividend yield would be 10% .
But if the share price dropped to 80p , the dividend yield increases to 12 .
This is good news for new investors , as they can effectively lock in the higher dividend yield by buying the share at a cheaper price .

How can I be sure of receiving a dividend ?  There are two ways that income investors can aim to still pick up dividends by investing in FTSE 100 firms .
Firstly , look at the size of the share price fall and the updated dividend yield .
For example , the ITV share price is down over 55% in the past three months .
Using the previous year 's dividend of 8p per share , and a share price of 67p , this would be a dividend yield of 12% .
This looks unsustainable in light of the firm 's historical dividend yield .
Hence , we have seen it cut .
There are plenty of other shares now yielding 10% or even 20% yields which start to raise alarm bells for me .
Secondly , look at the firm 's dividend cover .
This measures the profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dividend .
A cover of 1 means the dividend can be paid entirely from profit .
To feel safer about continuing to receive a dividend , I would be buying firms with a cover of at least 1 .
In my opinion , seeking reliable dividend income at the moment is tough .
That is why I am focusing more on buying stocks for capital appreciation .
I 'm looking for stocks that are fundamentally undervalued in the long run .
And with the Covid-19 virus now beginning to spread beyond of China and Italy , it seems very likely that the bull market we 've enjoyed over the past decade could finally be coming to an end .
Against such a backdrop of market worry , it 's little wonder that many investors are starting to panic .
( After all , nobody likes to see the value of their portfolio fall significantly in such a short space of time .
