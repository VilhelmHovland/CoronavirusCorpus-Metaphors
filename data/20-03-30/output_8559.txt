How Malone chorale 's virtual performance came together  Monday  Jon C .
Peterson does n't evaluate his students based on written tests .
The associate music professor at Malone University typically uses public performances .
But when Malone and other Ohio colleges and universities suspended in-person classes for the spring semester and the state barred people from gathering , Peterson , who directs Malone 's choral activities , had to figure out a new way his 43 students in the University Chorale could perform together without physically standing side by side .
He found that live video-conferencing tools did n't work because one slow internet connection derailed the group 's timing .
Instead , he asked each student to record a video of themselves singing the song " The Lord Bless You and Keep You " by Peter Lutkin , a traditional piece that the students already had performed .
He sent them a recording of the piece with a click track , which is similar to a metronome , in the background that the students used as they sang to help them stay in rhythm and key .
Peterson said he chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspirational for others .
" I wanted to find a piece that we could send out during this difficult time that would be a blessing to the community , " Peterson said .
" We chose one they were relatively familiar with and that would be a blessing .
"  The students submitted their videos last week and Josh McManaway , technical coordinator , videographer and photographer for Malone , spent eight hours splicing the videos together .
The virtual performance , which was posted online March 25 , quickly caught the attention of Gov .
Mike DeWine who highlighted the group and praised their efforts Sunday during his daily press briefing about the state 's efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus , also known as COVID-19 .
I wanted to close by sharing a performance that was specifically shared with our office by Malone University 's Chorale .
Thank you , Dr .
Peterson and the Malone University Virtual Choir .
To all of #Ohio : May the Lord Bless You and Keep You .

-- Governor Mike DeWine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We had no clue this was going to take off like this , " said Peterson , who has been teaching at Malone for seven years .
" This has been one of those humbling projects of my career .
"  Peterson said he has received messages from people in New York City and Texas thanking the group for providing such an inspirational message .
Peterson said the students have been lifted by the experience .
" There 's a healthy pride in what they are feeling now , " he said .
" They really want to be an inspiration and want their music to make a difference .
The fact that they are able to see that through the social media comments and the news coverage has been the best life and educational lesson they could have gotten through these circumstances .
"  Peterson , who also directs the All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir , hopes people will come to hear the University Chorale in person once classes resume on campus .
" The group sounds a lot better in person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shot in their homes were inspirational , the live music is so much more touching .
"  The group 's next virtual performance will be " We Are Not Alone , " by Pepper Choplin .
Peterson said some Malone alumni also will be joining in .
The performance is expected to be posted later this week .
