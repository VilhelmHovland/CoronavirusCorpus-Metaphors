REUTERS/Issei Kato  In Summary  The Tokyo Olympics were postponed on Tuesday to 2021 , the first such delay in the Games ' 124-year modern history , as the coronavirus crisis wrecked the last international sporting showpiece still standing this year .
Though a huge blow to Japan , which invested $12 billion in the run-up , the decision was a relief to thousands of athletes fretting over how to train as the world headed into lockdown to fight a disease that has claimed more than 16,500 lives .
Pressure had been building on the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and its president , Thomas Bach , with some athletes and sporting bodies angry that a seemingly inevitable decision had taken so long .
After a call between Bach and Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo , both parties announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer of 2021 .
" We and President Bach agreed that we keep cooperating with each other , so that the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics will be held in a complete form as proof that human beings have beaten the coronavirus , " Abe said .
Though it was the first Olympics ' postponement , they were cancelled outright three times during the two 20th century World Wars .
Major Cold War boycotts also disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984 .
Athletes were disappointed but broadly endorsed the delay , given health risks and disruption to their training as gyms , stadia and swimming pools shut down around the world .
" I compete in a little bike race , which is nothing compared to what is going on in the world right now , " American Olympic BMX champion Connor Fields said , before the official announcement .
" No sport is more important if it means more people might potentially die from this .
"  Australian double Olympic champion swimmer , Cate Campbell , said she was reeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goalposts have n't disappeared -- just shifted , " she said , after Australia had said it would not go to Tokyo 2020 if it went ahead .
skateboarder and gold medal hopeful Nyjah Huston was frustrated , though , especially as his sport was scheduled to make its debut at the Tokyo .
" When skating finally makes it in the Olympics then it gets postponed , " the 25-year-old wrote on Instagram , after a delay had begun to look inevitable .
" I was feelin ( sic ) ready too .
now I 'm going to have to be a year older for this ! "  The coronavirus outbreak has raged around the world since early this year , infecting nearly 380,000 people and wrecking sports events from the European soccer championships to Formula One motor racing .
Despite their disappointment , not to mention the logistical headaches and financial losses coming , a poll indicated that about 70% of Japanese agreed with a delay .
In a crowded sporting calendar , which will be making up for this year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its world championships , scheduled for Aug .
6-15 , 2021 , in Oregon , to clear a path for the Olympics .
The Athletics Association said a poll of more than 4,000 track and field competitors indicated 78% wanted the Games delayed .
The association 's American founder , twice Olympic triple jump champion Christian Taylor , is among athletes unable to train due to social distancing and closure of facilities .
" There is no sandpit for me , I have not put on jump spikes for two weeks , " he told Britain 's Times newspaper .
Tuesday 's decision came 122 days before the planned opening ceremony at Japan 's newly built National Stadium , which was to usher in the 16-day carnival of sport featuring 11,000 athletes from 206 nations and territories .
It was not the first time a Japanese Olympics has run into problems .
Both the 1940 Summer and Winter Olympic Games were due to be held in Japan but were cancelled due to World War Two .
It was not yet clear whether the athletes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those due to compete -- would need to qualify again .
The torch relay was being cancelled .
Postponement was a deep disappointment for Japan 's prime minister Abe , who has staked his legacy on the Games ' success and hoped it would bring a tourism and consumer boom .
Such was his enthusiasm that he appeared as video game character Super Mario at the 2016 Olympics ' closing ceremony .
IOC boss Bach is also in a tricky situation , after his repeated statements that the Games were on track brought a backlash from athletes and some national Olympic committees .
That , combined with disquiet over his support for Russian athletes to continue competing as neutrals despite their nation 's doping scandal , has threatened his grip on the IOC .
