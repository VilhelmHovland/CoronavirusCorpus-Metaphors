Hiranya Malik  March 26th , 2020  Conquering Coronavirus  Hiranya Malik  March 26th , 2020  Conquering Coronavirus  In these unpredictable times , when fear and uncertainty become the collective emotion , it 's imperative to find strength and hope in each other .
It has not been easy to grapple with the rapidly changing environment around us .
Firstly , I would like to acknowledge that the upheaval , untimely goodbyes and unprecedented change in our future has been tough on each and every one of us .
For many of us , returning to our homes and our days in London coming to a halt has been an overwhelming journey .
In the face of these difficult realisations , I want you to take a moment right now and think about the new friends you made , the places you visited , the experiences that made you feel like time was flying and the parts of LSE that became home .
I urge you not to let these circumstances taint your cherished memories .
The LazyBoys in the library , meals on the 4th floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday nights at the Three Tuns -- they will all be waiting for us when this is over .
What next ?  The uncertainty has triggered anxieties for a lot of us , but it 's crucial to remember that none of us can control the environment .
What is under your control is how you manage this anxiety .
Following are some ways of ensuring your wellbeing while you 're quarantined , self-isolating or social distancing .
This list is not exhaustive and does n't apply to everyone ! If you have any other tips for fellow students , leave a comment .
Setting a routine  Even though physical classes are not taking place and virtual classes do n't require you to be dressed well , it 's important to set a routine to reduce the feeling of disruption :  If it 's not possible to be present for Zoom classes due to time differences , watch lectures at the same time every day to retain meaningful schedules .
You may also find it helpful to set up a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your courses ; a table and chair with your necessities laid out at an arm 's length .
Keeping in touch  If you used to hang out with your friends after classes every Thursday , now you can video call them every Thursday !  If you 're cooking up worst-case scenarios by yourself in quarantine , call your friends and share how you feel .
I can guarantee that we 're all going through the same emotions and sometimes , having a medium for catharsis can be more relieving than you 'd expect .
As the popular High School Musical song goes , " we 're all in this together .
" We must rely on each other , lend emotional support and simply share a few laughs about the absurd unexpected turns that 2020 is taking !  We must rely on each other , lend emotional support and simply share a few laughs about the absurd unexpected turns that 2020 is taking !  3 .
More time for hobbies  You 're probably hearing it everywhere but a simple thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hobbies you do n't engage in anymore or take up new ones !  As we grow up , many of us stop reading fiction novels because we have to finish our academic journal readings , we stop having time to paint or play music without worrying about responsibilities .
Now , you have an opportunity to start indulging in your hobbies again !  Perhaps you 've always wanted to bake but did n't have an oven in your dorms or you want to work on the song lyrics or poem you left unfinished .
If you thought that the TikTok dance for Renegade was cool but too complicated , now is the time to put on a tutorial video and learn it ( dancing in your room is also a good alternative to gyms and exercising outdoors ! ) .
A silly-sounding activity that I like to engage in is to play concert videos of my favourite artists really loudly and sing like I 'm part of the crowd that has come together out of love for the same music , there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at-home concert might uplift your spirits .
Rushing into normalcy and routine may be helpful for some of us but it 's also important to take some time to introspect about what these changes mean for you .

You do n't have to jump into being productive and finishing your assignments .
It can be hard to look at the bright side and continue working when your future plans fall through .
It 's absolutely okay to feel upset about it and you 're not alone in feeling that way .
But you must also remember that this is only temporary , and we 'll all get through it together !  It 's absolutely okay to feel upset .
and you 're not alone in feeling that way .
I 'd like to end by saying that there 's a light at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only metaphorically ! ) .
