A stark contrast : Canada and the U .
face the challenge of COVID-19  " Each country is taking a different approach to the pandemic .
It remains to be seen how COVID-19 impacts each country 's population and economy , given their respective governments ' actions or inaction .
"  As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts the health and economy of Canadians and Americans , their governments ' responses could not be more different .
Since January , the world has watched the devastation wrought by COVID-19 , first in China , and then in South Korea , Iran , and Italy .
Each country declared quarantines and states of emergency .
Medical systems were overwhelmed by a lack of resources to treat a massive number of infections , followed by thousands of deaths .
In mid-March , U .
, President Donald Trump barred travellers from the European Union for 30 days .
The following week , the Canadian and U .
governments closed their common border to non-essential travel , while continuing commercial trade .
The two countries have since taken markedly different paths to addressing the threat and communicating it to their citizens .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation among federal , provincial , and municipal governments .
The message has been consistent : social distancing , flattening the curve , and providing financial support so citizens can survive the severe economic downturn .
In contrast , President Trump has not provided substantive federal resources to individual states -- notably New York , which is being devastated by COVID-19 .
And the images of thousands of students celebrating spring break on a Florida beach just last week underlines the lack of communication among municipalities , states and the federal government .
In Canada , Prime Minister Trudeau conveys the federal government 's priorities on a daily basis .
He is always followed by a medical update from Canada 's Chief Public Health Officer , Dr .
Teresa Tam .
In contrast , President Trump 's daily COVID-19 press briefings have been unstructured , rambling , self-congratulatory and largely partisan .
He has blurted out misinformation referencing possible cures , suggested that medical personnel should re-use Personal Protective Equipment .
public health officials and the media have added to the misinformation , some even denying the threat posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 , 2020 , U .
Surgeon General Dr .
Jerome Adams stated that America had " turned the corner " on coronavirus testing .
" We have now done more testing in the last eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks , " he said .
This is incorrect .
Canadian politicians and health care officials remain focused on flattening the curve so that hospitals and medical resources are not overwhelmed .
They have declined to estimate when schools , businesses , and the economy will return to normal .
Again , in contrast , President Trump , in a letter to U .
governors on March 26 , suggested new guidelines to categorize counties by " high-risk , medium-risk , or low-risk .
" He has urged the country to return to work by Easter Sunday , though changed his tone in a Sunday press conference , extending social distancing guidelines until April 30 .
In the coming weeks and months , COVID-19 will continue to impact the health and welfare of both Canadian and American citizens and economies .
The ability to protect each country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic stimulus and relief , and the willingness of governments to intervene .
The Canadian and the U .
governments are very different countries , with very different social safety nets and medical systems .
Each is taking a different approach to the pandemic .
It remains to be seen how COVID-19 impacts each country 's population and economy , given their respective governments ' actions or inaction .
