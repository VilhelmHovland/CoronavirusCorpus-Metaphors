The coronavirus has caused a major shift in how we live .
Mindfulness practitioners are offering ways to help us deal with that shift .
It 's a difficult time for everyone , with the Covid-19 outbreak bringing severe and unexpected changes to our lives , along with new concepts like ' social distancing ' and ' cocooning ' .
Amidst all the negative news there has been a growing community spirit across Ireland and an outpouring of empathy , particularly in the care of elderly and vulnerable people .
Technology is playing a part in keeping communities and families close , offering video conferencing calls , mindfulness and exercise classes to help everyone maintain their mental health .
Here at TheJournal .
, we will be featuring some of these as time goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public at this time , we 'd love to hear about it at voices@thejournal .
Send us a message with " WELLNESS " in the subject line .
Maura Rath  Source : Spiro Stergiou  MY NAME IS Maura , I 'm a Dublin based yogi originally from Wexford , just trying to share a little calmness over this pandemic period .
Last Thursday when the government closed the schools I could feel the stress in the air ; a sense of panic and anxiety .
Right away I needed to get on my yoga mat , my safe place .
I moved through a sequence of yoga poses , each posture linked with another breath .
After forty minutes of flowing on my mat , I finished with a short mediation .
Yoga always makes me feel lighter in spirit and ready to take the world on again .
My journey to teaching yoga began with the desire to share with others what yoga does for me so on Thursday I knew I wanted to share the calmness , healthy routine and positive mindset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared the idea of a free virtual yoga routine with my little yoga community of friends , family and regular students .
The response was overwhelmingly positive and thankful , so I went ahead .
I decided to stream live classes from Monday to Friday 8 am and 5 pm , to keep with the majority of office hours and also to help people to start and finish their day with a positive yoga class .
Routine is so important for our minds and bodies , it throws down an anchor to rely on when it feels like you 're drifting out to sea .
It 's also easy to forget the importance of physical movement when we 're focused on new challenges like working from home , amidst all the distractions that come with it .
The beauty of yoga is that it is about unity , and that does n't have to mean physical proximity .
Yoga can give us a sense of belonging that brings mindfulness to the individual which in turn feeds positively back into the collective consciousness .
This togetherness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practise yoga on our own , lead by a teacher but it helps us feel part of something bigger .
My live classes have been designed with a full heart , at a level that most people can at least attempt and create space and strength in their bodies and minds .
We start each class with a slow breathing exercise , this helps to ground us , clear our lungs and bring them into use .
Our breath is the most powerful tool in everyday life .
It is a tool we can have full control of especially in our physical yoga practice , no matter your ability .
After we become aware of our breath , we build greater awareness of our body , how it moves and what it needs .
Then we start to move in a gentle warm flow that links breath to each movement .
This style of yoga is called Vinyasa Flow .
Justin Caffrey , daily meditation  I am a former private equity and financial markets professional ; an entrepreneur , who found Buddhist psychology after losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a path to deal with extreme tragedy , trauma and anxiety .
I trained with some of the most incredible teachers around the world , and am extremely grateful to now be able to offer my skills to all who can benefit from them .
The approach used during our morning session is taken from ancient Japanese Samurai teachings used in battle .
Those Samurai who were out on the battlefield needed quick guidance and tools to move away from their fear ladened stimulated state , back to a capacity of thinking straight and finding logic during stressful moments .
They are simple practices that you can take into your day and deploy when needed .
I concluded Master Training with the Yamabushi in Japan .
These spiritual and mystical mountain hermits provided guidance to Samurai warriors in the shogun era .
I am lucky to be one of the few Westerners to have been trained by these wise and reclusive sages .

I will help you with your awareness of your stress response and triggers .
Unless you are an experienced meditator , trying to meditate for long periods of time whilst your body feels like it is on a war setting , is incredibly difficult to do .
I hope that by deploying some of these simple breathing exercises to help with anxiety , it may lead some people to evolve a greater mindfulness practice when this crisis passes .
We meet as a community each morning at 7 am online .
When you sit with me for 25 minutes , you are being joined by other like-minded people , who are also sitting , holding the same intention , and creating a sense of compassion within our group .
During the guidance , I also share some tips around self-care , the nervous system , nourishing the mind and body , and how to tackle the monkey mind .
Some simple ideas around the language we need to use with ourselves and our children during these times .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vocabulary to articulate how they feel .
We discuss active listening and finding a space to meet them on their level .
I have taught global leaders , professional athletes and entrepreneurs how to hold their nerve and find a sense of calmness in the most turbulent of storms .
Right now you can not change the direction of this storm , nor can you influence how the wind will blow , but you can find shelter , you can navigate your emotions , and in time this storm will pass .
Start your day with us at 7 am , give yourself 25 minutes to connect to your body , to find a grounding before stepping into your day .
My time from 7 to 7 .
am is being offered to you .
I hope you use it and come sit with our tribe .
Having survived watching my son die , I found that the human spirit has a capacity to overcome even the most difficult of circumstances .
We will come through this together .
