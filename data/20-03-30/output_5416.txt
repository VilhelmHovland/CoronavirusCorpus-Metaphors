Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that he was told to prepare the national capital for a ' stage-3 ' -like situation anytime soon , the Indian Express reported on Saturday .
Stage 3 is when the novel coronavirus , COVID-19 , is spread through the community .
So far , Delhi has reported 40 cases .
Of these , 30 cases were of individuals who had come from abroad .
The remaining 10 were through community spread .
Last week , the Indian Council of Medical Research chief ( ICMR ) addressed a press conference , where he said that India had not reached Stage 3 as yet , but cautioned people from venturing outside their homes .
This press conference , notably , was before Prime Minister Narendra Modi issued a 21-day lockdown of India on Tuesday night .
So far , India has reported 887 cases and 20 deaths .
However , this number could be far more than what data suggests due to the lack of testing facilities available for everybody .
On Friday , Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba , the country 's senior-most bureaucrat , in a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a gap between the number of international passengers who need to be monitored by the States /UTs and the actual number of passengers being monitored .
He said , " We initiated screening of international incoming passengers at the airports with effect from 18th January 2020 .
I have been informed that upto 23rd March 2020 , cumulatively , Bureau of immigration has shared details of more than 15 lakh incoming international passengers with the States/UTs for monitoring for COVID-19 .
However , there appears to be a gap between the number of International passengers who need to be monitored by the States /UTs and ihe actual number of passengers being monitored .
"  Gauba further added that this may seriously jeopardise India 's efforts to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus , which has claimed the lives of 24,136 people and infected 537,569 globally so far .
