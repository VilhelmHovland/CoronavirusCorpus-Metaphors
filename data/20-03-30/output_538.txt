A second wave of Connecticut school districts returned to the classroom Monday , albeit virtually , introducing students to innovative ways of learning amid the coronavirus outbreak .
School staff in New Haven and Hartford made their final pushes last week to get thousands of electronic devices into the hands of students before launching online education programs Monday .
While a number of suburban districts went online last week , New Haven , Hartford and other larger districts spent the week addressing such obstacles as an uneven access to technology and high-speed internet .

The district , like others , has been sharing information with families about free internet available through service providers like Comcast and Xfinity .

"  Torres-Rodriguez said the district has 80 employees who are tasked with trouble shooting technology-related issues for families .
Those employees received about 2,000 inquiries since Friday , she said , and the district is still working with some families to get them devices and access to the internet .
" I feel confident that we 'll meet the needs of all of our students , " she said .
Milly Arciniegas , executive director of Parent University , a Hartford non-profit that empowers parents to help their children receive an education , said Monday that about 2,000 Hartford families still need devices for online learning .
She said her organization took calls all day Monday from parents who were having issues with passwords , access to online classrooms and other matters .
" I 'm not surprised , but if I see that percentage at the end of the week I 'll be more concerned , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them learn how to access online learning , Arciniegas said .
She estimated that it could be more than a week before all the issues were resolved , but added that she felt Torres-Rodriguez was doing the best she could in a difficult situation and involving parents in the process .

The district did a sweeping survey of families in the district and the roughly 12,500 responses showed that more than 70 percent of students do not have laptops or computers at home .
" We know that some of the students may not have the devices they need , but we are doing our best to support our families , " Superintendent Ilene Tracey said .
" We know this is an unsettling time and want to assure you that our goal is to keep student learning and emotional well-being at the forefront of our minds as we implement these plans and structures , " school administrators wrote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week , teachers will not be posting mandatory assignments , the letter said , but rather will be determining how the digital classroom will work for students .
Every student in the district has a Chromebook to use .

The self-paced work will be supplemented with materials provided by teachers as well as video conferences with teachers and virtual small group discussions and mini lessons .
In Regional School District 6 , which includes the towns of Warren , Morris and Goshen , schools Superintendent Christopher Leone said the eight-school district had 95 percent attendance on the first day of distance learning , including two schools that were at 100 percent .
Leone said there were some issues with log-ins , connectivity and some students needing devices , but added that administrators , teachers and families were working together to solve any problems .
In Bloomfield , which also launched Monday , parents were largely pleased with the results , attributing the smooth start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school officials .
" Our experience has been fantastic from the start .
The communication between administrators , teachers and my children has been nothing short of amazing , " said Marianne Beman Stone .
" This morning was trying .
But mostly because of my children 's frustration with all the newness and trying to figure things out .
"  Bloomfield Schools Superintendent James Thompson said Monday that it took a " herculean effort to develop this comprehensive online curriculum in such a short time period .
"  " Long hours .
Spirited conversations .
Collaboration .
This was a true team effort .
I want to commend the Bloomfield Public Schools family for pulling together in this time of uncertainty , " Thompson said .

We got to see what Google classroom looks like for a first-grader , " she said .
" For a first grader , what I like is that instead of saying on Mondays we 're doing this and this , they give you the whole week .
So you can figure out when to do things .

I worry I 'm not going to do enough with it .
