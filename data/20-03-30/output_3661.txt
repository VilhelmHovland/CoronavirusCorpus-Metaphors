Former NFL wide receiver Orlando McDaniel has died from the coronavirus at age 59 , Louisiana State University announced .
McDaniel , a star hurdler during his college days at LSU , died on Friday after becoming ill when he returned home to Dallas from Washington DC , his LSU athletics coach , Dennis Shaver , told the Baton Rouge Advocate newspaper .
McDaniel was selected by the Denver Broncos with the 50th pick in the 1982 NFL Draft .
He played three games for Denver that season but failed to make a catch in his lone NFL campaign .
In 1980 , McDaniel was the US college national runner-up in the 110m hurdles but never had a chance at the Olympics that year because of the American boycott of the Moscow Games .
Coaches do n't just prepare athletes to compete , they prepare them for life .
All of N Texas will feel the loss of Coach McDaniel to COVID-19 , but my heart goes out especially to the young women he coached to greatness .
Thank you for the lives you touched .
