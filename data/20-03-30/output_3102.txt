Tablighi Jamaat members continue to defy lockdowns  Pakistani passengers sit atop buses as they make their way home from the three-day annual Tablighi Ijtema religious gathering in Raiwind on the outskirts of Lahore on November 6 , 2016 .
( File photo : AFP )  Two deaths from coronavirus have been directly linked to one of Pakistan 's largest annual religious gatherings in Raiwind -- but the group that organises it has not reined in its preachers .
Each year , the Tablighi Jamaat holds several massive gatherings or ijtimas on the outskirts of Lahore .
This year an estimated 250,000 men converged there on March 11 , despite warnings from the Punjab government as COVID-19 was spreading .
The ijtima was suspended the next day , but rain was given as the official reason .
By March 29 , tests came positive for the virus in 27 members of the Jamaat , Dawn newspaper reported .
And after another member , a young Chinese man , was also diagnosed with coronavirus , at least 200 people were placed in isolation at Hyderabad city 's Noor Mosque in Wahdat Colony .
Health officials had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mosque to collect nasal swabs .
The Sindh health department has confirmed that at least 36 of them were diagnosed with the virus .
When more than a dozen members of the Tablighi Jamaat tested positive in Islamabad last week , several parts of the city were sealed , Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat confirmed to SAMAA Digital .
By Monday , March 30 , one man who had attended the Raiwind ijtima and another , whose son had attended it , were both dead in Karachi .
The spokesperson for Sindh 's health minister , Meeran Yousuf , confirmed this .
The government swung into action and contacted the leaders of the Jamaat in Raiwind .
The Jamaat then issued orders , telling members to suspend their activities across the country .
But despite the orders , some of its local groups are still roaming freely , violating the lockdowns instituted in the provinces .
For example , a Karachi-based journalist , who has family in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 's Mardan , told SAMAA Digital that groups of up to nine men had been visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locals contacted them and said they should stop , " the journalist said .
" They refused to stop preaching and said , ' Ye sab dollar ka chakkar hai .
drama hai ( this is all about the dollar rate .
it is staged ) .
"  In response , Mardan 's administration quarantined at least 169 people at the Tableeghi Jamaat 's markaz in the city .
Deputy Commissioner Abid Khan Wazir told reporters Monday that three foreigners have been tested positive for the virus .
The leaders of the Tablighi Jamaat do not speak to the media and thus it was not possible to seek their comment .
But Abdul Jabbar Nasir , who has been reporting on religious groups for years , shed light on their network and reach , saying that while its markaz or headquarters is located in Raiwind , mosques in several areas across Pakistan also function as local markazes .
So even if Raiwind shuts down preaching , this does not mean satellite mosques are following suit .
Islamic worshippers wait for transport before their departure to their home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the outskirts of Lahore on March 13 , 2020 .
( AFP )  " For example , members of the Tablighi Jamaat in Karachi gather in Karachi 's Madni Masjid on Thursday , " said Nasir .
" There , groups are made and responsibilities are handed out .
"  One person is made an emir of a group which then departs for three- or ten-day trips to proselytise .
Nasir believes that sometimes groups in far-flung areas are difficult to communicate with and it could take hours or days to send them a message .
" There is no mechanism to contact groups across the country but every single person takes responsibility and conveys the message to their contacts .
"  The coronavirus has killed at least 21 people in Pakistan and 1,625 people have tested positive so far .
