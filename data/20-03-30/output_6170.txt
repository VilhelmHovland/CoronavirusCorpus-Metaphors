SIGN UP TO PEDESTRIAN DAILY  Thanks for signing up !  To recognise and appreciate all the bloody hard work that workers are doing to keep the country ticking over and all of us safe and fed during the Coronavirus pandemic , Fishbowl want to start gifting free feeds to those absolute legends on the frontline  The Feed The Front Line initiative kicked off on Thursday evening , where Fishbowl fans can snap a photo of themselves with their delivered meal , and then post it on Instagram tagging both Fishbowl and the #feedthefrontline hashtag .
If you get the attention of the ' bowl team with your fancy content skills , they 'll take the bait and slide into your DMs to organise a food drop off to your front-liner mate of choice .

Make a nice and attractive lure out of a selfie where you 're precariously balancing a poke bowl on your head or something , wave it around in front of the catch , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and bam , you 're feeding yourself and a friend for dinner .
And if you think about it , we all know a frontline worker legend , surely .
Those in the essential services like supermarkets , petrol stations , pharmacies , bottle shops , hospitals and medial centres .
People like garbos , tradies , posties , delivery drivers , ride-share drivers , hell even get the name of your food delivery person and nominate them for a feed if they 're into it .

Plenty of other initiatives like BuyThemACoffee and Doctors Without Babysitters have started up in the era of social distancing and self-isolation , to get us helping each other out during the pandemic .
So if you ca n't feed the frontline , there 's definitely plenty of ways you can be a helping hand from afar .
