South Korea 's emergency exercise in December facilitated coronavirus testing , containment  A South Korean tabletop exercise on emergency responses to a fictional mysterious outbreak led directly to tools the country deployed less than a month later to manage the arrival and spread of the coronavirus , one of the experts involved said .
According to an undisclosed government document seen by Reuters , on Dec .
17 two dozen leading South Korean infectious diseases specialists tackled a worrying scenario : a South Korean family contracts pneumonia after a trip to China , where cases of an unidentified disease had arisen .
The hypothetical disease quickly spreads among the colleagues of the family members and medical workers who treated them .
In response , the team of experts at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( KCDC ) developed an algorithm to find the pathogen and its origin , as well as testing techniques .
Those measures were mobilized in real life when a first suspected coronavirus patient appeared in South Korea on Jan .
20 , the document said .
" Looking back over the past 20 years , humans were most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively doing well on influenza but had been worried about the possibility of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus , " said Lee Sang-won , one of the KCDC experts who led the drill .
" It was blind luck - we were speechless to see the scenario become reality , " Lee added .
" But the exercise helped us save much time developing testing methodology and identifying cases .
"  The exercise played a key role in slowing what became Asia 's largest coronavirus epidemic outside China using aggressive and sustained testing .
After a big early outbreak , South Korea rolled out widespread testing within days , launching an extensive program to test people who do not have symptoms but may be able to infect others , isolate confirmed patients and trace their contacts .
The country won praise for containing the spread of the disease with comparatively little disruption .
It has 9,583 cases and 158 deaths , and managed to bring the daily tally of new infections to about 100 or fewer for the past three weeks .
The KCDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of study group , had wanted to boost large-scale DNA analysis capabilities after the organization earned much public criticism for its handling of a 2015 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome .
Soon after the drill , the coronavirus epidemic emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan , prompting the experts to begin considering that it might be a novel coronavirus .
Even before Beijing officially declared it , the South Korean team was ready to begin testing , Lee said .
The document also showed the KCDC established testing methodology on Jan .
4 , three days before Chinese authorities identified the virus , and started testing suspected cases on Jan .
By early March , South Korea was capable of running as many as 20,000 tests a day , with five firms churning out kits for domestic use and export .
" We might be a bit overreacting at that time with just a few domestic infections , but there were substantial possibilities it would reach pandemic levels indeed , " Lee said .
" Have we done well ? I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went through in 2015 - our motto was ' never again .
