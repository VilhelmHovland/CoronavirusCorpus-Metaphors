There 's little point in trying to whitewash things : the human race is in a difficult moment .
We 're trying to cope with something that we do n't have a whole lot of experience in coping with .
Every culture handles adversity in its own unique way .
It 's been incredible to realise that in Ireland we have a reservoir of strength to draw from when things get hairy .
It 's called culture .
People pay it lip service , others moan about all the funding it gets .
Maybe it 's only when things get bad that we as a society can fully appreciate how much we value it and actually need it to function as a peope .
Is n't it amazing , for instance , that there exists in this country a succinct , accessibly , lyrical and poignant poetic expression of the philosophical mantra ' this too shall pass ' .
It 's called ' Everything Is Going To Be All Right ' by the poet Derek Mahon .
Maybe you 've heard it on Morning Ireland in the last week , or at the end of Six One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have ' moments ' , but Mahon 's work has become wonderfully resonant at this trying time .
A poem : ' Everything is going to be all right '  Amid the sad news and anxiety the Covid-19 crisis is causing us all , here are words from one of Ireland 's most famous poets , Derek Mahon **26;3902;TOOLONG  ' Everything Is Going To Be All Right ' is a poem that admits that hardship and mortality are a part of life ( There will be dying , there will be dying / but there is no need to go into that .
) but that the beauty of the world has a power of its own ( The sun rises in spite of everything/and the far cities are beautiful and bright .
) It 's not trying to dodge reality or sugarcoat existence , but just remind us all that there is beauty all around us .
Even its title is reassuring .

Incredibly , many have already made work in preparation of this fraught moment .
We just needed to open our ears .
