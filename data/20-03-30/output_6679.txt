Trump says he does n't speak with ' nasty ' governors but it does n't affect the federal COVID-19 response  Last week on Sean Hannity 's Fox News show , President Trump said he doubted New York really needed all the ventilators they are requesting from the federal stockpile so hospitals can treat the tragic influx of COVID-19 patients .
In a press conference Sunday , PBS NewsHour 's Yamiche Alcindor asked Trump about how those comments might affect the parceling out of the federal stockpiles to states .
Trump incorrectly claimed he " did n't say that , " told Alcindor to " be nice -- do n't be threatening , " then , after letting her finish the question , said it would n't affect how the equipment is distributed .
Trump shared an anecdote about sending " generators " to New York and suggested they disappeared from the warehouse .
" When journalists get up and ask questions that are so threatening , " Trump said , and Alcindor cut in : " I was quoting you directly from your interview with Sean Hannity .
" She tried to ask a second question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on CNN 's Jeremy Diamond later , Diamond gave the mic to Alcindor to ask her follow-up , which was about deaths from the economic shutdown versus COVID-19 .
Diamond then questioned if Trump was envisioning suggesting a regional relaxation of social distancing before April 30 -- Trump said no -- and asked about Trump 's comments to governors on Friday : " You said , ' I want them to be appreciative .
' You also said , ' if they do n't treat you right , I do n't call .
' " " I did n't say that , " Trump said .
" These are direct quotes , sir , " Diamond replied , reading the full quote .
Trump quibbled with the " appreciative " quote but agreed he does n't speak with certain governors , like the " nasty " Jay Inslee : " I do n't like the governor of Washington , so do you know who calls ? I get Mike Pence to call , I get the head of FEMA to call .
" He added that he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's response , and called CNN " fake news .
" Watch the entire exchanges below , on CNN .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sharpened her criticism of President Trump 's early dismissal of the coronavirus , saying the delay cost American lives .

Dr Marc Lipsitch : What makes seasonal viruses seasonal is a combination of opportunities for transmission -- whether school is in term , which facilitates transmission -- and what proportion of the population is immune , combined with weather .
Humidity is lower in the winter , which is good for transmission .
Low humidity makes virus-carrying droplets settle more slowly because they shrink to smaller sizes and then friction keeps them in the air , whereas high humidity does n't do that .
