Tinubu says he did n't call for printing of more naira notes  Erstwhile governor of Lagos State and All Progressives Congress ( APC ) leader , Bola Ahmed Tinubu , has debunked the reports making the rounds that he called on the Nigerian Government to print more Naira notes .
Tinubu said in a statement that his comment was " misunderstood and misreported .
"  He said he rather enjoined the Nigerian Government not to refrain from spending as much money as possible in safeguarding the economy from the headwinds of the COVID-19 outbreak .
He said " in the statement , I provided , among other things , my thoughts on the economic impact of COVID-19 across the world and in Nigeria .
" I believe that the virus has the potential to be a grave economic threat to our nation .
Knowing this , I decided to use the platform to make known my thoughts should it become necessary for the government to act .
" Thankfully , we have not seen the worst of the virus but we must be bold and we must be prepared should the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I included nine specific recommendations for the government to consider , to boost confidence , protect vulnerable citizens and safeguard our economy .
" These were : ( i ) maintaining ( or expanding ) present levels of government spending ; ( ii ) focusing expenditure on public infrastructure and transportation ( if the virus does not hit strongly ) and health care ( if it does ) ; ( iii ) tax reduction and VAT suspension ; ( iv ) food security ; ( v ) lower interest rates ; ( vi ) quantitative easing by the CBN to prop up the financial markets ; ( vii ) exchange rate flexibility ; ( viii ) debt suspension to support individuals and the private sector ; and ( ix ) direct economic support for the poor .
" The core principle underpinning all of the above is that the Federal Government must adopt a countercyclical fiscal policy and should not be afraid to spend as much naira as is required to protect the economy .
" One thing I absolutely did not call for was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Such a suggestion is extremely far-fetched and has never been on my mind .
" It is unfortunate that my prescriptions were so badly misunderstood and misreported .
" To be clear , I do not want , nor am I calling for , the Federal Government to print a single new naira note .
" What I do want is for the government to meet the coming economic challenges with a swift , bold and effective spending plan .
" Those who , until now , would spend their time beating up on straw men should give us their own plans .
If , that is , they even have any .
