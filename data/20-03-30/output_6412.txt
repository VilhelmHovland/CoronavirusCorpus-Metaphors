NEW YORK ( AP ) -- A Navy hospital ship with 1,000 beds arrived Monday in New York City as the number of deaths in the state from the coronavirus outbreak climbed quickly .
The disease continued to claim the lives of health care workers .
Mayor Bill de Blasio said President Donald Trump 's suggestion that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals is " insulting " to front-line medical workers .
The latest coronavirus developments in New York :  -- -- --  SHIP ARRIVES AS TOLL RISES  A Navy hospital ship docked in New York City on Monday as the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the state soared to a " beyond staggering " 1,218 .
The 1,000-bed USNS Comfort will be used as a " relief valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed hospitals handle people with COVID-19 , Gov .
Andrew Cuomo said .
Shortly after it arrived at a Manhattan pier , the governor announced that the statewide death toll had risen by 253 in a single day .
" That 's a lot of loss , that 's a lot of pain , that 's a lot of tears , that 's a lot of grief that people all across this state are feeling , " Cuomo said .
Most of the state 's fatalities have occurred in just the past 10 days .
Cuomo said the ultimate number of COVID-19-related deaths will be staggering , then added : " To me , we 're beyond staggering already .
"  The Comfort , which was also sent to New York after the 9/11 terror attacks , has 12 operating rooms that could be up and running within 24 hours , officials said .
The ship is docked just north of a temporary hospital constructed inside the cavernous Jacob K .
Javits Convention Center .
State and city officials are trying to increase hospital capacity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We bring a message to all New Yorkers -- now , your Navy is returned and we are with you committed in this fight , " said Rear Admiral John Mustin .
There are 9,500 people in New York currently hospitalized for COVID-19 , with more than 2,300 in intensive care .
More than 66,000 New Yorkers have tested positive for the virus .
-- -- --  TEMPORARY MORGUES  As the outbreak has worsened , some hospitals are now parking refrigerated trailers outside their doors to collect the remains of the dead .
At two Brooklyn hospitals , videos posted online by bystanders and a medical worker showed workers wearing protective masks and gowns loading bodies onto trailers from gurneys parked on the sidewalk .
The office of the city 's medical examiner confirmed on Monday that it has started using a temporary morgue set up last week in Manhattan to provide emergency capacity as the city 's permanent morgues fill up .
The site near Bellevue Hospital includes a large tent and refrigeration units .
The U .
military has sent 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office deal with an influx of bodies .
Thomas Von Essen , the regional administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , said Monday his agency was also providing refrigeration trucks to the city .
" We in New York City have a desperate need for help over in Queens , " said Von Essen , who was the city 's fire commissioner on Sept .
11 , 2001 .
" And we are working on that as we speak , there 's folks trying to put it all together .
"  Queens has been the hardest hit of the five boroughs , with an outsized number of coronavirus cases and deaths .
-- -- --  THE TOLL  Two more New York City health care workers have died of the coronavirus , days after the first confirmed death .
De Blasio announced Sunday the deaths of Freda Ocran , a psych educator at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx , and Theresa Lococo , a pediatric nurse at Kings County Hospital .
Ocran was previously the head nurse of the psych unit at Jacobi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother in Africa , de Blasio said .
On March 20 , Ocran changed her profile picture on Facebook to include a mantra familiar to people on the front lines of the coronavirus fight : " I ca n't stay home .
I 'm a healthcare worker .
"  Dr .
James T .
Goodrich , a pediatric neurosurgeon who once led a team of 40 doctors at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx in an operation to separate 13-month-old twin boys conjoined at the head , died of complications related to coronavirus on Monday .
" His expertise and ability were second only to his kind heart and manner , " Montefiore Medicine CEO Dr .
Philip Ozuah said in a statement .
The hospital did n't say if Goodrich had recently treated people with COVID-19 .

of the approximately 36,000-person force .
In all , 930 members of the department have tested positive for the disease .
Several have died , including a school safety agent who perished Sunday , a detective and two other civilian workers .
-- -- --  MEDICAL MASKS  De Blasio and others criticized Trump for suggesting with no clear evidence that thousands of medical masks are disappearing from New York City hospitals .
At a Sunday briefing , the president told reporters they should be asking , " Where are the masks going ? Are they going out the back door ? "  Those remarks are " insulting " to hospital workers on the front lines of the city 's coronavirus crisis , de Blasio said Monday .
" It 's incredibly insensitive to people right now who are giving their all , " he said .
" I do n't know what the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on during the outbreak to not take masks home with them , but no evidence has emerged of large-scale looting of supplies .
Kenneth Raske , president of the Greater New York Hospital Association , said in a statement that the workers " deserve better " than the president 's comment .
" If he wants to make an accusation , then let him make an accusation , " Cuomo said .
" But I do n't know what he 's trying to say by inference .
