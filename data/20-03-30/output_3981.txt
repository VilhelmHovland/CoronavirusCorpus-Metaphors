Grocery workers are putting themselves at risk for us ; it 's time we thanked them  Doctors , nurses and medical workers are all deserving of the ' hero ' title .
But there are those working closer to home that deserve our thanks too  It 's become a bit of a painful ordeal to have to go out for groceries these days .
The prep of a mask or scarf to cover my face , the social-distancing queuing , the panicked avoidance of other shoppers and the hand washing that happens immediately afterwards all makes for a pretty anxiety-filled experience .
I prefer to get what I need and get out , and avoid supermarkets for the majority of my week .
Thankfully , I have the freedom to do that .
But if I worked there , it would n't be so simple .
Since the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak , retail workers in supermarkets and grocers ( which have become ever-more popular as people realise their necessity ) have been put under increasing pressure .
Their job to provide the public with essential supplies has become , well , more essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic-buying that many of us have engaged in .
Front line  Advertisement  Grocery workers are now , quite literally , in the front line in the fight against coronavirus .
They are keeping one of the final industries that is still open for business alive , and keeping all of us customers alive too .
Retail workers have to go into work every day and put themselves and their families in danger of catching Covid-19 -- they have to deal with hundreds of members of the public every day , work closely with surfaces that may be harbouring the virus , and deal with demand for products that has never been as high before .
They have to do this while trying to keep themselves healthy , and constantly worrying about the family members they may be putting at risk just by going into work .
The general public are rude at the best of times -- some treat retail workers as if they 're beneath them .
They take the term ' unskilled worker ' to mean ' undeserving of basic decency ' and spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregard for the workers who are serving them .
During this crisis , I can only imagine how those behaviours have been heightened .
I can only imagine how much harder it is to deal with if you 're a retail worker right now .
' Unskilled '  We congratulate the doctors and nurses , and clap the members of the HSE who put their lives on the line for us , as we absolutely should -- they are heroes and deserve to be lauded as such .
But the so-called ' unskilled workers ' , whose ' unskilled ' skills became essential pretty damn quick when all this started , deserve appreciation too .
Food and cleaning products and medication are of huge importance at a time like this -- the people who give us access to these things should be thanked , not cast aside and ignored .
When I cast my mind back to when I last held a retail job , I was in college .
I worked in an off-license part-time for about three years to fund my social life .
I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just using it as a way to make extra money .
If I had been in that position , and had suddenly been thrust into a global crisis situation , where my job became paramount to people 's safety and survival , I do n't know how I would have coped with it .
Where every day in work would be like the lead-up to Christmas , except there was no excitement , no light at the end of the tunnel , and I also had to sanitise everything in sight , I do n't know how I would have dealt with it .
The pressure and the confusion and the anxiety would have been a lot to take on -- and that 's what grocery workers are now feeling every single day .
We could all do with being a little kinder , showing a little more appreciation .
The next time you go to the supermarket , instead of grabbing all the toilet roll on the shelf and shoving your way to the queue , maybe ask the person at the till how they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate what they 're doing .
If it makes even a small difference to their day , it 's worth it .
