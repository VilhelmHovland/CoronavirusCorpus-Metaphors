Some of the world 's most valuable works of art are trapped in Australia , unable to return to their home institutions around the globe because of coronavirus .
And some of Australia 's most valuable works are similarly trapped overseas .
" We have nearly 100 Matisse and Picasso works here from 23 lenders around the world , the Tate in London , the Met in New York , and the Musee Picasso in Paris among them , " says Nick Mitzevich , director of the National Gallery of Art in Canberra .
The NGA is where the Matisse &amp; Picasso blockbuster was due to close on April 13 before the pandemic forced the gallery to shut its doors early .

But moving these works around the globe is a complicated and costly business .

" They are couriered , and the couriers are conservators , they look after the work .
" If you 're coming from London or Paris or New York to Australia , it 's always at least two flights , so you have to check the work into one aircraft and then switch it to another .
And the crates ca n't be left sitting in a shed or on the tarmac or anything like that , because of concerns about temperature and humidity , which are the great enemies .
It 's important there 's close scrutiny of every moment of the transportation of these works .
"  The paintings ca n't go anywhere without a human being by their side .
And because human beings ca n't go anywhere right now , nor can the paintings .
It flows both ways .

" At the moment our Francis Bacon is in Houston , our Monet haystack is in Germany , our Monet waterlilies is at the Queensland Art Gallery , and our Ned Kelly series is in Cairns , " Mitzevich says .
The NGA is not alone .
The National Gallery of Victoria has confirmed its Keith Haring/Jean-Michel Basquiat : Crossing Lines exhibition is still in Australia .
The Art Gallery of New South Wales has declined to reveal whether or not it currently holds any major works from abroad , citing security concerns .
This is not the first time major artworks have been held hostage to fortune in this country .
It 's not even the first time Picasso and Matisse have found themselves in such a predicament .
In 1939 , Sir Keith Murdoch -- father of Rupert -- sponsored an exhibition of contemporary artwork from Europe through his Herald Newspaper Group .
Known as The Herald Exhibition of French and British Contemporary Art , the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macquarie Galleries and a sometime art critic for Murdoch 's Melbourne Herald -- and consisted of 217 works : 189 paintings , 16 works on paper , and 12 pieces of sculpture .
There were four works by Georges Braques , six by Pierre Bonnard , seven by Paul Cezanne , eight by Henri Matisse and Vincent Van Gogh , and nine by Paul Gauguin and Pablo Picasso .
The entire exhibition was insured for ? 200,000 -- approximately $17 .
million in today 's money .
For that sum , you would now be lucky to pick up a single painting from the NGA 's Matisse &amp; Picasso show .
The Herald exhibition opened in Adelaide in August 1939 , at the National Art Gallery of South Australia .
In October , it moved to Melbourne Town Hall because the National Gallery of Victoria could find no room on its walls .
Then it travelled to Sydney where the insult was even greater .
The Art Gallery of New South Wales declined to hang the show , ostensibly because people had to pay to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely because the gallery 's trustees did n't much rate it .
Instead , it hung on the top floor of David Jones ' George Street store .
According to art historian Steven Miller , head of library services at the AGNSW and co-author ( with Eileen Chanin ) of the book Degenerates and Perverts , the works had been sourced by Burdett from " 80 or 90 different places " .
When war broke out in September 1939 , returning them became impossible .
These days there is no chance a public institution would fail to see the worth of a painting such as Pablo Picasso 's portrait of Lee Miller .
Kurtz  Legend has it that once the exhibition had finished its tour the works languished in storage for the rest of the war .
Robert Hughes wrote in his 1966 book The Art of Australia that the paintings were " kept in their crates until 1946 and not shown at all , half in the basement of the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the other half in the National Gallery of Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chanin , it was not these cutting-edge European works that were packed away for safekeeping ( in case of bombing ) in what was known as Operation Hush Hush , but the local permanent collections of the state galleries .
" Bare gallery walls were then periodically hung with paintings from the Herald exhibition , " they wrote in their 2005 book .
" Minor paintings from Australian collections were carefully protected , whilst works by Picasso , Braque and Van Gogh were left to their fate .
"  Loading  Selections from the exhibition in fact toured Australia continuously throughout the war , making it as far as Launceston and Hobart in May 1945 before finishing up in Brisbane in October .
Some 70,000 people saw the pictures , many of which were for sale , as they travelled the country but the collecting institutions remained largely immune to their charms .
" None of the galleries bought major works , though they were there , absolutely , and they would now be worth a fortune , " says Miller .
" There were some very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  The AGNSW did purchase eight works for a total of around ? 2500 , including what it believed was a painting by Gauguin ( for ? 1500 ) ; it later turned out to be by another artist , Charles Camoin .
" Camoin is a recognised artist , he does have value , but it 's in the thousands , " says Miller .
" If it really was a Gauguin it would be in the millions .
"  The NGV , though , was especially unimpressed .
Despite having the greatest acquisition fund in the country through its Felton Bequest , it bought just two works -- Felix Vallotton 's Le Point du Jour for ? 108 and Vincent Van Gogh 's Portrait of a Man for ? 2196 .
The latter was declared a fake by the gallery in 2007 , effectively reducing its then value from $5 million to almost nothing .
Among the works that could have been purchased at the time were Cezanne 's nature painting Sous-Bois ( c 1885 ) for ? 5522 ; Bonnard 's Prairie Aux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's La Table De Marbre ( 1925 ) for ? 850 ; and a Marc Chagall painting of flowers for just ? 165 .
Of course , it 's easy to be wise in retrospect , and in purchasing what they thought were works by Van Gogh and Gauguin the major galleries showed they at least had half a clue .
As for the works now stuck in Canberra , it 's highly unlikely any will be offered for sale , and almost certain that none will suddenly become available at a bargain price .
They 're merely enjoying an extended holiday abroad .
" I describe this as a bit of pause and a bit of postponement , that 's all , " says Mitzevich .
" The show still goes on , it just does n't go on exactly as we had planned .
