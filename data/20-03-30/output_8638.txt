NJ 's local health departments have been underfunded for years .
Now they 're playing catch-up  New Jersey 's patchwork of nearly 100 local , regional and county health departments is now the state 's front line of defense against a public health outbreak .
But these critical departments have been underfunded for decades , and no longer receive the amount of state backing they used to .
And while the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing is conducted and community spread occurs , local health officials ' workloads increase along with it .
" I can assure you that the local health officials are overwhelmed , " said Judith Persichilli , New Jersey 's state health commissioner .
" Some municipalities are in shared services , so they 're covering perhaps two municipalities .
Every day they work tirelessly , boots on the ground , to investigate cases , identify contacts , and take the appropriate public health actions .
"  That means the state has to get creative .
At the end of March , students from the Rutgers School of Public Health were deployed to help local officials with their growing workload of interviews and site visits , Persichilli said .
New Jersey is not alone .
Since 2008 , local health departments nationally lost around a quarter of their workforce , or about 60,000 workers , according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials ( NACCHO ) , a Washington , D .
organization representing 2,800 local public health departments in the U .
" There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Adriane Casalotti of NACCHO .
" The work is so often behind the scenes when you 're keeping people from not being sick , it 's easy to take for granted that that work is getting done .
"  When there is n't a crisis , officials promote healthy habits to reduce underlying health risks that leave communities vulnerable when something like COVID-19 strikes .
But the Garden State has ranked low compared with other states , according to a 2016 national survey from NACCHO .
New Jersey fell in the lowest quarter of spending per person by local health departments .
On average , the state spent less than $30 per person , compared with New York or Maryland , which spent more than $70 , Casalotti said .
On top of that , the biggest checks local health departments rely on from the federal government , from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's emergency preparedness budget , have been drastically cut in recent years .
NACCHO estimates that the budget has been slashed by one-third since 2001 .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's particularly more when you have measles outbreaks and the coronavirus , when you have historic rates of sexually transmitted diseases and Hepatitis A .
All of these things are piling on a system that has been chronically underfunded , " Casalotti said .
That means the state is playing catch-up .

Phil Murphy said he keeps pressing the federal government for more help and personal protective equipment for the state 's health care workers , but has received a fraction of what he requested .
To be sure , FEMA officials will staff testing centers and bring their own specimen collection kits and gear so New Jersey can save the state 's diminishing stockpile of those items .
New Jersey got $14 million from the CDC out of the $8 .
billion funding bill President Donald Trump signed on March 6 , 2020 , on top of $1 .
million in initial funding .
And New Jersey will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest federal stimulus bill , which Trump signed Friday .
The state will be eligible for at least $15 .
million from the CDC Public Health Emergency Preparedness fund to buy " personal protective equipment , laboratory testing to detect positive cases , infection control and mitigation at the local level to prevent the spread of the virus , and other public health preparedness and response activities , " according to estimates from the staff of U .
Sens .
Bob Menendez and Cory Booker .
New Jersey is also eligible to apply for more funding from a separate $750 million fund , and may also be able to draw more from other pots of money , like the state stabilization fund , FEMA disaster assistance and health care grants .
To put that in perspective , as of March 10 , New Jersey was spending more than $1 .
million per month to respond to the novel coronavirus , according to congressional testimony from New Jersey 's assistant commissioner of health , Christopher Neuwirth .
And confirmed cases of COVID-19 have only grown since then .
Snapshot of Bergen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state .
Take Bergen County .
The county has 70 municipalities .
Some of them , like Hackensack and Englewood , run their own health departments .
The county 's health officer , Hansel Asmar , provides some or all of those services for 35 other towns .
Two regional health commissioners handle another 27 towns .
Bergen has become the epicenter of New Jersey 's coronavirus outbreak : It had the state 's first confirmed positive case and since then has had more cases than any other county .
Of the state 's 13,386 positive cases , 2,169 are Bergen County residents , or close to a fifth of New Jersey 's total as of Sunday .
The county with the next-highest number is Essex , with 1,227 cases .
Story continues below chart  Loading .
The county 's health department budget was $19 .
million in 2019 , 3% of total county spending .
Its share of the budget is virtually unchanged from a decade ago .
Payroll records show Asmar oversees a staff of nearly 400 .
Asmar 's office directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not respond to requests for comment .
James Fedorko , the health officer for Englewood , told NorthJersey .
that county officials are working at a disadvantage during a public health emergency like this .
" They have a little bit more resources , but it must be very difficult , " Fedorko said .
" I know everybody here in town .
I know the key players .
I ca n't imagine how they 're keeping track of everything .
"  Fedorko describes being inundated with work as his department was tasked with finding every known contact of Englewood residents who contracted COVID-19 .
This city of 27,000 has 13 health workers , the highest of any Bergen town other than Hackensack .
The Health Department was " managing " when it had fewer cases , Fedorko said , but had to hire an extra public health nurse as the number of cases rose .
The city had 118 confirmed positive cases as of Saturday .

Today Network  Dr .
Aliza Solomon , president of the Englewood Board of Health , noted that health departments ca n't shift entirely to coronavirus response .
They must still issue birth and death certificates , conduct restaurant inspections , field calls from businesses asking about the latest news on what can and ca n't stay open .
The county was hampered by the sheer number of autonomous health departments , which must report to the state but do not have to report to the county , according to Freeholder Chairwoman Mary Amoroso .
She thinks a countywide system would have made matters less complicated .
" You 're not going to be able to tell any municipality that they ca n't have their own health official , but I think we probably need better reporting links , sanctified reporting links that those local health officials would report to the county , " she said .
The problem with state support  Local health departments rely primarily on property taxes , while the state and federal dollars try to fill in the gaps .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health comes from competitive grant funding for specific programs , meaning those dollars are not guaranteed and need to be fought for year after year .
" Why does that make a difference ? It would protect municipalities when you make a property tax cap , so localities have to tighten their belts , " said George DiFerdinando , former acting commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services in the early 2000s .
For the current fiscal year through June and Murphy 's proposed budget for the coming year , the state appropriated $2 .
million for " public health infectious disease control , " which explicitly would go to local health departments in case of an outbreak .
Last November , 21 local health departments received $95,000 each , and $350,000 was divvied up in grants for 73 local departments for training scholarships .
But before these two budgets , Treasury officials could not find a direct line appropriation for local health departments .
" We have n't had an overall big chunk of state funding since 2011 , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local Boards of Health Association , which represents 3,200 elected or appointed board of health members .
" When you make a grant competitive , it does n't always go to the right people .
It may be written a certain may ; maybe some politics enter into it .
"  Roman said he managed to secure two more years of public health funds in the early 2000s when he sat in front of a state legislative budget committee and screamed into the microphone , " RATS BATS AND CATS .
That 's what local public health is all about .
"  " There 's a lot more to it than animal bites , rabies control , etc .
, but it sure was a good catchphrase for them .
They renewed the funding , " Roman said .
Al Santos is mayor of Kearny , a Hudson County town that had seen 20 residents test positive for coronavirus and two people die as of Friday .
Hudson County 's total was 974 as of Sunday .
Santos said local health departments are n't set up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the kinds of spending cuts that towns like Kearny made after the last recession .
Kearny 's Health Department budget accounts for 1 .
of the town 's total spending .
" In light of this crisis , it 's obvious that staffing will need to be augmented and facilities at the Health Department improved , " he said .
" It 's a lot of work for these folks .
When the fog settles and we 're out of this , we 'll have to have a game plan for how to move forward .
