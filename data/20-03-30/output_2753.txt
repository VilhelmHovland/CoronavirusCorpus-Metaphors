When it fully makes a landfall in Nigeria , the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) pandemic ( COVID-19 ) will discover a country already at the mercy of pandemic-level hunger and chronic violence .
The combination of virus , violence and hunger should ordinarily be a complex emergency .
With President Muhammadu Buhari now evidently enfeebled , the virus arrives in a season of leadership vacuum , converting a severe public health challenge into a crisis of sustaining social cohesion and political stability .
Public health and political power in Nigeria have always had a mutually dissonant relationship .
When Brigadier-General Sani Abacha informed the world on December 31 , 1983 of the decision by Major-General Muhammadu Buhari to sack the elected civilian administration of Shehu Shagari , he offered an unusual reason : " Health services are in shambles as our hospitals are reduced to mere consulting clinics without drugs , water and equipment .
Our educational system is deteriorating at an alarming rate .
" Nearly 37 years later , the landfall of COVID-19 in Nigeria presents Muhammadu Buhari with an opportunity to advertise his achievements .
The score-card is doleful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany to treat radiculopathy .
His successor , Sani Abacha , died mysteriously in office , his remains quickly buried without an autopsy .
The predecessor of the man whom Buhari sacked in 1983 , Olusegun Obasanjo , who returned as civilian president in 1999 , tragically lost his First Lady in 2005 reportedly on a plastic surgeon 's operating table in Spain .
Obasanjo 's successor , Umaru Yar'Adua , spent most of his term in office shuttling between hospitals in foreign lands .
As elected president , Buhari has spent nearly as much time with doctors in foreign hospitals as he has in Nigeria .
All this while , lesser Nigerian mortals have had to make do without the health system he promised in 1983 .
As the virus arrives , it will find a country with no pretty options , with no capability for diagnosis , treatment or data-led preparation , little interest in informed modelling and a leadership vacuum like no other .
Let us begin with the diagnostic challenge .
Nigeria can not test its way out of the COVID-19 crisis .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lagos , one in Osun , one in Edo and another in Abuja .
There is no test centre in any of the 19 states of Northern Nigeria or in the five states of South-East Nigeria .
It is not surprising that the positive cases revealed so far closely track sites of testing .
Of 97 positive results , 72 or 74 .
per cent so far are in South-West Nigeria , which hosts three of the five test centres , with 59 or 60 .
per cent in Lagos alone ( which has two test centres ) .
Abuja , the Federal Capital reports another 16 positive results or 16 .
per cent .
The nearby states of Bauchi , Benue and Kaduna altogether report another four positives .
From the rest of the country , there are three confirmed cases altogether from Edo and Rivers States in the South-South , and two , both from Enugu in the South-East .
The five test centres are presently operating at capacity and there is no money to ramp up testing .
The country has fewer than 30,000 test kits .
Importing test kits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and in a market now dominated by duds .
The result is that many who need to be tested can not get this done presently .
Therefore , data deficits hamper planning .
The daily updates from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) can hardly be regarded as a credible measure of the spread of the virus in Nigeria .
As the virus beats its path to Nigeria , President Buhari has been somnolent .
An alert president would have called a halt to the overreach of the governors .
Presidential spokesman , Femi Adesina , claims this reflects the fact that it 's not the man 's style to speak to Nigerians .
It is difficult to dignify this piece of hubristic nonsense from a man who claims to have once been the president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors .
The more likely explanation is that President Buhari is enfeebled by more natural causes and increasingly lacks the cognitive bandwidth to provide the leadership this crisis requires .
The president 's chief of staff , Abba Kyari , the regime 's Svengali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Patient 31 , spreading the virus with the unusual generosity of a man who saw himself as too powerful for the rules of infection control .
The treatment and management options are not good .
In 2018 , Nigeria 's federal ministers of Labour and Health respectively encouraged the country 's doctors to emigrate or go into tailoring and farming .
Today , when they are needed , the country does n't know how many medical professionals it has .
In total , meanwhile , Nigeria has only about 350 intensive care units ( ICUs ) .
There is no hope in hell of being able to make up for a fraction of any shortfall , in anticipation of this crisis .
With no credible diagnostic or treatment option , the response of the country has been characterised by panic .
It began with the governor of Rivers State in the Atlantic littoral announcing that he had " closed " all inter-state , as well as maritime borders into the State .
His example was immediately followed by many governors , including those of Abia , Delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta States , the governors announced that they were taking over the airports located in their territories so they could shut them .
Inter-state borders in Nigeria 's system are federal , as are airports , maritime boundaries and the human assets required to police or secure all these .
State governors have no powers over them .
It is misguided for governors , anyway , to respond to a pandemic in such silos .
The fact that this is happening is evidence of the biggest problem that Nigeria confronts in this crisis -- leadership vacuum .
As the virus beats its path to Nigeria , President Buhari has been somnolent .
An alert president would have called a halt to the overreach of the governors .
Presidential spokesman , Femi Adesina , claims this reflects the fact that it 's not the man 's style to speak to Nigerians .
It is difficult to dignify this piece of hubristic nonsense from a man who claims to have once been the president of the Nigerian Guild of Editors .
The more likely explanation is that President Buhari is enfeebled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide the leadership this crisis requires .
The president 's chief of staff , Abba Kyari , the regime 's Svengali , has himself become Nigeria 's equivalent of South Korea 's Patient 31 , spreading the virus with the unusual generosity of a man who saw himself as too powerful for the rules of infection control .
A Presidential Task Force headed by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation ( SGF ) has been compromised by exposure to Mr .
Kyari , unable to work in a government not configured for remote business .
Put forward by the politicians as their institutional shield , the NCDC is caught in a brutal political turf-battle and must play safe by focusing on its limited role , even as it struggles for modest elbow-room to function .
COVID-19 is more than a complex emergency for Nigeria .
It could be disaster on a hitherto unknown scale .
In a country in which citizens do n't have access to many social safety nets , edicts of social distancing and lockdowns have limited shelf-life .
Hunger will force citizens to defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coercive enforcement could lead down the path of social unrest , which the country can ill-afford in a time of enfeebled national leadership .
Lagos State , by all measures the epicentre in the country , shows that leadership can make a difference to outcomes in the contest with this virus .
But state level leadership and the professionalism of the NCDC can only be optimised if there is political leadership by the federal government .
This will not come from a committee of appointees under the SGF .
With President Buhari unable to provide it at this time , Vice President Yemi Osinbajo must step out of the shadows and complement the waning authority of the president with his considerable cognitive bandwidth .
Capable leadership will make it possible to catalyse regional action by the states , and mobilise civic , business and faith communities in a manner that will prepare to minimise damage after the virus makes its landfall .
In the abscence of that , the toll of the virus in Nigeria could be crippling .
