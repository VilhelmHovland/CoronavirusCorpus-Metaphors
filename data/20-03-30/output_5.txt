Sajith never prescribed drug , only brought it to attention of relevant individuals-Harin  While claiming that former Opposition Leader in Parliament Sajith Premadasa ' never prescribed the drug for the Coronavirus as he only brought it to the attention of the relevant individuals ' , former Parliamentarian Harin Fernando vehemently rejected the propaganda carried out by distorting the statements of Mr .
Premadasa .
" It is regrettable that even amidst this catastrophic situation we are facing as a country , certain parties are talking questionable actions towards their lofty political objectives .
We vehemently reject the propaganda carried out by distorting the statements of the Former Leader of the Opposition Mr .
Sajith Premadasa , who has spoken on behalf of the interests of the people , Mr .
Fernando , who is also the head of the national campaign Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB ) .
It should also be noted that of the government acts in defiance of the opposition , it is a challenge to the populist rule .
It is no secret that the SJB Leader Sajith Premadasa was one of the pioneering people 's representatives within the Parliament who raised concerns pertaining to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention .
However , the statement he made on behalf of the people are being distorted within social media platforms in a repulsive manner .
The most recent incident is reported to have been attributed to a statement he made concerning several medications that are used to suppress the Coronavirus .
His efforts to bring the government 's focus on world-wide treatment options for the Coronavirus , is to serve as a responsible political leader , since the parliament is not obtainable for a public representatives to speak .
Full statement  Comments - 22  Upa Tuesday , 24 March 2020 06:33 AM  Funny thing is , his attempt to equate himself with he specialists of the totally unknown field to him , father aso like like that  Nihal Amarasekera Tuesday , 24 March 2020 06:34 AM  Sad , take either way  Missaka Tuesday , 24 March 2020 06:53 AM  Haa .
haa ! ! ! Stupid message by Sajith .
He has shown that again he is not a suitable candidate for the country leadership .
If he has any message to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper protocols without putting messages on FB !  Jay Jay Tuesday , 24 March 2020 06:56 AM  What bull .
If Sajith wanted to inform authorities , a public announcement is not the way to go at a time like this .
As he is a politician , he has access to the decision makers .
way more than the average citizen .
All he is trying to do is discredit the government .
He will better serve the people of Sri Lanka if he sends messages if encouragement rather than trying to discredit the government at every turn .
Do remember HF and SP , you were part of a government that let the Easter attack happen even after being warned over and over again .
Chandima Nanayakkara Tuesday , 24 March 2020 07:06 AM  Dear Mr .
Harin Tell that to Sajith P .
Please ask him to refrain from making statements before getting approval from others like you , so that blunders of this nature can be avoided in future .
As for blunders , all your people should keep your mouths shut ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martial , a former commander of the army found FB sourcers more reliable than official communication .
So was Rajitha , who had spoken to " a few parents " .
Rajitha put his foot in his mouth earlier too .
King Tuesday , 24 March 2020 07:18 AM  Sajith and all other opposition members should keep their big mouths shut .
Particularly Sajith who makes some stupid statements Every statement they make is being distorted in favour of the Govt who will stop at nothing to win the election .
Devinda Uduwara Tuesday , 24 March 2020 07:56 AM  Sajith did suggestions , proposals and requestions on Covid-19 in good intention Harin , " Dogs bark .
goes on .
" At the initial stage of its pandemic Govt was lethargic .
It shows from the world statistics .
As per their daily report as at date our infected cases per million of people is 5 .
as against 0 .
of India .
the difference , please .
Sajith is doing the correct thing all countries president or the PM is heading the fight against corona virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposition take leaders of other countries for example  Jaliya Pathirana Tuesday , 24 March 2020 12:26 PM  There is no one hiding and there is no need to .
The current situation is well under control unlike deaths in other so called first world countries .
We know Sajith is wanting stars but we will see where he is heading with elections .
So he is trying the limelight .
Citizen Silva Tuesday , 24 March 2020 09:11 AM  Dogs bark but the SJB caravan should move on .
forward .
Anuja Premawardhena Tuesday , 24 March 2020 11:24 AM  What Nonsense ! He specifically did a Trump ! ! Please fact check .
I think he has very poor support from the medical community , or announces facts with impunity without fact checking .
Thank god we do not have him as our leader at this juncture ! Anu  JeffK Tuesday , 24 March 2020 11:27 AM  Looks like followers are dumber than the leader .
Do they think that authorities do n't know about these drugs ?  Yeti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of an inferior mentality so trying hard to show off as a genius .
He will talk to a doctor , ask about some medicine and then talk 30 minutes about that medicine .
Do n't take this seriously , while idling at home without meeting supporters , he might wanted to show his literacy in pharmacology , problem is there may be people who take seriously  Neo Tuesday , 24 March 2020 11:37 AM  It 's Beyond me what the SJB fellows sees in Sajith .
Nishan Tuesday , 24 March 2020 11:54 AM  Harin , Best if you advise Simple Sajith to stop giving statements , over all , even if his intentions are for the good of the people or for his own political agenda .
Every time he says something he tends to shoot himself and his team in the foot .
He should keep quite on important national issues as he did over all these years with much success without exposing his ignorance at this last sate of his race .
Harin , your trying to defend Sajith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
