TORONTO -- Adam Rita 's heart aches over the toll the COVID-19 pandemic is taking on Italy .
Italy , which had over 97,000 confirmed cases of the disease with more than 10,000 fatalities as of Sunday , is near and dear to Rita 's heart .
The longtime former CFL coach and GM spent two seasons there coaching the Bergamo Lions of the Italian Football League .
Rita , 72 , and his wife , Judit , are back living in Mississauga , Ont .
Fortunately , many of the friends the made in Italy are OK but Rita said a former Lions player did lose his grandfather to the pandemic .
" We became good friends with the parents of one of our players and she was trying to explain to us what was going on there , " Rita said .
" But it 's nowhere near close to the horror they 're going through .
" People are dying by the minute and if you 're over a certain age there 's nothing they can do .
It 's pretty sad where they 're at .
"  Rita said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after people he knew travelled there and spoke glowingly about the time they spent there .
And for Rita , life in Bergamo certainly did n't disappoint .
" In Italy you could live there a lifetime and just scratch the surface .
I 'm a history buff and I love that sort of stuff , " Rita said .
" Italy is such a great place .
" When you go out in the evening , people are walking and pedestrians are socializing and the music is playing .
It 's like a different world .
Being social is their big deal .
"  Rita spent the better part of three decades in the CFL as an offensive co-ordinator , head coach and GM with B .
, Toronto , Edmonton , Ottawa and Memphis .
His teams went to the Grey Cup eight times , winning six .
He also served as the head coach at the University of British Columbia in 1989 .
Rita 's last season in Canada was 2010 as the Argonauts ' GM .
His contract was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16-13 in the East semifinal before losing 48-17 to the eventual Grey Cup-champion Montreal Alouettes in the conference final .
" When I retired from the CFL ( after 2010 season ) , my goal all along was to use football to travel all around the world , " Rita said .
" I was able to kind of do that .
" I went to several countries to coach , my wife and I .
It was unbelievable .
"  In 2012 , Rita served as the head coach of the Prague Panters in the Czech Republic .
Two years later , he was off to Switzerland to be the head coach of the Calanda Broncos before landing in Italy  So years before commissioner Randy Ambrosie implemented his CFL 2 .
strategy aimed at growing football globally , Rita learned first-hand about the game 's popularity in other parts of the world .
" It 's amazing the passion people have for the game , " Rita said .
" Football provides great structure because it takes all body types and all kinds of people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a great athlete -- it helps -- but you 're an important part of the team whether you 're a starter , the backup or just do kickoffs , which is pretty important .
There 's always a spot for a player .
I think every other sport where you have less players , the more highly skilled you have to be .
"  And in Rita 's experience , the vast majority of players all want to be coached hard for a common goal -- to succeed and be better .
" Sometimes you think otherwise , " Rita said with a chuckle .
" But every case and scenario that I 've ever been in , they all want to learn .
" It 's just a matter of how you deliver the message .
"  And experience teaches a coach different ways to deliver that message so players understand it clearly .
When they do , they 're much more apt to buy in .
" It 's commitment , " Rita said .
" You can coach at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's how you handle the situation you 're in .
"  However , Rita gets so much more out of coaching than merely drawing up Xs and Os and implementing schemes for games .
" The thing I miss most about coaching or doing what I do is relationships with people , " Rita said .
" Not necessarily the game itself .
" You see a young man who comes so far and feels better about himself , whether he 's a great player or not is irrelevant .
Those are the things that are most important to me .
It does n't matter what level you coach at , it 's all the same .
